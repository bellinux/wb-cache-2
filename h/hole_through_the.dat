5|$|On October 13, 1879, a {{post office}} was {{established}} near Hebron Church to serve the adjacent community (then known as Mutton Run). In December 1884, the church roof caught fire from an adjacent flue, burning a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary's ceiling which was soon repaired. On August 11–15, 1886, Hebron Church celebrated its centennial. During the celebration, Miller read a complete history of the German churches in the region. The centennial was reportedly the first of any Lutheran congregation in the southern United States.|$|E
5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|E

After {{alternating}} failed attempts by him to seduce her and them to kill each other. she succumbs to his advances when he promises to kill her. Afterwards, he finds he cannot as he has {{fallen in love with}} her. In a state of confusion he wanders the streets and passes out {{on the side of the}} road. The next day he finds his wife at Yabuhara's club. She tries to seduce him, then fakes hysteria and tells him Yabuhara paid her to kill him and that the three men he had killed had stolen from Yabuhara's diamond smuggling operation, and the foreigner was an investigator sent by the supplier. Unmoved, Hanada kills her, gets drunk and waits for Yabuhara to return. Yabuhara arrives already dead with a bullet <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> centre of his forehead.|$|E

5|$|The {{cessation}} of diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar prompted immediate French {{military action in}} a campaign that {{became known as the}} Second Franco-Hova War. The expedition ended eleven months later in September 1895 when a French military column reached Antananarivo and bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, blasting a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> roof of the queen's quarters and inflicting heavy casualties among the numerous courtiers gathered in the palace courtyard. Rainilaiarivony sent an interpreter to carry a white flag to the French commander and entreat his clemency. Forty-five minutes later he was joined by Radilifera, the Prime Minister's son, to request the conditions of surrender; these were immediately accepted. The following day Queen Ranavalona signed a treaty accepting the French protectorate over Madagascar. She and her court were permitted to remain at the palace and administer the country according to French dictates.|$|E
25|$|A custom in Bosco/Gurin (found {{also in the}} Avers valley, Graubünden) was {{to build}} houses with a Seelabalga ("soul-beam"). This was a sliding wooden door {{covering}} a small round <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wall, which was opened to allow {{the soul of a}} deceased inhabitant to depart.|$|E
25|$|In some legends, Vijayawada was {{referred}} to as 'Rajendracholapura'. A tale behind its acquiring the name Bezawada is that Goddess Krishnaveni (River Krishna) requested Arjuna to make a passage for her to merge into the Bay of Bengal. Hence, Arjuna made a bejjam (<b>hole)</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mountains and the place {{came to be known as}} Bejjamwada which later changed to Bezawada.|$|E

50|$|A {{toroidal}} polyhedron is a polyhedron whose Euler characteristic is {{less than}} or equal to 0, or equivalently whose genus is 1 or greater. Topologically, the surfaces of such polyhedra are torus surfaces having one or more <b>holes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> middle.|$|R
25|$|In {{preparation}} to this, it eats a circular <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> shell in February and closes it {{again with a}} silken plug. This is to enable the jawless adult moth {{to escape from the}} seed. After completion of the exit hole it spins a cocoon within the seed, with a passageway leading to the door. During the following pupal stage the larva will not move any more.|$|E
25|$|The epoxy/core test, detects voids by {{visual and}} {{mechanical}} methods. It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> pavement into the sub-base with a dry-bit roto-hammer. Next, a two-part epoxy is {{poured into the}} hole – dyed for visual clarity. Once the epoxy hardens, technicians drill through the hole. If a void is present, the epoxy will stick to the core and provide physical evidence.|$|E
25|$|The spindle, carved {{to reduce}} {{friction}} {{at one end}} and maximize it at the other, is held in a hole {{in the bottom of the}} bearing block, and at the other by the base board (which also is known variously as the hearth, hearth board, or fireboard). The string of the bow is wrapped once around it, so that it is tight enough not to slip during operation. A variation on this is called the Egyptian Bow Drill. It attaches the string by wrapping it around multiple times, or actually tying it to the drill or through a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> drill shaft, then wrapping it.|$|E
50|$|Dedicated {{ice-maker}} machines {{can be used}} {{to produce}} ice cubes for laboratories and academic use. Ice cubes are also produced commercially and sold in bulk; these ice cubes, despite their name, are often cylindrical, and may have <b>holes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> center.|$|R

25|$|TEPCO {{estimates}} the nuclear fuel {{was exposed to}} the air less than five hours after the earthquake struck. Fuel rods melted away rapidly as the temperature inside the core reached 2,800°C within six hours. In less than 16hours, the reactor core melted and dropped {{to the bottom of}} the pressure vessel, burning a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> vessel. By that time, water was pumped into the reactor in an effort to prevent the worst-case scenario – overheating fuel melting its way through the containment and discharging large amounts of radionuclides in the environment. In June the Japanese government confirmed that Unit 1 reactor vessel containment was breached, and pumped cooling water continues to leak months after the disaster.|$|E
25|$|The 51st Battalion {{attempted}} another {{takeover of}} the fort on October 21–22. After an artillery and aircraft barrage at 18:00, the Givati forces made their assault, employing a rigged armored vehicle which was meant to blow a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fort's walls. It got trapped between the barbed wire fences, but its explosion destroyed them and allowed the infantry to advanced onto the fort itself. Four soldiers managed to infiltrate it, but were overwhelmed by Egyptian fire and withdrew. The final battle of the corridor in Operation Yoav also came {{on the night of}} October 21–22, when Givati's 53rd Battalion made an attempts at the Egyptian Burma Road, failing to take any positions and retreating.|$|E
25|$|A pump drill is {{a simple}} tool used to make holes in light {{materials}} by hand {{and has been in}} use for centuries. The drill itself is composed of: the drill shaft, a narrow board with a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> center, a weight (usually a heavy disc) acting as a flywheel, and a length of cord. The weight is attached {{near the bottom of the}} shaft and the hole board is slipped over the top. The cordage is run through a hole near the top of the shaft and affixed to either end of the hole board so that it hangs just above the weight. The end of the shaft usually has a square hole made to fit certain sized auger bits or a simple triangular bit made to cut while rotating in both directions.|$|E
50|$|The Venezuelan hammock, as modified, {{eventually}} {{became known as}} a jungle hammock. Simply by wetting the hammock suspension ropes with insecticides or insect repellent, the jungle hammock even gave protection against crawling insects with mandibles that could bite <b>holes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> insect netting.|$|R
50|$|Steel {{remains the}} most {{commonly}} used slotted angle material, although aluminium alternatives are also available. The product is generally manufactured from sheet metal using machine presses to form the angle and to punch <b>holes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> metal. The strips are normally produced in a variety of standard lengths, and steel versions are often painted or galvanised to protect them from rust.|$|R
50|$|Soviet combat groups {{started to}} move {{from house to house}} instead of {{directly}} down the streets. They moved <b>through</b> <b>the</b> apartments and cellars blasting <b>holes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> walls of adjacent buildings (for which the Soviets found abandoned German panzerfausts were very effective), while others fought across the roof tops and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> attics.|$|R
25|$|By far {{the most}} common object was a stone star with a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> middle. They were found {{everywhere}} between Ibarra and Riobamba. The majority have six rays (and none have more), proceeding symmetrically from the center, and the whole are fashioned alike upon each side. A certain number have only five rays, and occasional examples are irregular in shape. All are pierced by a hole, which has been drilled from the two sides, {{and the size of}} this varies considerably. In dimensions they range from three to five inches in diameter and from three-quarters of an inch to two inches in thickness. Their weight is from five to twenty ounces. The larger part are made from basaltic rock and gabbro. Objects of this class were also cast in metal but these are now rarely found in Ecuador.|$|E
25|$|The Mint {{could not}} find a {{suitable}} metal which was sufficiently different in colour to the existing coins and which would not tarnish. This last point was thought to be important because the new coin would be the most valuable coin in general circulation in the world (about £8.40 in today's values). It therefore had to be a different shape; various methods had been used overseas to overcome this problem but none were without drawbacks. A <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> coin did unacceptable things to the Queen's head (which is a legal requirement on British coins), and wavy-edged, flat-edged or square coins could not be used in the coin-handling machinery which was then coming into increasing use in industry, banking and vending. To be used in a vending or sorting machine a coin would have to roll under gravity and be capable of being measured without being presented in a special way, in other words it needed a constant breadth at whichever angle it was measured.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May 1989, Hungary started {{dismantling}} its {{barbed wire}} border with Austria, opening a large <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Iron Curtain to the West {{that was used}} by {{a growing number of}} East Germans. By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East Germans had escaped to the West before the GDR denied travel to Hungary, leaving the CSSR (Czechoslovakia) as the only neighboring state where East Germans could escape to. Thousands of East Germans tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the Prague Embassy and the Hungarian Embassy where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to the CSSR on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of East Germans participated in the Monday demonstrations in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators; many were arrested and beaten. However, the people refused to be intimidated. On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.|$|E
50|$|A post-war {{update with}} twin {{fishtail}} exhaust pipes exiting <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> in <b>the</b> rear facing armoured plate. Cowls were no-longer required. Early type B Comets had armoured covers over <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>through</b> which <b>the</b> fishtail exhaust pipes would protrude, retaining the older Model A setup.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} other muricids, Ecphora sea snails bored <b>holes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hard shells of other mollusks, usually bivalves, or {{sometimes}} other snails, including other, smaller Ecphoras, {{in order to}} feed on their soft insides using a toothed, ribbonlike appendage (common to almost all gastropods) known as a radula.|$|R
60|$|The {{remaining}} four {{made good}} their retreat into the cabin, {{where they found}} Mr. Lewis, still alive, though mortally wounded. Barricading the cabin door, they broke <b>holes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> companion-way, and, with the muskets and ammunition which were at hand, opened a brisk fire that soon cleared the deck.|$|R
500|$|Dielectric {{resonators}} are {{pieces of}} dielectric material {{inserted into the}} waveguide. [...] They are usually cylindrical since these {{can be made with}}out machining but other shapes have been used. [...] They can be made with a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> centre which is used to secure them to the waveguide. [...] There is no field at the centre when the TE011 circular mode is used so the hole has no adverse effect. [...] The resonators can be mounted coaxial to the waveguide, but usually they are mounted transversally across the width as shown in figure 8. [...] The latter arrangement allows the resonators to be tuned by inserting a screw through the wall of the waveguide into the centre hole of the resonator.|$|E
500|$|West's {{performance}} on the song is notably intense, forcefully rapping lines such as [...] "we above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all / I got dogs that'll chew a fucking <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wall." [...] Swizz Beatz sets {{the tone of the}} song using several ad-libs such as [...] "one hand in the air, if you don't really care" [...] and the line [...] "this shit is fucking ridiculous" [...] which is repeated several times throughout the song, delivered by nearly every rapper. The second verse is delivered by Jay-Z, who spends the majority of his verse deconstructing the hate that surrounds fame and poses the question, [...] "would you rather be underpaid or overrated?" [...] Jay-Z comments on how a career in the music industry creates many opponents. The third verse is delivered by Pusha T, who muses on cocaine dealing.|$|E
500|$|Hopsin {{spoke on}} [...] "Hip Hop Sinister" [...] saying, [...] "That's {{probably}} the most intense rap song on the album. It's not a song that's going to slowly change anybody's life. It's just a rap song just have bars and sound dope. The energy on that, you'll probably hear it and want to cut somebody's throat. The song just amps you up so much. It's so hyped to {{where you want to}} punch a hole in somebody's head or punch a <b>hole</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wall." [...] "Good Guys Get Left Behind" [...] is a love song, that features multiple twists and turns. [...] "Old Friend" [...] is based around a friend of his that became addicted to methamphetamine and the personal issues which he suffered from it. Hopsin has said the meaning of the song was [...] "to show what early wrong decisions can do to youngsters in the long run", as well as [...] "what they can possibly miss out on." ...|$|E
