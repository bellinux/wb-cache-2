I know you hate to lose a minute of this fun; I understand just {{how you feel about}} it, and I don't want you to stand upon ceremony with me. Treat me just like one of yourselves, gents. This beech- wood is the regular Nova Scotia thing, ain't it? Tough and knotty! I can't bear any of your cheap wood-lot stuff <b>from</b> <b>around</b> <b>here.</b> What I want is Nova Scotia wood, every time. Then I feel that I'm gettin' the worth of my money." [...] His log dropped apart on each side of his horse, and he put on another. [...] "Well, mates," [...] he rattled on, [...] "this is lovely, ain't it? I wouldn't give up my little quarter of a cord of green Nova Scotia before breakfast for anything; I've got into the way of it, and I can't live without it." ...|$|E

King grew up believing what she later {{confirmed}} to him: that his biological father was a light-skinned black man.

5000|$|In December 2013 it was {{announced}} that Bernard had purchased non-league Durham City and become owner and chairman of the club. On buying the club, Bernard stated [...] "I want to make Durham one of the best feeder clubs in the north east. At the moment, I don't think the area develops enough youngsters. I want to raise the profile of the club and get links with Sunderland, Newcastle and Middlesbrough.

5000|$|Saying {{that she}} did not believe that he {{understood}} her, he remarked that he could not until he had listened to all the TV programs. Dori remarked that he was not <b>from</b> <b>around</b> <b>here</b> to which he said [...] "No. I'm from another Planet". Still shocked after thinking he was dead, the Stranger wondered why Dori thought he was dead because he had not began to decomposed. Dori stated that his injuries where fatal to humans. The Stranger explained that his kind regenerate their major organs and die only after they suffer massive damage to their brain. When the Stranger inquired as to humans, Dori jokingly said, [...] "No. We just go to work for the Department of Motor Vehicles". Baffled by the joke because his kind do not joke nor understand them, Dori tricks the Stranger and escapes only to be caught at her car with her behind the steering wheel. Attempting to flee, she threaten to run him over. The Stranger stops her by putting his foot on her car's bumper as she tries running him down.|$|E
5000|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{is based on}} the assumption that reducing or diverting the amount of attention paid to material being encoded and stored will reduce the quality and quantity of the later retrieval of that material in a form that is explicit and reportable. So, if a well learned skill is stored as a procedural memory, and its retrieval and subsequent performance is mostly unconscious and automatic, there is evidence showing that the explicit recollection of what happened during the performance will be reduced. A recent example illustrates this concept nicely. Immediately following Sidney Crosby's overtime goal against the USA, winning the 2010 Olympic Gold Medal for Canada in men's ice hockey, a reporter with TSN did an on-ice interview with Crosby: [...] "Sid, if you can, just take us through how that goal went in" [...] Crosby replied: [...] "I don't really remember, I just shot it - I think <b>from</b> <b>around</b> <b>here.</b> That's all I really remember. I think it went 5-hole, but, um, I didn't really see it to be honest".|$|E

5000|$|Inside {{a mobile}} home in a rural community, a mother is tuning the radio and {{beginning}} her daily chores while her son, Danny, finishes his breakfast. He runs {{to the door and}} says he's in a hurry {{to go down to the}} creek or Possum Meadows. His mother, just like every good mom, tells him to be careful. Danny soon makes his way to the creek, playing with his toy boat and running along the water. He notices the boat goes down the creek into this odd-looking fog. Meanwhile, a man in a grey outfit walks over and attempts to touch a deer, but it runs off. Then he notices Danny. They exchange greetings and the man says his name is Scout. He questions Danny what his toy boat is and what a tadpole is, as if the man had no idea what these things were. Danny and Scout begin walking together and discussing things like the weather and what the area is called. Danny asks him if he's <b>from</b> <b>around</b> <b>here,</b> but Scout says no, but he likes it. Soon, Danny says he has to leave and Scout says goodbye. Danny's mom is furious with him for being so trusting to a strange man and she wants him to stay away from the strange man. Danny says he can't because he invited Scout to dinner. Meanwhile, Scout is outside and he starts studying birds and fish. He even manages to stop the deer, but then points his hand at the deer and it glows and disappears.|$|E

5000|$|An early {{mention of}} the Hanseatics at Avaldsnes is in a letter by Norwegian king Haakon VI <b>from</b> <b>around</b> 1370. <b>Here</b> he writes about the Hanseatics which [...] "at peacetime raided and burned the king's farms at Avaldsnes and others by the Karmsund, his forests near Selbjørn, the houses for poor {{travelers}} between Karmsund and Bergen, and also farms and houses at the Karmsund {{that belonged to the}} kings subjects". The Hanseatics has here apparently destroyed everything the king owns near the coast from Bergen to perhaps the Swedish border. The reasons for this attack by the Hansa was that the king had tried to limit the Hanseatics trade in Norway.|$|R

40|$|Conservation {{practitioners}} are increasingly turning to incentive-based approaches to encourage local resource users to change behaviors that impact biodiversity and natural habitat. We assess {{the design and}} performance of marine conservation interventions with varying types of incentives through an analysis of case studies <b>from</b> <b>around</b> the world. <b>Here</b> we focus on seven examples that are particularly relevant to designing incentives for sea turtle conservation. Four of the cases are focused on sea turtle conservation, and the others contain elements that may be applied to turtle projects. Many more opportunities exist for interventions that combine the strengths of these approaches, such as performance-based agreements that provide funds for education or alternative livelihood development, and leasing fishing rights to reduce bycatch...|$|R
5000|$|Del Campo {{was born}} in Lima and left his native Peru at a young age. [...] Nothing is known with {{certainty}} about his early studies in Peru. He studied at Madrid's Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando) in Madrid <b>from</b> <b>around</b> 1865. <b>Here</b> he established a friendship with Lorenzo Valles, a history painter.Del Campo subsequently travelled to Italy and painted in Naples, Capri, Rome, Assisi and Venice. During a visit to France he studied new artistic developments in Paris. From 1880, he exhibited works at the annual Salon van de Société des Artistes Français. In 1880 he established himself in Venice.Here there already was a seizable community of emigré artists, such as Antonietta Brandeis, and the Spanish painters Martín Rico y Ortega, Mariano Fortuny and Rafael Senet. [...] He became good friends with Martín Rico. The two artists worked sometimes together painting the Venetian scenes that were popular with {{the increasing number of}} visitors to that city. [...] They responded thus to the large international market for their city views of Venice. Demand for del Campo's views was so strong, that he painted several views multiple times.|$|R

Marble is exclusively mined, processed and exported <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>around</b> the world.
