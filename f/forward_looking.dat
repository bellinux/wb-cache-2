5|$|The {{sensors to}} be {{developed}} under Shed Light were broken into three categories, Low Light Level TV (LLLTV), <b>Forward</b> <b>Looking</b> Infrared (FLIR), and <b>Forward</b> <b>Looking</b> Radar (FLR).|$|E
5|$|Autonetics (A {{division}} of North American Aviation) R-132 <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> radar (FLR) to locate targets for closer inspection via Low Light Level TV (LLLTV) and <b>Forward</b> <b>Looking</b> Infrared (FLIR), and featured a Moving Target Indicator (MTI) and automatic tracking capability.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the AW101 {{are equipped with}} self-defence systems, such as chaff and flare dispensers, directed infrared countermeasures (infrared jammers), ESM (electronic support measures {{in the form of}} RF heads), and a laser detection and warning system. British Merlins have been outfitted with protective armour against small-arms fire. A chin-mounted <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> infrared (FLIR) imaging sensor has been fitted to some variants.|$|E

5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe. The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E
5|$|To improve {{operations}} at low altitude, the AN/ASQ-151 Electro-Optical Viewing System (EVS), {{which consisted of}} a Low Light Level Television (LLLTV) and a <b>Forward</b> <b>looking</b> infrared (FLIR) system mounted in blisters under the noses of B-52Gs and Hs between 1972 and 1976. The navigational capabilities of the B-52 were later augmented {{with the addition of}} GPS in the 1980s. The IBM AP-101, also used on the Rockwell B-1 Lancer bomber and the Space Shuttle, was the B-52's main computer.|$|E
5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for night vision goggles, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{concurrent}} mapping and localization (CML) using <b>forward</b> <b>look</b> sonar data. Results are presented from processing of an oceanic data set from an 87 kHz US Navy <b>forward</b> <b>look</b> imaging sonar using the stochastic mapping method for CML. The goal is to detect objects on the seabed, map their locations, and concurrently compute an improved trajectory for the vehicle. The resulting trajectory is compared with position estimates computed with an inertial navigation system and Doppler velocity sonar. The results demonstrate the potential of concurrent mapping and localization algorithms to satisfy the navigation requirements of undersea vehicles equipped with <b>forward</b> <b>look</b> sonar. ...|$|R

5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy <b>forward,</b> <b>looking</b> somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|Being {{designed}} for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification {{to perform in}} medium level operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s. The RAF's GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a <b>Forward</b> <b>looking</b> infrared, a wide-angle HUD (Head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (Night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global Positioning System receiver. The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the Brimstone anti-tank missile, Paveway III laser-guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997, on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF's GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot). This project would see RAF GR4/4A improved in two phases, starting with {{the integration of the}} Paveway IV bomb and a communications upgrade, followed by a new tactical datalink in Phase B.|$|E

5000|$|Forward Look: Virgil Exner's radical <b>Forward</b> <b>Look</b> {{redesign}} of Chrysler's vehicles for the 1955 model year was emphasized by {{the adoption of}} a logo by the same name, applied to all Chrysler Corporation vehicles. The <b>Forward</b> <b>Look</b> logo consisted of two overlapped boomerang shapes, suggesting space age rocket-propelled motion. This logo was incorporated into Dodge advertising, decorative trim, ignition and door key heads, and accessories through September 1962.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the F-111F {{began to be}} {{equipped}} with the AVQ-26 Pave Tack <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> infrared (FLIR) and laser designator system, which provided for the delivery of precision laser-guided munitions and was mounted in the internal weapons bay. The Pacer Strike avionics update program replaced analog equipment with new digital equipment and multi-function displays. The last USAF F-111s were withdrawn from service in 1996, replaced by the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle.|$|E
25|$|The F-111C and F-111F were {{equipped}} {{to carry the}} AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tack targeting system on a rotating carriage that kept the pod protected within the weapons bay when not in use. Pave Tack featured a <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> infrared (FLIR) sensor, optical camera and laser rangefinder/designator. The Pave Tack pod allowed the F-111 to designate targets and drop laser-guided bombs on them. Australian RF-111Cs carried a pallet of sensors and cameras for aerial reconnaissance use.|$|E
25|$|In {{many areas}} of the moors and their {{associated}} dales the settlements took the form of isolated farms and hamlets rather than villages. Very few had an open field system of agriculture so Enclosure Acts were rarer than in other parts of England. The seventeenth century saw a major acceleration in the reclaiming of marginal waste land and in the eighteenth century <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> landlords attempted to improve their lands using drainage schemes and fertilisation measures.|$|E
