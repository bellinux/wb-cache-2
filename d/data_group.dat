500|$|Sharper upper {{limits on}} {{the speed of light}} have been {{obtained}} in experiments designed to detect effects caused by the galactic vector potential. Although the galactic vector potential is very large because the galactic magnetic field exists on very great length scales, only the magnetic field would be observable if the photon is massless. In the case that the photon has mass, the mass term [...] would affect the galactic plasma. The fact that no such effects are seen implies an upper bound on the photon mass of m < [...] The galactic vector potential can also be probed directly by measuring the torque exerted on a magnetized ring.

40|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{provides a}} promising solution to accelerate complicated spatial data processing, which has recently become increasingly computationally intense. Partitioning a big dataset into workload-balanced child <b>data</b> <b>groups</b> remains a challenge, particularly for unevenly distributed spatial data. This study proposed an algorithm {{based on the}} k-d tree method to tackle this challenge. The algorithm constructed trees based on the distribution variance of spatial data. The number of final sub-trees, unlike the conventional k-d tree method, {{is not always a}} power of two. Furthermore, the number of nodes on the left and right sub-trees is always no more than one to ensure a balanced workload. Experiments show that our algorithm is able to partition big datasets efficiently and evenly into equally sized child <b>data</b> <b>groups.</b> Speed-up ratios show that parallel interpolation can save up to 70 % of the execution time of the consequential interpolation. A high efficiency of parallel computing was achieved when the datasets were divided into an optimal number of child <b>data</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
