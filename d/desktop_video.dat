25|$|<b>Desktop</b> <b>video</b> {{magnifiers}} are {{electronic devices}} that use {{a camera and}} a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials. They enlarge printed pages for those with low vision. A camera connects to a monitor that displays real-time images, and the user can control settings such as magnification, focus, contrast, underlining, highlighting, and other screen preferences. They {{come in a variety}} of sizes and styles; some are small and portable with handheld cameras, while others are much larger and mounted on a fixed stand.|$|E

50|$|<b>Desktop</b> <b>video</b> {{refers to}} a {{phenomenon}} lasting from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s when the graphics capabilities of personal computers such as Commodore's Amiga, the Apple Macintosh II and specially-upgraded IBM PC compatibles had advanced {{to the point where}} individuals and local broadcasters could use them for analog non-linear editing (NLE) and vision mixing in video production. Despite the use of computers, <b>desktop</b> <b>video</b> {{should not be confused with}} digital video since the video data remained analog. Full-screen, full-motion video's vast storage requirements meant that the promise of digital encoding would not be realized on desktop computers for at least another decade.|$|E

40|$|A basic {{requirement}} in any successful {{application of a}} web-based system, such as Internet-based control systems, is the provision of efficient real-time processing and data transfer over the Internet. In {{a significant number of}} real-world environments, real-time web-based systems involve the transfer and exchange of large amounts of numerical data over the Internet. The heterogeneity and limited traffic resources of the Internet considerably complicate the transfer of such bulky data; for example, if a number of clients simultaneously try to connect with the same server or multiple data sources are accessed over the Internet via different platforms. Such situations require that a data transfer format has to be acceptable to heterogeneous platforms. Additionally, large amounts of data, such as graphics, <b>desktop</b> <b>videos,</b> and images uploaded to the Internet (which may sometimes consist of gigabytes of data), are increasingly being accessed, while, at the same time, the bandwidth available for communication is limited because of the increasing popularity of the Internet.

40|$|Face {{tracking}} [...] -the {{continuous monitoring}} of head position, orientation, and geometry [...] -has numerous practical applications for human-computer interaction, {{such as a}} perceptual form of multi-modal input. There are several non-invasive and computationally inexpensive techniques for face tracking that draw upon algorithms from computer vision. Of them, Bradski's CAMSHIFT algorithm is appealing because it requires minimal training. These techniques are particularly attractive {{in light of the}} growing installed base of fast desktop computers and cheap, low-end <b>desktop</b> digital <b>video</b> cameras. Low-end cameras, however, have characteristics that make them a poor fit for some such face tracking algorithms. In this paper, I introduce the problem of face tracking, provide an overview of the operation of CAMSHIFT {{as an example of a}} non-invasive vision-based face tracking algorithms, and describe my experiences attempting to employ video obtained from a low-end <b>desktop</b> digital <b>video</b> camera source in face tracking.

40|$|The big {{interest}} in <b>desktop</b> audio and <b>video</b> conferencing {{has led to}} a broad usage of multimedia tools in wide and local area networks. Many of these tools are based upon the IP multicast protocols. The general advantages of multicast services, like the efficient utilization of network resources and thus the possibility to reach arbitrary large numbers of receivers have by now rendered performance considerations of multicast protocols obsolete. Yet, the rapid growth of multicast usage, especially in the IP Internet, may lead to severe congestion problems, if performance trade-offs are not considered carefully in protocol design. In this paper we present performance investigations of the IP multicast architecture with special emphasis on routing protocols. Performance results derived from measurements and simulations will be discussed. Based upon these results, protocol improvements are suggested and evaluated. I.
