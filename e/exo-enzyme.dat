40|$|Two {{different}} kinetic methods (<b>exo-enzyme</b> kinetic (I) and polarographic o-phenylene-diamine (II) methods) for {{the determination}} of number-average molecular weight (Mn) of amylose have been developed. I. A theory has been presented which describes {{the time course of}} exo-enzyme-catalyz-ed hydrolysis of linear high polymer substrates accompanied by a competitive inhibition by products. The theory predicts that there is a linear relationship between t/p and p, where p is the concentration of product at time t, and that the slope s of the plot of t/p versus p is proportional to the Mn of the polymer substrate when a given amount of substrate is taken. Based on the proportionality between s and Mn, a kinetic method was proposed to determine Mn of linear polymer substrate by using an <b>exo-enzyme</b> hydrolyzing the polymer. The theory was applied to the hydrolytic reactions of various fractions of amylose of different degrees of polymerization catalyzed by crystalline <b>exo-enzyme</b> glucoamyla. se of Rhizopus delemar. A good agreement was obtained between the Mn values determined by the present kinetic method and those determined by osmotic pressure and reducing end— group measurements...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Only 30 - 50 yo of the cell-bound {{penicillinase}} of Bacillus cereus NRRL 569 is neutralized by antiserum prepared {{against the}} exo-penicillinase. The un-neutralizable fraction is not decreased by cell disintegration which liberates a pro-portion of the cell-bound enzyme into solution. Absence of neutralization cannot therefore {{be explained by}} the existence of a mechanical barrier which prevents access of antibody; it has in fact been shown to be due to the presence of another type of penicillinase, not liberated from the cells, which is enzymically similar to, but immunologically and physico-chemically distinct from, the <b>exo-enzyme.</b> This cell-bound penicillinase has been separated from the <b>exo-enzyme</b> by fractional precipita-tion with ammonium sulphate. It is inducible by penicillin, like the <b>exo-enzyme,</b> and is present in cells of the constitutive mutant strain, 569 /H. The penicillinase of Bacillus cereus strain 569, like that of other strains of this species, is mainly exocellular.

40|$|Healthy plant roots {{release a}} wide range of {{chemicals}} into soils. This process, termed root exudation, is thought to increase the activity of microbes and the exo-enzymes they synthesize, leading to accelerated rates of carbon (C) mineralization and nutrient cycling in rhizosphere soils relative to bulk soils. The causal role of exudation, however, is difficult to isolate with in-situ observations, given the complex nature of the rhizosphere environment. We investigated the potential effects of root exudation on microbial and <b>exo-enzyme</b> activity using a theoretical model of decomposition and a field experiment, with a specific focus on the stoichiometric constraint of nitrogen (N) availability. The field experiment isolated the effect of exudation by pumping solutions of exudate mimics through microlysimeter "root simulators" into intact forest soils over two 50 -day periods. Using a combined model-experiment approach, we tested two hypotheses: (1) exudation alone is sufficient to stimulate microbial and <b>exo-enzyme</b> activity in rhizosphere soils, and (2) microbial response to C-exudates (carbohydrates and organic acids) is constrained by N-limitation. Experimental delivery of exudate mimics containing C and N significantly increased microbial respiration, microbial biomass, and the activity of exo-enzymes that decompose labile components of soil organic matter (SOM, e. g., cellulose, amino sugars), while decreasing the activity of exo-enzymes that degrade recalcitrant SOM (e. g., polyphenols, lignin). However, delivery of C-only exudates had no effect on microbial biomass or overall <b>exo-enzyme</b> activity, and only increased microbial respiration. The theoretical decomposition model produced complementary results; the modeled microbial response to C-only exudates was constrained by limited N supply to support the synthesis of N-rich microbial biomass and exo-enzymes, while exuding C and N together elicited an increase in modeled microbial biomass, <b>exo-enzyme</b> activity, and decomposition. Thus, hypothesis (2) was supported, while hypothesis (1) was only supported when C and N compounds were exuded together. This study supports a cause-and-effect relationship between root exudation and enhanced microbial activity, and suggests that exudate stoichiometry is an important and underappreciated driver of microbial activity in rhizosphere soils...|$|E

Degradation was demonstrated by {{analysis of the}} reaction products. By use of the appropriate intermediate products as substrates, in conjunction with specific enzyme inhibitors, it was shown that the degradation proceeded sequentially from the non-reducing end. It was initiated by sulphatase (preferentially hydrolysing sulphate ester groups at the 6 -position), followed by beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and beta-glucuronidase, converting the substrate into monosaccharides and inorganic sulphate. The latter enzyme preferentially attacked disaccharides carrying their sulphate ester group at C- 4 of the hexosamine residue.

40|$|In the ocean, organic {{particles}} harbour diverse bacterial communities, which collectively digest and recycle essential nutrients. Traits like motility and <b>exo-enzyme</b> production allow individual taxa {{to colonize}} and exploit particle resources, {{but it remains}} unclear how community dynamics emerge from these individual traits. Here we track the taxon and trait dynamics of bacteria attached to model marine particles and demonstrate that particle-attached communities undergo rapid, reproducible successions driven by ecological interactions. Motile, particle-degrading taxa are selected for during early successional stages. However, this selective pressure is later relaxed when secondary consumers invade, which are unable to use the particle resource but, instead, rely on carbon from primary degraders. This creates a trophic chain that shifts community metabolism away from the particle substrate. These results suggest that primary successions may shape particle-attached bacterial communities in the ocean and that rapid community-wide metabolic shifts could limit rates of marine particle degradation.

40|$|The {{storage of}} corn {{seeds in the}} fresh state is very difficult. This reason is presumably ascribable to the unstability of {{hemicellulose}} constructing the cell membrane. The hemicellulose was composed of xylose, arabinose mainly, and smaller amounts of galacturonic acid, glucose and galactose. The mean molecular weight was about 730, 000 by a gelfiltration method. The yield of the hemicellulose from corn seeds amounts to about 1. 5 %. It is hydrolyzed by an <b>exo-enzyme</b> of one strain of bacteria isolated from corn seed. The mode of the hydrolysis is that of an endo type. This bacterium is a native one, namely, utilizes preferably the hemicellulose as only carbon source for the growth. At 15 ℃ it can grow with difficulty in stab and plate culture, but at 5 ℃ it can not grow at all. This bacterium is quite resistant to heat treatment, since even after heating at 120 ℃ for 20 min., {{a significant number of}} bacteria appeared in the sterilized medium.

40|$|Heparan sulfate (HS) {{catabolism}} {{begins with}} endo-degradation of the polysaccharide to smaller HS oligosaccharides, {{followed by the}} sequential action of exo-enzymes to reduce these oligosaccharides to monosaccharides and inorganic sulfate. In mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA) the <b>exo-enzyme,</b> N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase, is deficient resulting in an inability to hydrolyze non-reducing end glucosamine N-sulfate esters. Consequently, partially degraded HS oligosaccharides with non-reducing end glucosamine sulfate esters accumulate. We investigated the distribution of these HS oligosaccharides in tissues of a mouse model of MPS IIIA using high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Oligosaccharide levels were compared to total uronic acid (UA), which {{was used as a}} measure of total glycosaminoglycan. Ten oligosaccharides, ranging in size from di- to hexasaccharides, were present in all the tissues examined including brain, spleen, lung, heart, liver, kidney and urine. However, the relative levels varied up to 10 -fold, suggesting different levels of HS turnover and storage. The relationship between the di- and tetrasaccharides and total UA was tissue specific with spleen and kidney showing a different disaccharide:total UA ratio than the other tissues. The hexasaccharides showed a stronger correlation with total UA in all tissue types suggesting that hexasaccharides may more accurately reflect the storage burden in these tissues...|$|E

Whether {{this is a}} mechanism to self-limit accelerated inflammation is currently unknown [14]. However, when monocytes are stimulated with GM-CSF alone, they become reprogrammed to anti-inflammatory monocytes that are capable to downregulate intestinal inflammation in a mouse model in vivo via induction of Tregs [15]. Other than with the GCsM, GM-CSF-activated monocytes (GMaM) induced Foxp 3 + Tregs de novo from naive T cells utilizing extracellular ATP for degradation into adenosine. <b>Exo-enzymes</b> CD 39 and CD 73 are upregulated and used by GMaM to generate adenosine that directly differentiates naive T cells into Tregs. Furthermore, also GMaM upregulate the IL- 1 decoy receptor CD 121 b [16].

40|$|Amylose {{prepared}} from starch dispersed in 10 M-urea, pH 6. 2, {{was found}} to be resistant to the action of beta-amylase and phosphorylase, though it was degraded by alpha-amylase. Amylose isolated by conventional methods was similarly refractory after urea treatment, and was hydrolysed by beta-amylase to the extent of 32 - 35 %; it had no inhibitory effect towards beta-amylase. The physical and chemical properties of the modified amylose were in general comparable with those of normal amylose with a beta-amylolysis limit of 94 - 98 %. Starch and amylopectin were unaffected by urea treatment, i. e. the presence of amylopectin protected amylose against changes induced in it by urea. It is speculated that urea treatment "freezes" amylose molecules in a conformation that renders non-reducing termini inaccessible to the active site of the <b>exo-enzymes.</b> Such changes may limit the degradative action of beta-amylase and phosphorylase...|$|R

Previous studies had shown that these materials could be degraded. These studies were done uniquely in compost or by axenic compost isolates, and under thermophilic conditions, but {{it is likely that}} most of this material will be found in sites at more moderate conditions. Thus, a screening procedure was developed to assess the biodegradability of the co-polyester at ambient environmental conditions.

40|$|Cell walls {{prepared}} {{from the}} endosperm tissue of hydrated lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds undergo autohydrolysis. Release of carbohydrates is most rapid (0. 4 - 0. 6 [mu]g per endosperm) within the 1 st h of incubation in buffer, but substantial autolysis is sustained {{for at least}} 10 h. Autolysis is temperature sensitive, and the optimum rate occurs at pH 5. The rate of autolysis increases markedly in the period just prior to radicle emergence. The cell-wall polysaccharide composition in micropylar and lateral endosperm regions differs significantly; the micropylar walls are rich in arabinose and glucose with substantially lower amounts of mannose. Although walls prepared from both micropylar and lateral regions undergo autolysis, micropylar walls release carbohydrates {{at a higher rate}} than lateral walls. Autolysis products elute as large polymers when subjected to size-exclusion chromatography, suggesting that endo-enzyme activity is responsible for release of fragments containing arabinose, galactose, mannose, and uronic acids. Arabinose, galactose, mannose, and glucose are also released as monomers. As a function of time, the ratio of polymers to monomers decreases, indicating that <b>exo-enzyme</b> activity is also present. Thermoinhibition or treatment with abscisic acid suppresses germination and reduces the rates of autolysis of walls isolated from the endosperm by about 25 %.

Treatments included two different types of cereal grains (wheat, and barley) with or without an enzyme supplementation along with a corn-based diet as control group. The experimental diets were formulated to have similar contents of crude protein, metabolizable energy, total non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and were fed in two periods of starter and grower. Experimental traits were consisted growth performance, ileal flora numeration, villus morphology in 3 parts of the intestine, digesta viscosity and pancreatic enzyme activity, and determining the gene expression level of glucose transporter (SGLT 1) and mucin producer (MUC 2) in the jejunum. Results indicated that inclusion of wheat and barley to corn-soy based diet with or without <b>exo-enzymes</b> blend on growth performance traits were significant (p< 0. 01). Feed intake and average daily gain in wheat diet was lower, conversely FCR was higher than other groups (p< 0. 01). Maximum microbial count were observed in wheat and barley diets and minimum were observed in enzyme supplemented diets respectively (p< 0. 01). Control group and enzyme supplemented diets had minimum counting of gram negative, coliform and clostridium, but maximum counting of lactobacilli and bifidobacter were observed in enzyme supplemented diets (p< 0. 01). Viscosity and activities of pancreatic a-amylase and lipase were significantly increased in chicks fed wheat and barley when compared to the control group fed on corn (p< 0. 01). Feeding wheat and barley diets reduced villus height {{in different parts of the}} small intestine when compared to those fed on a corn diet (p< 0. 01).

For a {{bacteria}} to be considered probiotic it must be capable of surviving passage through the gastrointestinal tract. It must then colonize the host digestive system, either by adhering to the mucous membrane surface or the intestinal epithelia.

In a full factorial design, fen peat and bog peat were sampled from sites in use for nature conservation and for dairy farming, which contrast in history of drainage and fertilisation. In these four peat types, which frequently occur in the Netherlands, the microbial activity and respiration dynamics were studied in samples from superficial oxic peat layers by measuring Substrate Induced Respiration (SIR) and Substrate Induced Growth Response (SIGR). Total and active microbial biomass, microbial growth potential and potential <b>exo-enzyme</b> activities were determined in unamended samples and after nitrogen and/or glucose amendments. Remarkably, peat origin and land use did not affect basal respiration rates. In contrast, land use affected microbial biomass and potential growth rates as they were quadrupled in dairy meadows compared to nature reserves. This may be attributable to the pulses of organic and inorganic fertiliser that are being supplied in agricultural peatlands. Potential activities of oxidative exo-enzymes (phenol oxidase, POX, and phenol peroxidase, POD), in contrast, depended more on peat type, indicating a difference in peat substrate quality. Basal respiration rates and enzyme activities were not related. Phosphorus enrichment {{was identified as a}} potential driver of increased peat decomposition. The activity of the oxidative enzyme phenol oxidase and the concentration of phenolic compounds, which are considered to be the main regulators of peat decomposition according to the enzymic latch theory, were not related to respiration rates.

Engineered S-layers carrying functional inserts at high density also show potential in nanotechnology. However, there is currently no complete structure at atomic resolution available for any S-layer protein. This work is engaged in the (i) structural elucidation of the SbsB S-layer protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus by determining the surface location of individual residues. A cross-linking screen was used to analyse 23 cysteine residues, known to be surface accessible in the monomer, {{with respect to their}} position within the assembled S-layer. The study was able to distinguish between eight residues that are positioned close to the subunit-subunit interface and 10 residues located at the cell-wall facing inner surface. The assay also confirmed the previous assignment of four residues to the outer ambient-exposed surface. The tolerance of the individual sites to insertion of a short peptide sequence was investigated to (ii) create chimeric S-layer proteins for nanobiotechnological applications and (iii) advance the structural elucidation of SbsB. Insertion mutagenesis at nine of the surface sites led to mutants of conserved tertiary structure, of which six were assembly-positive. The six proteins provide model constructs for the incorporation of functional tags into S-layer arrays for nanobiotechnology application as high-density vaccine carriers. The mutagenesis screen also revealed three mutants of conserved tertiary structure but of assembly-negative phenotype.

The results suggested that C. albicans was the most frequent species observed, being more prevalent in patients presenting DS, isolated or in association with other yeasts, with high expression of proteinase. A Estomatite Protética (EP) é freqüentemente observada em pacientes portadores de prótese total, sendo a presença de fungos considerada um importante fator para o seu aparecimento. Baseado neste fato, avaliamos pacientes edêntulos com e sem estomatite protética, identificando os fungos presentes, e os níveis de proteinase e fosfolipase produzidos por Candida albicans. Os resultados mostraram que C. albicans foi a espécie mais freqüente, prevalecendo em pacientes com EP. Todas as cepas de C. albicans isoladas foram fortemente positivas para proteinase, diferentemente da atividade de fosfolipase...|$|R
40|$|Endophytic fungi and ecto{{mycorrhizal}} fungi co-exist in the mycorrhizal root tips of {{boreal forest}} trees. However, {{very little is}} known about the functional role they play in their host's biology. The activity of enzymes responsible for important biochemical processes is used to determine the functional role of root-associated mycorrhizal fungi. However, enzyme activity is never studied in the presence of endophytic fungi in-planta. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) root-isolated fungal endophytes on the host plant root morphology, to determine their functional effects using host root-excreted enzyme activity measurements, and to compare them with roots colonized by decomposer and ectomycorrhizal fungal strains and noncolonised Scots pine root tips. Our results show that endophytic fungi did not damage the pine roots in contrast to the decomposer fungi. The endophytic fungi penetrated the cortical cells of the host plant. The roots colonised by endophytic fungi produce different <b>exo-enzymes</b> compared with those produced by roots colonized by other fungal groups or noncolonized control root tips. Our results indicate that endophytic fungi are clearly a distinctive ecological group of fungi that have functional traits different from those of ectomycorrhizal and decomposer fungi...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is {{widespread}} in the environment {{and can be used}} by animal and plants as a communication molecule. Pseudomonas species, in particular fluorescent ones, synthesize GABA and express GABA-binding proteins. In this study, we investigated the effects of GABA on the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While exposure to GABA (10 µM) did not modify either the growth kinetics or the motility of the bacterium, its cytotoxicity and virulence were strongly increased. The Caenorhabditis elegans 'fast killing test' model revealed that GABA acts essentially through an increase in diffusible toxin(s). GABA also modulates the biofilm formation activity and adhesion properties of PAO 1. GABA has no effect on cell surface polarity, biosurfactant secretion or on the lipopolysaccharide structure. The production of several <b>exo-enzymes,</b> pyoverdin and exotoxin A is not modified by GABA but we observed an increase in cyanogenesis which, by itself, could explain the effect of GABA on P. aeruginosa virulence. This mechanism appears to be regulated by quorum sensing. A proteomic analysis revealed that the effect of GABA on cyanogenesis is correlated with a reduction of oxygen accessibility and an over-expression of oxygen-scavenging proteins. GABA also promotes specific changes in the expression of thermostable and unstable elongation factors Tuf/Ts involved in the interaction of the bacterium with the host proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that GABA is a physiological regulator of P. aeruginosa virulence...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose: The {{carbon sink}} {{function}} of peatlands is primarily {{driven by a}} higher production than decomposition of the litter Sphagnum mosses. The observed increase of vascular plants in peatlands could alter the decomposition rate and the carbon (C) cycle through a litter mixing effect, which is still poorly studied. Here, we examine the litter mixing effect of a peat moss (Sphagnum fallax) and two vascular plants (Pinus uncinata and Eriophorum vaginatum) {{in the field and}} laboratory-based experiment. Materials and methods: During the laboratory incubation, mass loss, CO 2 production, and dissolved organic carbon concentration were periodically monitored during 51 days. The collected data were then processed in a C dynamics model. The calculated enzymatic activity was correlated to the measured β-glucosidase activity in the litter. In the field experiment, mass loss and CO 2 production from litter bags were annually measured for 3 years. Results and discussion: Both laboratory and field experiments clearly show that the litter mixture, i. e., Sphagnum-Pinus-Eriophorum, had a synergistic effect on decomposition by enhancing the mass loss. Such enhanced mass loss increased the water extractable C and CO 2 production in the litter mixture during the laboratory experiment. The synergistic effect was mainly controlled by the Sphagnum-Eriophorum mixture that significantly enhanced both mass loss and CO 2 production. Although the β-glucosidase activity is often considered as a major driver of decomposition, mixing the litters did not cause any increase of the activity of this <b>exo-enzyme</b> in the laboratory experiment suggesting that other enzymes can {{play an important role in}} the observed effect. Conclusions: Mixing litters of graminoid and Sphagnum species led to a synergistic effect on litter decomposition. In a context of vegetation dynamics in response to environmental change, such a mixing effect could alter the C dynamics at a larger scale. Identifying the key mechanisms responsible for the synergistic effect on litter decomposition, with a specific focus on the enzymatic activities, is crucial to better predict the capacity of peatlands to act as C sinks...|$|E
40|$|Serratia marcescens is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{involved in}} predominantly nosocomial infections, however, {{it is also}} implicated as a common cause of microbial keratitis. Since many S. marcecens strains are also resistant to multiple antibiotics, this organism represents a growing public health problem. S. marcescens MG 1 utilises a regulatory system for regulation of swarming motility and <b>exo-enzyme</b> secretion that relies on {{the production of a}} diffusible signal identified as N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C 4 -HSL). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the role of C 4 -HSL in surface colonisation (adhesion and biofilm formation). In this thesis, the development of a novel biofilm in S. marcescens MG 1 is described. The biofilm comprises of an intricate and complex structure consisting of long filamentous cells, cell aggregates and cell chains. Two C 4 -HSL controlled genes (bsmA and bsmB) are shown to be crucial for biofilm formation. It is proposed that C 4 -HSL regulated bsmA and bsmB gene products are engaged in fine tuning aggregation at a specific time point in late biofilm development. Since adhesion is the first stage of colonisation, the role of C 4 -HSL in adhesion to a hydrophilic abiotic surface (HAS) and a human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell line was assessed. While adhesion to the HAS was found to be C 4 -HSL controlled, this was not the case for adhesion to the HCE cells. In adhesion to the HAS, mutations in the following C 4 -HSL regulated genes resulted in reduced adhesion; a sensor kinase gene (rssA), a type I transporter gene (lipB), bsmA and bsmB. These four genes were found to effect the expression of type I fimbriae which is proposed to be the adhesin affecting C 4 -HSL regulated adhesion. While C 4 -HSL is not involved in adhesion to the HCE cell line, the genes bsmA and bsmB are important. It is proposed that bsmA and bsmB dependent HCE adhesion is due to the requirement of these genes for type I fimbriae production. Furthermore, C 4 -HSL was found to regulate capsule polysaccharide and OmpX production and repress cytotoxic activity against HCE cells and erythrocytes. It is proposed that cytotoxicity is mediated by ShlA haemolysin...|$|E
40|$|During {{the month}} of December 1992, an {{expedition}} was undertaken to collect anaerobic sediment samples from alkaline lakes of the East African Rift Valley to Kenya. During this expedition, eleven samples were collected from the four non-saline, northern lakes (Lake Bogoria, Lake Nakuru, Lake Elmenteita and Lake Sonachi). A further five samples {{were obtained from the}} hypersaline Lake Magadi. Utilising an array of media, the isolation of alkaliphilic, obligate anaerobes, representing one of the major undescribed constituents of the trophic network, was attempted.;Extensive investigations into the sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) community of the sediment samples failed to provide pure culture isolates. However, successful enrichments utilising a range of substrates were obtained. Ethanol as a substrate resulted in the greatest number of positive enrichments, with representatives from each of the northern lakes visited. These are the first indications that ethanol may be used to enrich for alkaliphilic SRB. Lactate also performed well as a growth substrate, whilst acetate, butyrate, formate and fumarate also resulted in one or more positive enrichments. Contrary to previous findings, these data reveal the presence of alkaliphilic SRB capable of utilising a range of substrates. Although positive enrichments under hypersaline conditions were initially obtained using lactate, these cultures could not be maintained.;Using the substrates betaine, trehalose, starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, xylan and guar gum (galactomannan), a number of other organisms were isolated. Despite being enriched under anaerobic conditions, all the isolates were found to be facultatively anaerobic although <b>exo-enzyme</b> production appeared to take place only under anaerobic conditions.;Six alkaliphilic, obligate anaerobes were isolated from samples taken from two of the northern lakes (Lake Elmenteita and Lake Bogoria) using a complex medium with glucose. Phenotypic and taxonomic data indicated the presence of five species belonging to the Clostridium spectrum, although they were found to be phylogenetically distinct from previously described isolates. Each organism showed optimal growth at alkaline pH, and tolerated only low concentrations of NaCl (ca. 8 % w/v).;Enrichment of three Lake Magadi samples resulted in the isolation of three haloalkaliphilic obligate anaerobes. These organisms had an obligate requirement for high NaCl concentrations (> 16 % w/v), and showed a limited pH range for growth in the alkaline region (> pH 9. 5). Phylogenetic analysis of 6 S rDNA revealed these isolates also clustered within the Clostridium region of the low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, although they were also unrelated to any of the previously described species. Taxonomic proposals for a new genus and several new species are presented...|$|E
40|$|ISTO = present addressInternational audienceCation {{availability}} in peat {{may limit}} CH 4 production and microbial activity and thereby impact on rates {{of organic matter}} accumulation and the chemical character of the peat. We quantify total, soluble, and exchangeable cation concentrations, Exchange Site Saturation Levels (ESSLs) and organic fractions in bog-peat profiles and compare these with fen peat. Total and soluble cation concentrations are not correlated and these and exchangeable cation concentrations are lower in bog than fen peat. In all sites these vary with depth and the distribution patterns of individual cations are unique. This is explained by variation in ESSL, which is negatively correlated with Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). Total cation concentrations in bog peat are higher in {{the top and bottom}} fractions than in the middle. Soluble concentrations in surface bog peat are low, because cations are trapped due to low ESSL. This does not occur in fen peat, with lower CEC and higher ESSL. CEC is related to total organic matter content, not just to Sphagnum, which has been invoked as the explanatory variable of high CEC in peat bogs. There is a complexity in the mechanisms controlling cation availability in peat and we suggest that total, soluble and exchangeable cation fractions need {{to be taken into account}} in studies of cation limitation of microbial activity in organic soils. CEC may also chelate <b>exo-enzymes,</b> further inhibiting decay processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} the catalytic core of the family 6 cellobiohydrolase II, Cel 6 A (CBH II), from Humicola insolens has been determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1. 92 A. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the homologous Trichoderma reesei CBH II as a search model. The H. insolens enzyme displays {{a high degree of}} structural similarity with its T. reesei equivalent. The structure features both O- (alpha-linked mannose) and N-linked glycosylation and a hexa-co-ordinate Mg 2 + ion. The active-site residues are located within the enclosed tunnel that is typical for cellobiohydrolase enzymes and which may permit a processive hydrolysis of the cellulose substrate. The close structural similarity between the two enzymes implies that kinetics and chain-end specificity experiments performed on the H. insolens enzyme are likely to be applicable to the homologous T. reesei enzyme. These cast doubt on the description of cellobiohydrolases as <b>exo-enzymes</b> since they demonstrated that Cel 6 A (CBH II) shows no requirement for non-reducing chain-ends, as had been presumed. There is no crystallographic evidence in the present structure to support a mechanism involving loop opening, yet preliminary modelling experiments suggest that the active-site tunnel of Cel 6 A (CBH II) is too narrow to permit entry of a fluorescenyl-derivatized substrate, known to be a viable substrate for this enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{polymers}} often pose {{environmental hazards}} due to low biodegradation rates and resulting accumulation. In this study, {{a selection of}} wood-rotting fungi representing different lignocellulose decay types was screened for oxidative biodegradation of the polymer polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). Brown-rot basidiomycetes showed PSS depolymerisation of up to 50 % reduction in number-average molecular mass (Mn) within 20 days. In-depth investigations with the most efficient depolymeriser, a Gloeophyllum trabeum strain, pointed at extracellular hydroquinone-driven Fenton chemistry responsible for depolymerisation. Detection of hydroxyl radicals present in the culture supernatants showed good compliance with depolymerisation over {{the time course of}} PSS degradation. 2, 5 -Dimethoxy- 1, 4 -hydroquinone (2, 5 -DMHQ), which was detected in supernatants of active cultures via liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, was demonstrated to drive the Fenton processes in G. trabeum cultures. Up to 80 % reduction in Mn of PSS where observed when fungal cultures were additionally supplemented with 2, 5 -dimethoxy benzoquinone, the oxidized from of 2, 5 -DMHQ. Furthermore, 2, 5 -DMHQ could initiate the Fenton's reagent-mediated PSS depolymerisation in cell-free systems. In contrast, white-rot fungi were unable to cause substantial depolymerising effects despite the expression of lignin-modifying <b>exo-enzymes.</b> Detailed investigations with laccase from Trametes versicolor revealed that only in presence of certain redox mediators limited PSS depolymerisation occurred. Our results indicate that brown-rot fungi might be suitable organisms for the biodegradation of recalcitrant synthetic polymeric pollutants...|$|R
