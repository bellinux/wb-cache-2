[...] So jealous was he of every moment lost.|$|E
500|$|Tharin Gartrell {{was sentenced}} to 15 days in prison and six months in a halfway house for a charge of {{possessing}} methamphetamine on January 29, 2009.

500|$|Offenbach {{returned}} to Paris with his reputation and his bank balance both much enhanced. The last remaining obstacle to {{his marriage to}} Hérminie was the difference in their professed religions; he converted to Roman Catholicism, with the comtesse de Vaux acting as his sponsor. Isaac Offenbach's views on his son's conversion from Judaism are unknown. The wedding took place on 14 August 1844; the bride was 17 years old, and the bridegroom was 25. The marriage was lifelong, and happy, despite some extramarital dalliances on Offenbach's part.

[...] At other times, he was identified as French, Irish, and Turkish. [...] He told a friend that he was Creole, and speculated that he may have [...] "Negro blood" [...] in him, as he had [...] "kinky hair".

500|$|Tracy Hickman once ran the {{adventure}} as a Dungeon Master. According to him, {{the experience was}} like an old scary movie, with [...] "the obligatory castle high on the craggy cliff with the wolves howling in the woods. Sure enough, the vampire was {{up there in the}} castle. To most of the players it seemed like a straight forward task: find the vampire and kill him." [...] One player discovered Strahd's backstory and was so affected by it that {{when it came time to}} kill the vampire at the end of {{the adventure}}, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why. [...] "He deserved to die better than that," [...] his <b>friend</b> <b>said,</b> to which Hickman replied [...] "Yes [...] But that is how it is with people who fall from greatness. He chose his end when he first chose to kill his brother. How could it be any different?" ...|$|E

500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead <b>friend</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make." [...] He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon: ...|$|E
500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A <b>friend</b> <b>said</b> of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E
500|$|Eric Stokes died {{unexpectedly}} in 1962, {{an experience}} which left Constance bereft; a long-time <b>friend</b> <b>said</b> {{that she never}} really recovered. Faced with a substantial mortgage to service, Stokes returned to work: painting. Two years later, she opened her first one-woman show in over thirty years. It comprised 43 works, with the 27 paintings priced dearly, at upwards of 150 guineas. The exhibition was a success both financially and critically: Stokes earned over 4000 guineas, and the exhibition attracted praise from art historian and critic Bernard William Smith. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, she painted and held shows; this later phase of her work {{was based on a}} stronger, if lighter, colour palette and reflected the influence of the art of Henri Matisse, whom Stokes admired. There was also a change in her subject matter, from [...] "classically conceived" [...] still lifes, groups of figures and nudes, to more decorative themes. Stokes' works continued to be well received, having been included in the 1975 exhibition Australian women artists at the University of Melbourne, and the Regional Galleries Association of Victoria's 1977 touring exhibition The heroic years of Australian painting, 1940–1965. Stokes' last painting was Alice Tumbling Down the Rabbit Hole, painted around 1989; she died in Melbourne in 1991.|$|E

500|$|In August 2002, Baptiste {{was fined}} £500 after being {{found guilty of}} {{deliberately}} failing to attend the inquiry. Climbié's parents, speaking through a family <b>friend,</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "we, the family, expected her {{to be dealt with}} more severely". This was the first time a person had been prosecuted for not attending a public inquiry. In September 2002, Arthurworrey and Mairs were sacked following disciplinary procedures. The education secretary, Charles Clarke, also added them to the Protection of Children Act 1999 List, banning them from working with children. In October 2004, Arthurworrey appealed against her dismissal, saying that she was duped by Kouao and Manning, misled by medical reports, badly advised by her managers, and that she was a scapegoat for other people's failures, but the appeal was rejected. In 2005, she appealed the ban preventing her from working with children and won the case. In 2004, Mairs appealed her ban preventing her from working with children and won; this decision was challenged in the High Court but she prevailed. In 2004, six police officers involved in the case faced misconduct charges. All six kept their jobs, and some received reprimands and cautions. In 2004, the General Medical Council dropped misconduct charges against Dr. Schwartz.|$|E

Mrs. Puff's voice is provided by American actress Mary Jo Catlett, {{who is known for}} her live-action roles on television programs from the 1970s such as Diff'rent Strokes and M*A*S*H. As of 2017, voicing Mrs. Puff has become her only remaining regular television role; Catlett described herself as [...] "basically retired" [...] in 2013, since she feels that voicing Mrs. Puff requires less preparation than her performances in person. Lori Alan voices Pearl Krabs. During her audition for the role, Alan was shown an early drawing of the characters and took note of how Pearl was much larger {{than the rest of the}} cast. She decided to reflect the character's size in her voice by making it deep and full in tone. She aimed to make Pearl's voice invoke the sound of whales’ low vocalizations while also sounding [...] "spoiled and lovable." [...] In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, Alan said that she knew Pearl [...] "had to sound somewhat like a child," [...] but needed [...] "an abnormally large voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone.

My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my <b>friend</b> <b>said,</b> 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
