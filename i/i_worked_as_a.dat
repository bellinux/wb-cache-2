[...] Some key employees worked with Fatshark following {{the closing of}} GRIN. [...] Simon Viklund, Creative Director on the first Rearmed {{was hired as a}} Creative Advisor to the Fatshark team. [...] Of his position with Fatshark, Viklund remarked [...] "They were taking over things mid-project and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> creative advisor during the hand-over to tell them what they were looking at." [...] Viklund further stated that the original design for the game involved events beyond the existing plot. [...] "I wanted to start off there and end up in a city in the FSA where everyone can see a bionic fighting. [...] a nice way to convey that now everyone will see that bionics can't always be controlled." [...] He noted that this would be an event in which the public would notice the dangers of bionics and seek to outlaw them.|$|E

The customers raised lively rows, especially the women, and I never could hold a job long. So I began to rest my weary head upon the breast of Old Booze for comfort.

6000|$|... "I'll tell you," [...] answered. Janet. [...] "It {{is a bit}} {{of ancient}} history, but it may {{interest}} you. Your mother renounced your father when you were scarcely a year old. I met Jason Jones soon afterward, and believing,--as your own deluded mother did--that he would become a great artist, I gambled with him on his career. In other words, I supported Jason Jones with all my earnings as a nurse for a period of six years and in return he signed an agreement which states that one-half of all the money he received in the future, from whatever source, must be paid to me in return for my investment. Doubtless we both thought, at the time, that any money he got would come from the sale of his pictures; neither could have dreamed that your mother would call him to her on her death-bed and present sent him with your income until you came of age--seven years' control of a fortune, with no other obligation than to look after a child and keep her with him. But the agreement between us covered even that astonishing event. Imagine, if you can, Jason Jones' amazement when he entered your mother's sick chamber to find me--his partner--acting as her nurse. He was also annoyed, for he realized I knew the terms of the will and would demand my share of his income. Can you blame me? He hadn't made good as an artist and this was my only chance to get back some of the hard earned savings I had advanced him. But Jason Jones isn't square, Alora; he's mean and shifty, as perhaps you have discovered. He gave me some money at first, when I followed him to New York, as you know; but after that the coward ran away. That provoked me and made me determined to run him down. I traced him to Europe and followed him there, but he evaded me for a full year, until my money was gone and I was forced to return to America. For nearly three years longer <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nurse and hoarded my earnings. Then, through your father's banker in New York I managed to learn his address. The banker didn't tell me, but I did a little spy work and in the bank's mail I found a letter in Jason Jones' handwriting postmarked 'Positano, Italy.' That was all the clew I needed and I went to Italy and soon located my man. I faced him in his own villa--I believe you were away at the time--and when he found he was caught he cringed and begged for mercy and promised to give me all that belonged to me. He said {{he had a lot of}} gold in his possession and he would pay me partly in gold and partly in drafts on his New York banker. Then he left the room to get the gold and returned with a husky Italian servant who seized and bound me and threw me into a stone house used to store grapes, where I was kept a prisoner for nearly ten days and treated like a dog.|$|E
