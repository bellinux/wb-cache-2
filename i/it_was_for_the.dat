5|$|According to Richard Hoggett, the {{practice}} of being ruled {{by more than one}} individual may have been a common occurrence in East Anglia as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Kent and Northumbria. Ecgric and Sigeberht may have simultaneously ruled the peoples known as the North-folk and South-folk, who lived in the parts of their kingdom that would later become the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. However, Carver notes that Ecgric may not have reigned jointly with Sigeberht, but could just have plausibly ruled as a sub-king or served as an administrator within a region under East Anglian hegemony, only rising as king of the East Angles after Sigeberht's abdication.|$|E
5|$|In his {{strongly}} apologetic divisional {{history of}} the division which he later commanded, Otto Kumm claims that the division captured Bihać and Bosanski Petrovac, killed over 2,000 Partisans and captured nearly 400 during Case White. After a short rest and refit in April, the division was committed to Case Black in May and June 1943, during which it advanced from the Mostar area into the Italian governorate of Montenegro and killed, according to Kumm, 250 Partisans and captured over 500. The historian Thomas Casagrande notes that all German units fighting partisans routinely counted the civilians they had murdered as partisans. Therefore it can be assumed that the reported number of inflicted casualties included many civilians. The division played a decisive role during the fighting. Although Himmler had already planned to award Phleps with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross {{for his role in}} organising the 7th SS Division, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> achievements of his division during Case Black that Phleps received the award. Phleps was also portrayed in the SS-magazine Das Schwarze Korps. He received the Knight's Cross in July 1943, while he was also promoted to Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS (lieutenant general), and placed in command of the V SS Mountain Corps.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots come from an appreciation for democracy and literacy that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained power into the people and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they {{had to be able to}} read the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
5|$|The {{capital city}} was {{completely}} {{dependent on the}} water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians {{a picture of the}} prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using gravity and siphons to transport water through pipelines. The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs. In the fertile agricultural areas near the Tungabhadra River, canals were dug to guide the river water into irrigation tanks. These canals had sluices that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} {{began as}} a bimonthly, but switched to a monthly schedule in January 1940, though this only lasted six issues. June 1940 was followed by August and October 1940 and January and March 1941.

Fantastic then went on a quarterly schedule, beginning with the October 1944 issue; in October 1945 it became bimonthly again, {{though there was a}} gap between February and May 1946. From September 1947 {{to the end of the}} run the magazine was monthly. The volume numeration was regular, with a new volume starting at the beginning of each calendar year; the result was a variable number of issues in each volume, from a low of four in 1944 to a full twelve when the magazine was monthly, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last few years of its life. The last issue was volume 15 number 3.|$|E

5|$|While at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes {{had become}} {{good friends with}} Jake Seamer, who had also {{attended}} Brasenose College, and the pair were teammates for both Oxford and Somerset. Seamer had joined the Sudan Political Service (SPS) on his graduation in 1936, and while at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes also secured a role with the organisation {{that he would take}} up after his graduation. His duties with the SPS prevented him from playing for Somerset at all during 1938, but he made seven early-season appearances the following year, though two were for the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Free Foresters. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> latter of these that Mitchell-Innes made his only century of the season; playing against Oxford University, the Free Foresters required nearly 400 runs in the fourth innings to win. Mitchell-Innes opened the innings, and after the lunch interval on the final day he played attacking cricket, bringing up his century in 95 minutes. He was eventually dismissed for 143 runs, bowled as he tried to heave an on drive. The Free Foresters came within nine runs of their target, but were bowled out before they could reach it. In total, he scored 347 runs at 31.54 that year; the last season of first-class county cricket in England before it was interrupted by the Second World War.|$|E
