Although the quantity of cultivated <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> in those poor areas {{is not less than}} that of non-poor areas, the quality is lowly evaluated because of its high elevation, steep slope and earth surface roughness.

However, a complete data preprocessing technology for the regulation of <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> {{has not yet been}} formed. According to the characteristics of SPOT 6 satellite images, four different image fusion methods – Gram-Schmidt, HPF, PanSharpand PanSharpening were selected to conduct the comparison experiment by using the software platforms of ENVI, ERDAS and PCI. We evaluate the results’ performances from 3 different aspects. First, evaluating the image quality of experiment results qualitatively, then assessed quantitatively by establishing evaluation indexes including mean, standard deviation, information entropy, average gradient and correlation coefficient. Finally, evaluating the applicative effect of fused images based on the classification accuracy. The analysis results shows that the method of PanSharp is best to <b>extract</b> construction <b>land</b> information. Based on the PanSharp fusion image, in order to obtain the texture information under different scales, the authors screened the texture features according to Shannon entropy, and then used distance-based approach J-M to calculate the separation for choosing the optimal texture window.

Institutions {{are the way}} of life of landowners in undertaking agriculture <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> management. Institutional analysis views agriculture <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> management according to formal and informal rules affecting landowners’ decision making process. Formal rules are in the written forms and informal rules are the way they behave towards <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> management. In identifying institutional causes of idle agriculture <b>land</b> <b>resources,</b> the study gathers data from interviews with the selected landowners of undeveloped and developed agriculture lands in the case study areas. Data will be analysed using qualitative analysis to show the existence of formal and informal institutions affecting landowners’ decisions whether to participate or not in the agriculture <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> development initiatives. Then, data will be analysed further to categorised the sources of institutional constraints in the supply of agricultural land for development. The finding shows that there are various causes of constraints that influence landowners’ decisions to participate in the redevelopment initiatives on the lands. Amongst others, the findings show that the formal written customary land laws and landowners’ behaviour had limits the flow of land supply of agriculture <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> for the development in the case study areas. Therefore, solution to the causes of idle <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> must be identified and action taken in ensuring the idle agriculture land is available for development.

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} issue in Alpine regions is urban sprawl, which affects <b>land</b> <b>resources</b> and their environmental qualities {{as well as}} social and economic conditions. As the available area for permanent settlement is limited in Alpine regions due to natural constraints, <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> management here is even more relevant than outside the Alpine area. <b>Land</b> <b>resources</b> are being claimed for social, economic and ecological purposes, which is why efficient <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> management is a precondition for sustainable development at regional level. To implement such sustainable regional development, about 110 instruments have been collected in most Alpine countries. With a compilation of instruments for their better application, <b>land</b> <b>resource</b> management touches also on the understanding, development and perception of regions. The instruments for the implementation have been assessed in qualitative terms and lead to the conclusion that many instruments already exist, however there is a bottleneck at the point of implementation...|$|R
