40|$|Understanding how {{cycles of}} forest-defoliating insects are {{affected}} by forest destruction is of major importance for forest management. Achieving such an understanding with data alone is difficult, however, because population cycles are typically driven by species interactions that are highly nonlinear. We therefore con- structed a mathematical model to investigate the effects of forest de- struction on <b>defoliator</b> cycles, focusing on <b>defoliator</b> cycles driven by parasitoids. Our model shows that forest destruction can increase de- foliator density when parasitoids disperse much farther than defolia- tors because the benefits of reduced <b>defoliator</b> mortality due to in- creased parasitoid dispersal mortality exceed the costs of increased <b>defoliator</b> dispersal mortality. This novel result can explain observa- tions of increased outbreak duration with increasing forest fragmen- tation in forest tent caterpillar populations. Our model also shows that larger habitat patches can mitigate habitat loss, with clear impli- cations for forest management. To better understand our results, we developed an approximate model that shows that <b>defoliator</b> spatial dynamics can be predicted from the proportion of dispersing animals that land in suitable habitat. This approximate model is practically useful because its parameters can be estimated from widely available data. Our model thus suggests that forest destruction may exacerbate <b>defoliator</b> outbreaks but that management practices could mitigate such effects...|$|R

40|$|The ecology, life history, and {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} sagebrush <b>defoliator,</b> Aroga websteri Clarke, were studied {{in the field and}} laboratory. The <b>defoliator</b> has one generation a year at the Curlew Valley site. It overwintered in the egg stage and passed through five larval instars. Ten parasite species attacked the <b>defoliator</b> at the study site. Four species, Orgilus ferus, Phaeogenes sp., Spilochalcis leptis, and Apanteles cacoeciae, contributed over 75 percent of the total incidence of parasitism. Parasitism ranged from 20 to 76 percent in 1971, but only ranged from 6 to 29 percent in 1972. This decrease in total parasitism in 1972 coincided with a five-fold increase in the <b>defoliator</b> population. In 1972, many mature larvae {{died as a result of}} food shortage. A microsporidian infection and a predaceous beetle also caused variable mortality during the two years. Methods for determining defoliation to sagebrush plants were also studied in the field. The consumption and utilization of food by the fourth and fifth larval instars were determined. The fecundity, rate of development, and behavior of the insect were also investigated under laboratory conditions. Partial life tables were constructed from the findings of 1971 and 1972 to assess the r ole of various mortality factors in regulating the sagebrush <b>defoliator</b> numbers...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} survey of methods to detect pests in forest nurseries before they damage plants was done. These surveys recorded {{the most important}} forest nursery pests during 18 years (from 1980 to 1998) and their geographical and temporal distribution in the principal enterprises in Cuba. Approximately a dozen insect species and three hngi species responsible for the major problems in forest nurseries in Cuba were studied. The principal insect pests are: Anomis iNita (Guer) pep.

40|$|<b>Defoliator</b> pests often {{cause severe}} damage to commercially {{valuable}} timber trees, such as teak, grown in plantations, affecting {{the quality and}} quantity of the wood produced. Twenty-five isolates of an entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.), derived from different forest habitats were tested for their efficacy against the Teak <b>Defoliator,</b> Hyblaea puera Cram. The median lethal concentration (LC 50) for the isolates ranged from 0. 65 to 947. 41 × 105 conidia mL− 1. Four isolates, viz. MIS 2, MIS 19, MIS 7 and MIS 1, were promising, having low LC 50 values. A median lethal time (LT 50) of 3. 8 d was recorded for the isolates MIS 2 and MIS 7 when the moth larvae were exposed to a spore load of 107 conidia mL− 1. Formulations composed of “MIS 2 + MIS 7 + 0. 5 % Pongamia pinnata seed oil” and “MIS 2 + MIS 7 ” proved to be superior against the Teak <b>Defoliator,</b> causing 94. 73 % and 93. 93 % mortality, respectively. Application of the formulation “MIS 2 + MIS 7 + 0. 5 % P. pinnata oil” resulted in 63. 6 % and 56. 2 % reduction in infestation in nurseries and plantations, respectively, while the formulation “MIS 2 + MIS 7 ” recorded 56. 18 % and 51. 60 % reduction.

40|$|The cowpea bean (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) {{is often}} {{attacked}} by <b>defoliator</b> insects. There {{are a great}} number of species of these <b>defoliator</b> insects and they cause huge damage to the plants. The most important being: Diabrotica speciosa e Cerotoma arcuata (both Coleóptera), Spodoptera frugiperda, Mocis latipes e Spodoptera cosmioides (both Lepidoptera). Understanding the relationship between the plague infestation and the productivity of the culture is {{one of the keys to}} the success of the integrate management of the cowpea bean. Studying the artificial defoliation process in order to simulate similar insect damages to the plants is useful. There are few research studies about the artificial defoliation in the cowpea bean plant. So, this study was developed to determine the level of economical damage inflicted by <b>defoliator</b> insects in cowpea bean plants in the Cultivar BR- 17 Gurguéia. The experiments were conducted in the do Departamento de Fitotecnia do Centro de Ciências Agrárias da Universidade Federal do Piauí. The defoliation were in the order of 0 %; 25 %; 50 %; 75 % and 100 %. The experiment was taken 25 days and 40 days after planting the cowpea bean plants. The production loss threshold of the cowpea bean in local condition in Teresina-PI is R$ 61. 00. ha- 1, which allows, through regression analysis, the following conclusion: the level of control of <b>defoliator</b> insects during the vegetative state is about 60 % of defoliation; while in the reproductive state it is about 47 %...|$|R
