500|$|Rodney Webb, who {{represented}} England between 1967 and 1972, {{is quoted as}} saying [...] "Barry John's punting was phenomenal. He could drop the ball on a sixpence and he could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>every</b> time". Webb, who developed the modern rugby ball, believes that John can not be compared to modern kickers because [...] "the modern ball is coated in a laminate, has dimpled surfaces, unobtrusive lacing and multi panels. In the seventies the balls soaked up water, swerved all over the place and were placed in the mud and slime when kicking for goal".|$|E
500|$|Regarding her {{involvement}} in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she [...] "would definitely be part of it." [...] She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that [...] "Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody wants to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Every</b> time I see him, it's like: 'When {{is it going to}} happen? When is it going to happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E
500|$|Octavarium begins [...] "The Root of All Evil" [...] {{with the}} final note of the band's {{previous}} album, Train of Thought with [...] "In the Name of God". Train of Thought started [...] "As I Am" [...] with the last note from Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence with the title track, which in turn started with the noise that ended [...] {{at the end of}} [...] "Finally Free". Portnoy was inspired to do this thanks to the Van Halen album Women and Children First; the outro of the album's final song ended with a new riff being played which faded out. Portnoy recalled that he expected Van Halen's next album to start with that ending riff, but was disappointed when it did not. He later realized he had [...] "dug a hole where we're expected to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>every</b> time". He solved this problem on Octavarium, where the final track ends with the beginning of the first one. This made the album a cycle in itself, allowing the band to have a clean start with their next album. At 04:52–05:17, there is a lyrical and musical reference to the chorus of [...] "This Dying Soul" [...] from Train of Thought.|$|E
6000|$|Harry {{has lost}} his long curls; but he can never lose those eyes and eyelashes, and that fine, bold brow, that flushes with triumph, as he answers, [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>every</b> bit of <b>it,</b> myself, father; and nobody helped me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] {{said the}} other dryly. [...] "He <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>every</b> time, but the devil himself wouldn't squeeze ten cents out of Harry if he didn't {{want to give it}} him. But how long {{are you going to be}} {{stripping}} that fowl?" ...|$|R

500|$|Castellaneta also {{provides}} the voices for numerous other characters, including Grampa Simpson, Barney Gumble, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Hans Moleman, Sideshow Mel, Itchy, Kodos, the Squeaky Voiced Teen and Gil Gunderson. Krusty's voice {{is based on}} Chicago television's Bob Bell, who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. Barney's trademark is a loud belch. During early recording sessions for the show, he recorded {{a new version of}} the belch for every episode but discovered that it was not easy for him to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>every</b> time a script called for it. Castellaneta chose a recording of what he believed was his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard. Groundskeeper Willie's first appearance was in the season two episode [...] "Principal Charming". The character was written as an angry janitor and Castellaneta was assigned to perform the voice. He did not know what voice to use and Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, suggested he use an accent. Castellaneta first tried using a Hispanic voicing, which Simon felt was too clichéd. He then tried a [...] "big dumb Swede", which was also rejected. For his third try, he used the voice of an angry Scotsman, which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in the episode. The voice was based partially on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show Second City Television, who was portrayed by Dave Thomas. Mayor Quimby, who first appeared in [...] "Bart Gets an F", is a parody of various members of the Kennedy family. The episode script did not call for Quimby to be a parody of them, and Castellaneta improvised the accent. Sideshow Mel's voice is Castellaneta's impression of Kelsey Grammer, the voice of Sideshow Bob. Gil is a spoof of actor Jack Lemmon's portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film adaptation of the play Glengarry Glen Ross. Show runner Mike Scully thought that Gil would be [...] "a one-shot thing" [...] but [...] "Dan Castellaneta was so funny at the table read doing the character, we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in." [...] The Blue-Haired Lawyer's voice, as well as his demeanor, is based on lawyer Roy Cohn.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1940s, Jordan {{released}} {{dozens of}} hit songs, including the swinging [...] "Saturday Night Fish Fry" [...] (one {{of the earliest}} and most powerful contenders {{for the title of}} first rock and roll record), [...] "Blue Light Boogie", the comic classic [...] "Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens", [...] "Buzz Me," [...] "Ain't That Just Like a Woman (They'll <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>Every</b> Time)", and the multimillion seller [...] "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie".|$|E
2500|$|Inaugurated on June 17, 1902, by patent {{medicine}} salesman turned passenger agent George Henry Daniels, {{the train}} offered a barbershop and secretarial services. The train arrived in Chicago three minutes ahead of schedule; the schedule was twenty hours, four hours less than before. The New York Times report [...] laid great {{stress on the}} routine nature of the trip, with no special procedures being followed and no extra efforts being made to break records. It stated that there [...] "...was no excitement along the way," [...] and quoted a railroad official's claim [...] "...it is a perfectly practical run and will be continued," [...] and engineer William Gates maintaining [...] "This schedule can be made without any difficulty.

2500|$|In December 2013, Beyoncé {{explained}} {{the idea behind}} [...] "Bow Down" [...] on iTunes Radio: [...] "The reason I put out 'Bow Down' is because I woke up, I went into the studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn't the Beyoncé that wakes up every morning. It was the Beyoncé that was angry. It was the Beyoncé that {{felt the need to}} defend herself. And if the song never comes out…OK! I said it! And I listened to it after I finished, and I said, This is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. People like it, great; they don't, they don't. And I won't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>every</b> day because that's not who I am. But I feel strong. And anyone that says, 'Oh that is disrespectful,' just imagine the person that hates you. Imagine a person that doesn't believe in you. And {{look in the mirror and}} say, 'Bow down, bitch' and I guarantee you feel gangsta! So listen to the song from that point of view again if you didn't like it before." ...|$|E
