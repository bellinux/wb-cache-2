50|$|Water first {{enters the}} National Water Carrier through a several hundred meter long {{pipeline}} which is submerged under {{the northern part}} of Sea of Galilee. The water passes into a reservoir on the shore and then travels on to a pumping station. The pipeline is made up of nine pipes which are joined by an <b>internal</b> <b>cable</b> threaded through them. Each of these pipes includes twelve concrete pipes, each five meters long and three meters wide. As these pipes were cast, they were encased in steel pipes, sealed at the ends and floated out onto the lake. A winged star-shaped cap is mounted in a vertical section of the underwater pipe to allow water to be taken in from all directions.|$|E

5000|$|The Pinarello Neor {{replaced}} the FP Uno as Pinarellos base road bike model, featuring the same hydroformed aluminum frame as the FP Uno, but now boasts a carbon fibre rear triangle {{as well as}} ONDA carbon front forks. The Pinarello FPTEAM Carbon is constructed from 24HM12K uni-directional carbon fibre and features both tapered 1 [...] "1/8 1" [...] 1/4 ONDA front forks and ONDA rear triangles. The Pinarello Rahza is a full 24HM12K carbon fibre frame, featuring an asymmetrical monocoque design which improved frame rigidity. The frame also features ONDA forks and rear stays {{as well as the}} BB30 bottom bracket. The Pinarello Marvel is an entirely new asymmetry frame originating from the Pinarello Paris (constructed from Torayca 50HM1.5 carbon fibre) made from 30HM12K carbon. Rigidity of the frame is further improved by the usage of a tapered headset (1" [...] 1/8 - 1" [...] 1/2) as well as featuring <b>internal</b> <b>cable</b> routing. Pinarello say that the Marvel is [...] "top level bike and already UCI approved for use in official competitions." [...] The Marvel also makes full use of the Think2 system allowing the usage of both electronic and mechanical groupsets. Other new features include the new ONDA2V front fork and a new aerodynamic downtube.|$|E
5000|$|The Pinarello Dogma XC 9.9 {{features}} the unique-to-Pinarello divided rear triangle and {{is made from}} 60HM1K Torayca carbon fibre [...] "Nanoalloy" [...] technology. Torayca Nanoalloy technology has nano-particles embedded within the carbon fibre weave that Pinarello say explode upon impact, preventing the fiber from breaking or de-laminating. Pinarello calls the unique seat stay design [...] "ONDA XC Asymmetric Twin Arms" [...] Traditional frames have rear stays directly connected to the toptube, meaning that vibrations originating from the rear triangle are directly transferred {{all the way up}} to the handlebars. Therefore, Pinarello developed a system which divided the two main rear triangles, moving one higher than the other. These stays attach to the seat tube above the top tube, at separate points from one another, and they also serve as the seatpost clamp. This system has reduced the amount of shock felt from the rear, thus improving bike handling and stability. In order to protect the down tube from the front fork, whislt still keeping a geometrically lower down tube, Pinarello developed [...] "ForkStopper" [...] technology. The frame features <b>internal</b> <b>cable</b> routing for both Shimano and SRAM. The XC 9.9 was revealed at Granfondo La Pina in Treviso, Italy on 15 July 2012.The Pinarello Dogma XC 7.7 {{features the}} same unique-to-Pinarello divided rear triangle and is made from 60HM1K Torayca carbon fibre.The Pinarello Dogma XM 9.9 represents Pinarellos first venture back into Mountain biking since the Pinarello FV1, they claim the XM 9.9, constructed from 65HM3K carbon fibre, is as stiff as a roadbike. This claim is made through the usage of the new [...] "ONDA Curve Asymmetric" [...] rear quadrilateral, which is firm on flat ground and only works on uneven ground. Pinarello say that their system has only 5 points of flex as well as a monocoque design allow for this set of unique properties.|$|E

50|$|The Pinarello Montello FP8 was a {{time trial}} bicycle {{manufactured}} by Pinarello prior {{to the introduction of}} the Graal. It was made with aerospace grade carbon fibre composite. The 50HM3K carbon fibre creates an ultra stiff and light ride.The Pinarello Graal is a time trial frame manufactured by Pinarello. The Graal was designed using CFD techniques, maximizing the efficiency of the bicycle. The frame is available in both an electronic version and mechanical version, with the electronic version featuring an internally mounted battery.The Pinarello Bolide was released on 2 May 2013 with gains of a 15% reduction in aerodynamic drag and 5% reduction in weight over the Graal. Team Sky's 2012 Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins used the new bike at the 2013 Giro d'Italia. The Bolide has been in development for over year with both Pinarello lab technicians and Team Sky working on the bike. The Bolide uses aeroplane wing-shaped tubular sections in conjunction with a 'concave back' on the seat tube. This allows the rear wheel and frame to be closer together. In addition, the brakes are shielded behind leading small fairings and the frame utilizes integrated cabling to further minimize drag.On 21 June 2013 Pinarello released their second (in-house developed) high end time trial frame, called the Pinarello Sibilo. The Sibilo will debut at the 2013 Tour de France with Alejandro Valverde of Movistar Team. Early impressions are that the Sibilo shares some common features with the Bolide, such as; airfoil tubing, track style rear dropouts and a 'concave back'. Moreover, the Sibilo carries some aerodynamic refinements over the Bolide, for example, the front brake is further integrated into the forks and the rear brake has been moved towards the chainstays. These modifications remove the need for the brake fairings which are seen on the Bolide. The Sibilo is constructed from the same Torayca 65HM1K carbon as the Bolide, with <b>internal</b> <b>cable</b> routing for extra aerodynamic benefit. The Sibilo utilizes the stiff BB86 bottom bracket and can also accommodate both mechanical groupsets such as the Shimano Dura-Ace and Campagnolo Super Record sets, as well as their electronic variants (Dura-Ace Di2 and Campagnolo EPS).The Pinarello Xirion is designed specifically for triathletes by utilizing favorable frame geometry and is made from 24HM Unidirectional carbon fibre. The Xirion is sold as a complete bicycle fitted with Vision cycling components.In light of Bradley Wiggins' hour record attempt, Pinarello collaborated with Jaguar to produce the Bolide HR. The HR variant has aero-optimised front forks, seat stays and dropouts. The bike also features printed titanium bars. In 2015, the endurance part of the Italian national cycling team received Bolide HR bikes. At the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, Filippo Ganna rode his Bolide HR to victory in the Individual Pursuit.|$|E
5000|$|The Pinarello Dogma K {{features}} Pinarellos 'Century Ride' {{geometry and}} uses frame design that provides increased comfort without compromising the overall performance. As with other modern Pinarellos, the frame incorporates an asymmetric design which offsets the asymmetric forces created during the pedalling. The Dogma K and the Dogma frame differ {{from each other}} in the angle of the seat tube, brought back to increase shock absorption, and reduced head tube angle as well as slightly longer chain stays to increase comfort. Furthermore, a longer wheelbase makes for a frame that is less rigid vertically, improving shock absorption. The Pinarello ROKH is a frame that was made in an effort to offer the excellent performance of the DOGMA K to a wider group of cyclists. The ROKH's geometry is similar in shape and construction but with an even longer wheel base to add even more vertical compliance than the Dogma K. The Dogma K Hydro mirrors the new model variation seen with the Dogma 65.1, whereby hydraulic disc brakes have now been added. The Hydro features new ONDA HD (Hydraulic Disc) forks, as well as new chainstays accommodating the RAD braking system seen on both the DOGMA XC and Dogma 65.1 Hydro.The 2013 generation of the Dogma bicycle is the Dogma 65.1 Think2. When compared to the Dogma2, the Think2 features stronger and more rigid carbon fibre, 65HM1K, yielding a more reactive frame. Moreover, the Think2 has been built with the new electronic shifting group sets in mind, and thus has <b>internal</b> <b>cable</b> routing for both Shimano and Campagnolo systems. The 2014 Dogma 65.1 Hydro variant of the Dogma is virtually the same as the 2013 Think2 model, made from Torayca 65Ton HM 1K carbon fibre with [...] "Nanoalloy technology". The Hydro however, accommodates hydraulic disc brakes and features a new front fork developed from the previous ONDA2 fork, called the ONDA HD (Hydraulic Disk). The frame also features new chainstays which accommodate the new RAD braking system, derived from the development of the Dogma XC. Chris Froome rode the Dogma 65.1 Think2 to victory in the 2013 Tour de France.In May 2014 the Pinarello Dogma F8 was revealed as part of Pinarellos 2015 product launch, with the name deriving from this particular Dogma model being the 8th generation. The new bike was developed in conjunction with Team Sky sponsor and car manufacturer Jaguar and takes design cues (such as the front fork shape) from the Bolide time trial bike. Research advancements have led to claimed aerodynamic gains, with the F8 being 26.1% more aerodynamic than the Dogma 65.1, 6.4% more aerodynamic when including the bike rider and the frameset alone being 40% more aerodynamically efficient than the predecssor. The bike is expected to debut at the 2014 Critérium du Dauphiné.|$|E
