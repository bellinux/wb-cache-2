2500|$|Davis {{criticized the}} food {{industry}} of helping promote bad eating habits with misleading advertising. [...] "It's just propaganda," [...] she said, [...] "that the American diet {{is the best in}} the world. Commercial people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> us those lies for years." [...] In a television interview she said that a [...] "great deal of sickness is caused by refined foods." [...] She states that [...] "We are literally at the mercy of the unethical refined food industry, who take all the vitamins and minerals out of food." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Ship in the Bottle" [...] was {{the only}} {{completed}} track left off the record. [...] "That was the super-pop song of the record," [...] said Beck in 2002 interview. [...] "I {{think it was a}} little too corny. I mean, it was heartfelt, but since then people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> me they really liked it. I think we felt that the album was so long already. I don't know what the fate of that will be." [...] "Ship in the Bottle" [...] was released on the Japanese version of Sea Change and later remasters.|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{suggested}} that, {{though a}} pope from Latin America was unlikely, with only 19 of 117 cardinal-electors being from Latin America, the region seeks more say in Vatican affairs {{as it has}} the world's largest Catholic population. It cited secularism {{and the rise of}} Evangelicalism in Latin America, along with sex abuse scandals in Mexico, Brazil, and Chile as issues important to the region. BBC News said that while the balloting was likely to be hard-fought between different factions for a European or a non-European, an Italian or a non-Italian future pope, the internal differences were unclear, and that many different priorities were at play, making this election difficult to predict. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor remarked laughingly to a BBC presenter that his colleagues <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> him [...] "Siamo confusi– 'we’re confused,'" [...] as there were neither clear blocs nor a front-runner.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what is the}} matter, Robert?" [...] cried Laura, {{with the}} swift {{perception}} of womanhood. [...] "You are flushed, and your eyes are shining, and really you look quite handsome. Raffles <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> you something! What was it? Oh, I know! He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> you how he made his money. Hasn't he, now?" ...|$|R

2500|$|... "How is it {{possible}} for MPs to consult with their constituencies about the bills if they have not yet received them less than a week before Parliament is due to sit to discuss them? If MPs cannot consult with their electorates about the bills, how can they properly represent their views about these bills which will become laws that will affect their day-to-day lives? Such late notice and late provision of the bills demonstrates that the Government is not at all committed to the “stampa” principle of democracy and good governance, which is the representation of the people by leaders they elect to represent them. It reflects the Government’s attitude that because it has a majority in Parliament - which means its bills will automatically be passed - {{there is no need for}} the grassroots to know about these laws that it intends to pass, which will nevertheless affect their lives. This is an arrogant and undemocratic attitude which, unfortunately, has come to characterize our system of parliamentary democracy and particularly the approach of the major parties which have been in Government over the last 20 years. [...] I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> communities in Port Vila that I will consult with them about the 2009 Government budget, to get their views to present in Parliament, and I am very disappointed and angry that the Government, by their late notice, has meant that this will be very difficult, if not impossible." ...|$|E

60|$|I feel a {{good deal}} of {{hesitation}} about telling you this story of my own. You see it is not a story like the other stories that I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> you, or rather that Teddy Biffles, Mr. Coombes, and my uncle <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> you: it is a true story. It is not a story told by a person sitting round a fire on Christmas Eve, drinking whisky punch: it is a record of events that actually happened.|$|E
