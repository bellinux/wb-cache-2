25|$|The {{utility of}} this type of {{structure}} in buildings is that a large amount of the exterior envelope remains unobstructed and can be used for windows and door openings. This is preferable to a braced-frame system, which would leave some areas obstructed by the <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{house is}} a simple two-room {{structure}} with a central chimney. Its framework is composed of a dozen heavy so-called H-bents, visible on {{the interior of the}} house, that resemble goal posts with <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces.</b> This is an ancient northern European method of construction that contrasts with the boxlike house frames that evolved in England. The house had a high-pitched roof that created a large loft for storage. The roof was covered with shingles, and the exterior walls were clad with horizontal wood clapboard siding. A section of the clapboard has been removed at one corner to expose a reconstruction of the brick nogging used as insulation. The interior walls were stuccoed between the upright supports of the H-bents.|$|E

25|$|The {{critical}} architectural innovation {{designed for}} this purpose consisted of a wooden skeleton called the gaiola pombalina (Pombal Cage), a flexible rectangular frame with <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> enabling structures to withstand the overload and stress of an earthquake without coming apart. This wooden frame was erected atop walls with barrel vault arches on a masonry foundation, giving solidity and weight {{to the first floor}} of the buildings, intended for occupation by shops, offices and warehouses. All new structures in the downtown area were erected on pine log pilings driven into the sandy soil of the Baixa, to ensure the effective support of their weight. They were arranged according to their importance in a horizontal hierarchy based on proximity to the street (the uppermost storey would be reserved for poorer families with few possessions, usually having lower ceilings, communal balconies, smaller windows and smaller rooms). All the buildings had masonry firewalls separating them from each other. The standardization of façades, windows, doors, simple geometric patterns in the hallway tiles, etc. permitted accelerated progress of the works through the mass production of these elements on site.|$|E
25|$|The Patterson {{was named}} for Carlile Pollock Patterson, fourth Superintendent of the Coast Survey and first of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The New York Times {{credited}} the design to Commander Colby Mitchell Chester, USN, at that time Hydrographic Inspector in USC Naval architect Samuel Hartt Pook, U.S. Naval Constructor, was credited with supervising the drawings. She was built of wood in James D. Leary's yard at Williamsburg (Brooklyn) New York. Frames were white oak with cedar tops; planking, beams and lower deck were yellow pine, the upper deck was white pine. Her hull was fitted with iron <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces,</b> and five watertight bulkheads (3 wood, 2 iron). Power was a Cross compound vertical steam engine (one source reports 356hp, another source says 215 ihp; this difference may represent different calculation or measurement methods) and she could carry 133 tons of coal as fuel. Her machinery was constructed by Neafie & Levy of Philadelphia. She was rigged as a barkentine with double topsail yards; standing rigging was galvanized charcoal-iron wire. Her boats were two steam launches, two cutters, two whaleboats, and a dinghy. Her deckhouse, 13 × 62ft, included the engine and boiler rooms, galley, pantry, and a drafting room. She carried a Sigsbee piano-wire sounding machine, state-of-the-art for deep-water hydrography, holding five miles of wire. Lieutenant Richardson Clover, USN, supervised construction and became her first commander.|$|E
2500|$|The Sport was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{staggered}} wings of equal span and rectangular plan. [...] There were outboard ailerons on the upper planes only. [...] The interplane struts were of N-shape and the centre section was supported by two pairs of vertical struts from the fuselage. [...] The fuselage was a rectangular structure with four longerons interconnected by vertical and <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> skinned in 3-ply wood. An open cockpit began just aft of the first pair of centre section struts, with two low seats in tandem, spaced so closely together that the passenger's feet surrounded the pilot. [...] At the rear, the tailplane {{was attached to the}} top of the fuselage and wire braced to the rudder post. [...] This latter carried a tall rudder with a curved top which extended to the bottom of the fuselage, moving in a gap between the elevators; there was no fixed fin. [...] It had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with its main wheels on a single axle mounted on V struts to the lower longerons.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper takes Huzhou Baimitang Bridge as an {{engineering}} example, expounds the common diseases of through pre-stressed truss arch bridge and their causes. It uses structure calculation software {{to optimize the}} reinforcement methods of components, such as arch rib, <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace,</b> tie beam, etc. The results show that pasting steel for arch rib, <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> and pasting carbon fiber sheet for tie beam can effectively enhance the stiffness and the carrying capacity of Baimitang Bridge. The reinforcing methods are good for reference of other similar engineering projects...|$|R
50|$|Modern light-frame {{structures}} usually gain {{strength from}} rigid panels (plywood and other plywood-like composites such as {{oriented strand board}} (OSB) used to form {{all or part of}} wall sections) but until recently carpenters employed various forms of <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> to stabilize walls. <b>Diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> remains a vital interior part of many roof systems, and in-wall wind braces are required by building codes in many municipalities or by individual state laws in the United States. Special framed shear walls are becoming more common to help buildings meet the requirements of earthquake engineering and wind engineering.|$|R

30|$|In this model, gravity {{loads of}} the above story are ignored to simplify the model and reduce very long {{solvation}} time demanded by the software. <b>Diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> was prestressed by applying 40 -kn tensile force. After installation of brace in frame and using none-shrinkage high-strength mortar {{at the end of}} the FSSP after hardening of mortar the prestress force is released which leads to elongation of <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> and the brace is fitted in the frame. Then lateral force is applied to the model. The model failure mode was brace buckling as it is shown in Fig.  16.|$|R

5000|$|A queen-post bridge has two uprights, placed {{about one-third}} of the way from each end of the truss.

The central square between the two verticals is either unbraced (on shorter spans), or has one or two <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> for rigidity. A single diagonal reaches between opposite corners; two <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> may either reach from the bottom of each upright post {{to the center of the}} upper beam, or form a corner-to-corner [...] "X" [...] inside the square.|$|E

40|$|<b>Diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> is {{a common}} method used in South Africa for the bracing of timber trussed roofs with spans of less than 9 m. In the typical diagonally braced roof system, the brace {{is placed on the}} {{underside}} of the compression chord, which is as far as it can be placed away from the battens that brace the trusses not directly connected to the <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace.</b> Some of the stiffness of the bracing is lost because the low torsional rigidity of the top chord as well as the batten to top chord nailing is all part of the structural system. In this paper the authors investigate bracing of the entire roof system and contend that it is better to connect the bracing member closer to the battens as this improves the stiffness and bracing ability of the system. The authors study both the <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> as well as the alternative bracing method that uses criss-cross metal strapping, sometimes called speed brace. The speed brace is nailed to the top of the compression chord and is therefore much closer to the battens. Two different truss spans were studied to ascertain the buckling length of the top chord for both the <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> as well as speed bracing. By moving the bracing system closer to the battens the authors show that the speed brace gives a stiffer system which thereby reduces the buckling length of the top compression chord. [URL]...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the rigging}} {{challenges}} with Spanish web is arresting the torquing forces involved. These forces must be arrested within the rigging systems and that usually involves extra guy lines, gusset plates, <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> {{and other such}} techniques.|$|R
