In the episode, he is featured helping two children write a song about their Army captain father, who is returning from Afghanistan to surprise his family.|$|E

The individuals walking in Los Angeles stop for a moment, and look towards the sky, which is cut off screen. As close-up shots of Amuro finish {{by the end of}} the bridge section of the song, the camera pans towards rainbow-coloured clouds, which puts all the citizens <b>in</b> <b>surprise</b> and glee. The final chorus has Amuro {{and the children}} dancing and singing at Pershing Square, surrounding by several lighting effects and rainbow-coloured clouds. Several scenes of the clouds start to float within the city, above and near skyscrapers, and the video ends with Amuro, the children, and the citizens smiling.|$|E
5|$|In spring 593, Priscus was re-appointed {{in command}} as {{commander}} of the cavalry in Thrace, with Gentzon leading the infantry. Priscus, as the more senior of the two, also held overall command. Both generals marched to Dorostolon on the Danube, and campaigned with success against the Slavic tribes preparing to cross the river under their leaders Ardagastus and Musocius. Crossing the river, both Slavic hosts were annihilated <b>in</b> <b>surprise</b> night attacks. At the same time, however, Priscus reportedly quarrelled with his men over {{the distribution of the}} booty captured, and especially the considerable portion Priscus allocated to the imperial family. The soldiers were eventually placated, and the booty sent back to the capital with an escort. Maurice also sent orders for the army to winter north of the river, but this caused great resentment and unrest amongst the soldiers. Priscus chose to disobey the emperor's order and crossed again with his army to winter in the southern bank. In the autumn of 593, he was replaced by Maurice with his own brother Peter. Before the latter could assume command, however, Priscus arranged for a truce with the khagan, to whom he returned all Avar captives, some 5,000 in number, a fact for which he was criticized by Maurice.|$|E

25|$|Petrosian was {{partially}} deaf {{and wore a}} hearing aid during his matches, which sometimes led to strange situations. On one occasion he offered a draw to Svetozar Gligorić, which Gligorić initially refused <b>in</b> <b>surprise,</b> but then changed his mind {{in a few seconds}} and re-offered the draw. However, Petrosian did not even respond, instead went ahead and won the game. As it later turned out, he switched off his hearing aid, and did not hear when Gligorić re-offered the draw. In 1971, he played a candidates match against Robert Hübner in a noisy area in Seville, which did not disturb him, but frustrated Hübner so much that he finally withdrew from the match.|$|E
25|$|Maricopa County {{took charge}} of what was then called the Estrella Freeway project when it was dropped from the {{regional}} freeway plans, maintaining it as an interim 2-lane highway along the original corridor while keeping the state route designation. The county then made significant improvements to the roadway, extending it several miles north and east of US 60. While the highway was still largely a 2-lane rural road, the extension north of US 60 along with the southern terminus just north of Interstate 10 was upgraded to a 4-lane divided parkway, and the segment between US 60 and Bell Road <b>in</b> <b>Surprise</b> was partially upgraded to controlled-highway standards with overpasses and right-of-way for on-ramps.|$|E
25|$|Grace decides {{on a new}} revenge {{plot against}} Freddie. Mercedes disappears in mysterious {{circumstances}} and the police believe she has been murdered when they find traces of her blood. Flashback scenes aired revealed Grace was behind Mercedes' disappearance and she sets out to frame Freddie for her murder. She plant evidence in Freddie's flat so that he is arrested. Hollyoaks had been secretive {{about whether or not}} Mercedes had been killed by Grace. In February 2015, Mercedes reappeared on-screen <b>in</b> <b>surprise</b> scenes and it was revealed she had teamed up with Grace to frame Freddie for her supposed murder. The character had been hiding in a villa in France while Grace set Freddie up. Freddie's girlfriend Lindsey discovers the truth and sends Grace threatening messages to expose her deceit. Grace manages to fool the police investigation until Phoebe McQueen (Mandip Gill) incriminates herself into becoming the prime suspect for the supposed murder. With the plan ruined Mercedes later returns to the village.|$|E

500|$|Greinke was {{sometimes}} quiet and awkward in the clubhouse. To alleviate {{some of his}} anxiety and solitude, the Royals made arrangements for him to live with Royals Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett. Still, Greinke's uneasiness grew. By the 2005–2006 off-season, he nearly quit baseball. Greinke later remarked that, at the time, he {{did not expect to}} return to baseball. He left spring training for personal reasons in late February 2006. It was later revealed that he was diagnosed with depression and a social anxiety disorder. He reported back to the Royals' spring training facility <b>in</b> <b>Surprise,</b> Arizona, on April 17, where he underwent ongoing pitching sessions. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list due to psychological issues and took time away from baseball entirely. [...] He began seeing a sports psychologist and taking anti-depressant medication. Grienke only made three appearances out of the bullpen in 2006, and finished the year 1-0 with a 4.26 ERA.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{described}} the [...] "Cold, Cold Heart" [...] DLC as better paced and focused than the main game, owing to its shorter play time that {{allowed for a}} more interesting experience. It was also criticized, however, for losing focus near the end, and padding the running time with unnecessary deviations. GameSpot said that the DLC featured a satisfying combination of the series' combat, stealth, and detective mechanics, and introduced interesting new enemy types that wield ice guns capable of freezing both Batman and other enemies. Reviewers {{described the}} story as entertaining, following the interesting character of Mr. Freeze, but considered it lacking <b>in</b> <b>surprise</b> because it replicates that of the 1992 Batman: The Animated Series episode [...] "Heart of Ice". The final battle against Mr. Freeze was criticized for replicating several elements of {{the fight against the}} character in Arkham City. Similarly, IGN and Destructoid noted that the content lacked originality and innovation, providing generic environments and removing, rather than adding new abilities and weapons.|$|E

500|$|Sykes is {{wounded by}} Deke's posse while {{securing}} spare horses. The rest of Pike's gang returns to Agua Verde for shelter, where a bacchanal celebrating the weapons transfer has commenced; they see Angel [...] being dragged {{on the ground}} by a rope tied behind the general's car. After a brief frolic with prostitutes and a period of reflection, Pike and the gang try to forcibly persuade Mapache to release Angel, who by then was barely alive after the torture. The general appears to comply; however, as they watch, the general instead cuts Angel's throat. Pike and Engstrom angrily gun Mapache {{down in front of}} his men. For a moment, the federales are so shocked that they fail to return fire, causing Engstrom to laugh <b>in</b> <b>surprise.</b> Pike calmly takes aim at Mohr and kills him, too. This results in a violent, bloody shootout—dominated by the machine gun—in which Pike and his men are killed, along with most of Mapache's present troops and the remaining German adviser.|$|E
500|$|The case {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be going badly for Marshall-Hall. An inept cross-examination on his part weakened his argument, and an illness made him irritable and short-tempered. On {{the advice of his}} clerk, he asked Birkett to make the closing address before the court, which turned the mood of the courtroom completely and an initially hostile jury decided to disregard the agreement of Mr. Dennistoun to pay ancillary relief to his former wife. Birkett's performance made the front pages of many evening newspapers, including The Daily Mail which described Birkett as [...] "the greatest legal discovery of the year" [...] and called his speech [...] "a brilliant piece of advocacy". His work for this case and the newspaper coverage of it brought him to the attention of many London solicitors, and led to him earning £8,000 in the first seven months of 1925. In that year he made £12,000 overall, an amount which rose to £16,500 in 1926 and peaked in 1929 when he earned £33,500. On meeting Miles Malleson, an old friend from his time at Cambridge, he said <b>in</b> <b>surprise</b> [...] "did you know, Miles, that I am making more money than I thought existed in the world!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the later}} Tandy period (1946– 1949) and {{continuing}} throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less {{frequently in the}} center of the action. The Ghost of Blackwood Hall shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself. Her mouth is often open <b>in</b> <b>surprise,</b> and she hides her body from view. However, although Nancy [...] "expresses surprise, she is not afraid. She appears to be a bit taken aback by what she sees, but she looks as if she is still in control of the situation." [...] Many of these covers feature Nancy poised in the observation of a clue, spying on criminal activity, or displaying her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} highly {{acclaimed}} by critics and audiences alike. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised the film, calling it, [...] "one {{of the most}} deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made." [...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Two things, however, make Raiders of the Lost Ark {{more than just a}} technological triumph: its sense of humor and the droll style of its characters [...] We find ourselves laughing <b>in</b> <b>surprise,</b> in relief, in incredulity at the movie's ability to pile one incident upon another in an inexhaustible series of inventions." [...] He later added it to his list of [...] "Great Movies". Rolling Stone said the film was [...] "the ultimate Saturday action matinee–a film so funny and exciting it can be enjoyed any day of the week." [...] Bruce Williamson of Playboy claimed: [...] "There's more excitement in the first ten minutes of Raiders than any movie I have seen all year. By the time the explosive misadventures end, any movie-goer worth his salt ought to be exhausted." [...] Stephen Klain of Variety also praised the film. Yet, making an observation that would revisit the franchise with its next film, he felt that the film was surprisingly violent and bloody for a PG-rated film.|$|E
500|$|The next match pitted Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers (accompanied by Luna Vachon and Afa) {{against a}} team calling {{themselves}} the Four Doinks. After Bigelow's team was introduced, Doink the Clown's theme song began to play, but immediately {{switched to the}} theme of The Bushwhackers and Howard Finkel introduced the pair as Luke Doink and Butch Doink as they came down wearing clown wigs, with Luke riding a scooter and Butch pulling a wagon. As the fans waited to see who would be the other two Doinks, the intro to Doink's theme played again and the two Doinks were joined by Mabel Doink and Mo Doink with their rapping manager Oscar Doink; as they came to the ring they were referred to by Bobby Heenan as [...] "Doinks on a Mission". Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents. He was purposely offered one more balloon by the Doinks, which he willfully bit into. Samu was stunned to find out that the balloon was full of water, which caused him to stumble back <b>in</b> <b>surprise</b> and Luke rolled him up and pinned him. Later, Booger has a chance to pin Luke after he hit the Trip to the Batcave on him. However, Booger got off of Luke and went to the corner where Headshrinker Fatu offered him a banana. As Booger was looking to perform the move again, his teammates dragged him away and Booger landed on his knees. Luke and Butch performed their trademark battering ram on Booger. Mabel then executed a leg drop on Booger and pinned him. Down four wrestlers to two, Bigelow's team appeared to be making a comeback when Fatu began taking down his opponents with the carcass of a turkey that Afa had been eating from the entire match. He then performed a top rope splash onto Mo. Fatu got distracted, however, and examined a banana peel with curiosity. Butch entered the ring with a bucket and faked out Fatu by making {{like he was going to}} toss the contents of the bucket onto him. This resulted in Fatu slipping on the banana peel, and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match. Left by himself, Bigelow began brutally atracking three of the Doinks and seemed to get the upper hand when Mabel entered the ring and Bigelow was unable to do much to him. Meanwhile, Butch dumped a bucket of confetti all over Luna, which caused Bigelow to become momentarily distracted and Mabel and Mo sandwiched him in the corner. Bigelow fell, Mabel performed a splash on him, and the referee counted the pin as the other three Doinks piled on. After the match, the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow.|$|E
