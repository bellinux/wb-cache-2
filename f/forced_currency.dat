40|$|The unorthodox {{decision}} {{taken in}} 1850 to oblige the Treasury Offices {{to accept the}} bank notes of the Bank of France, {{in spite of the}} repeal of the <b>forced</b> <b>currency</b> in 1848, or in other words the maintaining of the legal tender of the note in relation to the Treasury Offices (Introduction), would be understandable with the following hypothesis. This unorthodox decision would indirectly come down to recovery the tax in cash by the Bank of France (I- 1), and would make possible to the Bank of France, thanks to the income of the tax, to stabilize its reserve that is structurally unstable (I- 2), even if it must be necessary to raise the bank rate in the event of important withdrawals realized by the Treasury (I- 3). In this way, the Bank of France would finance in cash, thanks to this aid from the State, the needs of the economy (II- 2), while the maintaining of the legal tender in relation to the Treasury Offices, would make possible to finance the public Deficit exclusively with its notes (II- 1). This monetary policy carried out by the Bank of France in 1850, would have taken as pattern, the monetary policy fulfilled by the Bank of England, through the 1844 's Banking Charter Act of Peel (II- 3). La décision "hétérodoxe" prise en 1850 d'obliger les Receveurs généraux à recevoir le billet de la Banque de France, malgré l'abrogation du cours forcé, autrement dit le maintien "hétérodoxe" du cours légal du billet de la BF auprès des Caisses publiques (Introduction), s'expliquerait par l'hypothèse suivante: cette décision "hétérodoxe" se ramènerait indirectement à un recouvrement en espèces de l'impot par la BF (I- 1) et permettrait alors à la BF de stabiliser son Encaisse, structurellement aléatoire, grace au produit de la fiscalité (I- 2), quitte à élever le taux de l'escompte en cas de retraits significatifs opérés par le Trésor (I- 3). La BF financerait alors en espèces grace à cette aide de l'Etat, le crédit à l'écnomie (II- 2), alors que le maintien du cours légal auprès des Caisses publiques, lui aurait permis de financer le déficit public par "création monétaire" (II- 1).

This study {{basically}} aims at estimating {{the significance of}} export promoting policies {{for the expansion of}} Turkish manufacturing exports in the period 1980 - 86. The price responsiveness of export is also analyzed by evaluating the effects of a decline in labor wages on manufactured exports. In this study, export promoting policies are grouped as export subsidies (tax rebates, export credits and foreign currency allocations) and flexible exchange rate policy (devalmtion of Turkish lira since January 1980). As there is several years of data on a number of manufacturing subsectors, the cross-sectional time series models are used to test the significance of these policies.

40|$|The {{countries}} of the European periphery are experiencing a balance of payments crisis stemming from persistent current account deficits and sharply lower private capital inflows, a condition known as a sudden stop. In countries with fixed exchange rates, sudden stops typically drain foreign reserves, <b>forcing</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation which eventually shifts the current account from deficit to surplus. However, the sudden stop has not prompted the European periphery countries to move toward devaluation by abandoning the euro, in part because capital transfers from euro-area partners have allowed them to finance current account deficits. A balance of payments crisis typically arises when a country can’t finance its foreign transactions. A country’s balance of payments can be separated into two main parts: the current account, which reflects the trade balance in goods and services; and the financial account, which reflects the balance on net international financial transactions. In turn, the financial account {{can be broken down}} into, one, the balance on international private capital flows; and, two, changes in official holdings of foreign reserve assets, such as gold, foreign currency, and foreign sovereign debt.

40|$|A game theoretic and {{incentive}} {{approach is}} used to explain an international monetary regime. Decisions concerning a fixed exchange rate regime are difficult because they involve cooperation among participants, but decisions concerning defections from a fixed exchange rate regime are relatively easy because they are taken unilaterally. This may explain the difficulties for the completion of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe well as the instability recently observed in the quasi-fixed exchange regimes of the Asian countries. EMU is now in full force. The perception of political benefits by national leaders has been the driving <b>force</b> of <b>currency</b> unification in Europe.

50|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that the introduction of current account convertibility and foreign trade liberalization would <b>force</b> a <b>currency</b> devaluation that would support export-led growth. However, when prices were de-controlled enterprises and retailers raised their prices to match those prevailing in the black market or towards world price levels, earning them windfall profits initially. Consumers reacted by reducing their purchases and by substituting better quality imported goods in place of domestically produced goods. Falling sales led {{to the collapse of}} many domestic enterprises, with personnel lay-offs or reduced hours of work and pay. This further reduced effective demand. As imports grew and exporters failed to respond to opportunities in world markets due to the poor quality of their products and lack of resources for investment, the trade deficit expanded, putting downward pressure on the exchange rate. Many wholesalers and retailers marked prices according to their dollar values and the falling exchange rate fed inflation. The central banks in several countries raised interest rates and tightened credit conditions, depriving state agencies and enterprises of working capital. These in turn found it impossible to pay wages on time, dampening effective demand further.|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{research}} on the microeconomics of currency markets, an area known sometimes as "currency market microstructure, ” has taken off in the past decade. This paper extracts from this research four lessons for modeling short-run exchange-rate dynamics. The first lesson is this: Currency flows are key, so models should focus on flows and equilibrium may be defined by equality between purchases and sales. The remaining three lessons concern the economic <b>forces</b> behind <b>currency</b> flows. Second lesson: Models should distinguish "financial" traders, who essentially use currencies as a store of value, from "commercial " traders, who use currencies as a medium of exchange. At short horizons cumulative financial flows have a positive relationship with exchange rates while cumulative commercial flows have a negative relationship. Third lesson: Financial traders are motivated by profits, rather than consumption, and their risk-taking will be constrained. Fourth lesson: Commercial traders are motivated by exchange-rate levels and rationally choose not to speculate. The paper notes that the workhorse models of international macroeconomics do not fit most of these lessons. These important lacunae in their microfoundations may help explain their limited empirical success. The paper sketches an optimizing model of currency flows {{that is consistent with}} the lessons.

The increased foreign debt denominated in foreign <b>currencies</b> <b>forced</b> the central bank to engage in more disciplinary monetary policy. The developed banking system worked in two ways: 1) increased public wealth in the banking system allowed a more relaxed discipline but 2) the commercial banks’ supply of liquidity through note issuance allowed the central bank to strengthen monetary discipline. The international economy developed as a credit economy and this international credit economy led to more flexible monetary policy. This affected the working of the adjustment mechanism where domestic prices simultaneously followed changes in the domestic money supply and in international prices.

40|$|An {{exchange}} rate between two currencies can be materially affected by shocks {{emerging from a}} third country. A US demand shock, for example, can affect the {{exchange rate}} between the euro and the yen. Because positive US demand shocks have a greater positive impact on Japanese interest rates than on euro area rates, the yen appreciates against the euro in response. Using quarterly data on the United States, the euro area and Japan from 1981 to 2006, this paper shows that the third-currency effects are significant even when exchange rates evolve according to uncovered interest parity. This is because interest rates are typically set in response to output and inflation, which are in turn influenced by other exchange rates. More importantly, third-currency effects are also transmitted to the actual exchange rate through the expected future exchange rate, which is, in a multi-country set-up, influenced by third-countries' fundamentals and shocks. Third-currency effects have a stronger impact on the currency of a relatively more open economy. The analysis implies that small open economies should avoid strict forms of bilateral exchange rate targeting, since higher trade and financial openness work as a <b>force</b> intrinsically amplifying <b>currency</b> fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the Eurozone it became obvious that the structural differences between member countries would not abate, as expected, but rather gradually widen. Although part of the problem {{can be attributed to the}} enlargement process, it also relates to asymmetric effects of the common currency and to diverging economic policies. This paper discusses the literature which associates the economic characteristics of EMU with arguments of the optimum currency area (OCA) theory and asks for missing capstones that would meliorate EMU to eventually resemble an OCA. As potential candidates for such building blocks, some sort of fiscal union and lender of last resort may qualify, drawing on the experiences of other currency unions and federal states. The financial and debt crisis has revealed that the endogenous <b>forces</b> within a <b>currency</b> union may be too slow to absorb the shocks originating from the crisis.
