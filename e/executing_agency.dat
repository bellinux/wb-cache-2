In 1989 JBIC had {{approved}} two loans to support two Metropolitan Water Supply Projects to transfer bulk {{water from the}} Khanpur Dam and the Simly Dam {{for a total of}} 18.268 billion Yen. The Khanpur project, implemented between 1994 and 2000, aimed at increasing bulk water supply to Islamabad and Rawalpindi from the Khanpur Dam. An [...] ex-post evaluation of the project in 2002 judged that [...] "the effect of the project was not necessarily high". The amount of water supplied was only 41% of what had been planned, and there were [...] "various problems with the <b>executing</b> <b>agency</b> (the Capital Development Authority) such as the scarcity of personnel, underdeveloped institutions, and the shortage of active efforts." [...] A Japanese field survey in 2008 re-examined the situation and found that [...] "no noticeable improvements have been made". The total amount spent was US$109 million (12,442 million Yen). Among other things, water purification facilities with a capacity of 281,000 m³ per day, water supply facilities and water storage facilities had been constructed.|$|E

This study attempts to provide a better explanation of the decentralization of the international development assistance system. The decentralization is defined as a dispersion of decision-making power among various organizations and the resistance of sovereign states to centralized majority decision. This study applies (1) sociological propositions developed in the national setting to explain the initial creation, growth, and decline of interorganizational relations with a focus on organizations' pursuit of autonomy, (2) sociological propositions developed in the international setting to explain how international organizations coopt sovereign states, and (3) realist propositions about state pursuit of national interest. The following hypotheses are supported: (1) resource scarcity and complementary domains motivated a funding organization and <b>executing</b> <b>agencies</b> to initiate their interorganizational relations; (2) they were concerned with acquiring power and protecting autonomy against eroding; (3) growing financial dependence of the <b>executing</b> <b>agencies</b> on their funding organizations led the latter to centralize the development system; (4) the convergence of interests in preserving autonomy and sovereignty led <b>executing</b> <b>agencies</b> and donor countries to introduce and support various special-purpose funding arrangements, as a means of mobilizing discretionary funds of their own and avoiding majority decision-making; (5) strong resistance to their centralization efforts forced the funding organization and recipient countries to establish and accept the special-purpose funding arrangements, as a means of regaining its organizational identity as the major fund supplier and meeting their financial interests; (6) intense competition for limited resources and the proliferation of those special-purpose funding arrangements blurred the division of labor and intensified the tendency to promote fragmented development initiatives; and (7) eroding domain consensus and subsequent conflicts led funding organizations and <b>executing</b> <b>agencies</b> to reach a temporary, impl icit compromise by acknowledging the newly evolving reality, but centralization and decentralization resumed pulling against one another. This study shows that the decentralization of the international development system can be better understood {{in the context of the}} dynamics of interorganizational relations, organization's pursuit of autonomy, and state pursuit of national interest or national autonomy...|$|R

In October 1999, a Bank-wide taskforce was appointed under the chairmanship of Francis B. Narayan, Lead Financial Management Specialist. The taskforce was supported by a consultant. The review process, lasting over a year, was carried out in consultation with all divisions and departments. These revised Guidelines are the result of the review. They describe ADB’s philosophy, policies, and approach to financial management of <b>executing</b> <b>agencies</b> and financial {{analysis of}} investment projects. They have been prepared for the benefit of ADB staff and consultants who evaluate financial management practices of <b>executing</b> <b>agencies</b> or undertake financial analysis of investment projects.
