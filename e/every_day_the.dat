5|$|The {{fight was}} one of the first {{victories}} for American forces in repelling the North Korean advance. In stopping the North Korean advance at the Notch and around Masan, the UN forces were able to halt the progress of the North Korean 4th and 6th Divisions, grounding their flanking moves to a halt and forcing them to withdraw to rebuild and re-supply. In the meantime, the American forces along the perimeter were being reinforced by heavier infantry and armor formations <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> North Korean defeat and retreat around the Masan region allowed both sides several critical days of reprieve from battle. This would end when the North Korean force began its final offensive on the UN forces in its coordinated assault on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

5|$|While he is {{virtually}} unknown in Canada, Harrison is widely honored in China. A statue in his likeness stands tall in Shanghai, his burial site at an Anglican compound in Kaifeng {{is home to}} the Dr. Tillson Harrison Memorial School, and the Harrison International Peace Hospital in Hengshui treats approximately 800outpatients <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> town of Tillsonburg, Ontario (named for Harrison's great-grandfather) maintains a lasting relationship with the hospital, which was renamed as such from the previous name of Handan International Peace Hospital in 1947. In 1988, the Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney, sent a commemorative letter to the Chinese ambassador to mark the centenary of Harrison's birth. However at that time it was not made clear that Harrison had falsified his age when enlisting in the UNRRA, and the celebrations took place seven years after the actual centenary. The same year, Harrison's remains were re-interred in a large tomb in a public ceremony, which many Canadians were invited to attend.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meant to}} take place in Santa Barbara, California, the installment, like the {{majority}} of Psychs episodes, was filmed in and around the Vancouver area of British Columbia. According to the show's creator Steve Franks, about half of the scenes in each episode are filmed in the suburb town of White Rock. Several of the sets, like the Psych office and Henry Spencer's house, are located along the coast in the White Rock area. Because of the differences between Vancouver and Santa Barbara, the show's producers were forced to bring in props for each episode, such as nine fake palm trees which had to be trucked to the set <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> scripts for each Psych episode had to go through several reviews, and often were cut down by as much as a few dozen pages. A large portion of show's dialogue consists of on-the-spot improvisation by the actors, specifically Roday and Hill. The writers noted that much of the humor in the installments came from improvisation. The episode also included several reoccurring gags on the show, such as an introductory flashback and the inclusion of a pineapple; both gags were created by the action of one of the actors.|$|E
5|$|In October 1892, {{shortly after}} he began {{attending}} New York Law School, Crosby was invited by former Yale coach Walter Camp to live in Annapolis, Maryland {{to serve as the}} coach for the United States Naval Academy football team; the program was acting in response to the appointment of Crosby's former teammate, Henry L. Williams, as coach for the Army team. Navy had first extended the offer to Camp, who suggested Crosby would fulfil the role more effectively. Crosby accepted the invitation, and became the second head coach in Navy history and the first who was independent of the program. The previous coach, Vaulx Carter, attended the academy, and had revived the program. Crosby's strategy for practices {{was one of the most}} intensive used at the academy during its early years; after classes <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> team played two 45 minute games against a team of 22 backup players, followed immediately by a long swimming session in a cold pool. Shortly before the season began, Crosby hired former St. John's College, Johns Hopkins, and Lehigh player Paul Dashiell to serve as his assistant coach.|$|E

5|$|Star of Festa is a {{gameplay}} mode {{in which}} the player's idol unit participates in a five-day music festival. On {{each of the five}} in-game days, the player is required to consecutively play three songs, and for each song, he or she is given a score that represents votes given by the in-game audience. For the third song <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> player may choose to compete against a computer-controlled opponent, represented as idols from 876 Production, 961 Production's Jupiter, and characters from The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls and other Shiny Festa games. By defeating his or her opponent, the player gains additional votes and earns the opponent's Name Card, which are shared across the three Shiny Festa games and passively grants additional votes. In addition to Name Cards, the player can also earn additional votes by using the Memories an idol has earned toward Memory Boosters. The player may choose to use the Memories of any of the idols who sings in the song, and if it is activated, Memory Booster icons appear throughout the song once the player has received a Shining Burst. To successfully complete Star of Festa, the player must accumulate 100,000 votes {{by the end of the}} last day.|$|E
