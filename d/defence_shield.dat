500|$|China's {{nuclear test}} of 1964, {{as well as}} its {{repeated}} threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to develop nuclear weapons. India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out further underground testing in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. India maintains a [...] "no first use" [...] nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its [...] "minimum credible deterrence" [...] doctrine. It is developing a ballistic missile <b>defence</b> <b>shield</b> and, in collaboration with Russia, a fifth-generation fighter jet. Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the escalating rhetoric and bellicose actions emanating from the Korean peninsula in April 2013, the United States deployed Patriot Missile Systems at its overseas military bases {{in danger of being}} struck by a North Korean missile launch. Japan took similar precautionary measures. A more permanent fixture and fitting in terms of Missile Defence Systems (MDS) is Israel’s Iron Dome Shield—designed to intercept rocket attacks by Hamas militants albeit more so for strategic benefit and less so for defending the civilian population. Both <b>defence</b> <b>shields</b> / systems, however, are designed for the same purpose—to intercept missile attacks during the ‘free flight’ phase (noting that this is specifically used in the ‘Ballistic Missile Defence context’). This article examines whether use of missile <b>defence</b> <b>shields</b> help support the existence of a wider right of anticipatory self-defence. The article also addresses the point at which an‘automated’ response takes place. Does such a response fall within the barometers of necessity and proportionality that govern a state’s lawful recourse to self-defence under international law...|$|R

50|$|The Shield holder {{at the end}} of {{each season}} is {{required}} to accept at least seven challenges for the following year. All home games during league play, but not during knockout playoffs, in the Mitre 10 Cup or Heartland Championship are automatic challenges. The remaining <b>shield</b> <b>defences</b> must be made up of challenges from unions in the other domestic competition. For example, since North Harbour, an Air New Zealand Cup (now Mitre 10 Cup) team, held the Shield {{at the end of}} the 2006 Cup season despite losing their home quarter-final to Otago, they were forced to defend the Shield against Heartland Championship teams during the 2007 pre-season.

In August 2008, Poland and the United States signed a preliminary deal to place part of the missile <b>defence</b> <b>shield</b> in Poland that would be linked to air-defence radar in the Czech Republic.

50|$|In fictional works, a force field, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} an energy shield, force shield, <b>defence</b> <b>shield</b> or deflector shield, is a barrier made of energy or particles. It protects a person, area, or object from attacks or intrusions. This fictional technology is created as a field of energy without mass {{that acts as a}} wall, so that objects affected by the particular force relating to the field are unable to pass through the field and reach the other side. This concept has become a staple of many science-fiction works, so much so that authors frequently do not even bother to explain or justify them to their readers treating them almost as established fact.|$|E
5000|$|On 6 May 2012, it was {{announced}} that Phase-I is complete and can be deployed to protect two Indian cities at a short notice. [...] New Delhi, the national capital, and Mumbai, have been selected for the ballistic missile <b>defence</b> <b>shield.</b> After successful implementation in Delhi and Mumbai, the system will be used to cover other major cities in the country. This shield can destroy incoming ballistic missiles launched from as far as 2,500 km away. When the Phase II is completed and PDV is developed, the two anti-ballistic missiles can intercept targets up to 5,000 km both at exo and endo-atmospheric (inside the atmosphere) regions. The missiles will work in tandem to ensure a hit probability of 99.8 per cent.|$|E
50|$|This {{undoubtedly}} {{stemmed from}} the leading role he had as the captain and first five in the Taranaki side which held the Ranfurly Shield between 1963-65.
