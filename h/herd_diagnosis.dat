40|$|This study {{evaluated}} test {{characteristics of}} environmental culture (EC) {{for the detection}} of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) in 32 herds over a 2 -year period. Individual fecal samples were collected every 6 mo and environmental samples every 3 mo. Individual fecal culture was performed on samples from positive pools. Samples were cultured in broth, with confirmatory polymerase chain reaction performed on positive fecal samples. Repeated measures were accounted for using GEE logistic models. Relative to a MAP herd-status based on all pooled fecal culture results collected during the study, sensitivity of a set of 6 EC-samples collected from prescribed locations within the herd environment (EC- 6) was 71 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 49 % to 86 %] and specificity was 99 % (95 % CI: 95 % to 100 %). Sensitivity of EC increased as apparent within-herd fecal culture prevalence (aWHP) increased. The estimated aWHP increased as the proportion of positive EC-samples within an EC- 6 set increased.

40|$|Qualitative {{examination}} of Fasciola gigantica eggs in faeces and bile {{were compared with}} the detection of precipitating antibodies in sera by agar gel precipitation test (AGPT) in 1000 cattle slaughtered at the Bodija municipal abattoir in Ibadan, Nigeria. Faecal and bile examination methods detected (196) 33. 5 % and (389) 38. 9 % of the animals as positive for fasciolosis, while (474) 47. 4 % were positive by AGPT. Both direct bile examination and faecal egg detection methods have high specificity and positive predictive value (100 %) when compared with AGPT. However, lower values for sensitivity and negative predictive value were observed for both faecal egg examination (66. 5 % and 67. 9 % respectively) and bile examination (81. 0 % and 78. 9 % respectively). Fecal and bile examination failed to detect 33. 5 % and 19. 0 % of the cases detected by AGPT.

40|$|Seven virgin heifers and two bulls, {{five and}} six years old respectively, were {{challenged}} with Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis, isolate FD 15. The challenge dose consisted of approximately 10 (9) organisms per ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7. 2. Cervicovaginal mucus was collected from heifers beginning one week after exposure using the technique described by Hoerlein and Kramer. These were cultured on a solid selective medium. Of the seven heifers, two became infected as determined by consistent recovery of the organism from cervical mucus samples. Seventy-four samples from both heifers were cultured; eight samples from one heifer, DO 7, were discounted {{on the assumption that}} she overcame her infection. Of the sixty-six samples, forty-eight yielded the organism on culture, giving a recovery rate of 72. 4 %. Preputial samples were collected from the two bulls by a pipette using the technique described by Dufty. These were cultured directly and following millipore filtration on a solid selective medium. They were also examined by immunofluorescence using a similar technique to that of Dufty and Schutte. Of the thirty-two samples examined by both methods, twenty-six (81 %) were positive on immunofluorescence examination, twenty-two (69 %) were positive on culture, and twenty-seven (84 %) were positive to both tests.

40|$|Paratuberculosis is {{a chronic}} {{enteritis}} that affects ruminants and {{is caused by}} Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (Map). The disease is worldwide spread and causes important economic losses. In Brazil, the bacillus was isolated {{in the south and}} northeast regions of the country and in Rio de Janeiro, but there are no enough epidemiological studies about its occurrence. Isolation of Map from tissues or fecal samples is 100 % specific, but Map shows the most fastidious growth of all mycobacteria. Incubation lasts 8 - 12 weeks, with a dependency on exogenous mycobactin J. Diagnostic tests based on specific DNA sequences allow fast and secure identification, and PCR has been used to confirm positive culture results and to identify Map in feces, milk and tissues. The most frequently used target sequences are the gene encoding the 16 S rRNA, and the insertion element IS 900. Serological assays are widely used for the <b>herd</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of the disease. A commercial ELISA with M. phlei pre-adsorption step achieves a specificity of 95. 4 % to 99 % and a sensitivity of about 45 %. Until now, there is no effective treatment for ill animals and control programs are based on managing procedures of herds and culling of symptomatic animals. In Brazil, paratuberculosis was recently identified and has been demonstrated even in autochthonous closed herds. Therefore, it is essential to perform an epidemiological national research and to investigate the economic impact of the disease in our herds. These results could promote a control program of paratuberculosis adapted to the Brazilian requirements...|$|E
40|$|Several {{biological}} parameters {{were measured}} in 31 heifers naturally infected with Fasciola hepatica during one grazing {{season in the}} Belgian Ardennes. A forecast model based on daily temperature {{used to assess the}} risk of fasciolosis was fitted to this assay. Cattle were turned out to two pastures. Each pasture was divided into two plots: one was treated with calcium cyanamide and the other was left untreated. The Lymnaea truncatula snails were counted on three different occasions. The results indicated a poor molluscicide efficiency. Body weight gains, anti-Fasciola antibody levels, faecal egg counts, levels of sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma GT), packed cell volumes, white blood cells and differential leucocyte counts were determined monthly. No statistically significant difference was observed between animals from the two plots regardless of the recorded data. No correlation was found between body weight gains and other biological data. The sampling date had a significant effect on the antibody responses within a same group, and on the enzymatic levels for all groups combined. The forecast results were consistent with the recorded data. Temperature was a major bioclimatic constraint on the transmission of life cycle, and risk of infection occurred mainly in late spring (May/June) and in early September. Current results might be used to issue advice on the need for flukicide treatment of cattle. The indicators of the infection considered alone were useless and it is concluded that <b>herd</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of fasciolosis may rely on the rise of specific antibody levels, possibly associated with an increase in hepatic enzyme activities.

40|$|Animal leptospirosis, exempt in rodents, manifests as {{peculiar}} biology {{where the}} animal can function, simultaneously or not, as a susceptible host or reservoir. In the first case, clinical symptoms are likely. In the second case, infection is subclinical and manifestations are mild or absent. Mild clinical symptoms encompass reproductive failure in production animals for host-adapted Leptospira sp. serovars. This work presents {{a study on}} Leptospira sp. infection in a mixed-species (bovine and swine) farm with documented reproductive disorders in the cattle unit. A long calving interval (above 450 days) was the hallmark observed in cows. Some cows (2 / 26 tested) presented a high titre of antibodies against Leptospira sp. serogroup Sejroe, but the overall within-herd prevalence was low (11. 5 % and 7. 7 % for cut-off titres of 1 : 30 and 1 : 100, respectively). The in-herd prevalence of leptospirosis in the sow unit (determined for 113 / 140 animals) was high when using a lowered cut-off threshold (32. 7 % vs. 1. 8 % for cut-off titre of 1 : 30 and 1 : 100, respectively). In this unit, the most prevalent serogroup was Autumnalis. The final diagnostic confirmation of Leptospira sp. maintenance within the farm was obtained through detection by PCR of Leptospira sp. DNA in an aborted swine litter. Despite {{the fact that a}} common causative infective agent was diagnosed in both species, the direct link between the two animal units was not found. Factors such as drinking from the same water source and the use of manure prepared with the swine slurry might raise suspicion of a possible cross-contamination between the two units. In conclusion, this work suggests that leptospirosis be included in the differential diagnosis of reproductive disorders and spontaneous abortions in production animals and provides data that justify the use of a lowered threshold cut-off for <b>herd</b> <b>diagnosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Subclinical {{mastitis}} is {{a common}} and easily disseminated disease in dairy <b>herds.</b> Its routine <b>diagnosis</b> via bacterial culture and biochemical identification is a difficult and time-consuming process. In this work, we show that matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) allows bacterial identification with high confidence and speed (1 d for bacterial growth and analysis). With the use of MALDI-TOF MS, 33 bacterial culture isolates from milk of different dairy cows from several farms were analyzed, {{and the results were}} compared with those obtained by classical biochemical methods. This proof-of-concept case demonstrates the reliability of MALDI-TOF MS bacterial identification, and its increased selectivity as illustrated by the additional identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species and mixed bacterial cultures.

40|$|Determining {{pregnancy}} in {{a cattle}} herd {{is one of}} the most vital aspects of a productive <b>herd.</b> Usually pregnancy <b>diagnosis</b> occurs in the fall when other culling decisions are made. However, in many cases identifying pregnant heifers and cows within 28 days of breeding allows for timely culling and marketing (Green et al., 2005). Today, many different methods to identify pregnancy exist for cows and heifers. Finding the method that works for each individual operation can be a challenge for ranchers. One method commercially available is the pregnancy associated glycoproteins (PAG) test. The PAG pregnancy test is relatively accurate and inexpensive. The materials needed to perform the PAG blood pregnancy test are blood collection tubes (Figure 2) and sterile needles. For this test, a blood sample is obtained by sticking the needle at a 90 degree angle to the tail into the middle coccygeal vein underneath the tail, a procedure commonly known as tail pricking (Figure 1). Blood is then collected in a tube (Figures 3 & 4). The blood samples were taken 25 - 28 days post breeding and sent to the Utah Veterinary Diagnostics Lab for testing. The results are 99. 9 % accurate (Table 1) (Lucy and Poock, 2012) ...|$|R
40|$|Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) possess similar {{structural}} and molecular features, are transmitted by biting midges (genus Culicoides), and cause similar diseases in some susceptible ruminants. Generally, BTV causes subclinical disease in cattle, {{characterized by a}} prolonged viremia. EHDV-associated disease in cattle is less prominent; however, it {{has emerged as a}} major economic threat to the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) industry {{in many areas of the}} United States. The recent emergence of multiple BTV and EHDV serotypes previously undetected in the United States demonstrates the need for robust detection of all known serotypes and differential diagnosis. For this purpose, a streamlined workflow consisting of an automated nucleic acid purification and denaturation method and a multiplex one-step reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the simultaneous detection of BTV serotypes 1 – 24 and EHDV serotypes 1 – 7 was developed using previously published BTV and EHDV assays. The denaturation of double-stranded (ds) BTV and EHDV RNA was incorporated into the automated nucleic acid purification process thus eliminating the commonly used separate step of dsRNA denaturation. The performance of this workflow was compared with the World Organization of Animal Health BTV reference laboratory (National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa) workflow for BTV and EHDV detection, and high agreement was observed. Implementation of the workflow in routine diagnostic testing enables the detection of, and differentiation between, BTV and EHDV, and coinfections in bovine blood and cervine tissues, offering significant benefits in terms of differential disease <b>diagnosis,</b> <b>herd</b> health monitoring, and regulated testing...|$|R
40|$|During a large {{mumps virus}} (MuV) {{outbreak}} which {{occurred in the}} Palestinian refugee camps of the West Bank, 68. 1 % (2, 636 / 3, 871) of the cases were vaccinated with one dose of trivalent measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Attack rates by camp ranged from less than 1 case per 1, 000 people in the population to 43 / 1, 000 (overall, 11 / 1, 000). The outbreak lasted from December 2003 to June 2005, with two peaks, one from April to May 2004 and the other from March to April 2005. To control the outbreak, a mass MMR vaccination campaign was conducted in May 2005. Evaluation of the immune status of cases (n = 59) and healthy controls (n = 51) revealed high levels of mumps immunoglobulin G (IgG) and a low MuV-specific IgM in clinical cases indicative of a booster immune response. This suggested a secondary rather than a primary infection due to the insufficient protection conferred by the single vaccine dose included in the vaccination program. This prediction was further confirmed by the low seroprevalence (68. 6 %) found in the healthy control group, which was below the threshold level required for MuV <b>herd</b> immunity. Mumps <b>diagnosis</b> was established mainly by reverse transcription-PCR in clinical samples obtained within 48 h from the onset of disease.

40|$|Chlamydiaceae are {{a family}} of obligate {{intracellular}} Gram-negative bacteria causing disease in man and animals. C. abortus is a major abortigenic agent in ruminants, causing ovine enzootic abortion (OEA). C. psittaci causes respiratory disease (avian chlamydiosis) in birds and psittacosis or parrot-fever in man. In Chapter I, an overview is given of the epidemiology, prevention, treatment and zoonotic risk of Chlamydiaceae infections in Chinese livestock. Differences in risk-factors, such as bio-security measures, and use of diagnostic tests and veterinary practices applied in China are compared to the West. In Chapter II, we examined the occurrence of C. abortus in Belgian ruminants by serology and molecular <b>diagnosis.</b> Sampling <b>herds</b> at n ≥ 10 revealed a seropositive herd status in 14. 3 % (6 / 42), 50 % (1 / 2) and 11. 6 % (11 / 95) of sheep, goat and cattle herds, respectively. Seroprevalence in one goat herd was 52. 9 % (9 / 17), but prevalence in positive sheep and cattle herds was generally limited to only 1 or 2 seropositive animals on 10 to 20 tested animals per <b>herd.</b> Molecular <b>diagnosis</b> on rectal swabs sampled at 3 cattle farms tested all negative for Chlamydiaceae DNA. In Chapter III, part A, we examined the pathogenicity of the well characterized C. psittaci genotype B (CP 3) and D (92 / 1293) strains in experimentally (aerosol) infected SPF chickens. Both strains caused conjunctivitis, rhinitis and dyspnoea. Pharyngeal and cloacal C. psittaci excretion was observed in all infected animals, indicative for systemic dissemination as proven by immunofluorescence staining of frozen tissue sections. Histopathological lesions were present in all infected chickens. However, differences in pathology were observed as genotype D was more virulent than genotype B, creating mortality and more severe clinical signs and lesions. In Chapter III, part B, sera of 30 Belgian and 10 Northern French chicken farms were tested by a C. psittaci MOMP-based ELISA. Ninety-six percent, 93 % and 90 % of the Belgian broilers, broiler breeders and layers were seropositive. Ninety-one percent of the French broilers were seropositive. In addition, tissues of 5 Belgian and 5 French broiler farms were examined at slaughter. All French farms ware culture positive while C. psittaci was cultured from the lungs of 80 % of examined Belgian farms. Chlamydia psittaci infections are apparently emerging in chickens raised in Belgium and Northern France. We could proof Hill-Evans postulates for chicken-derived C. psittaci genotype B and D strains. In Chapter III, part C, we focused on the histopathological lesions caused in experimentally infected SPF chickens. SPF chickens were experimentally infected with C. psittaci strain 10 / 423 (genotype B), 10 / 525 (genotype B) or 10 / 298 (genotype D), which were all isolated from Belgian or French broilers with pneumonia. All strains induced conjunctivitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis, airosacculitis, splenitis, hepatitis, nephritis and enteritis. Inflammation of the ovaries was only observed in genotype D infected chickens. Overall, the genotype D strain caused more severe histopathological lesions and a high mortality rate (54. 5 %) early upon infection. In addition, severity of lesions increased more rapidly in genotype D as compared to genotype B infected birds, which suggests faster replication in internal organ...|$|R
40|$|Brucellosis is {{a disease}} of {{socio-economic}} and zoonotic importance worldwide. In animals it {{is associated with the}} ingestion of feed that is contaminated with cyetic material from aborting herd-mates, while in humans it is associated with the consumption of unpasteurised milk and dairy products from infected animals. It may also be acquired from contact with infected material of animal origin by farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir and laboratory workers. Brucellosis was first reported in South Africa in the late nineteenth century. It is still present in the country today, with reported annual losses of at least R 300 million, and a national annual incidence of 5 000 cases in humans. The global incidence of human brucellosis is about half a million infections annually. As the incidence of human brucellosis is directly associated with prevalence in animals, control of animal brucellosis is emphasised. Veterinary control is compromised by the chronic nature and the variable incubation period of the disease, with an estimated up to 15 % of cattle in infected herds aborting before sero-conversion. Latency, which involves about 5 % of calves born from infected dams, is also problematic as these infected animals often test seronegative, only to seroconvert in the peri-parturient period, thus allowing opportunity for disease spread within and between <b>herds</b> before <b>diagnosis</b> is made. In addition, the currently used serological tests are at times unable to distinguish brucellosis from cross-reacting antibodies from other infections or brucellosis vaccines. x It was the objective of this study to investigate, under South African conditions, the value of the brucellin skin test (BST) in improving the sensitivity and specificity of the currently used serological tests. It has proved a valuable additional test in diagnosing early and latent infections as well as in differentiating brucellosis from cross-reacting organisms in unvaccinated cattle in Europe. The study also evaluated the benefit of replacing some of the currently used serological assays with the fluorescence polarisation assay (FPA). The FPA, a rapid and homogenous serological test with only a few operational steps, has been validated and is in current use in Canada. The study was carried out in Mpumalanga Province, on herds selected to reflect prevailing South African farming conditions. These herds were divided into certified Brucella abortus-negative herds (608 head) for the estimation of BST specificity, and confirmed B. abortus-infected herds (845 head) for the estimation of BST sensitivity. The results obtained indicated the BST had a specificity of 99. 18 %, and a relative sensitivity of 42. 86 %. However, 65. 38 % of BST-positive animals were negative on serology. When the high specificity is considered, together with the experiences of other researchers who found that the skin test became positive earlier than serological tests, these animals may be assumed infected. It is concluded that the BST is a valuable addition to the panel of diagnostic tests currently used to identify infected herds and individuals in South Africa. The FPA, with a relative sensitivity of 93. 65 % and a specificity of 98. 85 %, can potentially be of use as a screening test under South African conditions.

40|$|Bovine {{brucellosis}} is {{a disease}} affecting cattle worldwide and is mainly caused by Brucella abortus. Diagnosis of brucellosis {{is an important part}} of controlling bovine brucellosis in naturally infected cattle in South Africa. Serology remains the most practical method available to screen <b>herds</b> and confirm <b>diagnosis.</b> This study investigated the performance of Rose Bengal test (RBT), complement fixation test (CFT), serum agglutination test (SAT), competitive enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (cELISA), indirect ELISA (iELISA) and B. abortus species specific (BaSS) PCR in the diagnosis of brucellosis in naturally infected cattle in Kwazulu-Natal Province of South Africa. Natural brucellosis infection status of animals was determined by culturing from abomasal fluid, milk, hygroma fluid, lymph nodes or uterine discharges samples. Some of the samples were used in the BaSS PCR assay whereas sera obtained from the same animals were tested using RBT, CFT, SAT, cELISA and iELISA. Diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and diagnostic specificity (DSp) were determined for each test to assess each test performance to determine bovine brucellosis in naturally infected animals. Positive cultures were identified as B. abortus biovar 1. The iELISA and RBT had the highest DSe of 91. 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 80. 0 - 97. 7 %) followed by cELISA with a DSe of 91. 5 % (95 % CI: 79. 6 - 97. 6 %) and the CFT and SAT with DSe values of 91. 4 % (95 % CI: 79. 6 - 97. 6 %) and 87. 2 % (95 % CI: 74. 3 - 95. 2 %) respectively. The BaSS PCR had the lowest DSe of 72. 7 % (95 % CI: 39. 0 - 94. 0 %), but highest DSp of 92. 0 % (95 % CI: 79. 1 %- 98. 4 %) followed by the RBT and iELISA DSp value of 86. 7 % (95 % CI: 55. 5 %- 98. 3 %). CFT and cELISA had a DSp of 81. 3 % (95 % CI: 68 %- 89 %) whilst the SAT had the lowest DSp of 68. 8 % (41. 3 %- 89. 0 %). Although there was no statistically significant difference between the six tests in their ability to diagnose brucellosis, the RBT and indirect ELISA had the highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The BaSS PCR diagnosed B. abortus at species level and could be used to confirm culture results. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.
