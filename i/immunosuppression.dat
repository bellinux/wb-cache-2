5|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} {{infection}} in women prior to or during pregnancy {{does not appear}} to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether prophylactic treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo <b>immunosuppression</b> (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example, those with HIV infection).|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of <b>immunosuppression</b> in the population.|$|E
5|$|In {{the chronic}} stage, {{treatment}} involves managing the clinical {{manifestations of the}} disease. For example, pacemakers and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug amiodarone, may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease, while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for heart transplantation surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a contraindication for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the <b>immunosuppression</b> that follows surgery.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from <b>immunosuppression.</b> Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{reactivation}} {{increases with}} <b>immunosuppression,</b> {{such as that}} caused by infection with HIV. In people coinfected with M. tuberculosis and HIV, the risk of reactivation increases to 10% per year. Studies using DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis strains have shown reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB than previously thought, with estimates that it might {{account for more than}} 50% of reactivated cases in areas where TB is common. The chance of death from a case of tuberculosis is about 4% as of 2008, down from 8% in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death. Yet these organisms are {{also part of}} the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from <b>immunosuppression</b> or cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term <b>immunosuppression</b> to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue. In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term <b>immunosuppression</b> to maintain the transplant. Evidence suggests that, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. However, a follow-up study has shown that most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial <b>immunosuppression</b> are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E
25|$|Cause <b>immunosuppression.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{researchers}} have been looking into means of reducing the general burden of <b>immunosuppression.</b> Common approaches include avoidance of steroids, reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors, and other means of weaning drugs based on patient outcome and function. While short-term outcomes appear promising, long-term outcomes are still unknown, and in general, reduced <b>immunosuppression</b> {{increases the risk of}} rejection and decreases the risk of infection. The risk of early rejection is increased if corticosteroid <b>immunosuppression</b> are avoided or withdrawn after kidney transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Central {{mediated}} since {{peripheral administration}} of CRH antagonist {{does not affect}} <b>immunosuppression.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sirolimus {{can also}} be used alone, or in {{conjunction}} with a calcineurin inhibitor (such as tacrolimus), and/or mycophenolate mofetil, to provide steroid-free <b>immunosuppression</b> regimens. Impaired wound healing and thrombocytopenia are a possible side effects of sirolimus; therefore, some transplant centers prefer not to use it immediately after the transplant operation, but instead administer it only after a period of weeks or months. Its optimal role in <b>immunosuppression</b> has not yet been determined, and it remains the subject of a number of ongoing clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|TGF betas {{cause the}} {{transcription}} of mRNAs involved in apoptosis, extracellular matrix neogenesis and <b>immunosuppression.</b> It is {{also involved in}} G1 arrest in the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors that}} {{increase}} the risk of developing infective endocarditis are low levels of white blood cells, immunodeficiency or <b>immunosuppression,</b> malignancy, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids cause <b>immunosuppression,</b> and the {{therapeutic}} component of {{this effect is}} mainly the decreases in the function and numbers of lymphocytes, including both B cells and T cells.|$|E
25|$|Single center {{study showed}} renal allografts were {{preserved}} in 8/8 individuals managed with reduction in <b>immunosuppression</b> while graft loss occurred in 8/12 patients treated {{with an increase}} in therapy for what was thought to be organ rejection.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} diverticulitis are poorly understood, with {{approximately}} 40 percent due to genes and 60 percent due to environmental factors. Conditions {{that increase the}} risk of developing diverticulitis include arterial hypertension and <b>immunosuppression.</b> Obesity is another risk factor.|$|E
25|$|The oral lesion {{itself is}} benign and self-limiting, however {{this may not}} {{necessarily}} be the case for the underlying cause of immunocompromise. For instance, OHL with HIV/AIDS is a predictor of bad prognosis, (i.e. severe <b>immunosuppression</b> and advanced disease).|$|E
25|$|Multidrug {{resistant}} TB, malaria, and cholera are {{rampant in}} this area. The spread of HIV/AIDS, with its <b>immunosuppression,</b> {{will lead to}} a dramatic increase in infectious disease deaths. By 2010, the region could surpass Africa in the number of HIV infections.|$|E
25|$|More than 70% {{of cases}} are {{recorded}} {{in people with}} {{at least one of the}} following clinical situations: <b>immunosuppression,</b> diabetes, alcoholism/drug abuse/smoking, malignancies, and chronic systemic diseases. For reasons that are unclear, it occasionally occurs in people with an apparently normal general condition.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{experimental}} protocols were developed for ABO-incompatible transplants using increased <b>immunosuppression</b> and plasmapheresis. Through the 1990s these techniques were improved {{and an important}} study of long-term outcomes in Japan was published. Now, a number of programs {{around the world are}} routinely performing ABO-incompatible transplants.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids cause <b>immunosuppression,</b> {{decreasing}} the function and/or numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes (including both B cells and T cells), monocytes, macrophages, and the anatomical barrier {{function of the}} skin. This suppression, if large enough, can cause manifestations of immunodeficiency, including T cell deficiency, humoral immune deficiency and neutropenia.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempted}} human deceased-donor transplant {{was performed}} by the Ukrainian surgeon Yuri Voronoy in the 1930s; but failed due to Ischemia. Joseph Murray and J. Hartwell Harrison performed the first successful transplant, a kidney transplant between identical twins, in 1954, because no <b>immunosuppression</b> was necessary for genetically identical individuals.|$|E
25|$|Stem cell {{treatments}} {{may require}} <b>immunosuppression</b> {{because of a}} requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who is being treated.|$|E
25|$|A nephrologist is a {{physician}} who specializes in the care and treatment of kidney disease. Nephrology requires additional training to become an expert with advanced skills. Nephrologists may provide care to people without kidney problems and may work in general/internal medicine, transplant medicine, <b>immunosuppression</b> management, intensive care medicine, clinical pharmacology, perioperative medicine, or pediatric nephrology.|$|E
25|$|Feline leukemia {{virus and}} feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus {{belong to the}} Retroviridae family, and both cause <b>immunosuppression</b> in cats, which can increase their susceptibility to other infections. Research {{has shown that the}} prevalence of these viruses among feral cat populations is low and is similar to prevalence rates for owned cats in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The major {{mechanism}} for this <b>immunosuppression</b> through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells(NF-κB). NF-κB {{is a critical}} transcription factor involved in the synthesis of many mediators (i.e., cytokines) and proteins (i.e., adhesion proteins) that promote the immune response. Inhibition of this transcription factor, therefore, blunts {{the capacity of the}} immune system to mount a response.|$|E
25|$|Diseases of the {{intestine}} {{may cause}} vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, and altered stool, such as with blood in stool. Colonoscopy {{may be used}} to examine the large intestine, and a person's stool may be sent for culture and microscopy. Infectious disease may be treated with targeted antibiotics, and inflammatory bowel disease with <b>immunosuppression.</b> Surgery may also be used to treat some causes of bowel obstruction.|$|E
25|$|TST (tuberculin skin test) {{positive}} {{is measured}} by size of induration. The size of the induration {{considered to be a}} positive result depends on risk factors. For example, a low-risk patient must have a larger induration for a positive result than a high-risk patient. High-risk groups include recent contacts, those with HIV, those with chest radiograph with fibrotic changes, organ transplant recipients, and those with <b>immunosuppression.</b>|$|E
25|$|Acute {{liver disease}} rarely results in pain, but {{may result in}} jaundice. Infectious liver disease may cause a fever. Chronic liver disease {{may result in a}} buildup of fluid in the abdomen, {{yellowing}} of the skin or eyes, easy bruising, <b>immunosuppression,</b> and feminsation. Portal hypertension is often present, and this may lead to the development of prominent veins {{in many parts of the}} body, such as oesophageal varices, and haemorrhoids.|$|E
25|$|Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) can {{be caused}} by many {{cytotoxic}} drugs. The susceptibility of an individual to liver damage can be altered by other factors such as the cancer itself, viral hepatitis, <b>immunosuppression</b> and nutritional deficiency. The liver damage can consist of damage to liver cells, hepatic sinusoidal syndrome (obstruction of the veins in the liver), cholestasis (where bile does not flow from the liver to the intestine) and liver fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{sorbitol}} added to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, used {{in the treatment of}} hyperkalemia) can cause complications in the GI tract, including bleeding, perforated colonic ulcers, ischemic colitis and colonic necrosis, particularly in patients with uremia. Risk factors for sorbitol-induced damage include <b>immunosuppression,</b> hypovolemia, postoperative setting, hypotension after hemodialysis, and peripheral vascular disease. SPS-sorbitol should therefore be used carefully in the management of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Just {{as early}} studies showed islet transplantation's promise, {{research}} must now overcome the hurdles {{revealed by the}} recent islet transplant experience. New immunomodulatory agents offer the greatest hope of revolutionizing the field. New drug regimens capable of inducing tolerance to the transplanted islets would allow recipients to maintain their grafts without general <b>immunosuppression</b> and its associated toxicities. While many targets are currently under investigation, none are ready for clinical use.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{tissue that}} is {{destroyed}} or altered {{as a result}} of cancers is distorted, weakened, and more prone to fracture. This may lead to compression of the spinal cord, destruction of the marrow resulting in bruising, bleeding and <b>immunosuppression,</b> and is one cause of bone pain. If the cancer is metastatic, then there might be other symptoms depending {{on the site of the}} original cancer. Some bone cancers can also be felt.|$|E
25|$|It {{inhibits}} {{production of}} interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper (Th)1 cells, but upregulates IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. This {{results in a}} shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general <b>immunosuppression.</b> The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection {{is believed to be}} a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.|$|E
