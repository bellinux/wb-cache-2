40|$|Patients often {{perceive}} a detachment of the retina as a deterioration of their visus and/or the reduction <b>of</b> their <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> Whereas the measuring of the visus is an established method {{to assess the}} results in retinal surgery, the assessment <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> is only <b>of</b> minor importance. The present dissertation introduces a method (the quantitative classification <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> (QCFV)) {{that allows us to}} exactly quantify the hand-drawn sketches <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in the patients’ records. This method was used on a collective of patients who underwent retinal surgery 10 years ago, because it could be expected that the data of these patients’ reports kept in the central archive were as complete as possible. Moreover the results of the quantification <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> as an objective method to assess the success when operating retinal detachment were compared to the findings of visus-measuring and to the fundoscopic assessment of the reattachment of the retina. First a method was developed with which the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> could be quantified based on the hand-drawn perimetry sketches in the patients’ reports. The examination of quantitative perimetry with defined, differently configured test-fields proved the method to be reliable. So the method is also suitable for the quantification of the perimetric sketches <b>of</b> the visional <b>field.</b> An exemplary collective of patients was used to prove that the all-over development of visus and the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> following an operation of retinal detachment showed similar tendencies (the visus remained unaltered or improved in 67 % of all cases, the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> expanded in 53 %). Although the development of visus and <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> did not differ when the whole collective was looked at, the development of the visus of individual patients was contrary to that <b>of</b> their <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in more that 25 % of all cases. Therefore the development of visus and that <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> are criteria to be looked at independently with each single patient in order to assess the success of an operation. The results show that the total improvement – or in only a few cases the damage – the patient experiences because of an operation of retinal detachment is not sufficiently described by stating the visus or the fundoscopic results showing the reattachment of the retina. For the patient the discernible changes in his <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> are a criterion to judge the operational success. So the quantification <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> probably makes an important contribution here. In future the evaluation of different parts <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> should be taken into account...|$|R

Another factor in the collision was the subtle limitations on visual perception relating in part to the proximity of the mountain slope not far below both aircraft, requiring both pilots' attention to maintain suitable terrain clearance.|$|E

The image shown is never made up of two completely separate circular images-- rather the director shows us a single figure-eight shaped region made up of information from each eyepiece.) ...|$|E
