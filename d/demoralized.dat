5|$|At sunset {{the central}} armies broke contact and withdrew to their {{original}} positions and both fronts were restored along the lines occupied in the morning. The death of Dairjan {{and the failure of}} Vahan's battle plan left the larger Imperial army relatively <b>demoralized,</b> whereas Khalid's successful counterattacks emboldened his troops despite their being smaller in number.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October Soult's IV Corps fell on Memmingen {{from the}} east. After a minor clash that {{resulted}} in 16 French casualties, General-Major Karl Spangen von Uyternesse surrendered 4,600 soldiers, eight guns, and nine colors. The Austrians were low on ammunition, cut off from Ulm, and completely <b>demoralized</b> by the confusion reigning at army headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The failed Federal assaults of May 19 damaged Union morale, deflating the {{confidence}} the soldiers felt after their string of victories across Mississippi. They were also costly, with casualties of 157 killed, 777 wounded, and 8 missing, versus Confederate casualties of 8 killed and 62 wounded. The Confederates, {{assumed to be}} <b>demoralized,</b> had regained their fighting edge.|$|E

5|$|Around 60,000 former Czar's army troopers {{remained}} {{stationed in}} Finland in January 1918. The soldiers were <b>demoralized</b> and war-weary, and the home-sick, former serfs were thirsty for farmland set free by the revolutions. The {{majority of the}} troops returned to Russia {{by the end of}} March 1918. In total 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian warmen supported the Finnish Reds, but around 4,000, in separate smaller units of 100–1,000 soldiers, could be persuaded to fight in the front line.|$|E
5|$|Corbulo reordered his forces, {{withdrawing}} {{the defeated}} and <b>demoralized</b> IV Scythica and XII Fulminata legions to Syria, leaving X Fretensis to guard Cappadocia, and leading his veteran III Gallica and VI Ferrata to Melitene, where the invasion army {{was to be}} assembled. To these he also added V Macedonica, which had remained in Pontus throughout the previous year and not been tainted by the defeat, the newly arrived XV Apollinaris, and large numbers of auxiliaries and contingents of the client kings.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{joined a}} {{shrunken}} and <b>demoralized</b> Conservative caucus in the House of Commons. The Conservative leader, Robert Manion, {{failed to win}} {{a place in the}} Commons in the election, which saw the Liberals take 181 seats. The Tories sought to be included in a wartime coalition government, but Mackenzie King refused. The House of Commons had only a slight role in the war effort; under the state of emergency, most business was accomplished through the Cabinet issuing Orders in Council.|$|E

5|$|During the four-day offense of Vahan, {{his troops}} {{had failed to}} achieve any {{breakthrough}} and had suffered heavy casualties, especially during the mobile guard's flanking counterattacks. Early on 19 August 636, the fifth day of the battle, Vahan sent an emissary to the Muslim camp for a truce {{for the next few}} days so that fresh negotiations could be held. He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his <b>demoralized</b> troops. But Khalid deemed victory to be in reach and he declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|In December 1917 the Bolsheviks {{were under}} intense {{pressure}} from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and Russia Bolshevism was in crisis, with a <b>demoralized</b> army {{and the fate of}} the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could hold central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and his senate delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.|$|E
5|$|Lucic played minor hockey (VMHA) in Vancouver, {{but nearly}} quit the sport after being passed {{up in the}} 2003 WHL Bantam Draft.

He agreed to play, instead, for the Junior B Delta Ice Hawks, but later played his way onto the Express after five games.|$|E

5|$|Manuel Rodríguez had {{returned}} to Chile before the crossing, and began a guerrilla war in Santiago de Chile against the royalists, {{in support of the}} upcoming army. He was supported in the south {{of the city and the}} countryside. The strategy was to occupy nearby villages, seize the royalists' weapons and flee. The attacks on Melipilla and San Fernando, and a failed one at Curicó, <b>demoralized</b> the royalists.|$|E
5|$|On Carpenter's command, several massive volleys of aimed Spencer repeating rifles hit {{the front}} {{waves of the}} mounted Indians. The volleys {{decimated}} them as if hit by cannon filled with musket balls. A number of warriors, dismounted and using their ponies as bullet breaks, returned fire. Nearly all of these warriors died along with their ponies. Only three warriors made it to within fifty yards of the wagons before their demise. The Indians were so traumatized and <b>demoralized</b> by Carpenter's defense {{that they did not}} renew their attack.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, {{apparently}} {{distressed by}} the imperial approval {{given to the}} actions of Satsuma and Chōshū, fled Osaka aboard the Kaiyō Maru, withdrawing to Edo. <b>Demoralized</b> by his flight and by the betrayal by Yodo and Tsu, Shogunate forces retreated, making the Toba-Fushimi encounter an Imperial victory, although it is often considered the Shogunate forces should have won the encounter. Osaka Castle was soon invested on February 8 (on March 1, Western calendar), {{putting an end to}} the battle of Toba-Fushimi.|$|E

5|$|Saladin {{launched}} his last offensive against Mosul in late 1185, hoping {{for an easy}} victory over a presumably <b>demoralized</b> Mas'ud, but failed due to the city's unexpectedly stiff resistance and a serious illness which caused Saladin to withdraw to Harran. Upon Abbasid encouragement, Saladin and Mas'ud negotiated a treaty in March 1186 that left the Zengids in control of Mosul, but under the obligation to supply the Ayyubids with military support when requested.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that Labyrinth had {{a budget of}} $25 million. The film was a box office disappointment, grossing $12.9 million during its U.S. theatrical run.

It would be the last feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990.|$|E

5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet {{began to}} disengage, with the badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly <b>demoralized</b> forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E
