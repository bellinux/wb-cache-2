2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau found Tench's singing pretentious and the songs tedious: [...] "Despite some superb textures, {{this is as}} sloppy and self-indulgent as ever." [...] Roy Carr, writing in NME, felt that the album [...] "falls into that trap whereby the performance far exceeds the material. Beck hasn't lost any of his fire as he rips off solo after solo with flashy confidence". On the other hand, Rolling Stone magazine's Stephen Davis said that Rough and Ready is [...] "a surprisingly, fine piece of work {{from a man who}} wasn't really expected to come back.

5000|$|In his autobiography, Jones {{apologized to}} readers {{who might be}} {{disappointed}} {{that he had not}} provided more information in his book about his recording sessions because [...] "I've worked so many of them too drunk to walk but not too drunk to sing.

[...] As he later explained to Billboard in 2006, [...] "I would say 90% of the time I would be <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> damn <b>good</b> <b>shape</b> when I went into the studio. I did have a little sense, not a whole lot. But I would still have to have a little build-up of courage, three or four drinks throughout the session time.

5000|$|... "I'll Just Take It Out in Love" [...] is a {{love song}} by George Jones. It rose to #11 when it was {{released}} by Epic Records in 1978. I was written by Bob McDill. The song, which celebrates domestic tranquility, {{could not have been}} more different from what Jones was experiencing in his personal life at the time; the singer was penniless, addicted to alcohol and cocaine, and quickly earning a reputation as the most undependable live performer in show business. However, despite how much he abused himself, his vocal abilities remained stellar. In 2006 he explained to Billboard magazine, [...] "I would say 90% of the time I would be <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> damn <b>good</b> <b>shape</b> when I went into the studio.

60|$|Well, {{by the end}} {{of three}} weeks {{everything}} was <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>shape.</b> The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn't. It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same. But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} Four-Power {{agreement}} {{and the establishment of}} occupation zones in Austria, the Soviets occupied the base until 26 July 1945. The Americans took command of the Base on the 27th. Under United States control, the facility was called Tulln Air Base and was under the command of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE)'s XII Tactical Air Command. Upon the arrival of American troops at Tulln, the cadre found Russian troops billeted on the Base. The field was a mess. The German demolition crews had done their job well. One hangar was <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>shape</b> except for the windows and other minor damage. All others were demolished. Bomber and fighter planes were scattered all over the field and all salvageable parts were removed. The major portion of the Base was blown to rubble, but one barracks, the headquarters building, the vehicle garages and repair shop and a few other buildings were intact. The usable buildings were a mess with rats, vermin, excrement, and bullet holes everywhere. POW SS troops, guarded by the Rainbow Division, were brought in to do the cleaning up of rubble and house keeping duties. The first occupation troops at Tulln were assigned to the 10th and 81st Airdrome Squadrons.|$|E
