5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30. Weather reports had indicated low air pressures over the area for several days. It is relatively rare for {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done so. Only three other tropical cyclones have crossed from the eastern Pacific <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E
5|$|September 4, 1958– Tropical Storm Ella emerges <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> after {{crossing}} Cuba, {{with its}} outer rainbands producing gale force wind gusts in the Florida Keys. The winds uproots a few trees, though damage is minor.|$|E
5|$|August 13, 1971– A {{tropical}} depression strikes Fort Myers, {{turns to the}} northwest <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> intensifies as it turned to the northeast, and moves ashore near Steinhatchee. The depression produces hurricane-force wind gusts at Cedar Key and drops rainfall of over 8inches (203mm), resulting in some coastal flooding.|$|E
5000|$|Two nearby {{lakes in}} Finland are Vesijako (the name Vesijako {{actually}} means [...] "drainage divide") and Lummene in the Finnish Lakeland both drain in two directions: <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Kymijoki basin that drains <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Finland and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Kokemäenjoki basin that drains <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Bothnia.|$|R
5000|$|It {{runs from}} Hanko {{hundreds}} of kilometers to the east. It traps the extensive river and lake systems of Central Finland known as Finnish Lakeland (Järvi-Suomi, [...] "Lake Finland") and forces {{the water to}} flow through few breaches in the ridge. The Vuoksi River flows from lake Saimaa into Lake Ladoga (Laatokka) in Russia. From there the water subsequently flows through river Neva <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Finland, bypassing <b>the</b> Salpausselkä. The Kymi River flows from Päijänne <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Finland. An artificial breach from the Lakeland is the Saimaa Canal, from Saimaa at Lappeenranta <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Finland at Vyborg.|$|R
50|$|The {{north and}} east faces of Mount Willey drain {{directly}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Saco River, thence <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Maine at Saco, Maine.

5|$|October 2, 1969– Tropical Storm Jenny makes {{landfall}} near Fort Myers, {{crosses the}} state, and approaches the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral {{before turning to}} the west-southwest and exiting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> near Tampa. The storm produces heavy rainfall of 5—8inches (127–203mm) across the central region of the state.|$|E
5|$|September 23, 1960– Tropical Depression Florence strikes near Chokoloskee, {{and after}} turning westward near Vero Beach emerges <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> {{before making a}} final {{landfall}} near Pensacola. The storm drops moderate amounts of rainfall, causing localized but minor amounts of damage.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> on July30, the cloud pattern of system quickly became better organized. Later after emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> ships and satellite images confirmed that Tropical Depression Four had formed offshore {{of the north}} coast of the Yucatán Peninsula; although it was likely that the depression formed 80miles (129km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula several hours earlier than confirmed. The following morning after development occurred, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm 575miles (920km) southeast of Texas; the National Hurricane Center assigned it to the name Chantal. Although it became a tropical storm early that morning, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm until a reconnaissance flight confirmed tropical storm force winds about six hours later, when sustained winds were already 50mph (85km/h). Tropical Storm Chantal rapidly strengthened thereafter, with weather satellites indicating t–numbers increasing from 2.5to 3.5within twelve hours using the Dvorak technique. Chantal continued to intensify, and headed northwestward at 11mph (18km/h) due to weak ridging over Florida.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June24, eventually emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> on July7. An {{area of low pressure}} became discernible, and {{with data from}} a reconnaissance aircraft, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on July8. The depression failed to organize appreciably as it tracked west to west-northwest, moving ashore South Padre Island, Texas with winds of 35mph (55km/h) by 14:00UTC that day. The depression degenerated into a remnant low by 06:00UTC on July9 and dissipated over northern Mexico a day later.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía. In July 1772, however, the {{governor}} of Texas heard rumors that English traders were building a settlement {{in the area of}} the Texas coast that had been abandoned. The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, but saw no sign of other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the San Jacinto River emptied into Galveston Bay and not <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E
5|$|Debra's origins {{were from}} an area of {{convection}} over the western Bahamas and Florida related to an upper-tropospheric cold-core low and a tropical wave on July15. Whilst {{under the influence of}} a subtropical ridge–or a belt of high pressure–it slowly meandered southwestward and arrived <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> on July20. A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900EST (0100UTC on July21) which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward. The system's circulation remained indistinct until July23 as winds of 22–30knots consorted with squalls adjacent to the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.|$|E

5|$|Houston {{has four}} major bayous {{passing through the}} city that accept water from the {{extensive}} drainage system. Buffalo Bayou runs through downtown and the Houston Ship Channel, and has three tributaries: White Oak Bayou, which runs through the HoustonHeights community northwest of Downtown and then towards Downtown; Brays Bayou, which runs along the Texas Medical Center; and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of Houston and downtown Houston. The ship channel continues past Galveston and then <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of August 25, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made {{landfall}} as a Category 1 hurricane near the Miami-Dade–Broward county line in southern Florida and weakened into a tropical storm as a result. The next morning, after passing over the state, Tropical Storm Katrina moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> and reintensified back to hurricane strength. As the hurricane passed over the warm waters of the Loop Current, the hurricane began to undergo rapid deepening.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> from {{southern}} Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane watches and warnings for the Gulf Coast of the United States beginning at 13:00 UTC on August 24. After the initial hurricane watch from Mobile, Alabama to Sabine Pass, Texas, the watches and warnings were expanded to eventually include areas from Mobile, Alabama, to Freeport, Texas. All watches and warnings on the Gulf Coast were discontinued late on August 26 after the hurricane moved inland over Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{hurricane}} caused Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to cancel a rally and two fund-raising events in New Orleans. Governor Buddy Roemer issued for the Louisiana National Guard to be on standby for emergency duty. Officials closed several bridges across southeastern Louisiana and also canceled ferry travel across Lake Ponchartrain. In Pensacola, Florida, the Navy base moved the USS Lexington <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> during the hurricane, and also sent more than 100aircraft to a base in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) southeast of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|After exiting Cuba <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the {{hurricane}} weakened greatly. On October20 it passed {{a short distance}} west of Key West, Florida, and very early on October21 {{the hurricane}} moved over Marco Island with winds of 90mph (150km/h). The cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state, deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over Miami. It accelerated east-northeastward, moving over the Abaco Islands in The Bahamas. Gradually weakening, the storm interacted with an approaching cold front; late on October23 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front.|$|E

5|$|Between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC on September10, the United States Weather Bureau issued storm signals, {{equivalent}} to a tropical storm warning in , from Cedar Key, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. These were later upgraded to hurricane warnings in South Florida. Due to inclement weather conditions in West Palm Beach, which had been newly incorporated as a town just days earlier, businesses suspended their normal operations and people boarded up buildings, even as the strongest winds arrived. As the cyclone moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> reports from September 12 through September 14 helped ships prepare for the storm.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{hurricane}} weakened to {{a tropical storm}} again on October 14 as it moved overland, and began to curve north-northwest, restrengthening to a major hurricane by October 17 while it was west-southwest of Cuba. The hurricane made landfall over Cuba {{on the evening of}} October 17. The hurricane passed over southern Florida near Pigeon Key and Downtown Miami on October 18. The hurricane continued traveling north-northwest; however, it was forced to re-curve south-southwest, {{as a result of a}} high-pressure area. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm overland, eventually becoming a tropical depression. The system meandered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> making a final landfall in Central America on October 23.|$|E
5|$|On October9, {{the fifth}} {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} 1910season formed from a tropical disturbance in the extreme southern Caribbean, {{to the north of}} Panama. It tracked steadily northwestward, and attained tropical storm intensity on October 11. It continued to strengthen, and became a hurricane the next day. On October13, the storm was observed to the southwest of Cuba. Early on October 14, the hurricane briefly reached an intensity corresponding to Category 3 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before tracking ashore along the western tip of Cuba. However, it weakened somewhat after crossing the island. Upon emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the hurricane slowed considerably.|$|E
