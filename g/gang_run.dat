2500|$|The {{early years}} of {{organized}} crime in California were marked by the division of various Italian street gangs such as the Black Hand organizations in the early 20th century. The most prominent of these was the Matranga family, a <b>gang</b> <b>run</b> by relatives of Charles Matranga, founder of the New Orleans crime family. Their legitimate business was fruit vending.

Its first leader was Orsario [...] "Sam" [...] Matranga, who started leading the family in 1905.

2500|$|<b>Gang</b> <b>run</b> {{printing}} is {{a method}} in which multiple printing projects are placed on a common paper sheet {{in an effort to}} reduce printing costs and paper waste. Gang runs are generally used with sheet-fed printing presses and CMYK process color jobs, which require four separate plates that are hung on the plate cylinder of the press. [...] Printers use the term [...] "gang run" [...] or [...] "gang" [...] to describe the practice of placing many print projects on the same oversized sheet. Basically, instead of running one postcard that is 4 x 6 as an individual job the printer would place 15 different postcards on 20 x 18 sheet therefore using the same amount of press time the printer will get 15 jobs done in the roughly {{the same amount of time}} as one job.|$|E

60|$|Somebody had to {{do these}} things, since the U. P. R. must reach across to the Pacific. A day would come when a splendid passenger-train would glide {{smoothly}} down this easy grade where Casey jolted along on his gravel-car. The fact loomed large in {{the simplicity of the}} Irishman's mind. He began to hum his favorite song. Facing westward, he saw the black dot grow into a long train. Likewise he saw the beauty of the red-gold sunset behind the hills. Casey gloried in the wildness of the scene--in the meaning of his ride--particularly in his loneliness. He seemed strangely alone there on that vast gray slope--a man and somehow accountable for all these things. He felt more than he understood. His long-tried nerves and courage and strength had never yielded this wonderful buoyancy and sense of loftiness. He was Casey--Casey who had let all the <b>gang</b> <b>run</b> for shelter from the Sioux while he had remained for one last and final drive at a railroad spike. But the cool, devil-may-care indifference, common to all his comrades as well as to himself, was not the strongest factor in the Casey of to-day. Up out of the rugged and dormant soul had burst the spirit of a race embodied in one man. Casey was his own audience, and the light upon him was the glory of the setting sun. A nightingale sang in his heart, and he realized that this was his hour. Here the bloody, hard years found their reward. Not that he had ever wanted one or thought of one, but it had come--out of the toil, the pain, the weariness. So his nerves tingled, his pulses beat, his veins glowed, his heart throbbed; and all the new, sweet, young sensations of a boy wildly reveling in the success of his first great venture, all the vague, strange, deep, complex emotions {{of a man who has}} become conscious of what he is giving to the world--these shook Casey by storm, and life had no more to give. He knew that, whatever he was, whatever this incomprehensible driving spirit in him, whatever his unknown relation to man and to duty, there had been given him in the peril just passed, in this wonderful ride, a gift splendid and divine.|$|E
