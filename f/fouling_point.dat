40|$|In {{this paper}} a first time attempt has beenmade tomeasure the lowstrain shearmodulus of clean and fouled ballast using a seismic survey ofMulti-channel Analysis of SurfaceWave (MASW). Amodel rail track was built with nine sub-sections, each having {{different}} fouling characteristics. MASWsurveywas {{performed in the}} top of each section of ballast and shear wave velocitywas measured. The shearmodulus of ballast fouled by pulverized rock, clayey sand and coal was calculated by using shear wave velocities and densities of each section and presented. The optimum and critical fouling points are defined considering the shear stiffness and drainage criteria for ballast fouled by clayey sand and coal. In both cases the shear stiffness increased to amaximumand then decreased as the percentage of fouling increased. The degree of fouling corresponding to themaximumshearwave velocity is defined as the optimum <b>fouling</b> <b>point.</b> After a particular degree of fouling the shear stiffness decreased less than clean ballast and the corresponding drainage condition become unacceptable. This point is defined as the critical <b>fouling</b> <b>point.</b> The results obtained from the model track were compared with the field data...|$|E
40|$|Ballast fouling {{is created}} by the {{breakdown}} of aggregates or outside contamination by coal dust from coal trains, or from soil intrusion beneath rail track. Due to ballast fouling, the conditions of rail track can be deteriorated considerably {{depending on the type}} of fouling material and the degree of fouling. So far there is no comprehensive guideline available to identify the critical degree of fouling for different types of fouling materials. This paper presents the identification of degree of fouling and types of fouling using non-destructive testing, namely seismic surface-wave and ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey. To understand this, a model rail track with different degree of fouling has been constructed in Civil engineering laboratory, University of Wollongong, Australia. Shear wave velocity obtained from seismic survey has been employed to identify the degree of fouling and types of fouling material. It is found that shear wave velocity of fouled ballast increases initially, reaches optimum <b>fouling</b> <b>point</b> (OFP), and decreases when the fouling increases. The degree of fouling corresponding after which the shear wave velocity of fouled ballast will be smaller than that of clean ballast is called the critical <b>fouling</b> <b>point</b> (CFP). Ground penetrating radar with four different ground coupled antennas (500 MHz, 800 MHz, 1. 6 GHz and 2. 3 GHz) was also used to identify the ballast fouling condition. It is found that the 800 MHz ground coupled antenna gives a better signal in assessing the ballast fouling condition. Seismic survey is relatively slow when compared to GPR survey however it gives quantifiable results. In contrast, GPR survey is faster and better in estimating the depth of fouling.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of track foundation material gradually decreases due to insufficient lateral confinement, ballast fouling, {{and loss of}} shear strength of the subsurface soil under cyclic loading. This paper presents characterization of rail track subsurface to identify ballast fouling and subsurface layers shear wave velocity using seismic survey. Seismic surface wave method of multi-channel analysis of surface wave (MASW) {{has been carried out}} in the model track and field track for finding out shear wave velocity of the clean and fouled ballast and track subsurface. The shear wave velocity (SWV) of fouled ballast increases with increase in fouling percentage, and reaches a maximum value and then decreases. This character is similar to typical compaction curve of soil, which is used to define optimum and critical fouling percentage (OFP and CFP). Critical fouling percentage of 15 % is noticed for Coal fouled ballast and 25 % is noticed for clayey sand fouled ballast. Coal fouled ballast reaches the OFP and CFP before clayey sand fouled ballast. Fouling of ballast reduces voids in ballast and there by decreases the drainage. Combined plot of permeability and SWV with percentage of fouling shows that after critical <b>fouling</b> <b>point</b> drainage condition of fouled ballast goes below acceptable limit. Shear wave velocities are measured in the selected location in the Wollongong field track by carrying out similar seismic survey. In-situ samples were collected and degrees of fouling were measured. Field SWV values are more than that of the model track SWV values for the same degree of fouling, which might be due to sleeperâ€™s confinement. This article also highlights the ballast gradation widely followed in different countries and presents the comparison of Indian ballast gradation with international gradation standards. Indian ballast contains a coarser particle size when compared to other countries. The upper limit of Indian gradation curve matches with lower limit of ballast gradation curves of America and Australia. The ballast gradation followed by Indian railways is poorly graded and more favorable for the drainage conditions. Indian ballast engineering needs extensive research to improve presents track conditions...|$|E
