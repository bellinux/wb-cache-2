In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi work out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. Hitachi also improves the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (Super IPS). NEC and Hitachi become early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time.

40|$|Glasses {{comprising}} {{well known}} ferroelectric crystalline phases {{have been a}} subject of curious investigation {{from the point of}} view of exploiting these composites for dielectric, pyroelectric, ferroelectric, <b>electro</b> and non-linear <b>optical</b> devices. Transparent glass-ceramics containing ferroelectric crystallites at nano scale have been of much interest owing to their promising physical properties. The advantages that are associated with glass - ceramics include very low levels of porosity and hence high break down voltages. It is of our interest to nanocrystallize Aurivillius family of ferroelectric oxides and tetragonal tungsten bronzes on borate and tellurite based glass matrices and demonstrate their promising optical and nonlinear optical properties. Apart from the above, the nanocrystallites of well known ferroelectric material LiNbO 3 was grown in a reactive glass matrix. These nanocrystals of LiNbO 3 exhibited intense second harmonic signals in transmission mode when exposed to IR light at 1064 nm. The most interesting result was the demonstration of optical diffraction of the second harmonic signals which was attributed to the presence of self- organized sub-micrometer sized LiNbO 3 crystallites that were indeed inscribed by the IR laser light which was used to probe in the NLO property of these materials...|$|R

The combination of optical actuators and micromachined silicon technology arise possibilities to realize equipment in high volumes for reasonable prices, that have formerly been expensive laboratory equipment. This paper reports on the performance and applications of a spectrometer in MOEMS technology. It {{is based on a}} scanning mirror chip with a grating structure on top. Thus a spectrometer with selectable wavelength range was realized. The resolution is not limited by line width of a multisensor detector, as it is the case for state of the art low cost spectrometers. A single detector is used, cheaper than arrays and available for all wavelength ranges. The setup can be small and light, the grating withstands shocks and vibration much better than a classical spectrometer. The grating moves with a frequency of 500 Hz respectively 1000 Hz, a whole spectrum is acquired within milliseconds. The resolution is given by the grating line density and the spectrometer dimensions, as it is valid for every single detector spectrometer. Depending on the number of systems built, a price of the system can be expected significantly below those of low cost systems with fixed grating. Many possibilities arise in every application where light is analyzed spectroscopically...|$|R
40|$|An optical {{navigation}} system is being flown as the backup {{system to the}} primary Deep Space Network telemetry for navigation and guidance purposes on Orion. This is required to ensure Orion can recover from a loss of communication, which would simultaneously cause a loss of DSN telemetry. Images taken of the Moon and Earth are used to give range and position information to the navigation computer for trajectory calculations and maneuver execution. To get telemetry data from these images, the size and location of the moon need to be calculated with high accuracy and precision. The reentry envelope for the Orion EM- 1 mission requires the centroid and radius of the moon images to be determined within 1 / 3 of a pixel 3 sigma. In order to ensure this accuracy and precision can be attained, I was tasked with building precise dot grid images for camera calibration as well as building a {{hardware in the loop}} test stand for flight software and hardware proofing. To calibrate the Op-Nav camera a dot grid is imaged with the camera, the error between the image dot location and the actual dot location can be used to build a distortion map of the camera and lens system so that images can be fixed to display truth locations. To build the dot grid images I used the <b>Electro</b> Optics Lab <b>optical</b> bench Bright Object Simulator System, and gimbal. The gimbal was slewed to a series of elevations and azimuths. An image of the collimated single point light source was then taken at each position. After a series of 99 images were taken at different locations the single light spots were extracted from each image and added to a composite image containing all 99 points. During the development of these grids it was noticed that an intermittent error in the artificial "star" locations occurred. Prior to the summer this error was attributed to the gimbal having glitches in it's pointing direction and was going to be replaced, however after further examining the issue I determined it to be a software issue. I have since narrowed the likely source of the error down to a Software Development Kit released by the camera supplier PixeLink. I have since developed a workaround in order to build star grids for calibration until the software bug can be isolated and fixed. I was also tasked with building a Hardware in the Loop test stand in order to test the full Op-Nav system. A 4 k screen displays simulated Lunar and Terrestrial images from a possible Orion trajectory. These images are then projected through a collimator and then captured with an Op-Nav camera controlled by an Intel NUC computer running flight software. The flight software then analyzes the images to determine attitude and position, this data is then reconstructed into a trajectory and matched to the simulated trajectory {{in order to determine the}} accuracy of the attitude and position estimates. In order for the system to work it needs to be precisely and accurately aligned. I developed an alignment procedure that allows the screen, collimator and camera to be squared, centered and collinear with each other within a micron spatially and 5 arcseconds in rotation. I also designed a rigid mount for the screen that was machined on site in Building 10 by another intern. While I was working in the EOL we received a $ 500 k Orion startracker for alignment procedure testing. Due to my prior experience in electronics development, as an ancillary duty, I was tasked with building the cables required to operate and power the startracker. If any errors are made building these cables the startracker would be destroyed, I was honored that the director of the lab entrusted such a critical component with me. This internship has cemented my view on public space exploration. I always preferred public sector to privatization because, as a scientist, the most interesting aspects of space for me are not necessarily the most profitable. I was concerned that the public sector was faltering however, and that in order to improve human space exploration I would be forced into private sector. I now know that, at least at JSC, human spaceflight is still progressing, and exciting work is still being done. I am now actively seeking employment at JSC after I complete my Ph. D and have met with my branch chiefs and mentor to discuss transitioning to a grad Co-op position...|$|R
