Organic reds were probably present in many works but can normally only be inferred from the lack of <b>detectable</b> <b>elements</b> such as lead, iron or mercury by XRF analysis and from careful visual and, sometimes, ultraviolet examination. Visually, organic reds tended to be added on top of other colors and they appear more transparent and glassier. Higher percentages of red lead give a more orange color, vermilion and organic reds give a darker or pinker red, and hematite gives a browner tint.

We introduce Segment Linking (SegLink), an oriented text detection method. The main idea is to decompose text into two locally <b>detectable</b> <b>elements,</b> namely segments and links. A segment is an oriented box covering {{a part of a}} word or text line; A link connects two adjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same word or text line. Both elements are detected densely at multiple scales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional neural network. Final detections are produced by combining segments connected by links. Compared with previous methods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of accuracy, speed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of 75. 0 % on the standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) benchmark, outperforming the previous best by a large margin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512 x 512 images.

40|$|We present {{high-resolution}} Magellan/MIKE {{spectra of}} the four brightest confirmed red giant stars in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Bootes II (Boo II). These stars all inhabit the metal-poor tail of the Boo II metallicity distribution function. The chemical abundance pattern of all <b>detectable</b> <b>elements</b> in these stars is consistent {{with that of the}} Galactic halo. However, all four stars have undetectable amounts of neutron-capture elements Sr and Ba, with upper limits comparable to the lowest ever detected in the halo or in other dwarf galaxies. One star exhibits significant radial velocity variations over time, suggesting it to be in a binary system. Its variable velocity has likely increased past determinations of the Boo II velocity dispersion. Our four stars span a limited metallicity range, but their enhanced Î±-abundances and low neutron-capture abundances are consistent with the interpretation that Boo II has been enriched by very few generations of stars. The chemical abundance pattern in Boo II confirms the emerging trend that the faintest dwarf galaxies have neutron-capture abundances distinct from the halo, suggesting the dominant source of neutron-capture elements in halo stars may be different than in ultra-faint dwarfs.

40|$|We {{present a}} new type of {{wavelength}} dispersive x-ray spectrometer with a multi-capillary x-ray lens. This spectrometer has a simple and compact construction with good performance for small area analysis. A multi-capillary x-ray lens, a device that collects fluorescent x-rays from a selected sample area of diameter 0. 1 mm or less and collimates them into a nearly-parallel beam form, was combined with conventional flat crystals. The flat crystal and an x-ray detector were set on a 8 -B simple goniometer. The result of [Cu K-emission source / LiF flat crystal / Fe Ka line from stainless sheet sample] is as follows: the Fe KQ! intensity from a,O. l mm area is 130 times higher than a conventional XKF spectrometer and the intensity from a 0. 05 mm is 270 times higher. The FWHM of the FeKd line is 0. 012 A. These results indicate solid feasibility of a very small, simple-construction, easy-to-handle and high-sensitivity spectrometer. In addition, this spectrometer has several merits; 1) the number of simultaneously <b>detectable</b> <b>elements</b> is increased, 2) the influence of the surface roughness on measurements is very small because all elements are detected under the same conditions with respect to the x-ray take off angle, 3) it should be easy to adapt the spectrometer to PXKF, EPMA and SEM. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} vision-based method for instant global {{localization}} from a given aerial image. The approach mimics how humans localize themselves on maps using spatial layout of semantic elements on the map. Unlike other matching and localization methods that use visual appearance or feature matching, our method relies on robust and consistently <b>detectable</b> semantic <b>elements</b> that are invariant to illumination, temporal variations and occlusions. We use the buildings on the map and on the given aerial query image as our semantic elements. Spatial relations between these elements are efficiently stored and queried under a hierarchical semantic version of the Geometric Hashing algorithm that is inherently rotation and scale invariant. We also present a method to obtain building locations from a given query image using image classification and processing techniques. Overall this approach provides fast and robust localization over large areas.

The difficulty in recovering null mutations in Tpl suggests that it may be a complex locus, perhaps consisting of several genes with redundant functions.

40|$|A {{study of}} the mineralogical and {{chemical}} composition of recent sediments of the Niger delta, Nigeria was undertaken to provide baseline geochemical data and to relate these data to soil fertility, erosion and engineering problems. The mineralogical composition shows that three areas are distinguished: (1) a large kaolinite-quartz zone; (2) restricted kaolinite-beidellite zone; and (3) a highly restricted metastable smectite zone mainly montmorillonite and nontronite. The mineralogy is interpreted as functions of stability, groundwater flow rates, permeability and sea water incursion. Type 1 occupies the dynamic {{central part of the}} delta where permeability exceeds 1 Darcy, with rainfall averaging 6. 8 m yr(2 Ì 7 - 1) and little seawater influence. Gibbsite and goethite are also present.;The kaolinite-beidellite type occur near to the stable eastern part of the Niger delta. The permeability is about 0. 1 Darcy, seawater influence is high while weathering of young volcanics of unknown composition to the north-east contributes to the smectite composition. The third type occurs along the coastal areas and close to the rivers in the southwest. They are interpreted as metastable phases in the reactions between silica and kaolinite.;Chemical composition of the sediments suggests extreme leaching of cations. Silica and alumina are the major residual chemical components. Detectable cations occur mainly in the smectite-rich sediments {{in the eastern part of}} the delta. Trace element chemistry show less depletion. However the heavy mineral analyses show that most of the <b>detectable</b> <b>elements</b> reside in the most insoluble heavy minerals.

Salt-water effect on the chemical composition of the waters is evident in the same south-west and eastern part of the delta where the clay mineralogy is also influenced.;Textural and physical characteristics show that rapid loss of interparticle cohesion occurs in the delta soils upon saturation.

The current water depth varies from 0. 5 - 1. 3 m, versus the original 2 - 3 m depth. The Mulambin area has recently seen residential and other developments. The sedimentation rates in the lake were estimated recently at 1000 m 3 /y transported into the lake by tidal currents and 1500 m 3 /y from the catchment. 	 This study aimed to determine metal concentrations in Causeway Lake sediments using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and the k 0 -method of standardisation, and to assess the sediment quality using the ANZECC sediment quality guidelines. NAA is attractive because of its minimal sample preparation requirements and multi-element detection capability; furthermore a single monitor is sufficient for the k 0 -method to determine the concentration of all <b>detectable</b> <b>elements</b> in a sample. To check {{the reliability of the}} k 0 -NAA method, BCSS- 1 (estuarine) and PACS- 2 (marine) certified sediment reference materials were analysed. The k 0 -NAA anlyses of the Causeway Lake sediments were also compared with ICP-OES or ICP-MS analyses. The study used the new 20 MW OPAL research reactor operated by ANSTO. At the INAA irradiation positions used the neutron flux was around 1. 5 Ã 1013 cm- 2 s- 1 and was well thermalised (thermal/epithermal flux ratio > 1000). Irradiations were carried out in both the short and long residence time facilities to maximise the number of quantifiable elements. The neutron flux monitor for k 0 -NAA was the reference material IRMM- 530 R which contained 0. 1 % gold. Gamma-ray spectra were analysed using HyperLab and elemental concentrations calculated using Kayzero for Windows. The ratios of the k 0 -NAA data to the reference sedimentsâ certified values were generally 0. 9 - 1. 1 indicating reliability of the method. At least 30 elements (excluding Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb, but including rare earths) were detected in the Causeway Lake sediments. However only eight elements were compared because of the limited ICP-OES/ICP-MS dataset.

Current search methods are derived from archaeology, geology, botany, geography and taphonomy. However, there is limited testing of search techniques, particularly over graves containing human bodies, and few studies that have examined the appearance of gravesites over several years. In {{the absence of such}} studies in Australia, eight shallow burials (six animal graves, two human graves) and one calibration pit were established in South Australia to provide information about the physical properties of graves and the effectiveness of burial site location techniques. The findings provide descriptive information about the surface appearance of graves over six years, the chemical elements remaining in the upper levels of grave soil and the practical implications of using geophysical instruments to search for buried human remains in typical forensic cases in South Australian landscapes. Key surface indicators identified included ongoing faunal scavenging, soil surface differences, absence of moss, absence of vegetation in dry periods, the slow return of ground debris, and the formation of depressions. These were not all associated with the presence of a body but could be related to disturbance of the ground surface. There was a relationship between surface indicators and seasonal conditions and the position of the gravesites in relation to surrounding landscape features, in particular, trees. Higher levels of certain soil elements at the upper surface layer at the gravesites were identifiable after several years of burial; in particular, calcium and magnesium were identifiable at the human body and kangaroo gravesites. Ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity and electromagnetic induction were used to survey the gravesites. Ground penetrating radar provided the most significant results in terms of anomalies compared to the surrounds. However, use of these instruments highlighted the potential of overlooking gravesites due to lack of definitive survey data, the impact of seasonal conditions and the problems associated with using the instruments in some burial areas. Comparison of these findings is made with other international studies. Electrical resistivity surveying was successfully used to locate a 150 year old burial. A national survey on body location techniques used by police investigators in a seven year period was conducted, demonstrating a limited reported success in and use of search techniques other than ground search, implying a need to develop more reliable techniques for clandestine grave location. The results provide previously unavailable information about the surface appearance of gravesites, <b>detectable</b> <b>elements</b> in grave soil and the use of geophysical survey instruments for this purpose in South Australia.

Patterned UV photo-polymerization is used to prepare polymer gratings from a mixture of two acrylate monomers. A 3 MeV proton microprobe is used to study these gratings, prepared from two different monomers, each containing a different easily <b>detectable</b> label <b>element,</b> e. g. Cl, Si or F. During the preparation process, the difference in reactivity and mobility of these two monomers in combination with polymerâmonomer interaction results in diffusion of monomers. Since this diffusion process takes place on length scales of micrometers, a scanning ion microprobe is {{a powerful tool for}} the quantitative analysis of the polymer films, obtained after complete polymerization. The microprobe is equipped with PIXE, PIGE and RBS, to quantify both the label elements and C and O. This makes it possible to determine the concentration of monomer units as a function of position and thus to study the diffusion process. Two combinations of different monomers are studied. In the case of a 0. 5 : 1 mixture of a monofunctional and a difunctional monomer, both monomers migrate to the illuminated areas and large thickness variations are observed. When a 1 : 1 mixture of two difunctional monomers is used, opposite migration of the two monomers is observed, while the film shows no variation in thickness...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{critics of}} the genre, Di Lauro and Rabkin, argued that the male {{performers}} in stag films are also objectified {{and that they are}} even less humanized than the women who are the focus of attention because [...] "as performers men are not visible in their full humanity." [...] Williams describes this defense of pornography as sounding familiar saying [...] "like most such defenses, it ignores the larger power structure in which the presumably equalized dehumanization and objectification occur." [...] Drawing from art critic John Berger's studies on traditions in European art of oil paintings of nudes, Williams argues that the real subject of stag films {{is in the eye of}} the beholder. The point of view always comes from the phallus in stag film, Williams contends, making the predominant address to men only, and Williams argues that is where the power lies. Moreover, it is argued, there are <b>detectable</b> misogynist <b>elements</b> established early in this genre which inflect the more idealizing and fetishizing representations of female genitalia. The act of collectively getting together to get aroused at the spectacles of these hard core representations of sexual acts, is what film theorist Thomas Waugh describes as [...] "re-enacting some of the basic structural dynamics of the patriarchy, namely, the male exchange in women, in this case the exchange in fantasies and images of women".|$|R
30|$|The organic red(s) {{present in}} the {{manuscript}} could not be identified, but their presence was inferred from microscopic observation of the red colorants {{and the lack of}} characteristic <b>elements</b> <b>detectable</b> by XRF, except Al. In all cases, the attempted Raman analysis of organic red colorants yielded no further information due to the overwhelming fluorescence of the organic red itself. When examined with ultraviolet light, no visible fluorescence was observed, suggesting that the organic red colorant was unlikely to be madder. Spectra for the pigments vermilion and red lead are reproduced in Fig.Â  16. Similarly, no organic yellow(s) were identified {{due to the lack of}} characteristic elements detected by XRF analysis and no identifiable peaks in the Raman spectra. Identification of organic yellows typically involves sampling for analysis by chromatography mass spectrometry, which was not possible for this manuscript.|$|R
40|$|Formation of homo-interpenetrating polymer {{networks}} (homo-IPNs) of poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) {{and their}} capacity for calcification are investigated. A sequential method is established to generate IPNs of rank I and II, containing {{two or three}} crosslinked networks. Although the networks are chemically identical, thermo-mechanical analysis (DSC, DMA) suggests some phase separation. Calcification of PHEMA hydrogels, thought {{to be controlled by}} the free volume pathways accessible to calcium ions, is investigated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and experimental calcium deposition. While calcium uptake is reduced in IPNs, the size of the free volume elements estimated by PALS remain constant at radii of 2. 6 Ã (dry) and 2. 9 Ã (hydrated), both in PHEMA and IPNs. The reduction of calcium uptake cannot be therefore associated with the size reduction of the angstrom-size free volume <b>elements</b> <b>detectable</b> by PALS, and is attributed to the effect of chain packing on pores too large to be detected by PALS...|$|R
40|$|Trace {{elements}} and their concentrations {{play an important}} role in both chemical and physical properties of bitumen. Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) has been applied to determine the concentration of trace elements in bitumen. This method requires irradiation of the material with neutrons that transform the elements into radioactive isotopes. By analyzing the activity of the individual nuclides, the concentration of each <b>detectable</b> trace <b>element</b> can be determined with high precision. In this work, we perform trace elemental analyses of 13 distinct bitumens, including 2 modified and 3 bitumens from the material library of Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP. Three elements, vanadium, nickel and cobalt are found to be present in all bitumens. Vanadium and nickel are found to be the most abundant among all the elements detected. Next to vanadium and nickel, significant concentrations of iron are found in 11 bitumens. The total number of trace elements identified varied from 17 to 28 for the bitumens studied. For modified bitumens, the concentration of trace elements is used as a parameter to measure the extent of modification. The sum of most abundant trace elements (vanadium and nickel) correlates well with the sulphur and asphaltene contents of the same bitumen. Moreover, the concentration of the latter metals are known to be an indicator for the aging characteristics of bitumen. Thus, INAA provides the content of trace elements in bitumen, where the concentrations vary (ppm to ppb) depending on the crude origin of the material. Thus, INAA can be used to trace back the crude origin of the material, which may have applications in the field of asphalt recycling (RAP and RAS) ...|$|R
30|$|Carbon black, if pure, {{should be}} {{deprived}} of <b>elements</b> <b>detectable</b> by EDXRF analysis; on the contrary, it is very absorbent of infrared radiation so that the infrared image obtained by IR reflectography can make its presence visible. Reflectography is widely used on painting for under-drawing examination. For this reason, there is a deep knowledge of the response of black painting media. We performed long wave infrared reflectography (with sensitivity ranging 1000 â 2500 Â nm) because, in this range of wavelength, carbon black pigments are strong absorber while iron-gallic ink are transparent [10]. There are some other materials, such as hematite (iron oxide) which have instead an intermediate behaviour at these wavelengths. The iron-gallic dyes, {{on the basis of}} the ancient recipes, were produced by mixing vegetal extracts (tannins obtained by gall-nuts) with inorganic salts (mainly vitriols, nominally iron sulphates with other metal sulphates such manganese, copper, zinc, lead and others). For this reason, this kind of pigments is very well characterized by EDXRF analysis, but it is transparent to IR radiation.|$|R
