I came up even as the seneschal's archers were tying him up, and I gave him my fore-word that I would bide with him until he had passed.

It was mentally that he suffered. His was one of those just-as-good cheap-substitute minds, incapable of harbouring more than one idea at a time, and during those sixty days of quiet seclusion it was filled with an ever-growing resentment against Officer Keating. Every day, as he moved about his appointed tasks, he brooded on his wrongs. Every night was to him but the end of another day that kept him from settling down to the serious business of Revenge. To be haled to prison for correcting a private enemy with a sand-bag--that was what stung. In the privacy of his cell he dwelt unceasingly on the necessity for revenge. The thing began to take on to him the aspect almost of a <b>Holy</b> <b>Mission,</b> a sort of Crusade.|$|E

60|$|She {{opened her}} {{window and looked}} out. The moon, a great silver dome, was {{uplifting}} itself from a bluish-gray level, which she knew was the distant plain of wheat. Somewhere in its midst appeared a dull star, at times brightening as if blown upon or drawn upwards in a comet-like trail. By some odd instinct she {{felt that it was}} the solitary forge of the young inventor, and pictured him standing before it with his abstracted hazel eyes and a face more begrimed in the moonlight than ever. When DID he wash himself? Perhaps not until Sunday. How lonely it must be out there! She slightly shivered and turned from the window. As she did so, {{it seemed to her that}} something knocked against her door from without. Opening it quickly, she was almost certain that the sound of a rustling skirt retreated along the passage. It was very late; perhaps she had disturbed the house by shutting her window. No doubt it was the motherly interest of Mrs. Randolph that impelled her to come softly and look after her; and for once her simple surmises were correct. For not only the inspecting eyes of her hostess, but the amatory glances of the youthful Emile, had been fastened upon her window until the light disappeared, and even the <b>Holy</b> <b>Mission</b> Church of San Jose had assured itself of the dear child's safety with a large and supple ear at her keyhole.|$|E
6000|$|Personally, I must {{plead guilty}} to what I know is by many, {{especially}} {{by those who are}} attached to the Boer cause, considered as folly if not worse, namely, a sufficient interest in the natives, and sympathy with their sufferings to bring me to the conclusion, that in acting thus we have inflicted a cruel injustice upon them. It seems to me, that as they were the original owners of the soil, they were entitled to some consideration in the question of its disposal, and consequently and incidentally, of their own. I am aware that it is generally considered that the white man has a right to the black man's possessions and land, and that it is his high and <b>holy</b> <b>mission</b> to exterminate the wretched native and take his place. But with this conclusion I venture to differ. So far as my own experience of natives has gone, I have found that in all the essential qualities of mind and body, they very much resemble white men, with the exception that they are, as a race, quicker-witted, more honest, and braver, than the ordinary run of white men. Of them might be aptly quoted the speech Shakespeare puts into Shylock's mouth: [...] "Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?" [...] In the same way I ask, Has a native no feelings or affections? does he not suffer when his parents are shot, or his children stolen, or when he is driven a wanderer from his home? Does he not know fear, feel pain, affection, hate and gratitude? Most certainly he does; and this being so, I cannot believe that the Almighty, who made both white and black, gave to the one race the right or mission of exterminating, or even of robbing or maltreating the other, and calling the process the advance of civilisation. It seems to me, that on only one condition, if at all, have we the right to take the black man's land; and that is, that we provide them with an equal and a just Government, and allow no maltreatment of them, either as individuals or tribes: but, on the contrary, do our best to elevate them, and wean them from savage customs. Otherwise, the practice is surely undefensible.|$|E

5000|$|This cross can {{be found}} at the road {{starting}} at the back of the village, at the first turn after the entrance to the cemetery. It is a simple iron cross where [...] "1965" [...] can be read, without the [...] "1" [...] that is broken. Its construction can be attributed to the [...] "Holy Missions" [...] ("Santes Missions") celebrated after the Spanish Civil War. Several testimonies in the form of crosses and monuments {{can be found}} at different cities and villages across Catalonia. Some of these crosses have been catalogued as symbols from the Franco dictatorship. The main goal of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Missions</b> was to reinforce the Catholic faith, and they received the support of the Franco regime, like for instance the <b>holy</b> <b>missions</b> celebrated in Artesa de Segre in 1964, conducted by Claretian priests. Several activities were performed led by missionaries, lasting between one and three days, including ways of the cross, messes and processions. As a reminder of the celebration, they would construct a cross at some relevant place of the village, like the one that can be found in Montargull.|$|R
