60|$|Captain Hagar {{was a quiet}} man, and in no way a fighter, but now {{he seemed}} imbued with a {{reckless}} courage; and without thinking {{of the danger of}} exposing himself to pistol or to rifle, he laid the nozzle of his hose over the rail and directed it down upon the deck below. As soon as the hot steam began to pour upon the astonished pirates there were yells and execrations, and when another scalding jet came in upon them over the <b>forward</b> <b>bulwarks</b> of the Monterey, the confusion became greater on the pirate ship.|$|R
60|$|Except {{that the}} clouds were {{somewhat}} more broken, {{there was no}} change. Dark masses of vapour flew overhead, torn and ragged. The wild tumble of waves rose and fell, without order or regularity. <b>Forward,</b> the <b>bulwark</b> on both bows had been carried away, and the deck was swept clear of every movable object.|$|R
50|$|Having ground {{broken in}} the 11th or 12th century {{originally}} as Slavic enceinte positioned {{on the western}} fringe, fort-post {{was on top of}} 400 metre high Castle Hill. It comprised considerably smaller dimensions comparatively to modern encompassing ragged outline. Facing <b>forward</b> stone <b>bulwark</b> plummeted two meters down turning into convoluted mirroring shaped to the crag drop-off.|$|R
50|$|The Short House-type had {{a shorter}} main deck {{house with a}} trunk style house over the engine room, with raised <b>bulwarks</b> <b>forward</b> and aft. They were powered by a 6-cylinder diesel engine built by the Enterprise Engine & Foundry Company, San Francisco.|$|R
50|$|The deck layout {{is geared}} towards ocean sailing, with wide side decks giving easy access <b>forwards,</b> and high <b>bulwarks</b> with high lifelines for safety. The cockpit is very small; this helps seaworthiness, as {{the weight of}} water which can be loaded onto the boat by a wave is limited. However, comfort in the cockpit is not helped.|$|R
50|$|Chicora {{went missing}} on Lake Michigan January 1895 with a cargo of flour. Portions of {{wreckage}} of the missing vessel-consisting of the Port side and <b>forward</b> upper <b>bulwarks</b> 5 ft wide and 12 ft long along with the passenger gangway were found a mile on the ice near South Haven, Michigan. Pieces of wreckage are also reported to have been found. In April 1895 it was reported wreckage was coming ashore at New Buffalo, Michigan. On 19 April 1895 a witness claimed to have seen the Chicora stern down and bow up in the lake between South Haven and Saugatuck, Michigan, on 23 January 1895.|$|R
60|$|Before {{morning the}} yard was in its place and the sail set and, except for the {{shortened}} mizzen, and a ragged hole through the <b>bulwark,</b> <b>forward,</b> the polacre {{showed no signs of}} the engagement of the evening before. Two or three men were slung over the stern of the brig; plugs had been driven through the shot holes and, over these, patches of canvas were nailed, and painted black.|$|R
60|$|The men {{sprang to}} their feet with alacrity {{when they heard the}} news. Another hawser was brought up and firmly spliced to the one in use just beyond the <b>bulwark</b> <b>forward.</b> Then it was led along outside the shrouds and {{fastened}} to the bitts astern and then to the mizzen-mast. This done, the first hawser was cut at the <b>bulwark</b> <b>forward,</b> and the ship swung round almost instantly. As soon as she headed dead for shore the raffle that had so long served for their floating anchor was cut adrift and the try-sail was hoisted on the stump of the foremast, and with six good men at the wheel the vessel surged shorewards under the force of the gale, every man on board holding his breath. The opening was but a shipâ€™s-length across, but driven by the wind and steered with the greatest care the Furious shot into it as quickly and as surely as if she were propelled with oars. A great shout of relief burst from the whole crew when, after proceeding for a hundred yards along a narrow channel, the passage suddenly widened out into a pool {{a quarter of a mile}} across.|$|R
60|$|Lister {{thought about}} the men on board the hulk. Two, buffeted by wind and spray, must hold the wheel on the short quarter-deck that lifted them above {{the shelter of the}} <b>bulwarks.</b> <b>Forward</b> of this, the water rolled about, washing on board and pouring out. The men could not for a moment slack their watchfulness. Sweating and {{straining}} at the spokes, they must hold her straight. To let her sheer when she crossed a comber's top would break the rope.|$|R
60|$|Kitty gave {{a cry of}} alarm, and {{the next}} instant the colonel had {{relieved}} Mr. Arbuton. It was a scene, and nothing could have annoyed him more than this tumult which poor Mrs. Ellison's misfortune occasioned among the bystanding habitans and deck-hands, and the passengers eagerly craning <b>forward</b> over the <b>bulwarks,</b> and running ashore {{to see what the}} matter was. Few men know just how to offer those little offices of helpfulness which such emergencies demand, and Mr. Arbuton could do nothing after he was rid of his burden; he hovered anxiously and uselessly about, while Mrs. Ellison was carried to an airy position on the bow of the boat, where in a few minutes he had the great satisfaction of seeing her open her eyes. It was not the moment for him to speak, and he walked somewhat guiltily away with the dispersing crowd.|$|R
60|$|This {{movement}} {{was a signal}} to the Arabs, who poured down on both reefs in hundreds, screaming and gesticulating like maniacs. It required good nerves and some self-reliance to advance {{in the face of such}} a danger, and this so much the more, as the barbarians showed themselves in the greatest force on the northern range of rocks, which offered a good shelter for their persons, completely raked the channel, and, moreover, lay so near the spot where the kedge had been dropped, that one might have jerked a stone from the one to the other. To add to the awkwardness of the affair, the Arabs began to fire with those muskets that are of so little service in close encounters, but which are notorious for sending their shot with great precision from a distance. The bullets came thick upon the ship, though the stoutness of the <b>bulwarks</b> <b>forward,</b> and their height, as yet protected the men.|$|R
60|$|The cabman had no {{difficulty}} {{in finding the}} Parthia, which {{was still in the}} basin. Tom was, however, only just in time to get on board, for the men were already throwing off the warps, and ten minutes later she passed out through the dock-gates, and soon anchored {{in the middle of the}} river. Tom had been on board too many ships at Portsmouth to feel any of that bewilderment common to emigrants starting on their first voyage. He saw that at present everyone was too busy to attend to him, and so he put his portmanteau down by the <b>bulwark</b> <b>forward,</b> and leaning on the rail watched the process of warping the ship out of the docks. There were a good many steerage passengers forward, but at present the after-part of the ship was entirely deserted, as the cabin passengers would not come on board until either late at night or early next morning. When the anchor had been let drop he took up his trunk and asked a sailor where he ought to go to.|$|R
500|$|Construction {{began on}} 22 June 1914 by the ONZiV at Nikolayev, after {{the launch of}} [...] on 7 June cleared the {{building}} slip. However she was not actually laid down until 28 April 1915 with the intention to launch her in October 1915. The normal building schedule was maintained until early 1915 as the Russians believed that the war would be over soon. However, workers were diverted to more important projects and war production began to interfere with deliveries of material beginning shortly afterwards which delayed her launch until on 18 October 1916. Several proposals were evaluated while she was building to modify her {{in light of the}} issues demonstrated by the Imperatritsa Mariya-class in service. They proved to trim badly by the bow and were very wet forward. One proposal was made to fit Imperator Nikolai I with a forecastle deck to improve her seaworthiness. This was rejected, as the additional weight from the forecastle and raising the forward barbette would actually worsen her trim forward. However, a proposal to add a [...] <b>bulwark</b> <b>forward</b> was accepted. Work on her continued at a slow rate through the February Revolution of 1917, but the unsettled times disrupted her construction and further delayed her. She was renamed Demokratiya (: Democracy) on 29 April 1917 and she was estimated to be about 60% complete. Industrial unrest and strikes further slowed progress and the provisional government postponed further work on 24 October 1917 until [...] "a more favorable time".|$|R
