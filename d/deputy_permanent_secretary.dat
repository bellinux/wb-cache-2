40|$|This {{research}} {{identifies the}} professional development needs of fifty District Directors employed by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Bangkok, Thailand, {{in order to produce}} an operational strategy for a learning organisation and an improvement in work quality. The population sample consists of the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Secretary,</b> two <b>Deputy</b> <b>Permanent</b> <b>Secretaries,</b> and all fifty District Directors of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. The research involves a Proactive Evaluation, in which a needs assessment of a group of fifty District Directors is undertaken. A mixed methods approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, is applied. The quantitative research component applies a three-round Delphi survey of the fifty District Directors. The Delphi survey identified seven areas from the sixteen originally submitted; as well, a set of five professional development strategies is identified. The seven elements needed to improve their skills and competencies were: leading an organisation; administering responsibilities rapidly and transparently in order to provide effective service; being mature; establishing good human relationships; collaborating effectively with people and their organizations; providing moral leadership that is concerned with equity and equality; understanding people in order to satisfy their needs. The five professional development strategies required to promote these needs were: improving skills and competencies; successful training; overcoming problems with training; the duration of training programs; selecting suitable training venues. Finally, in order to draw these various elements together, a professional development training policy designed to benefit present and future District Directors of the BMA is developed. ...|$|R

40|$|Organisations {{worldwide}} {{are attempting}} to identify talent by using various assessment methods to evaluate competencies perceived to be core to the mandate of their organisations. In recent years recruitment and selection of individuals rely on assessment methods deemed to have high validity and reliability. One such assessment method used worldwide to evaluate top management is the assessment centre, {{commonly referred to as}} the AC. The main research problem of this study focussed on an evaluation {{of the extent to which}} the assessment centre method is effectively used for the selection and development of senior management employees in the public service of Botswana. The main research problem had eight sub-problems which were addressed through the following actions: A comprehensive literature study was conducted to define and establish the purpose of assessment centres. Moreover, the study aimed to establish the international best practice for the administration of the assessment centre as a tool for selection and talent development. Subsequent to the literature study an interview schedule and survey questionnaire were developed based on the literature. The interview schedule was used to obtain information from consultants who provide assessment centre services to the public service. The objective of the questionnaire was to obtain information from the recipients of the service and determine the extent to which that information compares with information obtained from the consultants. The questionnaire was distributed to a randomly selected population. The results of the empirical study were statistically analysed and interpreted and revealed that <b>permanent</b> and <b>deputy</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>secretaries</b> are more aware of the reasons for using the assessment centre method than directors and deputy directors. These senior management employees felt that the assessment centre is an effective tool for selection and development but the results from the assessment centre are not optimally used for development. The study revealed that generally the assessment centre process conducted in the Botswana public service is in line with international best practice of assessment centres. However, there are certain areas that need some improvement for the assessment centre to entirely conform to international best practice. These areas include the implementation of an assessment centre policy and the improvement of feedback and vital information provided to participants prior to the centre. The empirical study also revealed that senior management employees hold the view that many senior officers in the public service do not know the importance of the assessment centre method and are not comfortable to participate in such a centre. The assessment centre method has proven to be an effective tool for evaluating competencies. This is due to its use of multiple techniques, assessors, simulations and exercises. Theory has revealed that the assessment centre has higher validity and reliability than other assessment methods. However, due to the high costs of running assessment centres, some organisations take shortcuts and therefore jeopardise its validity...|$|R
