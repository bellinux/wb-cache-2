40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>esorubicin,</b> a new anthracycline antibiotic, {{was investigated}} {{in conjunction with a}} phase I clinical trial. The drug was administered to 12 patients as an intravenous bolus at a dose of 20 to 40 mg/m 2. All patients had normal renal and hepatic functions and no third space fluid accumulation. Plasma and urine samples were assayed by HPLC. The peak plasma concentration of <b>esorubicin</b> was 0. 74 ± 0. 57 μM (mean ± SE). <b>Esorubicin</b> disappeared from plasma according to a tri-exponential pattern with a terminal half-life of 20. 4 ± 7. 3 hr. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve was 0. 64 ± 0. 31 μMxhr. Total body plasma clearance was 45. 5 ± 26. 8 liter/min/m 2 and the apparent volume of the central compartment, 41. 0 ± 24. 8 L. A single metabolite, 4 ′-deoxydoxorubicinol, was detected in plasma. This metabolite was observed in 5 patients only and its mean peak concentration was 0. 029 ± 0. 017 μM. The area under the plasma versus concentration time curve for 4 ′-deoxydoxorubicinol was 0. 02 ± 0. 014 μMxhr. The urinary excretion of total fluorescence within 5 days of therapy was 7. 3 ± 1. 3 % of the administered dose. <b>Esorubicin</b> represented more than 80 % of the excreted anthracyclines. As in plasma, 4 ′ -deoxydoxorubicinol was the only metabolite detectable in urine. No correlation between the various pharmacokinetic parameters and drug-induced toxicity was observed in this small group of patients. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.
