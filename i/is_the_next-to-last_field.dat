The last two ships of <b>the</b> class <b>were</b> ordered on 23 December 1901 by the Argentine Navy {{in response to the}} order by Chile for two second-class battleships. The possibility of war between Argentina and Chile, however, abated before <b>the</b> vessel <b>was</b> completed, and a combination of financial problems and British pressure forced Argentina to dispose of Bernardino Rivadavia and her sister ship Mariano Moreno. The Argentine government attempted to sell the ships to Russia, but negotiations failed over the price demanded by the Argentinians. The Japanese government quickly stepped in and purchased them due to increasing tensions with Russia despite the high price of ¥14,937,390 (£1,530,000) for the two sisters. Already planning to attack Russia, the government delayed their surprise attack on Port Arthur that began the Russo-Japanese War until the ships had left Singapore and could not be delayed or interned by any foreign power.|$|R

5|$|After {{taking a}} year off from baseball, Zito signed a minor league {{contract}} {{to return to the}} Athletics on February 16, 2015. In spring training, Zito competed for a role on the Athletics' 25-man roster, possibly as a long reliever. On April 4, 2015, Zito accepted an assignment to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Zito's Nashville teammates lauded him for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for the entire team on his birthday. Zito spent the entire season with Nashville, including about a month on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis. He <b>was</b> activated on <b>the</b> <b>next-to-last</b> day of <b>the</b> season on which he pitched one scoreless inning of relief.

Although Peel was an extremely safe Conservative seat {{for most of its}} history, Davis won by a surprisingly narrow 1,203 votes. The election took place soon after the federal Progressive Conservative government of John Diefenbaker cancelled the Avro Arrow program. [...] Most of the 14,000 Canadians put out of work by this decision were residents of Peel, and many cast protest ballots against Diefenbaker by supporting Bill Brydon, the provincial Liberal candidate. Davis served for two years as a backbench supporter of Leslie Frost's government. [...] When Frost announced his retirement in 1961, Davis became the chief organizer of Robert Macaulay's campaign to succeed him as premier and party leader.

40|$|A three-dimensional, geometrically {{nonlinear}} two-node Timoshenkoo {{beam element}} {{based on the}} total Larangrian description <b>is</b> derived. <b>The</b> element behavior <b>is</b> assumed to be linear elastic, but no restrictions are placed on magnitude of finite rotations. The resulting element has twelve degrees of freedom: six translational components and six rotational-vector components. The formulation uses the Green-Lagrange strains and second Piola-Kirchhoff stresses as energy-conjugate variables and accounts for the bending-stretching and bending-torsional coupling effects without special provisions. The core-congruential formulation (CCF) is used to derived the discrete equations in a staged manner. Core equations involving the internal force vector and tangent stiffness matrix <b>are</b> developed at <b>the</b> particle level. A sequence of matrix transformations carries these equations to beam cross-sections and finally to the element nodal degrees of freedom. The choice of finite rotation measure <b>is</b> made in <b>the</b> <b>next-to-last</b> transformation stage, and the choice of over-the-element interpolation in the last one. The tangent stiffness matrix is found to retain symmetry if <b>the</b> rotational vector <b>is</b> chosen to measure finite rotations.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{convergence}} of the minimal residual (MR) and the conjugate gradient (CG) method when applied to linear algebraic systems with symmetric positive definite tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices. Such systems arise, for example, from the discretization of one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Based on our previous results in [J. Liesen and P. Tich´y, BIT, 44 (2004), pp. 79 – 98], we concentrate on <b>the</b> <b>next-to-last</b> iteration step, and determine the initial residuals and initial errors for the MR and CG method, respectively, {{that lead to the}} slowest possible convergence. By this we mean that the methods have made the least possible progress in <b>the</b> <b>next-to-last</b> iteration step. Using these worst-case initial vectors, we discuss which source term and boundary condition in the underlying reaction-diffusion equation <b>are</b> <b>the</b> worst {{in the sense that they}} lead to the worst-case initial vectors for the MR and CG methods. Moreover, we determine (or very tightly estimate) the worst-case convergence quantities in <b>the</b> <b>next-to-last</b> step, and compare these to the convergence quantities obtained from average (or unbiased) initial vectors. The spectral structure of the considered matrices allows us to apply our worst-case results for <b>the</b> <b>next-to-last</b> step to derive worst-case bounds also for other iteration steps. We present a comparison of the worst-case convergence quantities with the classical convergence bound based on the condition number of, and finally we discuss the MR and CG convergence for the special case of the one-dimensional Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions...|$|R
