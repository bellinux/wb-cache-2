50|$|Kames {{are small}} hills that consist of sediments ranging from sands to gravels.

A <b>kame</b> <b>terrace</b> is a relatively flat surface of sediment that was deposited between the valley surface and the glacier.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Modes of {{formation}} {{and rates of}} collapse have been determined for kame terraces and a fan delta in the Adams Inlet area, Alaska. The hummocky and trenched surface of the <b>kame</b> <b>terrace</b> develops by mass-wasting processes caused by differential melting of buried ice. The dry channels in the collapsed part of the terrace are formed by melt water during stagnant-ice bursts. Measurements {{over a period of}} 17 years indicate that terrace back-wasting averages 4. 3 m a-I. The fan delta is forming near sea-level by streams that derive part of their load from the <b>kame</b> <b>terrace.</b> The fan delta seaward of the retreating <b>kame</b> <b>terrace</b> is undergoing partial collapse to produce kettles ringed by concentric fractures. Vegetation, now as much as 5 m below high tide, suggests a fan-delta collapse rate of about 0. 5 m a-I...|$|E

This study comprises engineering geological investigations of the roading aggregate {{with the objective of}} identifying potential aggregate source areas which comply with specifications. Five aggregate sources, two glacial and three post-glacial, have been identified, and their geology related to aggregate quality. A survey of existing aggregate quarries confirmed the sub-specification quality of schist derived roading aggregate, and that the highest quality roading aggregate of the Basin is produced from exotic glacial transported graywacke. A graywacke rich aggregate source area of Kame terraces was investigated. Investigations included mapping at scales of 1 : 10 000 and 1 : 1 500, and the excavation of test pits. A geotechnical testing programme concluded that the <b>Kame</b> <b>terrace</b> source area was capable of producing roading aggregate for basecourse, and is comparable with the highest quality roading aggregate of the Wakatipu Basin.

40|$|The depositional {{conditions}} of kame terraces {{in a mountain}} valley were analysed sedimentologically and petrologically {{through a series of}} kame terraces in the Rudawy Janowickie mountains. The kame terraces comprise five lithofacies associations. Lithofacies association GRt, Sp originates from deposition in the high-energy, deep gravel-bed channel of a braided river. Lithofacies association GC represents a washed out glacial till. Probably a thin layer of till was washed out by sandy braided rivers (Sp). The fourth association (Fh, Fm) indicates a shallow and quite small glaciomarginal lake. The last association (GRt, GRp) indicates the return of deposition in a sandy-bed braided channel. The petrography of the Janowice Wiekie pit and measurements of cross-stratified beds indicate a palaeocurrent direction from N to S. The Janowice Wielkie sedimentary succession accumulated most probably during the Saalian (Odranian, Saale I, Drenthe) as the first phase of ice-sheet melting, because the <b>kame</b> <b>terrace</b> under study is the highest one, 25 - 27 m above the Bóbr river level.

40|$|A paleoenvironmental and paleolandscape {{reconstruction}} of two separate {{sites in the}} Greenwich Bay region of RI was completed {{for use in the}} Paleocultural Landscapes Project. Investigations of a lacustrine sediment record in Warwick, RI were completed in order to develop a regional paleoenvironmental reference record. Investigations of the acoustic sub-bottom record in Greenwich Bay, RI were completed in order to develop paleolandscape reconstructions of the observed depositional environments for future use in an archaeological site prediction model. ^ For Chapter one, we took a single sediment core from Gorton Pond, Warwick, RI in the summer of 2013 for the purpose of developing a regional paleoenvironmental reference record. The core was dated using both AMS-radiocarbon dating of four terrestrial macrofossil samples, and correlations with a radiometric/pollen age model from a surface core taken from Gorton Pond for a previous study. The oldest terrestrial macrofossil was a spruce cone dated to ~ 12, 100 calendar years BP, but an estimated 18, 000 years of sediment is in the Gorton Pond record, based on bracketing ages from dated recessional moraines in the region. However, we only sampled an estimated 16, 000 years, based on a Younger Dryas transition of 13, 000 BP. ^ Physical, magnetic, and elemental/isotopic (C, N, S, D/H) proxy measurements were made, and six distinct environmental zones were interpreted. The Gorton Pond record indicates significant changes in lake productivity and temperature. The Late Pleistocene Deglacial Period (16. 0 - 13. 0 ky BP) is indicated by low OC%, high concentrations of magnetic material, and terrestrially-sourced organic matter. The Younger Dryas chronozone was observed (13. 0 - 11. 8 kyr BP) as large decreases in δl 13 C, OC%, and δDBA, indicating cold conditions. A transition from the Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene (11. 8 - 9. 6 ky BP) was observed by rapid warming and increased aquatic productivity. The Middle Holocene (9. 6 - 3. 6 ky BP) was characterized by depleted δD BA of behenic acid ratios, which may suggest Gorton Pond is sensitive to changes in air mass/moisture sources, but other local effects are being investigated. ^ In chapter two, a geophysical survey was conducted using acoustic sub-bottom (CHIRP) seismic reflection techniques, and 24 lines covering 40 km were processed and interpreted. Four distinct seismic units were interpreted, spanning from the Pleistocene-aged deglacial sediments to modern day estuarine sediments. A basal till/bedrock surface marks the limit of seismic penetration, and overlying thick (up to 42 m) varved proglacial lake sediments suggest that the area was part of Glacial Lake Narragansett (GLN). Paleochannel stream cuts unconformably lie above the proglacial lake sediments, indicating a draining of GLN and a period of subaerial exposure in which an organized tributary system existed in Greenwich Bay. A GIS-based Local Polynomial Interpolation model was used to create a representative surface of the stream-dissected paleolandscape that existed prior to marine inundation. While useful, denser CHIRP coverage (100 m line spacing minimum) is recommended in order to take stress off of the interpolation. The proximity of channels to archaeological finds at Cedar Tree Beach would suggest that they might have been important resources for ancient inhabitants. Comparisons to the USGS East Greenwich Quadrangle Surficial Geology Map (Smith, 1955) shows significant <b>kame</b> <b>terrace</b> and other glacial meltwater deposits that may indicate a paleo-drainage of the modern day Pawtuxet river into the paleolandscape observed in the Greenwich Bay seismic record. ...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneity and Scaling in Geologic Media: Applications to Transport in the Vadose and Saturated Zones Stephen Brown, Gregory Boitnott, and Martin Smith New England Research In {{rocks and}} soils, the bulk {{geophysical}} and transport {{properties of the}} matrix and of fracture systems {{are determined by the}} juxtaposition of geometric features at many length scales. For sedimentary materials the length scales are: the pore scale (irregularities in grain surface roughness and cementation), the scale of grain packing faults (and the resulting correlated porosity structures), the scale dominated by sorting or winnowing due to depositional processes, and the scale of geomorphology at the time of deposition. We are studying the heterogeneity and anisotropy in geometry, permeability, and geophysical response from the pore (microscopic), laboratory (mesoscopic), and backyard field (macroscopic) scales. In turn these data are being described and synthesized for development of mathematical models. Eventually, we will perform parameter studies to explore these models in the context of transport in the vadose and saturated zones. We have developed a multi-probe physical properties scanner which allows for the mapping of geophysical properties on a slabbed sample or core. This device allows for detailed study of heterogeneity at those length scales most difficult to quantify using standard field and laboratory practices. The measurement head consists of a variety of probes designed to make local measurements of various properties, including: gas permeability, acoustic velocities (compressional and shear), complex electrical impedance (4 electrode, wide frequency coverage), and ultrasonic reflection (ultrasonic impedance and permeability). We can thus routinely generate detailed geophysical maps of a particular sample. With the exception of the acoustic velocity, we are testing and modifying these probes as necessary for use on soil samples. As a baseline study we have been characterizing the heterogeneity of a bench-size Berea Sandstone block. Berea Sandstone has long been regarded as a laboratory standard in rock properties studies, owing to its uniformity and ''typical'' physical properties. We find that both permeability and velocity exhibit complex heterogeneity at the centimeter scale. While some correlation with the outcropping of the bedding is apparent, much of the heterogeneity is not clearly associated with visual features. We are developing software tools to examine simultaneously pixel by pixel correlations among geophysical measurements, transport properties, and visual (photographic) texture and the dependence of these correlations on measurement scale. We find that certain pairs of physical quantities, such as P velocity and permeability for example, are distinctly correlated with one another at certain scales, but less obviously at other scales. Preliminary analyses of the Berea Sandstone data show that by simultaneous consideration of several physical properties the data can be separated into clusters of like properties which can be considered distinct facies. Apparently, identification of these facies, which could represent a limited range of fluid permeability, may be made by making joint geophysical measurements. Given various physical models for the dependence of the geophysical and transport properties on pore size, we expect that these observed correlations will provide conditioning and constraints to inversions for stochastic models of the internal structure of a specimen. For the study of soil heterogeneity at a wide range of scales, we are focusing on a local glacial deposit. This deposit is a glacial <b>kame</b> <b>terrace</b> of fluvial origin with multi-scale sedimentary structures comprised of unconsolidated sands, clays, and gravels. There are also many joints and faults in the unconsolidated sediments, allowing study of these as potential fluid flow conduits or barriers. We have obtained undisturbed soil samples from this site, allowing detailed laboratory study using similar methods to those described for the sandstone block...|$|E

However, not all lake terraces are relict shorelines.

40|$|The {{extent of}} Late Quaternary {{glaciation}} {{in the northwest}} Nelson region of New Zealand has traditionally been regarded as minor, with small-scale valley glaciation in confined upland reaches. New geomorphological evidence, including moraines, <b>kame</b> <b>terraces,</b> till-mantled bedrock and outwash terraces, indicate that greatly expanded valley glaciers flowed into the lowland valley system at the mouths of the Cobb-Takaka and Anatoki drainages. The timing for this ice advance into lowland valleys is constrained by lowland landform characteristics and a single cosmogenic exposure age, suggesting Late and Middle Pleistocene ice expansion, respectively. Evidence for expanded upland ice on the Mount Arthur Tableland and adjacent areas includes trimlines, boulder trains and roche moutonées. Two cosmogenic exposure ages on upland bedrock surfaces suggest that major ice expansion occurred during MIS 3 and/or 4, while previously published exposure dating from Cobb Valley suggests large MIS 2 ice expansion as well. The inferred, markedly expanded ice left little or no clear geomorphic imprint on the Cobb–Takaka Gorge, and required temperature depression of 4 – 6 °C with near-modern precipitation levels. © 2009, Wiley-Blackwell.

40|$|Abstract: The River Rega valley near Łobez {{was formed}} by a rapid icesheet degradation. Evolution of valleys of rivers (including the Rega) {{discharging}} into the Baltic Sea began in late Plenivistulian; {{it was then that}} glacifluvial outwash levels and <b>kame</b> <b>terraces</b> were formed. At that time, the water was flowing southward and further on towards the south-west, in a broad channel. That period was termi-nated at the turn of Plenivistulian and late Vistulian, when the discharge became directed northwards. The net result was the onset of the formation of the modern Rega valley system, buried chunks of dead ice {{still in the process of}} melting. Dead ice melt-down proceeded at the fastest rate during Allerød. It was then that deposits of organic matter were formed, the deposits being most probably remnants of fossil soil. Plant macro-fossils and remains of freshwater malacofauna point to a sporadic occurrence of sediments of a shallow water body which existed on the melt-down site of a huge chunk of dead ice. The thickness of the overlaying mineral cover (up to 6 m) is indicative of a fast sediment accretion rate. Sandy and silty sediments were deposited in synchrony with the dead ice melting. As a result, today’s Rega valley features traces of small melt-water lakes as well as fossil sedimentation basins (underlain by the Allerød organic level), rapidly filled with fluvial and fluvio-limnic sediments.

40|$|Vernal pools {{are small}} {{isolated}} wetlands that {{are covered by}} shallow water for variable periods {{in the winter and}} spring but may be completely dry for most of the summer and fall. Despite their small size, vernal pools are a dominant wetland type throughout New England. These wetlands are hotspots of floral and faunal biodiversity, as their unique hydrology and landscape characteristics allow them to serve as a home and breeding ground for many distinct plant and animal species. Because of their abundance in New England, vernal pools may also be an important long-term regional storehouse for organic carbon. Despite the functional and ecological values of vernal pools, few studies have investigated how variations in hydrology, pool size, geomorphic setting, and surrounding landscape attributes affect soil carbon in these systems and the associated hydric soils that sequester the carbon. Therefore, the primary objectives of this thesis were to i) assess the effect of landscape characteristics on hydrologic and edaphic conditions; ii) investigate the need for additional hydric soil indicators for vernal pool soils; iii) quantify the relationship between vernal pool hydrology and greenhouse gas fluxes; and iv) evaluate processes of carbon cycling throughout vernal pools.

The spatial organisation and morphology of hummocky features investigated in Torridon allows the differentiation of cross-valley orientated marginal moraines and the more numerous streamlined features with a down-valley orientation interpreted as flutings. As the flutings are superimposed on the cross-valley moraines they are thought to post-date moraine formation. The spatial organisation of glacial landforms in Torridon therefore represents a palimpsest landscape. Mapping of moraines in the Rannoch Moor basin suggests {{that this was a}} major centre of ice convergence rather than accumulation during the Loch Lomond Stadial. Ice mainly accumulated in the corries in the mountains to the west of moor from where it flowed to coalesce as an upland icefield. Ice is thought to have reached a sufficient volume in the Rannoch Moor basin to flow down valleys as outlet glaciers. Hummocky features found at Tyndrum and Strath Fillan have a polygenetic origin and include the remnants of eskers, hummocks produced by local ice stagnation, marginal moraines, and lateral moraines which have been modified by paraglacial debris flow.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{penultimate}} glaciation vast {{areas of}} the Alps were glaciated, with piedmont glaciers protruding into the foreland. In the easternmost part of the northward draining valleys of the Alps, the glaciers did not reach the foreland, but formed valley glaciers confined by the mountainous terrain. This also applies to the Ybbs valley, where samples for luminescence dating out of glaciofluvial gravel accumulations were taken at three locations along the present day river course. In a highly dynamic depositional environment, such as a glacier-fed river system, incomplete resetting of the luminescence signal is possible, in particular when transport distances are short. In such cases, quartz usually is the preferred mineral over feldspar, especially if dose rates are low and may theoretically allow obtaining quartz ages beyond 150  ka. Because previous research has shown, and as corroborated within this study, quartz from the research area exhibits analytical problems in the high age range. Therefore luminescence properties of coarse grain (100 – 200  μm) quartz and in addition K-rich feldspar were investigated with the aim to reconstruct the chronology of the glacial processes within the Ybbs catchment area. Issues of incomplete bleaching were pIRIR 225 encountered and addressed by comparing quartz OSL, fading corrected K feldspar IR 50 and pIRIR 225 to identify reliable ages. Depositional ages based on quartz OSL and feldspar pIRIR 225 signals revealed deposition of ice marginal <b>kame</b> <b>terraces</b> and glaciofluvial foreland terraces during late to middle MIS 6. In combination with results from previous studies, we could reconstruct the valley evolution during the Riss glaciation. Newly gained luminescence ages of the deglaciation in the easternmost Alps coincide with OSL dated deglaciation events in the Western Alps, indicating that climatic change along {{the north side of}} the Alps happened simultaneously...|$|R

The ice-sheet waning resulted in formation of groups of crevasse landforms such as kame plateaux, <b>kame</b> hillocks, <b>kame</b> <b>terraces</b> and melt-out depressions. The post-Wartanian morphogenesis increased diversity of the relief by rejuvenation of most of buried valleys, by cutting new valleys and raising the interfluve surface with aeolian sheets and dunes. Sand and silt were deposited in melt-out depressions. The depressions had initially functioned as closed depressions and had formed a local base level. They were incorporated into a valley network presumably {{at the end of}} the Vistulian glaciation. Blocks of dead ice melted gradually and it has led to the formation of flattenings in the melt-out depressions bottoms. The flattenings are 2 - 3 m high and have short gentle slopes. These slopes and the slopes of the melt-out depressions are cut with dells and basin-like valleys. Few of the cuttings continue their direction as barely perceptible, shallow flat-floored valleys drained by perennial or intermittent watercourses. In the Holocene eight types of geocomplexes with stable matter and energy structure were formed, as a result od natural processes. Man's influence has led to diversification of the environment which can be represented by 19 types of present-day geocomplexes.

The three superficial glacial aquifers (two fluvio-glacial <b>kame</b> <b>terraces</b> and a lateral till) provide similar results: a best fit with an exponential flow model (EM) (playing the major role) combined in parallel with a piston flow model (PFM), and a rather short mean transit time (T 5 - 7 y). The deepest mineral aquifer (Evian) can only be fitted with the in a series combination of a highly dispersive model (DM; T 68 y; DP = 0. 5) and a piston flow model (T 2. 5 y) or, better, by the in a series combination of an EM (T 8 y) modelling the subsurface aquifer and a DM (T 60 y; DP = 0. 75) and the same piston flow model (T 2. 5 y) modelling the deep mineral aquifer, this latest combination of models providing the following parameters: T 70 y and median transit time 45. 5 y. It is also to be noted that a very {{small part of the}} recharge; about 1. 3 %, avoids both the EM and the DM, and directly enters the PFM (at the Northern limit of the Gavot Plateau). These models are very sensitive regarding the T (± 1 y, 0. 25 y for the PFM), less so with DP. These results will prompt hydrologists to (re) work historical data to determine if important hydrologic information is available. The interest and limits of such a modelling, also for other constituents than tritium, along with the future for tritium as a tracer are discussed and it also provides new insights on the structure and functioning of alpine paleo glacial hydrosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{is one of the}} {{unpublished}} research projects which are known to have been conducted in New England and in Eastern Canada under the guidance of the late Richard J. LOUGEE, long-time professor of Geomorphology at Clark University. Over a number of years, this writer has worked in close relationship with Lougee and much evidence in the field was studied together. It is believed that here has been recorded a most detailed work of surveying, and this undoubtedly accounts for the somewhat exceptional results that will be presented. The area selected for this study (about 80 % of it is woodland) is located in the highlands of Central Massachusetts in Worcester County, about twenty miles (32 kilo-meters) northwest of the city of Worcester. It consists of the valley of the Otter River draining north, and of {{a small portion of the}} East Branch of the Ware River draining south. Since completion of this study, parts of the low area which held the ancient glacial lakes have been flooded to become water reservoirs. That proglacial lakes, though temporary they may have been, once submerged much of the area under study, is shown by an abundance of deltas, kames, eskers and deltaic <b>kames</b> <b>terraces.</b> It is believed that all of these were built under water in such lakes. Other features, such as kettle-holes and glacial outlets, especially ice-marginal channels cutdiagonally down the slope, have also been studied. By plotting on a profile of the most characteristic elevations (often carefully surveyed), it is possible to find the water planes of ancient proglacial lakes. To this must be added experiments conducted in a sedimentation tank as also measurements of both the imbrication of cobbles in eskers and the « smoothness indexes » of such stones and pebbles, using A. Cailleux' methods. Thus were obtained results which tend to show that : 1 - the area under study probably was in a deep interlobate space created between the Connecticut Valley lobe to the west and the Boston Basin lobe to the east ; 2 — ice-marginal channels are an indication of the existence of a thick, fast-retreating ice border ; 3 - an isostatic balance restored itself by sometimes quick and strong adjustments of the crust of the earth ; 4 — an early upwarping, made up of various zones of tilting articulated on hinge lines, has been referred to as Hubbard Uplift and is the earliest known in the post-Glacial history of New England...|$|R
40|$|The Valley Heads Moraine (VHM) is a 280 km-long {{interrupted}} and discontinuous band of glacigenic sediment {{in central}} New York. It forms {{the most extensive}} morainic system in the State and separates southward and northward-flowing streams that follow partly filled 2 ̆ 2 through valleys 2 ̆ 2 in the bedrock. Deposits comprise diamict, ice contact, outwash, and lacustrine sediment. Landforms include <b>kames,</b> <b>kame</b> <b>terraces,</b> kettles, outwash fans and deltas. Named by Fairchild in 1932, it has received little attention {{in spite of its}} geomorphic, geologic, and hydrologic importance. The result of this study provides knowledge of the glacial episodes involved, the mechanisms of drift emplacement, and the relation to other contiguous moraines east, west, and south. ^ The purpose of this study has been to determine the method of emplacement of the VHM. There are four different glacier-process models that have been used in northeastern United States to explain sediments and landforms at the Laurentide Ice Sheet margin: (1) morphosequence model, (2) hydraulic pump model, (3) inwash model, and (4) backwash model. Each is evaluated and its relative importance assessed. To do this hundreds of glacial outcrops were examined in the field, and 39 special sites were mapped and sediment samples evaluated in the laboratory. Mineral analysis showed a remarkable sediment composition consistency throughout the area. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that both glacial and fluvioglacial transport processes took place during the VHM deposition. ^ The VHM formed during recessional events of the Laurentide Ice Sheet about 14, 000 ybp. Drift was deposited in a dead ice environment at the ice margin after adjacent uplands had become ice-free. Ice tongues up to 20 km in length and 300 m in thickness occupied major through valleys of the Alleghany Escarpment. During early stages of drift emplacement, sediment sources came as a result of hydraulic movements through decaying ice masses and inwash when ice ablated from the adjoining deglaciated terrain. Ice retreat from the drainage divide provided avenues for materials to backwash into the kame moraine and also produced thick lacustrine sediments in the proglacial lakes. Thus all the evidence generated in this investigation leads {{to the conclusion that the}} VHM was formed principally by three interacting sets of process mechanisms. They are hydraulic pump, inwash, and backwash transport processes. The relative importance of each debris transport process is likely to vary from valley to valley depending on topography (landform and relief), glacier geometry, and the thermal regime of the glacier. ...|$|R
40|$|The Lake Heron basin is an {{intermontane basin}} located {{approximately}} 30 kms west of Mount Hutt. Sediments within the basin {{are derived from}} a glacier that passed through the Lake Stream Valley from the upper Rakaia Valley. The lack of major drainage in the south part of the basin has increased the preservation potential of glacial phenomena. The area provides opportunities for detailed glacial geomorphology, sedimentology and micropaleontogical work, from which a very high-resolution study on climate change spanning the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) through to the present {{was able to be}} reconstructed. The geomorphology reveals a complex glacial history spanning multiple glaciations. The Pyramid and Dogs Hill Advance are undated but possibly relate to the Waimaungan and Waimean glaciations. The Emily Formation (EM), previously thought to be MIS 4 (Mabin, 1984), was dated using Be 10 to c. 25 ka B. P. The EM was largest advance of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Ice during the LGM was at least 150 m thicker than previously thought, as indicated by relatively young ages of high elevation moraines. Numerous moraine ridges and <b>kame</b> <b>terraces</b> show a continuous recession from LGM limits, and, supported by decreasing Be 10 ages for other LGM moraines, it seems ice retreat was punctuated by minor glacial readvances and still-stands. These may be associated with decadal-scale climate variations, such as the PDO or early ENSO-like systems. There are relatively little sedimentological exposures in the area other than those on the shores of Lake Heron. The sediment at this location demonstrates the nature of glacial and paraglacial sedimentation during the later stages of ice retreat. They show that ice fronts oscillated across several hundred metres before retreating into Lake Heron proper. Vegetation change at Staces Tarn (1200 m asl) indicates climate amelioration in the early Holocene. The late glacial vegetation cover of herb and small shrubs was replaced by a low, montane forest about 7, 000 yrs B. P, approximately {{at the time of the}} regional thermal maxima. From 7, 000 and 1, 400 yrs B. P, temperatures slowly declined, and grasses slowly moved back onto the site, although the montane forest was still the dominant vegetation. Fires were frequent in the area extending back at least 6, 000 years B. P. The largest fire, about 5, 300 yrs B. P, caused major forest disruption. But full recovered occurred within about 500 years. Beech forest appears at the site about 3, 300 yrs B. P and becomes the dominant forest cover about 1, 400 yrs B. P. Cooler, cloudier winters and disturbance by fire promoted the expansion of beech forest at the expense of the previous low, montane forest. Both the increased frequency of fire events and late Holocene beech spread may be linked to ENSO-related variations in rainfall. The youngest zone is characterised by both a dramatic decline in beech forest and an increase in grasses, possibly representing human activity in the area...|$|R

G. M. Map (No. 67 / 524500 - 705230 and No. 68 / 524500 - 70300 of Section L) at the scale 1 : 50, 000 is {{presented}} in this paper. Primary objective of the research is the mapping of the most recent marine and transitional terraces. The outcropping substratum - subdivided into depositional units (ground, terminal and lateral moraines, <b>kame</b> <b>terraces,</b> drumlins, eskers, etc.) and erosion units (marginal and submarginal streams, kettie-holes, etc.) -is prevalently linked with the last glaciations of the southern Andean Cordillera (Darwin Cordillera) and adjacent coastal areas of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. Three orders of mostly marine terraces lie over this substratum in the present coastal areas. The 1 st order terraces -the oldest - include deposits and surfaces located at elevations between 18 and 25 m a. s. l. which formed under lacustrine to transitional to marine conditions. The 2 nd order terraces, located between 6 and 11 m a. s. l, are formed by erosion surfaces often with associated gravel and sand, locally also with fossiliferous deposits. Terraced deposits at the elevations between 3 and 5 m a. s. l have been attributed to the 3 rd order terraces. Inland, numerous older sequences of terraces are visible at more than 25 m a. s. l. : these are, however, mainly to be linked to a continental environment. Locally, below 3 m a. s. l, there is a very young 4 th order of terraces which are of marine origin. Their areal extent is very small and not mappable at the 1 : 50, 000 scale. Mapped terraces are attributed to the Holocene {{on the basis of their}} stratigraphic position and radiometric 14 C ages. In particular, the oldest terraces can be dated to the lower Holocene, although their base may be slightly older (late Pleistocene); the intermediate order is 6, 000 - 7, 000 years old B. P., and the youngest terraces (3 rd order) are dated to 4, 000 - 5, 000 years B. P. The present morphological setting of the coast is the product of the evolutionary dynamics of Holocene marine and transitional terraces. Lakes (Iagunas) characterizing the coastal areas and which formed as a result of morphogenetic processes occurring in a glacial enviroment, evolved in many cases as backshore basins in a littoral environment. Locally they are suspended (palaeobackshore) over the present sea level because of isostatic phenomena following the last glaciation, associated with a mild eustatic phase; beach forms such as beach ridges, berms, spits, etc. are present in these latter cases. These forms are also the most common paleo-landforms on the terraced surfaces. The western section of the studied coastal area ("Villa Kon Aiken" Sheet) is characterized by a large number of 2 nd order terraces which, during uplift, trapped Iagunas and a series of minor lakes {{along the coast}}al strip of Seno Otway. The eastern coast ("Isla Isabel "Sheet) shows a more complete terraced sequence, especially along the coast facing Isla Isabel, which was affected by a more homogeneous uplift than the western part of the studied coastal area and where all the terrace orders are present. The remarkable altimetric correspondence between 2 nd and 3 rd order terraces in the two sections of the surveyed coast of the Brunswick Peninsula suggests a prevalent and homogeneous isostatic uplift. The scarce outcrops of eroded 1 st order terraces in the western coastal section may be explained with tilting phenomena during uplifting...|$|R

The present coastal configurations are prevalently a product of the evolutionary dynamics of said terraced sequences through the continental, transitional and marine environment.

The information is mainly from the mapping and field sampling carried out during the 1991, 1994 and 2003 Italian expeditions which were organized by the “Dipartimento di Scienze Geologiche, Ambientali e Marine” of the “Università di Trieste”, within the P. N. R. A.

Subsequent research was carried out in greater detail with mapping of morphological units in the coastal belt (collection of morphostructural, stratigraphic, micropaleontological and sedimentological data, study of active cliffs, palaeo-cliffs, littoral dynamics, dunes, etc.). 	 	During this second phase, greater attention was given to the study of palaeo-shorelines and different terrace orders of presumed marine origin. On the basis of the initial geological, sedimentological and geomorphological results obtained, we made a zoning of the coastal belts along the Atlantic opening of the Straits. 	The map shows the distribution of the youngest terraces (prevalently Holocene), from which four orders have been mapped starting from the average sea-level. The three youngest orders are certainly of coastal origin while for the oldest a transitional origin may be feasible. 	Generally, they are mostly depositional bodies, but very ocasionally they are just simple marine erosion surfaces (palaeo-abrasion platforms) formed either on glacial and/or glacifluvial deposits, or on the Meso-Cenozoic bedrock. On the whole, they follow the current coastline, being apparently genetically connected to it, although in detail, they present an ancient configuration different from the present Straits. 	Bahía Inútil is a marine morphological unit located in an original Quaternary glacial valley, and its morphogenesis is probably linked to several of the latter glaciations. It became marine dominated just {{at the end of the}} last glaciation. 	In the surveyed area, from the zone North of Porvenir to South of Punta Yartoú, for about 200 km., the coasts of the bay impinge on the local Meso-Cenozoic basement, the glacial cover s. l., or marine-transitional terraced deposits. 	The Meso-Cenozoic basement, which is well represented along the whole coast, is mainly formed from the sediments of the Grupo Bahía Inútil units or of Agua Fresca, Chorrillo Chico or Cerro Cuchilla formations. In the southern area of the bay, up to Puerto Arturo, it is formed from a sequence of folds, sometimes faulted with axial direction West North West - East South East (E. N. A. P., 1977; Mapa Geológico de Chile - Instituto de Investigacion Geológicas, 1980). 	Glacial deposits s. l. result from superimposition of the latter glaciations or just local episodes of them. They are part of continental geomorphological units, both depositional and erosive. These units are expressed by: moraines (ground, terminal or lateral), drumlins, erratics, <b>kame</b> <b>terraces,</b> fluvial terraces, kettle holes, marginal and submarginal channels, etc., which evidence advancement of the glaciers towards Bahía S. Sebastián (East). They are intimately connected to broad, frequent glacifluvial inter-morainal or alluvial plains at different heights, which represent either simple erosion surfaces or depositional bodies. Altogether, these glacial and alluvial deposits are formed from gravels, sands and well laminated pelites often affected by tectonics due to the ancient glacier actions. 	The terraced marine and transitional deposits belong basically to four orders, and they are mainly represented by depositional bodies, but sometimes only by erosion surfaces lying on the Meso-Cenozoic basement (abrasion palaeo-platforms) or on Quaternary glacial and glacifluvial deposits. Their sequence is evident in the vicinity of Porvenir. 	The First, more ancient Order, shows terraces generally located between 18 and 25 m above p. s. l., mostly around 20 m., constituted by sands and pelites characterized by an intense stratification and parallel lamination. There is no proof that it belongs to a marine environment, although its strict distribution along the present coast and not beyond it, suggests this. Landwards, especially in the eastern area of the bay and to the North East of Cabo Boquerón, where it shows an inner step, its upper surface connects with palaeo-alluvial fans. It suggests, on the whole, a transitional environment. There are neither absolute nor relative chronological data. Its superimposition on last glaciation deposits suggests that it belongs to the lowest stage of the Holocene or, perhaps, to the upper Pleistocene. 	Second-Order terraces are definitely coastal marine, as proved by lithology and biofacies. At Bahía Inútil and in its neighbourhood, they are mainly made up of gravels and sands. They are mainly located around 10 m, ranging from 6 to 11 m above p. s. l.; to the north of Porvenir they are higher, containing there or at Cabo Boquerón, some inner steps. According to the bibliography, their Holocene age has been confirmed by dating with radiocarbon and by their superimposition on last glaciation deposits and the current fauna. 	Third-Order terraces run mostly parallel with the present coast, with the exception of the ancient deltaic areas, where they follow a landward tendency, becoming transitional terraces in the contact zones. They are much more evident than they seem on this map, because of the scale, especially in small inlets to the mouths of creeks. They are mainly made up of fossiliferous gravels (gasteropods, bivalves etc.), and locally, sands and laminated pelites. They are distributed between 3 and 5 m above p. s. l. 	The Fourth Order shows itself to be distribuited at a height of betwen 1 to 2 metres. The Fourth Order is composed of raised palaeo-beaches containing a rich faunas of gasteropods, bivalves and balanids as recognized by C 14 dating. 	From the evolutional palaeo-geographic point of view, all four terrace orders are post last-glacial. The First Order is probably bound to the morphological situation at the beginning of the last glaciation, whereas the Second, the Third and the Fourth Orders belong to pauses in the isostatic uplift, together with a positive eustatic component subsequent to the glacial phase and currently considered of minor importance to the isostatic component. The presence of contemporary tectonic movements cannot be exluded. Detailed studies aimed at distinguishing the eustatic effect from the isostatic and tectonic ones are in course. 	The present morphologic conditions support the described palaeo-geographic evolution since they repeat the conditions of the past shown by the terraces. 	In this sector also, many of the coastal lakes were connected, in their first phase of formation only, to glacial morphogenesis; subsequently, their evolution in an advanced phase of deglaciation (the last) was strictly linked to marine action and thus closely linked to the formations of the terraces. The lakes were, in fact, trapped between those terraces following their isostatic uplift (Cabo Monmouth, Laguna Barrosa, Puerto Nuevo, Caleta Josefina, Laguna Ema, Puerto Yartoú) ...|$|R

From the textural point of view, they are made up of stratified sands and laminated pelites. The Holocenic age is hypothesized on the basis of both stratigraphic position and relation to analogous deposits in the Straits of Magellan with radiocarbon dates. 	Second Order terraces lie mainly between 6 and 11 m above p. s. l.; they are much more extensive than the previous order, and sometimes contain evidence of marine palaeo-forms (Punta Catalina, Punta Dungeness). The deposits are mostly clayey and sandy, sometimes gravelly, and often fossiliferous (gasteropods, bivalves etc.). Their age (Holocene) is presumed from their stratigraphic position, their faunal content, and radiocarbon dating. 	Third Order terraces (Holocene) are less present than in adjacent areas, although they represent larger single outcrops between 3 and 5 m a. s. l [...] Fossiliferous gravels prevail, with some sands. Their age (Holocene) has been directly based on radiocarbon dating carried out on the shells that they contain. 	The Fourth Order shows itself to be distribuited at a height of betwen 1 to 2 metres. The Fourth Order is composed of raised palaeo-beaches containing a rich faunas of gasteropods, bivalves and balanids as recognized by C 14 dating. 	The coastal belt is almost always made up of depositional continental units, mainly linked to the last glaciations and consisting of moraines (ground, terminal and lateral) and <b>kame</b> <b>terraces,</b> as well as fluvial terraces and drumlins. There are, moreover, erosion units, such as marginal and sub-marginal streams, kettle holes and ancientstream channels (first, second and third glaciations). 	The present coastal morphology is more uniform compared to the ancient one suggested by the Holocene terraces. Present abrasion platforms, salt-marsh areas, tidal flats and channels, stable or advancing moving coasts are better developed in areas where the terraces are more noticeable (Bahía Santiago-p. p., Bahía San Felipe, Bahía Lomas, the area between Primera Angostura and Punta Tandy), which indicates that the morphology was the same in the past. On the contrary, they are not developed where there are no terraces or where they are less evident (Bahía Santiago-p. p., Primera Angostura, the stretch between Punta Tandy and Punta Wreck). The genetic similarity between the present configuration of spits and cuspate forelands of Punta Dungeness and Punta Catalina and those of the past expressed by Holocene terraces is also notable. 	The main aeolian morphologies follow the dominant Magellanic wind direction at high-altitudes, whereas on lower zones they run parallel to the coast. 	Lakes in the area are basically bound to glacial morphogenesis. Nevertheless, there are other lakes formed by entrapment in the palaeo-geographic evolution of the marine terraces (Bahía San Felipe, Bahía Lomas, Punta Catalina). They can be, sometimes, considered different stages in the latter phase of the last deglaciation, indicating backshore environments, and relative palaeo-beach ridges formed by isostatic uplift and risen, above the base level. In some sector, they have been, or are currently being shaped in their morphologic evolution, by strong and regular West North - West winds, migrating leewards. 	Elucidation of the evolutionary framework of the mapped palaeo-surfaces, linked to palaeo-beach deposits, provides an important contribution to the reconstruction of the Holo-Pleistocene s. l. palaeo-geographic picture of the peri-Antarctic areas. 	Detailed studies (scale 1 : 50, 000) on marine terraces linked to Holo-Pleistocene glacio-eustatic variations are in course. The aim is to publish an Atlas accompanied by about 12 Geomorphological Maps (topographically based on 28 sections 1 : 50, 000 I. G. M. C.) of the area between Punta Dungeness and Bahía Inútil...|$|R
40|$|The South Great Poland ice-sheet lobe {{representing}} the Warta Glaciation stretched from the Warsaw-Berlin pradolina that {{runs along the}} S 2 nd parallel (100 m above sea level) to the Wieluń Upland (272 m above sea level) in south (SI°N). The lobe was halted by topographic barriers of the Ostrzeszów Hills (284 m) and of the Łódź Upland (284 m) and left some signs of push moraines there. In central Poland the Wartanian ice-sheet spread southwards utilising the river valleys of the Prosna, Warta and Widawka (Fig. 1). The ice conserved the valleys, which is evidenced by 2 - 4 m thick till well preserved {{on the slopes of}} buried valleys older than of Wartanian age (Fig. 2). The southern portion (51 O 5 O'N) of the South Great Poland lobe diverged into lower order lobes of Widawka, Warta and Prosna. The Widawka lobe, developed in the east, flew over the elevation of the Bełchatów Upland (200 - 220 m) and left signs of diffluence in the Piotrków Plain (Fig. 3). The Warta lobe crept up onto the northern edge of the Wieluń Upland (200 - 250 m) where the ice-sheet dissipated. The Prosna lobe reached the Wieruszów Upthrust at a similar altitude. Climatically induced process of the ice-sheet degradation began with the development of crevasses and cracks in the places of irregularities in the topography of the sub-Quaternary bedrock. This {{led to the formation of}} marginal zone delineated by the maximum extend of the ice-sheet and by its extent during the main stagnation phase, when the contact with the active ice mass was retained. Inside this zone the landforms associated with stagnant ice downwasting are found. These include <b>kames,</b> karne <b>terraces,</b> karne plateaux, kettles, post-glacial depressions, small outwash plains, latent fragments of pradolinas. Topographic watersheds separate former inward and outward meltwater flow directions. Four subsequent phases of the ice-sheet degradation and the corresponding zones: I - Dzialoszyn, II - Sieradz, III - Niemysłów and Kalisz zones comprise a similar range of landforms and the pattern of flow directions inherited from the areał deglaciation (Fig. 3 and 4). The formation of the zones can be related to the elevations of the sub-Wartanian base, mainly of Mesozoic and Neogene age. Groups of kames (Fig. 1 and 5) are also the evidence of the areal deglaciation. On elevations of the substratum elongated crevasses developed in the downwasting ice. They were then filled with gravel and sand - mainly of inglacial or supraglacial origin. The areas situated between subsequent deglaciation zones and the groups of karnes are usually build of till that forms low relief of undulating ground moraine. Proces rozprzestrzeniania lądolodu warciańskiego w środkowej Polsce postępował ku południowi dolinami Prosny, Warty i Widawki. Udokumentowane jest to gliną zwałową, dobrze zachowaną na stokach dolin kopalnych starszych od zlodowacenia warciańskiego. W części południowej lobu południowowielkopolskiego (5 I, 30 aN) wyodrębniły się loby niższego rzędu Prosny, Warty i Widawki. Klimatycznie uwarunkowany proces zanikania lądolodu rozpoczyna się przetainami i spękaniami na elewacjach podłoża podwarciańskiego. Prowadzi to do powstania stref brzeżnych ograniczonych każdorazowo linią maksymalnego zasięgu lądolodu i linią głównego etapu postojowego, zachowującego więź z żywym lądolodem. Kolejne etapy zanikania lądolodu warciańskiego w strefach: I działoszyńskiej, II sieradzkiej, III niemysłowskiej i kaliskiej mają podobny inwentarz form rzeźby i układ odpływu wód odziedziczony z deglacjacji arealnej (rys. l, 3 i 4). Obszary leżące pomiędzy kolejnymi strefami brzeżnymi zbudowane są przeważnie z glin zwałowych moreny dennej, która miejscami powleczona jest utworami pokrywowymi...|$|R
