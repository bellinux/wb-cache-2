5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{increase}} in the numbers of skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand <b>for</b> <b>office</b> workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S firms becoming larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale. It was also driven by changing technology. The typewriter was joined in the office by the adding machine, the telephone and filing cabinets, all adding to the demand <b>for</b> <b>office</b> space and requiring increasingly specialised workers.|$|E

5|$|After the war, de Peyster served {{overseas}} as a dignitary. When {{he returned}} to the United States, he ran <b>for</b> <b>office</b> and was elected to the State Assembly.

In 1900, the family feud culminated in a race for the office of Mayor of their native town, father running against son. After defeating his father, who owned the town hall, he was forced to move the Mayor's office to a new building. He died in 1903, survived by his three daughters.|$|E
5|$|Among the organisations that Playford {{belonged to}} was the local {{branch of the}} Liberal Federation, yet until the months {{preceding}} his eventual election, he never talked of holding political office.

In 1932 the Liberal and Country League (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the multi-member constituency of Murray at the 1933 election.|$|E

5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} <b>for</b> <b>office</b> {{was challenged}} {{on the basis}} of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election.

A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.|$|E

This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary {{groups such as the}} fasci femminilli and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from Prime Minister Benito Mussolini's more conservative coalition partners.|$|E
