Electromagnetic compatibility studies require that the fields from sources of electric power be well known. Unfortunately, many of these sour-ces are not defined to the desired degree of accuracy. This applies e. g. {{to the case of}} the twisted-wire pair used in telephone communication; already practiced is twisting of insulated high-voltage three phase power cables and single-phase distribution cables as well.

For the <b>helical</b> <b>conductor</b> with finite length the method is based on the Biot-Savart law. Since the lay-out of the cables is much more similar to a broken line than to strait line, in the paper the magnetic flux densities produced by <b>helical</b> <b>conductor</b> of complex geometry are also derived.

Due to the overlap, disorder backscattering is possible and allows a localization transition. A conductor can pass through two localization transitions with increasing field, one from the conventionally localized system to the quasi-helical conductor (with localization length exceeding the system length), and one at a higher field again to a localized state, due now, however, to backscattering below the magnetic field induced pseudo-gap.

The setup used is a three-dimensional periodic cube of a size several times the correlation length of the interstellar turbulence.

Hydrodynamical and nonhelical simulations are run for comparison to determine the effects the magnetic field has upon the gas itself. Turbulence is simulated by <b>external</b> <b>helical</b> forcing of varying strength, which is known to create a large-scale dynamo of alpha squared-type. The nonhelical cases are also explored in an attempt to create a small-scale dynamo at high Rm, but no dynamo action could be detected in the range of Rm ~ 30 – 150. The hydrodynamical simulations reproduce the tendency of the gas to separate into two phases if an unstable cooling function is present. The critical magnetic Reynolds number of the large-scale dynamo was observed to be almost twice as large for the unstable versus stable cooling function, indicating that the dynamo is harder to excite when TI is present.

These results are based on a one-year, multi-frequency (15, 24, and 43 GHz) Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) monitoring of the TeV blazar Markarian 421 (Mrk 421). We investigate the Faraday screen properties and its location with respect to the jet emitting region. Given that the 43 GHz radio core flux density and the RM time evolution suggest a similar trend, we explore the possible connection between the RM and the accretion rate. Among the various scenarios that we explore, the jet sheath is the most promising candidate for being the main source of Faraday rotation. During the one-year observing period the RM trend shows two sign reversals, which may be qualitatively interpreted {{within the context of the}} magnetic tower models. We invoke the presence of two nested helical magnetic fields in the relativistic jet with opposite helicities, whose relative contribution produce the observed RM values. The inner helical field has the poloidal component (B_ p) oriented in the observer's direction and produces a positive RM, while the outer helical field, with B_ p in the opposite direction, produces a negative RM. We assume that the <b>external</b> <b>helical</b> field dominates the contribution to the observed RM, while the internal helical field dominates when a jet perturbation arises during the second observing epoch. Being the intrinsic polarization angle parallel to the jet axis, a pitch angle of the helical magnetic field ϕ≳ 70 ^∘ is required.

40|$|In the {{machining}} industry, {{there is a}} constant need to increase productivity while also maintaining dimensional tolerances and good surface quality. For many classical machining operations (e. g. milling, turning, and broaching), research has been established that is able to predict the part quality based on process parameters, workpiece material, and the machine’s dynamic characteristics. This allows process planners to design their programs virtually to maximize productivity while meeting the specified part quality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to predict the cutting forces during {{the machining}} operation. This can be done using analytical equations for a lot of operations; however, in more recent research for complicated processes (e. g. 5 -axis milling, gear hobbing), this is done by calculating the cutter-workpiece engagement with geometric CAD modellers and calculating incremental cutting forces along the cutting edge. With knowledge of the cutting forces, static deflections and dynamic vibrations of the tool and workpiece can be calculated {{which is one of the}} most prominent contributors to dimensional part inaccuracies and poor surface quality in machining. The research presented in this thesis aims to achieve similar goals for the gear shaping process. Gear shaping is one of the most prominent methods of machining cylindrical gears. More specifically, it is the most prominent method for generating internal gears which are a major component in planetary gear boxes. The gear shaping process uses a modified external gear as a cutting tool which reciprocates up and down to cut the teeth in the workpiece. Simultaneously, the tool and workpiece are also rotating proportionally to their gear ratio which emulate the rolling of two gears. During the beginning of each gear shaping pass, the tool is radially fed into the workpiece until the desired depth of cut is reached. In this study, the three kinematic components (reciprocating feed, rotary feed, and radial feed) are mathematically modelled using analytical equations and experimentally verified using captured CNC signals from the controller of a Liebherr LSE 500 gear shaping machine. To predict cutting forces in gear shaping, the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is calculated at discrete time steps using a discrete solid modeller called ModuleWorks. From the CWE in dexel form, the two-dimensional chip geometry is reconstructed using Delaunay triangulation and alpha shape reconstruction which is then used to determine the undeformed chip area along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is discretized into nodes with varying cutting directions (tangential, feed, and radial), inclination angle, and rake angle. If engaged in cutting during a time step, each node contributes an incremental three dimensional force vector calculated with the oblique cutting force model. Using a 3 -axis dynamometer, the cutting force prediction algorithm was experimentally verified on a variety of processes and gears which included an internal spur gear, external spur gear, and <b>external</b> <b>helical</b> gear. The simulated and measured force profiles correlate very closely (about 3 - 10 % RMS error) with the most error occurring in the <b>external</b> <b>helical</b> gear case. These errors may be attributable due to rubbing of the tool which is evident through visible gouges on the finished workpiece, tool wear on the helical gear shaper, and different cutting speed than the process for which the cutting coefficients were calibrated. More experiments are needed to verify the sources of error in the helical gear case. To simulate elastic tool deflection in gear shaping, the tool’s static stiffness is estimated from impact hammer testing. Then, based on the predicted cutting force, the elastic deflection of the tool is calculated at each time step. To examine the affect of tool deflection on the final quality of the gear, a virtual gear measurement module is developed and used to predict the involute profile deviations in the virtually machined part. Simulated and measured profile deviations were compared for a one-pass external spur gear process and a two-pass external spur gear process. The simulated profile errors correlate very well with the measured profiles on the left flank of the workpiece, however additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model on the right flank. Furthermore, the model also serves as a basis for future research in dyamic vibrations in gear shaping. The above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented into a tool called ShapePRO (developed in C++). The software is meant for process planners to be able to simulate the gear shaping operation virtually and inspect the resulting quality of the gear. Accordingly, the user may iterate the process parameters to maximize productivity while meeting the customer’s desired gear quality...|$|R

Three parametric equations are used to describe the center line of the double and triple helical wires. A companion parametric equation, using two parameters, describes the double and triple helical wire surfaces. These equations are used to produce plots of the three-dimensional shape of individual helical wires and second, third degree helical cable. Such plots are useful in designing cables where geometrical interrelationships are easily understood...|$|R
