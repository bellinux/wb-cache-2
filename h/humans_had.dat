5|$|The Orcs {{enlarged}} {{the portal}} {{until they could}} transport seven warriors, who massacred a Human village. The raiding party brought back samples of good food and fine worksmanship, and a report that the Humans were defenseless. The Orcs' raiding parties grew larger and bolder, until they assaulted Azeroth's principal castle. However, the <b>Humans</b> <b>had</b> been training warriors of their own, especially the mounted, heavily armed Knights. These, assisted by Human Sorcerers, gradually forced the Orcs to retreat through the portal, which the <b>Humans</b> <b>had</b> not discovered.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Beringian wolf, other Beringian carnivores include the Beringian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), scimitar-toothed cat (Homotherium serum), short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), and the omnivorous brown bear (Ursus arctos). Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> reached the Bluefish Caves in the Yukon Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being found there on specimens of Yukon horse, steppe bison, caribou, wapiti (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{was aware}} of the severe {{reaction}} {{in some parts of the}} scientific community against the suggestion made in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation that <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> arisen from animals by a process of transmutation. Therefore, he almost completely ignored the topic of human evolution in On the Origin of Species. Despite this precaution, the issue featured prominently in the debate that followed the book's publication. For most of the first half of the 19th century, the scientific community believed that, although geology had shown that the Earth and life were very old, human beings had appeared suddenly just a few thousand years before the present. However, a series of archaeological discoveries in the 1840s and 1850s showed stone tools associated with the remains of extinct animals. By the early 1860s, as summarized in Charles Lyell's 1863 book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man, it had become widely accepted that <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> existed during a prehistoric period—which stretched many thousands of years before the start of written history. This view of human history was more compatible with an evolutionary origin for humanity than was the older view. On the other hand, at that time there was no fossil evidence to demonstrate human evolution. The only human fossils found before the discovery of Java Man in the 1890s were either of anatomically modern humans or of Neanderthals that were too close, especially in the critical characteristic of cranial capacity, to modern humans for them to be convincing intermediates between humans and other primates.|$|E
5|$|<b>Humans</b> <b>had</b> {{free will}} to ignore divine {{guidance}} {{and the behavior}} required by maat, but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves. A deity carried out this punishment using its ba, the force that manifested the god's power in the human world. Natural disasters and human ailments were seen {{as the work of}} angry divine bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm, and Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|In the Halo universe, <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> {{advanced}} to a comparable level {{of technology to}} the Forerunners but, after losing a war with them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as {{they do not have the}} technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E
50|$|Cats {{have seven}} {{cervical}} vertebrae like almost all mammals, thirteen thoracic vertebrae (<b>humans</b> <b>have</b> twelve), seven lumbar vertebrae (<b>humans</b> <b>have</b> five), three sacral vertebrae (<b>humans</b> <b>have</b> five {{because of their}} bipedal posture), and, except for Manx cats and other shorter tailed cats, twenty-two or twenty-three caudal vertebrae (<b>humans</b> <b>have</b> three to five, fused into an internal coccyx). The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's enhanced spinal mobility and flexibility, compared to humans. The caudal vertebrae form the tail, used by the cat as a counterbalance to the body during quick movements. Between their vertebrae, they have elastic discs, useful for cushioning the jump landings.|$|R

5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest at its base. An extensive wild animal community once thrived {{in the area of}} Level Mountain. This included a wide range of animal species with caribou being the most abundant. <b>Humans</b> <b>had</b> arrived at Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s. This remote area of Cassiar Land District has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|The Didact and his {{makeshift}} crew {{travel to}} an ancient Precursor planet, Charum Hakkor, where <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> once also settled. The Didact is disturbed to find {{that many of the}} Precursor structures on the planet have fallen into ruin; Precursor structures were thought to be completely indestructible. The Didact also discovers that a prisoner, ensconced in both Precursor and human containment methods, has escaped. They travel to the nearby planet of Faun Hakkor, another formerly human-settled world, to find it stripped of all sentient life, its ecosystem in peril. The Didact sponsors Bornstellar's first mutation, a vital part of Forerunner growth, imprinting himself upon Bornstellar. The Didact's memories, tactics and experiences are shared with Bornstellar, giving him insight into the context of the Forerunner-human war and the planets the crew had just visited.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree that}} Hexxus is imprisoned in is cut down by Tony and Ralph, Zak's superiors. Hexxus quickly begins {{to regain his}} powers by feeding on pollution. He manipulates the humans to drive to FernGully. In FernGully, Zak meets Pips, a fairy envious of Zak's {{relationship}} with Crysta. Zak begins {{to fall in love}} with Crysta, but hides the true reason that the <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> returned. When the signs of Hexxus's resurrection begin to manifest themselves in poisoned trees and rivers, he finally admits that humans are destroying the forest. The fairies mount an attempt to defend their homes, but knowing their fight is hopeless, Zak convinces Batty to aid him in stopping the machine before it destroys them. When Zak makes his presence known to Tony and Ralph, Hexxus takes over the machine and begins to wildly destroy the forest.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the rise with {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> been more common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, {{to the extent that the}} jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native Americans that people would not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|E

25|$|Past {{theories}} {{of how the}} first people came into the New World stated that they arrived via the Bering Bridge that connected Asia and North America. The theory stated these nomads descended from hunting families and had acquired the skills to track down and kill large mammals. By this time, <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> developed preliminary weapons used for hunting. These weapons included the Clovis points, which were narrow, carved stone projectiles used specifically for big game. A couple hundred years later, <b>humans</b> <b>had</b> established the atlatl, an invention {{that allowed them to}} throw spears at their prey. These inventions allowed hunters to put distance between them and their prey, potentially making it less dangerous to approach these ground sloths.|$|E
