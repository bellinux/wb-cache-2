5|$|Although the {{proteasome}} normally produces {{very short}} peptide fragments, {{in some cases}} these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules. Certain transcription factors regulating the expression of specific genes, including one component of the mammalian complex NF-κB, are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form. Such activity requires the proteasome to cleave the substrate protein internally, rather than processively degrading <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> terminus. It {{has been suggested that}} long loops on these proteins' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity, while the majority of the protein remains outside. Similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins; this mechanism of selective degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin/proteasome dependent processing (RUP).|$|E

Young, a captain in the United States Navy, had flown on three spaceflights prior to Apollo 16: Gemini 3, Gemini 10 and Apollo 10, which orbited the Moon. One of 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966, Duke had never flown in space before Apollo 16. He served on the support crew of Apollo 10 and was a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) for Apollo 11.|$|E

5|$|The {{mail pouch}} was a {{separate}} component to the saddle {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E

After dealing with Opie, Ichigo finds out that the Quincies are attacking the Soul Society. Arriving just after Head Captain Yamamoto's death, Ichigo encounters the Wandenreich's leader Yhwach. At {{the end of the}} encounter, which ends in a draw, Ichigo learns his mother was a Quincy. During the fight, Ichigo's Zanpakutō is shattered while attempting to stop Yhwach from escaping. Ichigo goes back to the World of Living where he learns the truth that his mother was a Quincy who was on a verge of hollowification until she was saved by Isshin at the cost of his Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo later learns that entity he believed to be Zangetsu is actually the embodiment of his Quincy powers yet accept him as he gains his reforged Zanpakutō in its new split Shikai form. During the second invasion by the Wandenreich, Ichigo and his friends confront Yhwach at the Soul King's Palace. During the prolonged fight that followed, Ichigo is defeated by Yhwach. With help from new allies, Ichigo faces Yhwach once again and slices him in two after getting help from the now free Aizen. Ten years after Yhwach's defeat, Ichigo and Orihime have a son named Kazui, who destroys the remnants of Yhwach's power.|$|E

He resisted reform efforts from Ambassador to Japan Edwin O. Reischauer and President John F. Kennedy. He resigned from the office and the military in August 1964.|$|E

[...] The anecdote was first reported by biographer Parson Weems, who interviewed people after Washington's death who knew him as a child over a half-century earlier. The Weems text was very widely reprinted throughout the 19th century, for example in McGuffey Readers. Adults wanted children to learn moral lessons from history, especially as taught by example from the lives of great national heroes like Washington. After 1890 historians insisted on scientific research methods to validate every statement, {{and there was no}} documentation for this anecdote apart from Weems' report that he learned <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> of the neighbors who knew the young Washington. Joseph Rodman claimed in 1904 that Weems plagiarized other Washington tales from published fiction set in England, but no one has found an alternative source for the cherry tree story.|$|E
