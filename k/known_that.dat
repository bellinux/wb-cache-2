40|$|How {{much can}} we turn the screw on counter-examples to the KK principle? The principle, also {{sometimes}} called “positive introspection”, says <b>that</b> if one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P. It is widely, although not universally, {{acknowledged that the}} KK principle is false, {{and not just for}} the boring reason <b>that</b> one can <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P without having formed the belief <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P. One can <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, and believe <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, without knowing <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, because one is not in a strong enough epistemic position to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P (Williamson 2000 : 114 - 30). One’s epistemic position is weaker with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P itself. But how much weaker can one’s epistemic position be with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P? Of course, if one does <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, one’s epistemic position with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P cannot be so bad <b>that</b> one positively <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> one does not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, as opposed to merely failing to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, for knowing is 1 factive: one can know only what is indeed the case.

40|$|In 1995, I {{wrote an}} essay 'Existence'.

The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious long distance trading that was the preserve of the elite. The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the underworld; the patron deities of merchants were two underworld gods carrying backpacks. When merchants travelled, they painted themselves black, like their patron gods, and went heavily armed.|$|E
