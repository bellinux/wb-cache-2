The neural activity for the emotion of Envy (the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>displeasure</b> at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person’s self-concept was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class snobbery. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and Schadenfreude (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the insular lobe, and with increased activity in the striate nucleus; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of empathy (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).|$|E

We confound the trouble they give us, with their real moral turpitude, and measure the one by the other. Now if a fault prevails in school, one teacher will scold and fret himself about it, day after day, until his scholars are tired both of school and of him: and yet he will do nothing effectual to remove it. Another will take efficient and decided measures, and yet say very little on the subject, and the whole evil will be removed, without suspending for a moment, the good humor, and pleasant feeling, which should prevail in school.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold.

Second, to apply my interpretation of the sublime and ugliness to contemporary art, and to resolve certain issues that have been raised in accounting for the possibility of artistic sublimity. I argue that an experience of a genuine artistic sublimity is an uncommon occurrence. I propose that the value of contemporary art can be best explained by referring to Kant’s notion of ugliness and his theory of aesthetic ideas...|$|E

40|$|Kant {{asserts that}} the {{incentive}} which makes humans head for moral act is their feeling {{of respect for the}} moral law. The moral law exists a priori as the law of reason and directly determines the will. But it is merely formal and has not any content. Therefore the law itself has not any reference to human feelings. According to Kant, the morality is not grounded on feelings and desires, but rather on negation of them. The morality is grounded on the observance of the moral law. Then what motivates the human will to the morality? Kant maintains that the moral law determines directly the human will, forming the law of the will, which prevents feelings and desires from intervening the exercise of the will. It arouses the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>displeasure</b> in the human mind, but it realizes the moral law, arousing the feeling of respect at the same time. This feeling of respect for the moral law is the incentive which makes the will head for the moral act. The feeling of respect for the moral law also arouses Interest in the morality in our conducts. And this interest undergoes logical scrutiny through the maxim of conduct, breeding consciousness as to whether the maxim applies universally or not. That is to say, the interest provides a way in which the moral law realizes itself in actual condusts. Kant calls this series of the movements of mind the true 'Moral Sentiment'. ...|$|E

Essa restrição acaba por deixar os juízos teleológicos fora da conexão geral anteriormente estabelecida.

40|$|Aesthetics can {{be defined}} as our ability to perceive, feel and sense objects in the world and assign them {{positive}} or negative values along a continuum between beauty and ugliness. The psychological processes underlying the sense of what is beautiful or ugly imply perception and appraisal of objects of art, as well as emotional and interoceptive reactivity towards them.

Studies indicate that specific brain areas process perception of static or dynamic bodies.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} quality of life in patients' who had survived a cardiac arrest and were treated with an implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD). Two groups were compared, those that had received an ICD with those that were treated otherwise. This thesis comprises several studies on cardiac arrest survivors and especially those that received an ICD therapy. In chapter 1 we described quality of life and the determinants of quality of life. The study design is also described in this chapter. The sample consisted of 168 consecutive patients who were admitted to the hospital after OHCA. The patients completed a questionnaire at baseline, and at one, six and 12 months. The questionnaire contained items on quality of life (Rand- 36 and HPPQ), depressive symptomatology (CES-D), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory), coping (Utrecht Coping List), social support (Social Support List Interactions), social activities (subscale EORTC), sexuality (subscale EORTC), satisfaction with patient education (patient education questionnaire), continuity of care (CCCpQ) and utilization of care (RC-UD survey). In Chapter 2 the results are presented on the relationship between continuity of care and quality of life. We found no significant association between patient education, continuity of care and quality of life in either group. We, however, did find an association between patient satisfaction with received care and quality of life. Chapter 3 reports on a 12 month quality of life assessment of cardiac arrest survivors treated with or without an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. No differences were found between the ICD group and control group regarding quality of life and well-being. A significant improvement in physical and social functioning, and mental health were found in the first six months. The prevalence of anxiety and probable depression was high irrespective of the treatment received: anxiety and depressive symptoms did not change significantly between 1 and 12 months after discharge. Chapter 4 details the factors that predict quality of life and depression in ICD recipients. Mental health, appraisal support, <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>displeasure</b> and physical functioning measured at baseline (before treatment) were significant predictors of quality of life in ICD recipients at 12 months. In Chapter 5 we assessed quality of life, depression and anxiety in ICD recipients who did and did not experience an ICD shock delivery. Significant differences were found within the groups over time regarding physical role limitations (p < 0. 051). Those who experienced shocks throughout the year (group 1) felt more limited in their daily activities due to physical or mental problems. We concluded that overall quality of life and psychological well-being did not change in ICD recipients, irrespective of whether they experienced defibrillatory shocks. Chapter 6 describes the content of the qualitative study. Seven major categories were derived from the analysis: anxiety, uncertainty, disappointment, frustration, unexpected barriers, acceptance of and dependency on the ICD played a major role in the lives of ICD recipients. This study leads us to believe that survival of cardiac arrest has a greater impact on quality of life than the type of therapy received after the event...|$|R

40|$|The {{familiar}} {{terrain of}} Kant's {{account of the}} mind involves a two-fold distinction: between the two major faculties of cognition and desire, and between the higher and lower sub-faculties of each. But Kant's account of the mind contains a third major faculty that is missing from this picture [...] the faculty <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> pleasure and <b>displeasure.</b> Roughly, this is the faculty responsible for subjective sensation and feeling/emotion. However, at this point, a tension emerges. Just as the higher faculties of cognition and desire are identified with a function of reason, so, too, is the higher faculty <b>of</b> <b>feeling.</b> But {{if this is the}} case, does it mean that reason has or produces its own emotions? And if so, what could these emotions be like? Furthermore, wouldn't they conflict with the dichotomy thought to exist in Kant between reason and emotion (due in part to the metaphysical constraints of his theory) ? In my dissertation, I argue that Kant (implicitly) conceives of emotion in functional terms. That is, emotions are evaluative judgments that initiate action. These judgments can manifest themselves in a variety of forms, depending on the objects and principles involved. This turn to a functional conception thus gives Kant the flexibility to account for emotions across a wide spectrum, from the instinctual emotions of non-rational, embodied animals to the purely rational emotions of a non-embodied god. My dissertation first develops the basic functional structure of emotion implicit in Kant's work (found especially in the Lectures on Metaphysics). It then shows the implications this cognitive structure has for understanding several central features of Kant's practical theory, including the nature of animal versus human non-moral motivation, happiness, and finally, the moral <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> respect...|$|R
