5|$|Immediately after Luna's death, {{confusion}} reigned on both sides. The Americans {{even thought}} Luna {{had taken over}} to replace Aguinaldo. Luna's death was publicly declared only by 8 June, and a circular providing details of the event released by 13 June. While investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna's death, not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon García {{said that it was}} he who was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct the assassination of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness at the time prevented his participation in the assassination. Aguinaldo would be firm in his stand that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the assassination of Luna.|$|E
5|$|Writer and {{producer}} Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited {{his parents in}} St. Louis, Missouri {{after the release of}} Used Cars. Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale thought about the president of his own graduating class, who was someone <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with. Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when, in fact, she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.|$|E
5|$|In mid-April, Armbrust rockets {{were fired}} from Croatian {{positions}} outside Borovo Selo into the village. According to {{one version of}} the event, several rounds were fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades in the outskirts of Borovo Selo. According to a second version, three rockets were fired on the village with the specific aim of inflaming ethnic tensions. One of the rockets hit a house and another landed in a field, failing to explode. There were no casualties, but the already tense situation was made worse when the unexploded rocket was shown on Serbian Television as evidence of Croatian aggression against Serbs. The rockets were fired {{by a group of}} men that were led to the site by Osijek police chief Josip Reihl-Kir, who was later murdered by Croat irregulars. Croatia's interior minister Josip Boljkovac said the group included Deputy Defence Minister Gojko Šušak, Branimir Glavaš and Vice Vukojević. Šušak claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the incident but had been in the area at the time. Nikola Jaman, at the time a commander of the local Police Reserve unit, said that he led the action and denied that Šušak, Glavaš and Vukojević were in the group. Jaman noted that the action was planned together with Reihl-Kir.|$|E

5|$|When {{both men}} were arrested on 18 January, Carty said he was {{innocent}} of the allegations and claimed {{he had been in}} a pub in Kilburn with relatives and friends, and stayed the night at a relative's house. When police searched his home, they found a pair of trainers that forensic tests showed had a drop of ap Rhys Pryce's blood on one toe. DNA from several people, including Brown, were found on the trainers. Officers also found a top with traces of Brown's DNA, and fibres found on Pryce's overcoat were microscopically indistinguishable from the material of that top. Brown also said he had been in Kilburn {{the night of the murder}} and initially claimed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with either the robbery of the other man or the robbery and murder of Pryce. When the mobile phone of the other victim (Ali) was discovered at his home, he claimed he had bought it from two men. Detectives also found that Brown had hoarded press cuttings of Pryce.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot {{go back to his}} apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On {{the way out of the}} bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E
5|$|Whilst at a {{boot camp}} trip with Steph and Fernando, Steph {{believes}} Gilly has feelings for Sarah, and is unaware his feelings are for her. During the trip, after Steph, Fernando and Gilly leave, Sarah is {{killed in a}} tragic parachute jump. Gilly writes a poem for Steph, and in it, offends Fernando. When Steph reads it she is angry at Gilly, who tells her it is Rhys who has the feelings for her. Fernando punches Rhys as Gilly convinces Steph <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the poem. In order to make Steph jealous, Gilly kisses Cheryl {{who is trying to}} make Calvin jealous. Despite using him, Cheryl develops true feelings for Gilly. Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson) works out that Gilly is in love with Steph. However, Gilly denies it, saying that he loves Cheryl. Cheryl catches Gilly looking at an engagement ring, which Fernando has bought for Steph. She assumes the ring is for her and tells everyone in The Dog in the Pond that she and Gilly are getting married. Gilly reluctantly goes along, not wanting to hurt her feelings. Cheryl notices the growing closeness between Gilly and Steph and confronts him. On discovering he is in love with Steph, she breaks off their engagement, at the same time Steph and Fernando break up. Gilly goes travelling with Zoe and Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst). Steph, after being told about Gilly's feelings for her, rushes after him to admit her love just as Gilly leaves. Gilly returns on 5 March with his girlfriend Jem. Steph is upset when he proposes to Jem. Steph admits her feelings to Gilly, but he decides to stay with Jem.

25|$|Nine of the {{prominent}} German scientists who published reports in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte {{as members of}} the Uranverein were picked up by Operation Alsos and incarcerated in England under Operation Epsilon: Erich Bagge, Kurt Diebner, Walther Gerlach, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Werner Heisenberg, Horst Korsching, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker and Karl Wirtz. Also incarcerated was Max von Laue, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the nuclear energy project. Goudsmit, the chief scientific advisor to Operation Alsos, thought von Laue might be beneficial to the postwar rebuilding of Germany and would benefit from the high level contacts he would have in England.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s): e.g. Kossuth-díj ‘Kossuth Prize’ is also hyphenated, {{even if it}} is not a prize by Lajos Kossuth, and {{no reason}} can be found for an actual compound: <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the prize, it was only named for his honour. This rule is also often ignored when it is {{considered}} to be overruled by another rule concerning names of institutions, e.g. in the name of Mindszenty-emlékhely ‘Mindszenty Memorial’, advertised as Mindszenty Emlékhely. In fact, in this case there is a double reason to capitalize Mindszenty (as a name of a person and the beginning letter of the institution name) but the second element of the compound should not be affected.|$|E

The Casqui received advance warning of the planned attack and decided to return the looted items and issue an apology in order to stave off retribution from the combined Spanish and Pacaha force. De Soto arranged a dinner for the two leaders and arranged a peace treaty between the two groups. As a gesture of gratitude for the arrangement of peace and also to outdo his rival, who had only presented a daughter to de Soto, Chief Pacaha presented de Soto {{with one of his}} wives, one of his sisters, and another woman from his tribe. The de Soto expedition stayed at Pacaha's village for approximately 40 days.|$|E

500|$|Crumley joined Bristol City, newly {{promoted}} to the Second Division for 1923–24, as a backup to Frank Vallis. By 13 October, with Bristol City already bottom {{of the table and}} both Vallis and Robert Goddard already tried in goal, Crumley made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Southampton. According to the Western Daily Press, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> so [...] "we [...] yet to learn... how good he is when asked to meet League requirements". He kept his place for the next match, a 1–0 defeat to Fulham, in which he exhibited a tendency to rush off his line when he should not, but that was his last appearance in the League side.|$|E
500|$|In December 803 (Treadgold {{puts it in}} 804), however, a {{group of}} [...] "Lycaonian" [...] (possibly Paulician) {{soldiers}} disembarked at Prote and blinded Bardanes. This was a highly symbolic act: blinding was the usual punishment usually meted out to heretics and rebels, or to deposed emperors and other political rivals {{to prevent them from}} becoming a threat. It is very likely that this was done {{at the behest of the}} Emperor himself, although in a later public statement before the Senate, Nikephoros swore that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. Most scholars believe in Nikephoros's direct involvement, but Treadgold holds it likelier that the soldiers acted on their own, since Bardanes was no longer a credible threat to the Emperor. In the event, despite pressure from the Patriarch and the Senate to punish the perpetrators, and his own pledge to do so, Nikephoros let them go.|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to {{try to come up with}} a way to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E
