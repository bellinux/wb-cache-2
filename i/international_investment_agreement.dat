50|$|An <b>International</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Agreement</b> (IIA) {{is a type}} of treaty between {{countries}} that addresses issues relevant to cross-border investments, usually for the purpose of protection, promotion and liberalization of such investments. Most IIAs cover foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio investment, but some exclude the latter. Countries concluding IIAs commit themselves to adhere to specific standards on the treatment of foreign investments within their territory. IIAs further define procedures for the resolution of disputes should these commitments not be met. The most common types of IIAs are Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and Preferential Trade and Investment Agreements (PTIAs). International Taxation Agreements and Double Taxation Treaties (DTTs) are also considered as IIAs, as taxation commonly has an important impact on foreign investment.|$|E

40|$|The term "investor" in {{international}} investment agreements The {{aim of this}} thesis is to explain, compare and evaluate the meaning of investor {{as one of the}} key terms used in the area of international investment protection.

The subjects carrying out these operations are called investors. However the framework of international investment protection {{as we know it today}} started out when the so called bilateral investment treaties (BITs) became commonly used to protect and promote international investing. These treaties entered into by states as sovereign members of the international community stipulated conditions to protect each other's investors in order to stimulate the flow of free capital over the borders.

40|$|The <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreement</b> regime, one of {{the more}} obscure global institutions, has a {{significant}} impact upon how states, local governments and communities develop. Many investment agreements include investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanisms, which seek to protect investors from unjust expropriation by host states. Yet, the implications of such a mechanism for fulfilling the vision of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have never been studied. This thesis examines the ISDS mechanism by conducting a case study of the Chevron v. Ecuador (II) [CvE 2] investment arbitration. The thesis analyses case documents such as hearing transcripts, decisions and submissions to identify the discourses at work within the arbitration; determine the implications of such discourses for processual developments; and explore how such processes influence the space afforded to those nongovernmental organisations and environmental justice groups affected by the arbitration. The research utilises an analytical framework informed by critical development theory and environmental justice theory, to demonstrate that the CvE 2 arbitration is dominated by an exclusive discourse that prioritises a strict adherence to international investment law, to the exclusion of other principles such as those of international human rights law and environmental law. The dominance of such a discourse reduces the legitimacy of the institution and its rulings for many key stakeholders. The findings also reveal that marginalised stakeholders, such as environmental organisations representing indigenous communities, were refused access to the arbitrations though they were materially affected by the claims, and additionally, were denied consideration - whereby the material impact of the ruling upon the stakeholder group was deemed irrelevant to the proceedings. The findings provide evidence that ISDS, in its current form, is incompatible with the United Nation’s goal for ‘effective, accountable and inclusive institutions’ (United Nations Development Programme, 2016, p. 1). This thesis contributes to the scholarship on environmental justice and environmental policy through its analysis of the implications of arbitration mechanisms embedded in international investment regimes for environmental justice claims and, more broadly, the goal of sustainable development. The thesis highlights the need for further research into investor-state investment arbitrations and provides evidence that significant reform is necessary in order for the institution to be reconciled with the SDGs...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a dramatic development of {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) within the Pacific Rim region, alongside with state controlled entities (SCEs) playing an increasingly prominent role. However, this remarkably rapid growth of FDI led by SCEs has created certain concerns, including notably competitive neutrality (CN) concerns, which have resulted in calls for national and international regulations on such investments. Although national measures have been taken by some States to address such concerns, it is controversial whether {{and to what extent}} such SCEs investment should be regulated by <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreement</b> (IIAs). Among the many issues, the most significant is the question whether and to what extent such SCEs should be treated as qualified investors under IIAs. This article therefore explores the status of state owned entities under international investment agreements within the Pacific Rim region, by addressing two key issues relating to the definition of investor under IIAs. It first discusses whether SCEs are covered by the definition of “investor” under investment treaties. It then analyses whether such SCEs are entitled to initiate the investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism, namely, the “national of [a] Contracting State” requirement under the ICSID Convention. Finally, it discusses the implications for the Pacific Rim region. The review of treaty practices within the Pacific Rim region shows that although the specific language of the “investor” clause varies in IIAs, none of the existing IIA expressly excludes SCEs as qualified investors. It is observed that recent regional agreement negotiations would continuously liberalise and promote FDI, and that limitations and restrictions on SCE investments have been addressed by some developed economies. The ICSID Convention provides a broad coverage for jurisdiction for “nationals” without distinguishing public foreign investors from private foreign investors, but in academia and arbitration practice it is controversial whether SCEs should be limited to access the investor-State arbitration. What is clear is that with the rapid growth of foreign investments by SCEs, the issues of whether the SCEs are qualified as covered investor under the investment treaties and whether SCEs can resort to the ICSID arbitration are likely to be subject to more and more scrutiny and debate. Given the uncertainty resulted from the ambiguity in the bulk of world IIAs and the ICSID Convention on the issue of SCE protection, it is advisable for the governments within the Pacific region to rethink and carefully redefine the relevant terms to achieve further clarify...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to demonstrate, through the {{analysis}} of arbitration awards, that in investor-state arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States ("ICSID Convention"), it has been permissible for claims to be directly based on international law even if it is not specifically designated as the applicable law, and to identify the problems and limits of this jurisprudence. First, it is not only what substantive protection is warranted for investors but also what international law is enforced on host countries through judicial mechanisms initiated by a private party, or conversely whether their actions taken to perform their obligations under international law can be immune, and whether and how international law should be treated as applicable law in investor-state arbitration. Chapter 2 argues that both of these issues need to be considered. Chapter 3 (1) makes the point that with regard to applicable law for investor-state arbitration, in order to address the issue that actions of the governments of host countries are easily legitimatized under their own national laws, legal stratagems have been employed in investment agreements hitherto, and nevertheless, even with the interpretation of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention specifying both domestic law and international law as the applicable law, it is considered that domestic law should be primarily applied, and only if there are lacunae in that law or there is conflict with international law should international law be applied complimentarily. Chapter 3 (2), however, points out that in arbitration based on the relevant provisions of international investment agreements, with regard to claims based on the provisions of such international investment agreements, a number of arbitral awards have been rendered as established precedents to the effect that the international investment agreements themselves are directly applicable on the grounds that the national law of the host country recognizes the applicability of international law within its national law order. Chapter 3 (3) explains the grounds and limitations of that, based on the premise that the direct applicability of international law has been established. First, although arbitration awards state that the national laws of host countries recognize the applicability of international law within its national legal order, it critically examines whether, as a formalistic legal interpretation, that would negate the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, and also whether an <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreement</b> is directly applicable may essentially depend upon the will of the host country. This further argues that it should be determined whether the international law is a treaty that presupposes the enforcement by private parties by means of a judicial mechanism. Chapter 4 further discusses whether any international treaty other than international investment agreements can be indeed directly applicable, even given the general direct applicability of international law. First, paragraph 1 argues that with regard to permitting direct application as the basis for claims, what implementation is supposed varies from one treaty to another, and thus, that it is necessary to examine whether the treaty is supposed to be implemented through the judicial remedial process. Second, paragraph 2 examines, even if direct application is denied as being the base of claims, whether it is necessary to permit a defense to be based upon obligations borne under other treaties. It points out the need for accepting such a defense anyway, in light of the special characteristics of investor-state arbitration that involves relationships with investors who are highly unlikely to have any particular concern over compliance with other treaties. Chapter 5 indicates that as stated above, requests for remedies have become permissible through arbitration directly based upon substantive obligations laid down in international investment agreements, and thus conventional international investment agreements, whose main aim is to make arbitration available as a relief procedure alternative to court proceedings in host countries, have become functionally closer to modern international investment agreements that expressly recognize claims based on the international investment agreements themselves. This also applies to conventional international investment agreements that Japan has concluded. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{covers a}} timely {{set of issues}} {{concerning}} the relationship between intellectual property rights (“IPRs”) associated with foreign investments, state-authorized compulsory licenses, trade law (in particular, the TRIPS Agreement), and claims for indirect expropriation that might be brought in investment arbitration. I focus, as a case study, on compulsory licenses and claims of indirect expropriation. Compulsory licenses bear an inherently contentious character. This government authorized license often presents a clash between significant opposing interests – on one side, the legitimate expectations of patent based foreign investors founded on the <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreement</b> (“IIA”) and a patent regime that, for well established reasons, provides relatively strong protection during the patent’s term, {{and on the other}} side, the strength of the public interest in exceptional cases, such as a public health crisis. The circumstances that may be commonly associated with the issuance of a compulsory license, in which an investor’s existing IP rights and investment position are severely impacted, provide the seeds for a dispute and strong incentive for the investor to seek recourse through available means of dispute settlement. In this context, the compulsory license in relation to IP based investments and claims of indirect expropriation illustrates two levels of complexity for international investment law. First, the tension between investor’s rights and government action in the area of compulsory licensing is but a specialized example of a broader recurrent public policy issue in international investment law. The broader question concerns the appropriate balance between the rights and responsibilities of investors and those of governments. The investor is entitled to have its legitimate expectations with regard to the operation and return on its investment respected by the host state. However, the host state must be able to pursue legitimate regulatory goals without risk of 2 ̆ 7 regulatory chill. 2 ̆ 7 The investment dispute context for a compulsory license brings these countervailing interests to a head, as these issues coalesce around questions of how much leeway governments should have to take actions that may interfere with IPRs and IP-based investments, whether these actions contravene the standards of protection established for foreign investors under national patent laws and IIAs, and whether such measures are otherwise defensible as consistent with non-investment law treaty provisions, such as Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement. The reference to the TRIPS Agreement raises the second point of complexity: the compulsory license provides a case in point to show the interplay between two different treaty-based regimes. A compulsory license-based claim for indirect expropriation against a host state under an IIA may implicate several strands of public law that can be complimentary or competing, integrated or overlapping. International investment law as channeled through the IIA confronts intellectual property law as established through national law or the TRIPS Agreement. The compulsory license brings this confluence of competing legal regimes into stark focus. If a foreign investor believes that a host state has improperly authorized a compulsory license with respect to its patent-based investment, it may face not only a choice of forum in which to vindicate its rights, but also choice of law issues in making out a claim of indirect expropriation. Because investment agreements such as bilateral investment agreements (BIT) stand side-by-side with the WTO multilateral trading system, these respective regimes may afford different levels of protection and different remedies to the foreign investor in a dispute where the investor’s home State and the host State are both members of the WTO, or where the IIA itself makes reference to the TRIPS Agreement. While there has been ample scholarly examination in the areas of investment arbitration and international trade law and related public health issues, much less has been written about intellectual property issues arising under BITs, and even less so in relation to intellectual property (including compulsory licenses) in the context of investor-State arbitration. For this reason I believe my article offers an interesting case study, and makes an important scholarly contribution that would be of interest both to academics and to the broader international dispute settlement community...|$|E
