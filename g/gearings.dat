On {{the basis of the}} comparison results the gearing is solved as a substandard kind of involute gearing. The involute gearing is designed by the method of generalized parameters. For the gearing design the program <b>GEARING</b> – symetrical profile version 1. 5. was used. Consequently this program was adapted for the case of the change of the instrument shape by the user. The kind of wheels material was designed. Further the way of wheels production for single-piece and batch production was also designed.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} approach to Tourism Economics {{is based on}} the systemic nature of tourism, stemming both from the heterogeneity of the tourist package and from the existing complex interactions among destinations, firms, tourists. The systemic nature of tourism and the identification with its geographical representation, that is the destination, introduce the concept of Local Tourist System (LTS). This systemic nature has also been recognized by the Italian legislation by creating of an economic policy instrument, named Local Tourist System: “We call local tourist systems, homogeneous or integrated tourist environments, which include territories belonging even to different regions characterized the offer integrated cultural, environmental and tourist attractions, including typical agricultural and local handicraft products, or by a widespread presence of individual or associated tourist firms” (National Tourist Law Reform, Law 29 March 2001 No. 135, Our Translation). Moving from the assumption, the aim {{of this paper is to}} propose a method to identify LTS. It is applied for identify LTS in Sicily. The method is articulated in two steps. In the first step we proposed use of <b>Gearing’s</b> approach (Gearing, 1976) to measure tourism attraction in Sicily and in the second step, we proposed to use spatial classification with the constraints of contiguity for identify LTS in Siciliy. This study will provide information for policy makers, researchers and whoever wants to implement the idea of collaborating networks in a context of local tourism development...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s 78 of the Gearing-class destroyers {{underwent}} extensive modernization overhauls, known as FRAM I, which {{were designed to}} convert them from an anti-aircraft destroyer to an anti-submarine warfare platform. FRAM I removed all of the DDR and DDE equipment, and these ships were redesignated as DDs. FRAM I and FRAM II conversions were completed 1960-65. Eventually all but four <b>Gearings</b> received FRAM conversions.|$|E
50|$|Many of the <b>Gearings</b> {{provided}} significant gunfire {{support in}} the Vietnam War. They also served as escorts for Carrier Battle Groups (carrier strike groups from 2004) and Amphibious Ready Groups (Expeditionary Strike Groups from 2006). DASH was withdrawn from ASW service in 1969 due to poor reliability. Lacking ASROC, the FRAM II ships were disposed of in 1969-74. With ASROC continuing to provide a standoff ASW capability, the Gearing FRAM Is were retained in service for several years, with most being decommissioned and transferred to foreign navies 1973-80. They were replaced as ASW ships by the s, which were commissioned 1975-83. These had the same ASW armament as a Gearing FRAM destroyer, {{with the addition of}} improved sonar and a piloted helicopter, initially the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite and from 1984 the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk. Some <b>Gearings</b> served in the Naval Reserve Force (NRF) from 1973, remaining in commission with a partial active crew to provide training for Naval reservists. The last Gearing-class destroyer in US naval service was , a FRAM I, decommissioned and struck 1 October 1983 and expended as a target 14 July 1999.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} provide the ships with a {{credible}} anti-submarine weapon, the FRAM I upgrade for the <b>Gearings</b> centered on the addition of AN/SQS-23 sonar and two new weapon systems, the ASROC rocket-assisted torpedo launcher {{with a range of}} 1-5 miles (not in FRAM II upgrades), and the DASH antisubmarine helicopter with a range of up to 22 mi. [...] Both were armed with the new Mark 44 torpedo, which was also carried in torpedo tubes on the ships. ASROC could also launch a nuclear depth charge.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 94 <b>Gearings</b> and 33 Allen M. Sumners {{received}} FRAM modifications 1960-65. Many {{of the ships}} provided significant gunfire support in the Vietnam War. DASH was withdrawn from ASW service in 1969 due to poor reliability. Lacking ASROC, the Allen M. Sumners were left without a standoff ASW capability, and were decommissioned 1970-73, with most being transferred to foreign navies. The <b>Gearings</b> lasted somewhat longer in US service, with most decommissioned and transferred to foreign navies 1973-80. The FRAM destroyers were replaced as ASW ships by the s (destroyer escorts prior to 1975), which were commissioned 1969-74, and the s, which were commissioned 1975-83. Both of the replacement classes had the same ASW armament as a Gearing FRAM I destroyer, {{with the addition of}} improved sonar and a piloted helicopter, typically the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite. Some ships of both the Allen M. Sumner (from 1965) and Gearing classes (from 1973) served in the Naval Reserve Force (NRF), remaining in commission with a partial active crew to provide training for Naval reservists.

50|$|In 1945 the Navy began {{converting}} 24 {{out of the}} 98 <b>Gearings</b> to be {{radar picket}} ships (designated DDR in 1949) that could provide early warning of massed attack without overwhelming their Combat Information Centers. Leary was overhauled to upgrade her to a radar picket destroyer, which included installing the most advanced radar systems at the time. She then departed for Boston, Massachusetts where some fire control work was done. This work was interrupted by V-J Day celebrations. Later, the ship steamed on up to Casco Bay where she operated with a Task Force to assigned to develop defenses against kamikaze attacks.|$|E
5000|$|BMX {{bikes are}} built for dirt jumping, {{and tend to}} have a longer top tube than a street BMX bike and are often more robustly built. They will rarely have pegs fitted. Traditionally, DJ (dirt jump) bikes ran only a rear v-brake but disc brakes are {{becoming}} more common. DJ tires are treaded, as opposed to the slicks and semi-slicks used for park riding. Some riders prefer large, padded seats for in-flight tricks while others do not find seat size an issue. The gear ratio is generally around 44:16, 36:13, 33:12, 30:11 or 25:9 though using small <b>gearings</b> such as 25:9, known as 'micro gearing', has become popular.|$|E
50|$|Ships {{from the}} Gearing class were {{completely}} torn down and rebuilt from the hull up, including new engines, {{a much larger}} combat information center, and new sonar and radar systems. The 21-inch torpedo tubes between the funnels were removed, and the 8-round ASROC launcher (FRAM I only) placed there instead. All 3-inch/50 cal gun mounts were removed, and the after superstructure {{was used for the}} DASH's hangar and flight deck, with two new triple Mark 32 torpedo tubes for the 12.75-inch Mk.44 torpedo placed just behind the rear funnel. This modernization was designed to extend the life of the destroyer by at least eight years. Eventually, all but four <b>Gearings</b> received FRAM I or FRAM II conversions.|$|E

5000|$|The first-generation 2002-2005 model years TrailBlazer {{is based}} on a truck {{platform}} called GMT360, with all models having four-wheel drive as an option with both automatic engagement and the more traditional [...] "4 High" [...] and [...] "4 Low" [...] <b>gearings,</b> except the SS model which features an All wheel drive system. The TrailBlazer features an independent front suspension, and a five-link rear suspension.

50|$|Depending on subseries, 1xx, 2xx or 3xx, {{some members}} of this class can drive with maximum speed 100 km/h, 120 km/h, 140 km/h, or 160 km/h (latest series), {{depending}} on the gearing. The most common <b>gearings</b> are for 120 km/h (classes 0xx, 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, 8xx) intended for freight and passenger trains, and 140 km/h (classes 6xx and 7xx) intended for passenger services, with locos for 160 km/h being rare and locos for 100 km/h all converted for 120 km/h. The models with higher maximum speed got less tractive power and are used for passenger or light freight trains only, whereas the models with lower maximum speed got high tractive power and are thus able to pull heavy freight trains as well.|$|E

50|$|The first {{mention of}} a {{windmill}} on this site dates from 1408; however, this probably refers to an older post mill, which was later replaced by the current brick tower mill. Research on the brickwork of European tower mills by a historian points to a year of construction that cannot be earlier than about 1500. The mill was initially the property of Lord of the Duchy Kleef and continued to be owned by successive landlords, until it was sold into private ownership in 1866 to the then leaseholder Van Grinten. After his death, it was sold to mill worker Johannes Gerritsen.In the 1930s, the change was made from wind to motor power, and the sails, tailpole and internal <b>gearings</b> were removed. All milling stopped in 1955, after which the municipally of Zevenaar became the owner in 1966. They had the windmill restored in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|Freeride {{mountain}} bikes are often geared differently to downhill or other {{mountain bikes}}. There are three main types of Freeride mountain bike <b>gearings,</b> these are Single Speed, Short Range and Long Range. Single Speed mountain bikes use a single chainring at the front, mounted to the cranks, {{and a single}} cog at the rear, normally mounted to a freewheel or a freehub. A Short range freeride bike uses a single chainring at the front, with a cassette hub, containing multiple (usually 7 or 10) cogs, {{ranging in size from}} 10 teeth to 24 teeth. A Long range freeride bike normally has a single chainring at the front (however older bikes may have 2 or 3) with multiple (10 or 11) cogs at the rear mounted on a cassette hub, ranging in size from 10-36t. The larger number of gears and larger rear rings provide a more [...] "low low gear" [...] for climbing up steep surfaces.|$|E
50|$|The FRAM II {{program was}} {{designed}} {{primarily for the}} Sumner-class destroyers, but sixteen <b>Gearings</b> were upgraded as well. This upgrade program included life-extension refurbishment, a new radar system, Mark 32 torpedo tubes, DASH ASW drone, and variable depth sonar (VDS). Importantly, it did not include ASROC. FRAM II ships included six DDRs and six DDEs that retained their specialized equipment (1960-61), as well as four DDRs that were converted to DDs and were nearly identical to the Allen M. Sumner-class FRAM IIs (1962-63). The FRAM II ships retained all six 5-inch guns, except the DDEs retained four 5-inch guns and a trainable Hedgehog in the No. 2 position. All FRAM IIs retained two Hedgehogs alongside either the No. 2 5-inch mount or the trainable Hedgehog mount. The four DDRs converted to DDs were armed with two new 21-inch torpedo tubes for the Mark 37 ASW homing torpedo. Photographs of the six retained DDRs show no markings on the DASH landing deck, {{as well as a}} much smaller deckhouse than was usually provided for DASH, so they may not have been equipped with DASH.|$|E
5000|$|A {{magnetic}} gear resembles in part, the traditional mechanical gear. All cogs of each gear component of {{magnetic gear}}s {{act as a}} magnet with periodic alternation of opposite magnetic poles on mating surfaces. Gear components are mounted with a [...] "cushioned" [...] backlash capability similar to other mechanical <b>gearings</b> with no cushioning effect. Although they can exert as much force as a traditional gear, such gears work without touching and so are immune to wear of mating surfaces, have very low noise and can slip without damage making them very reliable. They {{can be used in}} configurations that are not possible for gears that must be physically touching and can operate with a barrier completely separating the driving force from the load. The magnetically coupled gear can transmit force into a hermetically sealed enclosure without using a radial shaft seal, which may leak. Hermetically sealed processes are not contaminated or chemically affected by the magnetic gear. This can be an advantage in explosive or otherwise hazardous environments where leaks constitute a real danger.|$|E
50|$|In 1811 - 12, John Frederick Herring {{built the}} second grist mill in Richland County. This mill was situate on the Clearfork, four {{miles west of}} Bellville, {{in what is now}} Perry township. Peter Weirick was {{employed}} to do the carpenter work, and while he was erecting the building, Mr. Herring drove to Baltimore with a six-horse team to procure burrs, wheels and <b>gearings</b> for the mill. The round trip from this part of Ohio to Baltimore and return was then made by team and occupied about two months’ time. Now the same distance can be traveled in fewer hours than the days required then. After operating this mill for several years, Mr. Herring sold the same to Francis Baughman in 1815. In 1833, Mr. Baughman disposed of this property to John Hanawalt, who operated the same for about fifty years, and the mill is known in history as “Hanawalt’s.” This mill stood where the Lexington and Fredericktown road crosses the Clearfork. The building is now used as a barn. John Hanawalt was the father of J. L. Hanawalt of South Main Street, Mansfield.|$|E
5000|$|Ships in the Allen M. Summner class {{received}} only armament modifications under FRAM II, {{and not all}} ships of the class received the FRAM upgrades. Although the rear deck was also converted as a flight deck for DASH, the new 12.75-inch triple torpedo tubes were placed where the older 21-inch ones had been, and ASROC was not installed. Typically, all three 5-inch/38 twin mounts were retained. Additionally, two new 21-inch torpedo tubes for the Mark 37 ASW homing torpedo and variable depth sonar (VDS) were added. The converted Allen M. Sumners were designed for another five years of service [...] Sixteen <b>Gearings</b> were also converted under FRAM II. These included six radar picket destroyers (DDRs) and six escort destroyers (DDEs) that retained their specialized equipment (radar or trainable Hedgehog), as well as four former DDRs that were converted to near-twins of the Allen M. Sumner-class FRAM II destroyers. No Gearing FRAM IIs received ASROC. The retained DDRs kept all six 5-inch guns, and photographs show their DASH hangar was smaller than on other ships, plus the landing pad had no markings, so {{they may not have}} received DASH.|$|E
50|$|The Allen M. Sumners {{served on}} radar picket {{stations}} in the Battle of Okinawa, {{as well as other}} duties, and had several losses. Cooper, Meredith, Mannert L. Abele, and Drexler were lost during the war, and Hugh W. Hadley was so badly damaged by a kamikaze attack that she was scrapped soon after the war ended. In addition, USS Frank E. Evans was split in half in a collision with HMAS Melbourne, and never repaired. After the war most of the class (except some of the light minelayers) had their 40 mm and 20 mm guns replaced by up to six 3-inch/50 caliber guns (76 mm), and the pole mast was replaced by a tripod to carry a new, heavier radar. On most ships one depth charge rack was removed and two Hedgehog mounts added. One of the two quintuple 21 in torpedo tube mountings had already been removed on most {{to make way for a}} quadruple 40 mm gun mounting and additional radar for the radar picket mission. 33 ships were converted under the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization II (FRAM II) program 1960-65, but not as extensively as the <b>Gearings.</b> Typically, FRAM Allen M. Sumners retained all three 5-inch/38 twin mounts and received the Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH), two triple Mark 32 torpedo tubes for the Mark 44 torpedo, and two new single 21-inch torpedo tubes for the Mark 37 torpedo, with all 3-inch and lighter guns, previous ASW armament, and 21-inch torpedo tubes being removed. Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) was also fitted; however, ASROC was not fitted. Ships that did not receive FRAM were typically upgraded with Mk 32 triple torpedo tubes in exchange for the K-guns, but retained Hedgehog and one depth charge rack.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{ship was}} {{laid down in}} August 1944, while the last was {{launched}} in March 1946. In that time the United States produced 98 Gearing-class destroyers. The Gearing class was a seemingly minor improvement of the previous Allen M. Sumner class, which were built from 1943 until 1945. The main difference was that the <b>Gearings</b> were 14 ft longer in the midship section, allowing for increased fuel tankage for greater range, an important consideration in Pacific War operations. More importantly in the long run, the Gearings' increased size made them much more suitable for upgrades than the Allen M. Sumners, {{as seen in the}} wartime radar picket subclass, the 1950s radar picket destroyer (DDR) and escort destroyer (DDE) conversions, and the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) conversions 1960-65. As designed, the Gearings' armament was identical to that on the Allen M. Sumner class. Three twin 5 in/38 caliber Mark 38 dual purpose (DP) mounts constituted the main battery. The 5-inch guns were guided by a Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System with a Mark 25 fire control radar linked by a Mark 1A Fire Control Computer stabilized by a Mark 6 8,500 rpm gyro. This fire control system provided effective long-range anti-aircraft (AA) or anti-surface fire. Twelve 40 mm guns in two quad and two twin mounts and 11 20 mm guns in single mounts were also equipped. The initial design retained the Sumners' heavy torpedo armament of 10 21" [...] (533mm) tubes in two quintuple mounts, firing the Mark 15 torpedo. As the threat from kamikaze aircraft mounted in 1945, and with few remaining Japanese warships to use torpedoes on, most of the class had the after quintuple 21 in torpedo tube mount replaced by an additional 40 mm quadruple mount (prior to completion on later ships) for 16 total 40 mm guns. 26 ships (DD-742-745, 805-808, 829-835, and 873-883) were ordered without torpedo tubes to allow for radar picket equipment; these were redesignated as DDRs in 1948.|$|E
