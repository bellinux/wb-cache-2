5|$|They <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{scene where}} Lisa and Bart visit Homer before his surgery and were unsure of how to do it, so they {{approached}} Brooks. Brooks made up the entire scene on the spot. Originally, the surgery {{was supposed to be}} performed by Dr. Hibbert, but it was later changed to Dr. Nick. In the original airing of the episode, Dr. Nick's phone number was the number of a real legal clinic, whose lawyers made them change it to 1-600-DOCTORB.|$|E
5|$|With two authors at {{the time}} Holmes <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{pseudonym}} since having two authors would place the books at different places at libraries, confusing and possibly scaring off potential readers.

5|$|After the {{approval}} of the legislation, the Vermont Sesquicentennial Commission moved quickly to secure designs to be used for the half dollar. Members <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the coin show Ira Allen on the obverse, and the Battle of Bennington Monument on the reverse. They commissioned Sherry Fry, who had created a statue of Allen for the University of Vermont, to design the coin. On July 1, 1925, Fry wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts (charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins), informing him that the models would be ready in about a week.|$|E
5|$|Despite Venice's {{economic}} and maritime decline, in 1601 {{at the behest}} of the Doge Marino Grimani, the Venetian Senate <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new bucentaur built at the cost of 70,000 ducats; although the existing one was still in service, experts regarded it as too old. The designer of the new ship is unknown, but he was selected from among the most qualified marangoni (ships' carpenters) of the Arsenale. The work was supervised by Marco Antonio Memmo, the sovraprovveditore (overseer of the provveditore) of the Arsenale. The new vessel was approved and praised by all on its maiden voyage to the Lido with the newly elected Doge Leonardo Donato on Ascension Day, 10 May 1606.|$|E

On the 1883 anniversary of his 9th year in office, an elaborate public coronation ceremony was held at expenses exceeding $50,000. Kalākaua crowned himself. In 1886, Kalākaua's two-week 50th birthday Jubilee added more expense, reported by Harper's Weekly to be $75,000.|$|E

5|$|His {{funeral was}} {{one of the largest in}} the South. Davis was first entombed at the Army of Northern Virginia tomb at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. In 1893, Mrs. Davis <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his remains reinterred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. After the remains were exhumed in New Orleans, they lay for a day at Memorial Hall of the newly {{organized}} Louisiana Historical Association, with many mourners passing by the casket, including Governor Murphy J.

Due to religious persecution and {{the increasing number of}} its members, Pule <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the cofradía recognized by the colonial government and the Roman Catholic Church. He first sought recognition and authorization from the Bishop of Camarines but his request was denied. Not discouraged, he then sought the approval of the Real Audiencia but he was also ignored.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, Image {{published}} Saga Deluxe Edition Volume 1, a hardcover volume {{collecting the}} first 18 {{issues of the}} series, which comprise its first three story arcs. Because Vaughn sees Saga as a story about Hazel, he and Staples <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> each new hardcover volume feature an original image of that character at a different stage of her life. Because the first volume covers her birth and infancy, its cover features a closeup of Hazel nursing from her mother's breast, set {{against the backdrop of}} Landfall and Wreath, which recalls the first issue's cover. Eric Stephenson warned Vaughn and Staples that some retailers and distributors would object to this cover image, thus limiting the series' audience, but after seeing Staples' rendition of the image, Stephenson decided that sales would not be a problem.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the film}} would not feature any songs, the {{directors}} hired James Newton Howard to compose the score. Approaching it as a live-action film, Howard <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> different musical themes for {{the cultures of}} the surface world and Atlantis. In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an Indonesian orchestral sound incorporating chimes, bells, and gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would {{have a number of}} key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is {{the first}} mass {{production}} car manufactured by Hyundai to include the warning sound system.

5|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the premiere, Chaplin <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an unpublicized preview at Los Angeles' Tower Theatre. It went poorly, {{attracting}} a small and unenthusiastic crowd. Better results were seen at the gala premiere on January 30, 1931 at the Los Angeles Theater. Albert Einstein {{and his wife were}} the guests of honor, and the film received a standing ovation. It next premiered at the George M. Cohan Theater in New York where Chaplin closely supervised the release, spending the day doing interviews, and previously spending $60,000 on the advertising, as he was frustrated with what UA's publicists had come up with. Chaplin demanded half of the total gross, and considering audiences would be more attracted by the film itself than its technology, he demanded higher ticket prices compared to talkies.|$|E

5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Germany, the {{question}} became {{what to do with}} the ships of the High Seas Fleet. Because no neutral nation wanted to host the rebellious sailors of the mutinous armada, the Allies eventually <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the force interned at Scapa Flow, with the guns of the Grand Fleet's ships nearby in case of any attempt at a break-out. On 15 November, Beatty met with Hipper's representative, Rear Admiral Hugo Meurer, to arrange the surrender of the German ships. Meurer agreed to surrender to Beatty in the Firth of Forth. From there, the German vessels would proceed to Scapa Flow, until their ultimate fate was decided by the Paris Peace Conference.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> surgery secretly, {{to avoid}} further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make}} a full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E

5|$|Drogba {{continued}} scoring goals but {{suffered an}} injury at the training ground and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an operation on his knee. He {{was unable to}} play for four weeks and missed key games against Valencia, Arsenal and Liverpool. Drogba returned from injury to play in an FA Cup third round match against Queens Park Rangers and wore the captain's armband for the last 30 minutes {{he was on the}} pitch, but that was his last performance for Chelsea before international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. Upon his return, Drogba scored a goal in the 2008 League Cup Final, making him the all-time leading scorer in League Cup Finals with four goals, but could not help prevent Chelsea fall to a 2–1 defeat at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur. Drogba also became the first player to score in three League Cup finals and the first to score in three consecutive English domestic cup finals. He scored both goals in a key 2–1 victory against Arsenal on 23 March 2008, bringing Chelsea equal on points with leaders Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|In January 1965, the junta-appointed Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương {{intensified}} the anti-communist war effort by expanding military expenditure using aid money and equipment from the Americans, {{and increasing the}} size of the armed forces by widening the terms of conscription. This provoked widespread anti-Hương demonstrations and riots across the country, mainly from conscription-aged students and Buddhists who wanted negotiations. Reliant on Buddhist support, Khánh did little to try to contain the protests. Khánh then <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the armed forces take over the government. On January 27, with the support of Thi and Kỳ, Khánh removed Hương in a bloodless putsch. He promised to leave politics once the situation was stabilized and hand over power to a civilian body. It was believed some of the officers supported Khánh's increased power to give him an opportunity to fail and be removed permanently. Khánh persisted with the facade of civilian government by retaining figurehead chief of state Phan Khắc Sửu and making economics professor Nguyễn Xuân Oánh the caretaker prime minister.|$|E
5|$|In March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado entered Q'umarkaj at the {{invitation}} of the remaining lords of the K'iche' after their catastrophic defeat, fearing that he was entering a trap. He encamped on the plain outside the city rather than accepting lodgings inside. Fearing the great number of K'iche' warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry {{would not be able to}} manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Q'umarkaj, he invited the leading lords of the city, Oxib-Keh (the ajpop, or king) and Beleheb-Tzy (the ajpop k'amha, or king elect) to visit him in his camp. As soon as they did so, he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp. The K'iche' warriors, seeing their lords taken prisoner, attacked the Spaniards' indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers. At this point Alvarado <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the captured K'iche' lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city. After the destruction of Q'umarkaj and the execution of its rulers, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K'iche' resistance. Alvarado wrote that they sent 4000 warriors to assist him, although the Kaqchikel recorded that they sent only 400.|$|E
