5|$|Augustus' {{powers were}} now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the {{completion}} of the Second Settlement, July 1, 23 BC. Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability. Later Roman <b>Emperors</b> were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often newly appointed <b>Emperors</b> would decline {{one or more of the}} honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility. Just as often, as their reign progressed, <b>Emperors</b> would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate. Later <b>Emperors</b> took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of a Triumphant general (toga picta), which became the imperial insignia well into the Byzantine era.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living <b>emperors</b> could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead <b>emperors</b> could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that <b>emperors</b> generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E

5|$|As {{a member}} of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was a close {{relative}} of all five Julio-Claudian <b>emperors.</b> His father was emperor, and his adoptive grandfather was the founder of the Roman Empire, Augustus.

5|$|From the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) {{until the}} Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the ruling {{head of state}} was known as huangdi, or emperor. In Chinese {{historical}} texts, <b>emperors</b> of the Song dynasty, along with the Tang and Yuan dynasties, are referred to by their temple names. Before the Tang dynasty (618–907), <b>emperors</b> were generally referred to in historical texts by their posthumous names. During the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties, <b>emperors</b> were exclusively referred to in historical texts by their single era name, whereas <b>emperors</b> of previous dynasties, including the Song, usually had multiple era names. The amount of written characters used in posthumous names grew steadily larger from the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 220) onwards and thus became overly long when referring to sovereigns. For example, the posthumous name of Nurhaci (r. 1616–1626), {{the founder of the}} Manchu state which would eventually establish the Qing dynasty, contained 29 written characters. By the Tang dynasty, much shorter temple names were preferred when referring to the emperor, a preference that was carried into the Song dynasty. Each emperor also had a tomb name (陵號; linghao) and various other honorific titles.|$|E
5|$|From the Shang to Sui (581–618 AD) dynasties, Chinese rulers (both {{kings and}} <b>emperors)</b> were {{referred}} to by their posthumous names in records and historical texts. Temple names, first used {{during the reign of}} Emperor Jing of Han (r. 157–141 BC), were used exclusively in later records and historical texts when referring to <b>emperors</b> who reigned during the Tang (618–907 AD), Song (9601279 AD), and Yuan (1271–1368 AD) dynasties. During the Ming (1368–1644 AD) and Qing (1644–1911 AD) dynasties, a single era name was used for each emperor's reign and became the preferred way to refer to Ming and Qing <b>emperors</b> in historical texts.|$|E

50|$|<b>Emperor</b> Wenzong of Tang (809-840), {{personal}} name Li Ang, né Li Han (李涵), was an <b>emperor</b> of the Tang dynasty of China.

5|$|However, it {{is unclear}} whether Lucas {{intended}} Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor or just the first of a succession of <b>Emperors.</b> Michael Kaminski, author of The Secret History of Star Wars, claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt <b>Emperors,</b> not just one. If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.|$|E
5|$|The Augustan History (Latin: Historia Augusta) is a late Roman {{collection}} of biographies, written in Latin, of the Roman <b>Emperors,</b> their junior colleagues, designated heirs and usurpers {{of the period}} 117 to 284. Supposedly modeled on the similar work of Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors (collectively known as the Scriptores Historiae Augustae), written during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I and addressed to those <b>emperors</b> or other important personages in Rome. The collection, as extant, comprises thirty biographies, most of which contain {{the life of a}} single emperor, while some include a group of two or more, grouped together merely because these <b>emperors</b> were either similar or contemporaneous.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, <b>Emperor</b> Wu, {{while he}} was under Hou's control, was unwilling to yield, and he refused to carry {{out some of the}} acts that Hou wanted him to.

Hou put <b>Emperor</b> Wu under closer guard, and <b>Emperor</b> Wu, in anger, soon grew ill and died. (Some historians believe that Hou starved <b>Emperor</b> Wu to death.)

5|$|The coins were minted {{under three}} dynasties of Roman <b>emperors.</b> The {{earliest}} are the successors of the Constantinian dynasty, {{followed by the}} Valentinianic <b>emperors,</b> and finally the Theodosian <b>emperors.</b> The collegiate system of rule (or Consortium imperii) meant that imperial partners would mint coins in each other's names at the mints under their jurisdiction. The overlapping reigns of Eastern and Western <b>emperors</b> often allow changes of type to be dated to within part of a reign. So the latest coins in the hoard, of Western ruler Honorius (393–423) and his challenger Constantine III (407–11), can be demonstrated {{to belong to the}} earlier parts of their reigns as they correspond to the lifetime of the Eastern Emperor Arcadius, who died in 408. Thus, the coins provide a terminus post quem or earliest possible date for the deposition of the hoard of 408.|$|E
5|$|The {{suicide of}} Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio-Claudian dynasty to an end, {{leading to the}} chaotic Year of the Four <b>Emperors,</b> which saw the {{successive}} {{rise and fall of}} the <b>emperors</b> Galba, Otho and Vitellius, until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69.

5|$|Under the Macedonian <b>emperors,</b> {{the city}} of Constantinople flourished, {{becoming}} the largest and wealthiest city in Europe, {{with a population of}} approximately 400,000 in the 9th and 10th centuries. During this period, the Byzantine Empire employed a strong civil service staffed by competent aristocrats that oversaw the collection of taxes, domestic administration, and foreign policy. The Macedonian <b>emperors</b> also increased the Empire's wealth by fostering trade with Western Europe, particularly through the sale of silk and metalwork.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, though, <b>Emperor</b> Xuanzong's {{crown prince}} Li Heng, {{who did not}} follow <b>Emperor</b> Xuanzong toward Jiannan, had {{declared}} himself <b>emperor</b> (as <b>Emperor</b> Suzong) at Lingwu.

In order to show favor to Cui, however, <b>Emperor</b> Xuanzong erected a monument at Shu Commandery to commemorate his accomplishments.

5|$|According to Tibetologist John Powers, Tibetan sources counter this {{narrative}} of titles {{granted by the}} Chinese to Tibetans with various titles which the Tibetans gave to the Chinese <b>emperors</b> and their officials. Tribute missions from Tibetan monasteries to the Chinese court brought back not only titles, but large, commercially valuable gifts which could subsequently be sold. The Ming <b>emperors</b> sent invitations to ruling lamas, but the lamas sent subordinates rather than coming themselves, and no Tibetan ruler ever explicitly accepted the role of being a vassal of the Ming.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four <b>Emperors</b> to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple <b>emperors.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Peace of Nisibis, Diocletian and Galerius returned to Syrian Antioch. At some time in 299, the <b>emperors</b> took part in a ceremony of sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices were unable to read the entrails of the sacrificed animals and blamed Christians in the Imperial household. The <b>emperors</b> ordered all members of the court to perform a sacrifice to purify the palace. The <b>emperors</b> sent letters to the military command, demanding the entire army perform the required sacrifices or face discharge. Diocletian was conservative in matters of religion, a man faithful to the traditional Roman pantheon and understanding of demands for religious purification, but Eusebius, Lactantius and Constantine state that it was Galerius, not Diocletian, who was the prime supporter of the purge, and its greatest beneficiary. Galerius, even more devoted and passionate than Diocletian, saw political advantage in the politics of persecution. He was willing to break with a government policy of inaction on the issue.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Emperor</b> Yingzong's reign {{is known}} for {{controversy}} over the correct rituals to be performed by the <b>emperor</b> for his father. <b>Emperor</b> Yingzong had been adopted by <b>Emperor</b> Renzong, so <b>Emperor</b> Renzong was nominally <b>Emperor</b> Yingzong's father. However, biologically, Zhao Yunrang was <b>Emperor</b> Yingzong's father. Some officials suggested that <b>Emperor</b> Yingzong honour his biological father with the title [...] "Imperial Uncle", but the <b>emperor</b> agreed with Ouyang Xiu and others and decided to honour his biological father as his parent.

5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} <b>emperors</b> began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a {{monopoly}} {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The <b>emperors,</b> however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
