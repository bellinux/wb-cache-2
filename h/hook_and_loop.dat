25|$|Boxing gloves {{usually come}} with either lace-ups or velcro. In velcro gloves, the velcro {{acts as a}} second handwrap that adds more {{stability}} to the wrist. Lace-up gloves provide a more snug and secure fit, but unlike velcro gloves, require assistance from another person to lace, and are usually wrapped with tape before the match. Lace-up gloves {{can be converted to}} velcro gloves using a <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> converter.|$|E
25|$|The belt loops are of new design, {{much wider}} (double width) {{and there is}} 8 of them now {{compared}} to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs {{at the bottom of}} the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers have {{expressed}} concern about the Velcro on the ACU.

Zippers have also been a topic of concern. Soldiers also expressed concern because the zippers (as with any zipper) can bind up, and render the uniform uncomfortable to wear, especially with body armor.|$|R

50|$|De Mestral {{obtained}} patents in {{many countries}} right after inventing the fasteners, as he expected an immediate high demand. Partly due to its cosmetic appearance, though, <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop's</b> integration into the textile industry took time.

2500|$|Wrapping legs {{requires}} {{care and}} skill. [...] A too loose bandage will fall off, potentially tangling in the horse's legs, causing panic or injury. [...] A too tight bandage may cause injury to tendons, ligaments and possible circulation problems. [...] Commercial boots for riding or shipping are simpler to apply as they attach with a <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> fastening, or, less often, with adjustable buckles. [...] Leg bandages require more attention. [...] A bandage is usually applied over a protective padding of roll cotton or a premade quilted pad.

[...] When wrapping a horses leg the left leg is wrapped in a counter-clockwise direction, and the right leg is wrapped in a clockwise direction, starting on the outside, moving front to back. [...] Legs may be bandaged with either disposable stretchable wrap that sticks to itself, or with washable fleece or cotton wraps that are reusable and fasten at the ends with a <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> closure.

2500|$|Half chaps, {{also known}} as chapettes, are a popular style of equestrian gaiters that extend from the ankle to just below the knee.

5000|$|The steel aerosol {{spray can}} with the gas propellant, and [...] "crimp on nozzle" [...] was {{developed}} in the US in 1949. It quickly became a favored type of packaging in Canada for a number of products including whipped cream, deodorant, bug spray and hair spray. The gas propellant, usually a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s when research demonstrated that it had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international Montreal Protocol of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile hydrocarbons. The disposable diaper was introduced to the Canadian market in 1972 by Procter & Gamble Canada Ltd. The chemistry of hair colouring was introduced to the domestic scene in the US and Canada in 1956, when Clairol began marketing a home hair colouring kit for women that could be purchased for a modest price at a local pharmacy or grocery store. Invented in Canada, the green plastic garbage bag (Bin bag) was introduced to Canadians in the late 1960s. Patented in 1955 by Swiss engineer, George de Mestral, velcro, a two sided fastening technology based on <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>loops,</b> was introduced to a number of countries, including Canada, in the late 1950s.

Evan Rytlewski from The A.V.

40|$|AbstractAggregates of pre-sorted cells form {{structures}} called tissue spheroids {{that have}} been widely used in the field of tissue engineering. The greater contact of the cells with the culture medium is directly related to cell viability and to the increase of proliferation rate. Due to the characteristics of a 3 D environment, at some zones within the tissue spheroids some cells are not equally exposed to the environment, impacting in the formation of microenvironments with decreased oxygen, nutrients and soluble factors produced by cellular metabolism leading to the formation of low proliferation areas and consequently necrosis (cell death). The fusion of cells also changes the catabolites flow, generating a very heterogeneous diffusion. The idea of this project is to develop and improve a microscaffold based on the concept of lockyballs that have cell support function for tissue engineering. Lockyballs have <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>loops</b> which attach each other assuring a 3 D cellularized mesh. The model has a spherical outer structure and inner hollow microsphere constituted by pores with diameters smaller than the cell ones, whose function would be to prevent cell entry and provide an environment suitable to diffusion gradient necessary for the cell viability of the spheroid avoiding necrosis. The first stage of the work consisted in the generation of different three dimensional models by Computer Aided Design (CAD) software Rhinoceros 5. 0. At the second stage, the CAD model was imported into finite element method (FEM) software (ANSYS R 16 Static) to perform computational simulation, which consisted of structural analyses. Computational simulations were essential to predict the diffusion phenomenon inside the whole 3 D structure. The development of new microscaffolds models can enhance the regenerative capacity and 3 D tissues construction...|$|R
