Later, the song went on to receive two Grammy nominations at the 38th ceremony for Best R Song—for Austin's composition—and for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, eventually winning the latter. [...] "We were in shock! We just put out music so that people could find a connection with what were saying, so we didn't know exactly how people would feel about anything," [...] Thomas says as she recalls TLC's winning moment. [...] "So when you <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> recognition, it says so much. The Grammys is like the Oscars of music, so we were just beyond happy to get one." [...] Shortly after winning, they announced their bankruptcy in an interview backstage of the show. The song's publisher, EMI, later received the 1996 ASCAP Pop Music Award for Publisher of the Year.|$|E

Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies {{and the rest of the}} production team had expected, Gold took a minimalist approach. When pitching the track to the production team, Gold described the track as representing Rose's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor. He later said, [...] "I wanted to <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> throbbing, sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock, because I thought that's what Rose would do if she was hurting and ran up to her bedroom and locked herself in her room and had a good old cry, really." [...] The piece uses the same vocal work from [...] "Rose", when Rose first enters the TARDIS, thus creating a bookend effect. It is a favourite among fans and of executive producer Julie Gardner, and is one of the reasons, along with Pappenheim's overall contribution and the [...] "Song for Ten" [...] from [...] "The Christmas Invasion", that the [...] was released several months later.|$|E

2500|$|An {{official}} in France's Atomic Energy Commission {{reported that they}} estimated the blast was [...] "about or less than a kiloton" [...] and expressed uncertainty {{about whether or not}} the blast was actually nuclear. [...] There have been various large planned and unplanned non-nuclear explosions comparable in yield to small nuclear detonations, such as the U.S. [...] "Minor Scale" [...] explosion from 1985, which used conventional explosives to simulate a 4 kiloton detonation. According to the Washington Times anonymous U.S. intelligence sources speculated there [...] "was a seismic event that registered about 4 on the Richter scale, but it still isn't clear if it was a nuclear test. You can <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> seismic reading from high explosives". The Wall Street Journal explains that this blast was equivalent to the explosive force of about US$100,000 worth of ammonium nitrate. [...] International experts have said that it will take some time to confirm whether it was a successful nuclear test, as North Korea claimed, or an unsuccessful one ("fizzle"), or perhaps not even a nuclear test at all.|$|E
2500|$|Kingston {{describes}} the character as being [...] "like a female Indiana Jones" [...] {{with regard to}} both characters being archaeologists and having action hero qualities. She also took inspiration from Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ellen Ripley in the Alien film franchise commenting that she'd always been [...] "so envious of her for having that kind of role." [...] Kingston has also praised the way the love story between River and the Doctor has been deftly handled, stating that [...] "I'm not sure you'd <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dynamic in America". For Kingston, the physical age difference between herself and Matt Smith adds {{to the success of}} the pairing, whilst she feels that viewers have responded warmly to the notion of an action hero in her 40s. Matt Smith has noted that in his characterisation of the Doctor that [...] "River Song frightens the Doctor but he finds himself strangely attracted to her" [...] and that [...] "what makes her a great companion is that when she turns up all hell breaks loose!".|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, Sheila Prophet of Record Mirror {{felt the}} album was [...] "worth giving a spin" [...] and said: [...] "This is their {{comeback}} album - the one that'll make 'em or break 'em. It features [...] "Gypsy Roadhog" [...] {{and most of the}} other tracks are in the same vein - solid, rocking numbers, but just not quite distinctive enough {{to make it in the}} same way as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] did. Part of the problem is that they seem to be trying too hard - laying everything on, instead of sticking with simplicity. The result is that it sounds, heavy, cluttered, even, a bit old-fashioned. Noddy's voice still sounds great, and Dave turns in some pretty nifty guitar, but there's just too much of everything. In the old days, lyrics weren't too important to Slade, but now they're writing songs with meaning." [...] Pete Makowski of New Musical Express wrote: [...] "The band were always on form when they worked within the most basic of formats. Rock and Roll! This album is high energy on a primeval scale. It's got all the ball bustin' riffs you'll find nestling comfortably alongside yer ZZ Tops and Nugents. It's got the same suicidal pace of the Aerosmith Rocks album. It's packed with strong tunes, lotsa potential singles and the lyrical content is more interesting." [...] Tony Ciarochi of Fairbanks Daily News-Miner said: [...] "...their latest album definitely packs the kind of punch that would <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> reaction from a crowd of concert goers. Although it is fairly basic rock 'n' roll, the British humor and sarcasm with which it is presented make it a refreshing chance from some of the more bland sledgehammer rock grounds dominant in America." ...|$|E

After seven years of playing Lolly, Tolli left Neighbours in 2001 to focus on her schooling. Tolli's mother said it was [...] "the right time" [...] for her daughter to leave and the producers agreed. [...] "I remember the fun times. I was a kid.

In 1992, Goodstein noted that the series had been broadcast, via PBS, by over 100 stations, [...] "usually at peculiar hours when innocent people were unlikely to tune in accidentally on a differential equation in the act of being solved". He observed that detailed viewership figures were difficult to obtain, but when the show had been broadcast in Miami during Saturday mornings, the producers were able to obtain Nielsen ratings.In fact, it came in second in its time slot, beating the kiddie cartoons on two network stations. There were 18,000 faithful core households in Dade County alone, the median age of the viewers was 18, and half were female. However, we seldom <b>get</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> detailed information.Goodstein and assistant project director Richard Olenick noted,Anecdotal information in the form of letters and phone calls indicates very considerable enthusiasm among users at all levels from casual viewers to high-school students to research university professors, but there have also been a number of sharp disappointments, particularly when Instructional Television administrators have tried to handle TMU like a conventional telecourse.Similarly, a 1988 review in Physics Today suggested that the programs would not function well on their own as a telecourse, but would work much better as a supplement to a traditional classroom or a more standard distance-learning course such as Open University. The reviewers also found the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] of computer-animated equations too fast to follow: [...] "After a short time, one yearns for a live professor filling the blackboard with equations". Similarly, a review in the American Journal of Physics, while praising the [...] "technical proficiency of the films", wrote of the animated equation manipulations, [...] "As the MIT students say, this is like trying to take a drink of water out of a fire hose". A considerably more enthusiastic evaluation came from physicist Charles H. Holbrow, who told Olenick, [...] "These materials will constitute the principal visual image of physics for decades". Goodstein and Olenick reported that younger viewers tended to enjoy the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] style [...] "much more than older viewers, who are made uncomfortable by the algebraic manipulations they cannot quite follow".|$|E

[...] Kirkus Reviews also praised Speigelmans writing, finding the novel to be [...] "Character-driven with a protagonist as enigmatic as he is compelling.
