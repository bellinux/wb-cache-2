40|$|Abstract — The DECOS {{architecture}} {{provides a}} framework for integrating multiple application systems within a single distributed <b>computer</b> <b>system.</b> Since the DECOS architecture aims at applications in the automotive, avionic, and industrial control domain, including applications up to the highest criticality level, the design and development process of DECOS-based <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> is of utmost importance. Within the DECOS project a model-based development process is devised which aims at enabling a reduced time-to-market in spite of increasing the system’s functionality, the reuse of application software on different instantiations of the DE-COS platform, and performing validation activities earlier in the development phase of <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper we outline the overall model-based development process of <b>integrated</b> <b>computer</b> <b>systems</b> based on the DECOS architecture with a strong focus on the modeling of the DECOS execution platform. Additionally, we present a novel graphical model editor based on GME for capturing the execution platform in the model-based development process. ...|$|R

Though both the Pennsylvania and the Central struggled through the 1950s on the dividends from their large investments in border state coal haulers—the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Norfolk and Western—the Penn Central merger created a massive system from two weakened giants. Exacerbating the situation, the Interstate Commerce Commission foisted the nearly bankrupt New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad onto the new company. The New Haven, running between Boston and New York, was heavily involved in money-losing commuter traffic. Transportation historian George W.
