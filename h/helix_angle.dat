40|$|Solid {{end mills}} with multi-section cutting edges and {{variable}} <b>helix</b> <b>angles</b> {{are available for}} application. New types of solid end mills for low energy consumption have recently been developed. These so-called Low Power Cutting (LPC) -Tools are characterized by differential <b>helix</b> <b>angles.</b> Compared to solid end mills with variable <b>helix</b> <b>angles,</b> the new differential <b>helix</b> <b>angles</b> change their pitch continuously over the cutting edge length. Due to this fact the cutting conditions {{are not in a}} constant state during the revolution of the cutting tool. Existing mathematical approaches for the calculation of cutting forces only consider constant <b>helix</b> <b>angles</b> in milling operations. This paper describes an approach for the prediction of cutting forces for differential <b>helix</b> <b>angles.</b> The developed mathematical model is based on geometrical considerations.

40|$|ObjectivesIt {{has been}} {{proposed}} that successful left ventricular surgical restoration should restore normal helical myofiber orientation. A magnetic resonance imaging technique, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, has been developed to measure myocyte orientation. By using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, this study tested the hypothesis that (1) myocyte orientation is altered after anteroapical myocardial infarction and (2) left ventricular surgical restoration restores normal <b>helix</b> <b>angles.</b> MethodsThirteen sheep underwent anteroapical myocardial infarction (25 % of left ventricular mass). Ten weeks later, animals underwent either aneurysm plication (n = 8) or sham operations (n = 5). Six weeks after this operation, hearts were excised, perfusion fixed in diastole, and underwent magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging. Hearts from normal sheep (n = 5) were also harvested and imaged. Primary eigenvectors of the diffusion tensors from magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging were resolved into <b>helix</b> <b>angles</b> relative to a local wall coordinate system. Transmural samples of the <b>helix</b> <b>angles</b> were compared at the border zone of the aneurysm or repair (or a comparable distance from the base in normal sheep), 1 cm below the valves, and halfway between. ResultsThe helical myofiber orientation did not change after myocardial infarction. However, aneurysm plication caused myofibers in the anterior border zone to rotate counterclockwise (− 35. 6 ± 10. 5 °, P =. 028) {{and those in the}} lateral border zone to rotate clockwise (34. 4 ± 8. 1 °, P =. 031). ConclusionsSurgical restoration alters myocyte orientation adjacent to the surgical repair. However, myofiber orientation is not abnormal after myocardial infarction, and thus surgical restoration techniques intent on restoring normal <b>helix</b> <b>angles</b> might not be warranted...|$|R

25|$|Hobbing uses a {{hobbing machine}} with two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the <b>helix</b> <b>angle</b> of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the <b>helix</b> <b>angle</b> of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|E

The model {{is used to}} fit mechanical tension test data from the equine common digital extensor tendon (CDET) and superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), which are used as archetypes of positional and energy-storing tendons, respectively. The fibril crimp and fascicle <b>helix</b> <b>angles</b> of the two tendon types are used as fitting parameters in the mathematical model to predict their values. The outer fibril crimp angles were predicted to be 15. 1 Â° Â± 2. 3 Â° in the CDET and 15. 8 Â° Â± 4. 1 Â° in the SDFT, and the average crimp angles were predicted to be 10. 0 Â° Â± 1. 5 Â° in the CDET and 10. 5 Â° Â± 2. 7 Â° in the SDFT.

This supports previous qualitative observations that helical substructures {{are more likely to be}} found in energy-storing tendons than in positional tendons and suggests that the relative compliance of energy-storing tendons may be directly caused by these helical substructures...|$|R

2500|$|Form-milling uses {{either a}} single- or multiple-form cutter. In one variant of form-milling, the single-form cutter is tilted to the <b>helix</b> <b>angle</b> of the thread and then fed {{radially}} into the blank.

2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's <b>helix</b> <b>angle)</b> and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread <b>helix</b> <b>angle)</b> {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E

40|$|The {{dependence}} of local left ventricular (LV) mechanics on myocardial muscle fiber orientation was investigated using a finite element model.

Muscle fiber orientation in the LV wall is quantified by the <b>helix</b> fiber <b>angle,</b> defined as the angle between the muscle fiber direction and the local circumferential direction. In a first simulation, a transmural variation of the <b>helix</b> fiber <b>angle</b> from + 60 degrees at the endocardium through 0 degrees in the midwall layers to - 60 degrees at the epicardium was assumed. In this simulation, at the equatorial level maximum active muscle fiber stress was found to vary from about 110 kPa in the subendocardial layers through about 30 kPa in the midwall layers to about 40 kPa in the subepicardial layers. Next, {{in a series of}} simulations, muscle fiber orientation was iteratively adapted until the spatial distribution of active muscle fiber stress was fairly homogeneous. Using a transmural course of the <b>helix</b> fiber <b>angle</b> of + 60 degrees at the endocardium, + 15 degrees in the midwall layers and - 60 degrees at the epicardium, at the equatorial level maximum active muscle fiber stress varied from 52 kPa to 55 kPa, indicating a remarkable reduction of the stress range. Moreover, the change of muscle fiber strain with time was more similar {{in different parts of the}} LV wall than in the first simulation.
