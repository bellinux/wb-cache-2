40|$|The {{immunobiology}} of <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> (EAE) is incompletely understood. The causative {{agent is}} Chlamydia psittaci, which infects many ruminant species and has zoonotic potential. The organism can {{survive in the}} ovine host for many months without causing clinical symptoms but does not generate a sterile immunity during this time. It has been postulated that the organism persists in the host entering at a latent phase, possibly mediated by host cytokine production. The effects of cytokines on chlamydial multiplication vary between host species, between different cell types within those species and also vary between chlamydial species and strains. The multiplication of the EAE strain of C. psittaci in ovine ST- 6 cells can be restricted by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) but not with comparable concentrations of IFN-alpha. Altering the nutrient composition of the cultures by addition of tryptophan partially reverses the antichlamydial effects of the IFN-gamma. This offers a potential mechanism by which C. psittaci can persist in sheep. The implications of these observations for the pathogenesis of EAE are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chlamydia psittaci is a {{major cause}} of ovine {{abortion}} in the fourth to fifth months of gestation. During the lambing seasons of 1986, 1987, and 1988, fetuses from 52 cases of ovine abortion, stillbirth, or perinatal death were submitted to the laboratory for necropsy examination. Placenta or fetal tissues from 34 cases were cultured on mouse L cells for C. psittaci. Chlamydia psittaci was identified by immunofluorescence on cultures in 20 of these cases. The major gross lesion consistently associated with Chlamydial abortion was placentitis with multifocal cotyledonary necrosis and accumulation of red-brown exudate in the intercotyledonary placenta Chlamydiae appeared as spherical organisms, less than 1 µm in diameter, in the cytoplasm of tropho-blasts in impression smears of cotyledons. H istologically, placentitis was sometimes accompanied by pneumonia or encephalitis in the fetus. Chlamydia psittaci was considered the cause for fetal death when Chlamydial isolation was associated with placentitis or inflammation of other fetal tissues and when other abortifacient agents were not detected. <b>Enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> (EAE) was first described in Scotland in 1936, 9 but it was 1950 before Stamp identified Chlamydia psittaci as the etiologic agent?

40|$|Chlamydophila abortus {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of {{infectious}} abortion in pregnant sheep (<b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> or EAE) worldwide. Organisms shed in infected placentas and uterine discharges at lambing time are the main sources of environmental contamination, responsible for transmission to susceptible animals and possible human contacts. In the present study, a recently developed test, based on a recombinant fragment of the polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 (rOMP 90 - 4 indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [iELISA]) and one based on the variable segment 2 (VS 2) region of the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) (MOMP VS 2 iELISA) were compared using sera from C. abortus-infected ewes at different stages throughout pregnancy. The rOMP 90 iELISA detected antibody much earlier in pregnancy than the MOMP iELISA, which, like the complement fixation test, detected antibody only at the time of abortion or lambing. No anti-MOMP antibody response could be detected in three of seven experimentally infected ewes. Furthermore, the rOMP 90 iELISA detected antibody in an animal that seroconverted during the course of the study, which the MOMP iELISA failed to detect. Overall, the results show that the rOMP 90 - 4 iELISA is considerably more sensitive than the MOMP VS 2 iELISA for identifying animals infected with C. abortus. Earlier detection of infection will allow appropriate control measures to be taken to reduce environmental contamination, thus limiting the spread of infection, financial losses, and the possible risks of zoonotic transmission to humans...|$|E

This discharge lasted for up to 7 - 8 days after lambing. Ewes were clinically normal with rectal temperatures between 39. 1 C adn 39. 6 C. White to brownish, watery discharge with a foetid smell was designated Type 2. Affected ewes had rectal temperatures of 39. 9 C ti 41. 5 C. The most severe discharge (Type 3) was yellow/white with large lumps of pus and affected ewes were inappetant, visibly depressed with rectal temperatures in excess of 41. 5 C. Ewes with Type 2 and 3 discharges were found to produce fewer lambs per ewe than the flock average in the season following the discharge (1. 6 vs 1. 95 in 2008 and 1. 75 vs 1. 92 to scanning in 2009). Bacteria present in the discharges included E. coli and other faecal bacteria, staphylococci, especially S. aureus, corynebacteria of a number of species, C. minutissimum, C. jeikeium, C. stratum, C. pseudodiptheriticum, C. afermentans, C. urealyticum, C. renale, C. cystitidis, C. propinquum and C. argentoratense and Arcanobacterium pyogenes. Some bacterial species isolated represent first records for the sheep, especially Aerococcus urinae.

40|$|Ovine <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion,</b> {{caused by}} Chlamydia abortus, leads to {{important}} economic losses worldwide. In addition to reproductive failures, infection may impact lamb growth {{during the first}} weeks after birth, yet this effect has not been well characterized.

In this context, we evaluated the efficacy of an inactivated standard commercial vaccine and a 1 / 2 diluted dose in pregnant sheep challenged with C. abortus by examining multiple indicators ofvaccine effect (including incidence of reproductive failures, bacterial excretion, and evolution of weight gain of viable lambs during {{the first month of}} life). Three groups <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> [control non-vaccinated, C (n = 18); vaccinated with standard dose, SV (n = 16) and vaccinated with 1 / 2 dose, DV (n = 17) ], were challenged approximately 90 days post-mating and tested using direct PCR (tissue samples and vaginal swabs) and ELISA (serum) until 31 days post-reproductive outcome.

40|$|SUMMARY Toluidine blue {{staining}} {{was used}} to detect Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions in both McCoy and HeLa- 229 cells from clinical specimens. This method was more sensitive than iodine staining for detecting C trachomatis inclusions in both McCoy and HeLa- 229 cells and also more sensitive than Giemsa staining for detecting chlamydial inclusions in HeLa- 229 cells. While its sensitivity for detection of chlamydial inclusions in McCoy cells is {{equal to that of}} Giemsa staining, toluidine blue staining is easier and faster to perform. Different staining methods have been used to detect chlamydial inclusions in cell cultures. Giemsa stain-ing followed by dark ground microscopy has been the most commonly used technique. The glycogen matrix of Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions can be detected using various stains-for example, iodine' carmine, 2 and periodic acid Schiff. 3 Iodine staining combined with bright field microscopy is probably the simplest of all staining techniques for detecting C trachomatis inclusions, but compared with Giemsa and carmine it is less sensitive. 4 Periodic acid Schiff stain is useful in that inclusions are detectable by both bright and dark field microscopy, but the actual staining technique is quite complex, as is that for carmine. 5 Methylene blue stain combined with dark field microscopy is said to be useful for the diagnosis of infection caused by the <b>enzootic</b> ovine <b>abortion</b> strain <b>of</b> C psittaci. 6 But it offers no advantage over Giemsa or iodine stains for the detection of C trachomatis inclusions. : Immunofluorescent staining 7 seems to be both fast and sensitive but it requires the use of expensive reagents. Recently, a methyl green-neutral red stain-ing technique {{has been found to be}} highly sensitive for detecting C psittaci inclusions combined with bright field microscopy. 8 It is as sensitive as Giemsa staining combined with dark field microscopy for detecting C trachomatis inclusions. We report a simple, fast technique for detecting C trachomatis inclusions using toluidine blue, effective with both bright and dark field microscopy. We have compared its sensitivity with that of Giemsa an...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of health management <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> during pregnancy are as follows: (i) {{successful completion of}} pregnancy at term, (ii) birth of healthy and viable lambs, with optimal birth and potential weaning bodyweight, (iii) optimum milk production during the subsequent lactation and (iv) improved management in relation to drug residues in animal products. Knowledge of the physiological background of pregnancy in ewes: changes, mechanisms and interactions, during pregnancy {{is important for the}} overall health management <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> during pregnancy. Health management <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> includes diagnosis <b>of</b> pregnancy and evaluation of the number of foetuses borne, which will support strategies for subsequent management of the flock. Nutritional management <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> depends upon the stage of lactation and specifically aims to (i) prevention of pregnancy toxaemia and other metabolic diseases during the peri-partum period, (ii) formation of colostrum in appropriate quantity and quality, (iii) production of lambs with normal future birth bodyweight and (iv) support of increased milk yield during the subsequent lactation. At the end of lactation, udder management <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> includes its clinical examination, culling <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> considered unsuitable for lactation and, possibly, the intramammary administration of antibiotics; {{objectives of}} that procedure are (i) to cure infections which have occurred during the previous lactation and (ii) to prevent development of new mammary infection during the dry period. Management <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> includes the correct and timely diagnosis of the causative agent of the disorder, as well as the strategic administrations of chemotherapeutic agents, aiming to prevent abortions in flocks with confirmed infection with an abortifacient agent, especially if no appropriate vaccinations had been carried out before the mating season. During the final stage of pregnancy, health management <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> includes administration <b>of</b> appropriate anthelmintic drugs, aiming to eliminate gastrointestinal helminthes (thus, increasing production output <b>of</b> <b>ewes)</b> and preventing the built-up of parasitic burdens in the environment (thus, reducing infection of lambs during their neonatal period). Vaccinations <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> aim to protect these animals, as well as their offspring, especially against diseases which are a frequent cause of neonatal mortality (e. g., clostridial infections). Health management also aims to prevent the main metabolic disorders <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> (i. e., pregnancy toxaemia and hypocalcaemia), as well as to monitor flocks for development of these disorders. Health management <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> is completed with application of husbandry practices {{before the start of the}} lambing season. Finally, in some cases, health management may include induction and synchronisation of lambings, which is a management or therapeutic procedure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In the summer-fall of 2011, a nonspecific febrile {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} hyperthermia, drop in milk production and watery diarrhea {{was reported in}} adult dairy cows {{from a series of}} farms located in North-West Europe. Further, in November 2011, an <b>enzootic</b> outbreak <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> stillbirth and birth at term of lambs, kids and calves with neurologic signs and/or head, spine or limb malformations emerged throughout several European countries. Both syndromes were associated with the presence in the blood (adults) or in the central nervous system (newborns) of the genome of a new Shamonda-like orthobunyavirus provisionally named Schmallenberg virus after the place where the first positive samples were collected. The clinical, pathological, virological and epidemiological facts that were made publicly available during the first 6 months after the emergence are presented here. Current knowledge of the epidemiology of the phylogenetically closest relatives of the newcomer (Shamonda, Aino and Akabane viruses) is not exhaustive enough to predict whether the current outbreak of Schmallenberg virus is the prelude to endemicity or to a 2 years long outbreak before the infection burns out when serologically naïve animals are no longer available. In the future, cyclic epizootic reemergences are a possibility too, either synchronized with a global decrease of herd immunity or due to antigenic variants escaping the immunity acquired against their predecessors. The latter hypothesis seems unlikely because of the wide array of biologic constraints acting on the genome of viruses whose life cycle requires transmission by a vector, which represses genetic drift. The remarkable stability of the Shamonda virus genome over the last forty years is reassuring in this regard. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of dietary selenium supplementation (organic, inorganic) <b>of</b> high pregnant <b>ewes</b> on the production traits of lambs, the concentration of selenium in the blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and their lambs, indicators of antioxidant status in the blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and their lambs, the metabolic profile <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and their lambs and concentrations <b>of</b> thyroid hormones. <b>Ewes</b> were in the last third of pregnancy, the average age of four years, healthy and in good condition, divided into three groups of 10 animals. The research lasted 4 months respectively, 2 months with ewes during high pregnancy, 2 months with ewes during lactation and on their lambs during suckling period. Ewes ration from control group one was composed from 300 g/day/animal feed mixture without addition of selenium and 150 g/day/animal barley and alfalfa hay that they had ad libitum. Feed mixture from second group <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> was supplemented with 0. 3 mg/kg organic form of selenium (Sel-Plex®), and feed mixture from third group with the same amount inorganic form of selenium (sodium selenite). Selenium supplementation <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> feed mixture did not significantly influence on the production traits of their lambs postpartum. Selenium supplementation <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and their lambs had influence on a significant (P< 0. 01; P< 0. 05) increase in the concentration of selenium, GSH-Px and SOD in whole blood compared to control group <b>of</b> <b>ewes.</b> Organic selenium supplement had a more significant impact on the increase in concentration of selenium and GSH-Px in the blood. In the ewes and lambs blood was determined decrease of MDA with increasing concentrations of selenium in the blood. Generally, the selenium supplementation led to an increase (P< 0. 05) in the number of WBC and lymphocytes in the blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and lambs. Also, the increase in the number of RBC, HGB content and MCV in lambs and MCH as well as MCHC in ewes that had a selenium supplement in feed mixture were determined. Concentration of Ca, Cl, Na and Fe significantly increased in the blood <b>of</b> supplemented <b>ewes.</b> Addition <b>of</b> selenium in feed mixture <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> had influence on significant increase of serum urea and triglycerides and increasing trend of glucose. In the lambs was determined significant decrease in cholesterol, triglycerides, globulin, HDL, and HCO 3 -, a significant increase in urea, albumin and LDL levels with the addition of selenium in feed mixture. Inorganic source of selenium influenced on a significant increase of pO 2 in the blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and increasing trend in lambs. Strong ion difference (SID) and the z-value in the blood of lambs, average age of 23 days, were significantly decreased with the addition of inorganic selenium in the feed mixture. Inorganic selenium supplement in the feed mixture <b>of</b> pregnant <b>ewes</b> influenced a significant increase in the anion gap. It was determined a slight increase in activity of AST and LDH and a decrease in serum CK <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> supplemented with selenium, while in the lambs organic and inorganic selenium supplements influenced on a significant decrease of AST, GGT and CK. Selenium supplementation <b>of</b> high pregnant <b>ewes</b> had influence on the growth of the concentration of T 3 and T 4 in the blood. Inorganic selenium supplement in lactating ewes influenced a significant increase in concentration of T 3. In the lambs, average age 23 days, selenium supplement had influence increase of concentrations of T 3 and T 4, while aged 63 days had influence on increase T 3 and decrease T 4. The highest concentration of selenium in milk was determined in ewes that had supplement of organic selenium in the rations. A significant positive correlation between selenium concentration and GSH-Px in the blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and lambs was determined with the addition of organic selenium in feed mixture. Also, positive correlation was determined between the concentration of selenium in whole blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and their lambs, which was significant with supplementation of organic selenium. Also, positive correlation between GSH-Px, SOD and MDA was determined in whole blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and lambs that was stronger in organic compared to inorganic selenium supplement in feed mixture <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and lambs. Supplementation <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> with organic selenium was significantly increased its concentration in the blood <b>of</b> <b>ewes</b> and lambs, and had influence on increase of GSH-Px, which is more reliable indicator in monitoring the supply of body with selenium...|$|R
40|$|Ovine <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> is an {{infectious}} and contagious disease clinically characterized by abortion and weak neonates, affecting sheep and goats. The etiological agent is Chlamydophila (C.) abortus, {{which is considered}} one of the most common animal pathogens of small ruminants; it has important economic implications and represents a significant zoonotic risk. Clinical diagnosis is often difficult because the clinical signs and the pathological lesions are not specific for C. abortus infection, in fact they can also be observed as a result of infections with other abortifacient agents. Moreover, the involvement of the laboratory is necessary to perform the definitive diagnosis. One hundred and seventeen vaginal swabs from sheep with clinical signs related to chlamydial infection were examined by a PCR-RFLP assay that demonstrated high specifity and sensitivity. Six samples were positive for C. abortus. Vaginal swabs are easy to handle and allow to deal with biohazardous material in safety conditions. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|As Bactérias da família Chlamydiaceae são classificadas nos gêneros Chlamydia e Chlamydophila. O primeiro contêm as espécies C. trachomatis, C. suis e C. muridarum e o segundo as espécies C. abortus, C. pecorum, C. psittaci, C. felis, C. pneumoniae e C. caviae. Entre as espécies do gênero Chlamydophila causadoras de doença da esfera reprodutiva em animais de interesse econômico, a C. abortus tem sido descrita em vários países, como causa de abortamento, nascimento de animais prematuros e natimortalidade. A doença causada pela C. abortus é conhecida como aborto enzoótico ovino, aborto enzoótico caprino e pelo aborto epizoótico bovino, causando prejuízos econômicos e problemas de saúde publica. A dificuldade em se realizar o diagnóstico da clamidofilose tanto por isolamento, por provas de biologia molecular, como por provas sorológicas, pode ser a causa da ausência de citações da C. abortus em ovinos, no Brasil, até a presente data. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estimar a soroprevalência de anticorpos contra Chlamydophila em ovinos de propriedades localizadas em municípios da região de Londrina, Estado do Paraná. A prova de fixação de complemento, recomendada pela OIE, foi realizada em 267 amostras de soro sanguíneo de ovinos, provenientes de oito propriedades, sendo considerados positivos os animais que apresentaram títulos > 32. Foram detectados 19 (7, 11 %) animais positivos, e sete (87, 50 %) propriedades tiveram pelo menos um animal positivo. Nestas propriedades, foram relatados sinais clínicos de abortamento, natimortalidade, nascimento de crias fracas e repetição de cio. Dos 19 soros positivos, 17 (89, 50 %) apresentaram títulos de 32, um (5, 30 %) apresentou título de 64 e um (5, 30 %) apresentou título de 128. Este resultado indica a presença de anticorpos contra Chlamydophila nas propriedades estudadas. Bacteria {{from the}} family Chlamydiaceae are {{classified}} in genres Chlamydia and Chlamydophila.
