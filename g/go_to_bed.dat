5|$|The {{education}} of Pedro II began {{while he was}} still heir to throne, and he learned to read and write in Portuguese at age five. His first tutors were Mariana de Verna and Friar Antonio de Arrábida. When he became Emperor he already had several professors. Amongst these were Félix Taunay (father of Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay) and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (son of the regent Francisco de Lima e Silva), who taught French and Fencing respectively, and towards both of whom he developed lifelong friendship and admiration. Pedro II passed the entire day studying with only two hours reserved for amusements. He would wake up at 6.30a.m. and begin studies at seven, continuing until 10p.m., after which he would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> The disciplines were diverse, including everything from languages, history, philosophy, astronomy, physics, geography and music, to hunting, equestrianism and fencing.|$|E

25|$|After {{many years}} of being held on Mondays at 9:00pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30pm Eastern/5:30pm Pacific. The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> earlier. For many years the film {{industry}} had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office. The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, {{to the point where}} some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January or early-February ceremony held on a Sunday would have to compete with National Football League playoff games such as the Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|At home, Liza {{plays the}} spinet {{as she and}} her friend Pauline sing a duet about evening in the countryside. Their girlfriends ask to hear more, so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look {{of the young man}} in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and opens the door to the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> After the Countess retires, Liza asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into his embrace.|$|E

25|$|Rises in {{the costs}} of living make poor people less able to afford items. Poor people spend a greater portion of their budgets on food than wealthy people. As a result, poor {{households}} and those near the poverty threshold can be particularly vulnerable to increases in food prices. For example, in late 2007 increases {{in the price of}} grains led to food riots in some countries. The World Bank warned that 100 million people were at risk of sinking deeper into poverty. Threats to the supply of food may also be caused by drought and the water crisis. Intensive farming often leads to a vicious cycle of exhaustion of soil fertility and decline of agricultural yields. Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. In Africa, if current trends of soil degradation continue, the continent might be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to United Nations University's Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa. Every year nearly 11 million children living in poverty die before their fifth birthday. 1.02 billion people <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> hungry every night.|$|E
25|$|Production {{came to a}} {{temporary}} halt on November 17, 1999 {{with the death of}} cinematographer Aleksandr Zhukovskiy (Александр Жуковский). The loss was crippling for Yuriy Norshteyn — he said of Zhukovskiy that he was the only person who ever saw exactly eye-to-eye with him both as an artist and as a friend. Nevertheless, by 2001 production had resumed with a new cinematographer — Maksim Granik (Максим Граник), one of Zhukovskiy's students. Production soon halted again — this time for three years. Norshteyn spent {{a year and a half}} making a 3-minute animation for the introduction to Spokoynoy nochi, malyshi!, a popular Russian nightly show for young children to watch before they <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> (his segment was taken off the air in the summer of 2001; the show moved to another channel while the copyright for the sequence stayed with the old one). He also spent nine months working on a 2-minute sequence for the Japanese collaborative film Winter Days (released in 2003). Norshteyn said that this sequence required as much work as a 10-minute film, and that his work on it influenced The Overcoat and vice versa (the sequence contains a scene with Bashō searching for ticks in his cloak which is similar to a scene in The Overcoat).|$|E
25|$|Sir Rowland {{wonders if}} there is {{anything}} written on the autographed papers in invisible ink and they test them, revealing the names of six distributors of drugs, including Costello. Going to tell the police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone and, after a moment, Jeremy re-enters and is about to smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was away from the other two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made about seeing his golf club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E
