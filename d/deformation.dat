25|$|A hyperelastic {{material}} {{is a special}} case of a Cauchy elastic material in which the stress at any point is objective and determined only by {{the current state of}} <b>deformation</b> with respect to an arbitrary reference configuration (for more details on <b>deformation</b> see also the pages <b>Deformation</b> (mechanics) and Finite strain).

The special case of Cauchy elastic materials where the work done by the stresses is independent of the path of <b>deformation</b> is referred to as a Green elastic or hyperelastic material. Such materials are conservative and the stresses in the material can be derived by a scalar elastic potential, more commonly known as the Strain energy density function.|$|E

25|$|Elastic <b>deformation</b> in solids is {{reversible}} {{change in the}} internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As <b>deformation</b> occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force.

This is known as elastic <b>deformation</b> or elasticity.|$|E

The composite behavior is analogous to a nylon stocking, whose rubber band does the role of elastin as the nylon does the role of collagen.
