For instance when preparing food, the drive model {{appears to be}} compatible with sensations of rising hunger as the food is prepared, and, after the food has been consumed, a decrease in subjective hunger.

25|$|The maximum rpm of a {{propeller}} (at about 2800 {{depending on}} its diameter) {{is about half}} that at the maximum torque/power rpm of about 5500rpm for a car engine and these engines therefore need to be fitted with a <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> unit. Such units absorb about 20% of the engine power and therefore the normally aspirated Isuzu unit delivers the same maximum power as the Jabiru 5100. Recent developments of the Jabiru engine range by Rotec have produced replacement water-cooled cylinder heads for the 5100. This has removed the overheating problems and also allowed the nose cowling of the Mk26 to be reshaped to remove the air intake and considerably reduce the frontal area to be {{in keeping with the}} original sleek design of the Spitfire. First flights of a Mk26 with the redeveloped water-cooled Jabiru 5100 are expected in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists such as William James {{initially}} {{used the}} term motivation to refer to intention, in a sense similar {{to the concept of}} will in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came {{to be seen as a}} primary source of motivation. According to drive theory, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle, roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduced the concept of the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic events. Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking. Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> model.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ignition}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Model T,with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and trembler coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed spur gear (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6mph). A worm <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element to the gear element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.|$|E
2500|$|John Dollard taught anthropology, {{psychology}} and sociology at Yale and {{was interested in}} studying social class and specific learning experiences. Neal Miller studied under Hull at Yale, which is where he earned his Ph.D. Miller also founded the Laboratory of Physiological Psychology at Rockefeller University in New York, which is where he conducted research on animal training and this work helped to develop biofeedback. Miller and Dollard collaborated and developed a social learning theory that was successfully applied to psychotherapy and understanding. Their book, Social Learning and Imitation, listed the four fundamentals necessary for instrumental learning. These were drive, cue, response and reward and were based on Hull’s <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> theory of learning [...] They used a similar construct to Hull’s theory, however, they proposed that any strong stimulus could have motivating or drive properties without essentially being tied to the need of that particular organism. Their book, Personality and Psychotherapy (1950) {{is considered to be}} a very important book for it combined Hullian learning theory with psychoanalysis and helped to lay the foundation of cognitive behavioral therapy.|$|E

50|$|In early {{attachment}} theory, behavioural <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> {{was proposed}} by Dollard and Miller (1950) {{as an explanation}} of the mechanisms behind early attachment in infants. Behavioural <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> theory suggests that infants are born with innate drives, such as hunger and thirst, which only the caregiver, usually the mother, can reduce. Through a process of classical conditioning, the infant learns to associate the mother with the satisfaction of reduced drive and is thus able to form a key attachment bond. However, this theory is challenged by the work done by Harry Harlow, particularly the experiments involving the maternal separation of rhesus monkeys, which indicate that comfort possesses greater motivational value than hunger.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} that leave {{the validity of}} drive theory open for debate. The first {{problem is that it}} does not explain how secondary reinforcers reduce drive. For example, money does not itself satisfy any biological or psychological need, but it reduces drive on a regular basis by a pay check. Secondly, <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> theory has trouble explaining why humans and other animals voluntarily increase tension by exploring their environments, even when they are not hungry or thirsty.|$|E
50|$|As {{relatively}} small four-wheeled vehicles, these used a simplified {{layout of the}} H-drive. A single wide casing housed the differential and transfer box, with four articulated driveshafts running to bevel gear boxes inboard of each wheel. The use of bevel boxes, rather than DAF's worm gears, required the final <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> {{to be placed in}} the hubs, using an epicyclic reduction in each hub. This had the advantage of reducing torque in the driveshafts, allowing their unsprung weight to be made lighter.|$|E

50|$|According to such theorists as Clark Hull and Kenneth Spence, <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> is a {{major cause}} of {{learning}} and behavior. Primary drives are innate drives (e.g. thirst, hunger, and sex), whereas secondary drives are learned by conditioning (e.g. money). Doris Kraeling and Byron Campbell experimented to determine if “reduction would be more effective as a reinforcer if the initial drive were low than if the initial drive were high.” Their findings are quite surprising: “Changes in stimuli are more discriminable at low levels of stimulus intensity than at higher levels of stimulus intensity”.|$|E
50|$|The car had an {{air-cooled}} 8 hp V-twin cylinder Chater-Lea engine {{driving the}} rear wheels through a two speed transmission with top gear being direct and the lower gear a chain reduction system.

The footbrake operated on {{the rear wheels}} with internal expanding shoes and the handbrake controlled a leather faced band contracting onto the main drive shaft. The final drive to the rear axle used a worm <b>drive</b> <b>reduction</b> system.|$|E

5000|$|Cognitive <b>drives</b> (<b>{{reduction}}</b> of uncertainty, and competence). Uncertainty {{reduction is}} maintained through exploration and frustrated by mismatches with expectations and/or failures to create anticipations. Competence consists of task specific competence (and can be acquired through exploration of a task domain) and general competence (which measures {{the ability to}} fulfill the demands in general). The competence drive is frustrated by actual and anticipated failures to reach a goal. The cognitive drives are subject to individual variability and need regular satisfaction.|$|R
