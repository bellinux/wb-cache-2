In Singh supra, at p. 218, Wilson J. speaking for the {{three members of the}} Court who addressed the Charter ...doubted that utilitarian considerations ... could constitute a justification for a limitation on the rights set out in the Charter (emphasis added). The reason behind Wilson J.’s scepticism was that the guarantees of the Charter would be illusory if they could be ignored because it was administratively convenient to do so.

40|$|There is an {{enormous}} unmet need for immigrant legal aid in the United States. This {{is partly due to}} regulations that bar federally funded legal services organizations from representing many types of immigrants. The possible repeal of these restrictions is rarely discussed as a means to expand immigrant access to counsel. Federal funding for immigrant legal aid appears to have become taboo, despite the fact that for much of its history, legal aid was deeply connected to immigration. This forgotten history reveals that there was once broad national consensus in favor of immigrant legal aid; it became contentious and faced restriction only after legal aid lawyers began to represent “illegal aliens” during the War on Poverty. Congress reacted to legal aid lawyers’ bringing high-profile civil rights litigation on behalf of undocumented immigrants by enacting a restriction scheme that authorized representation only of those immigrants that Congress deemed permanent. This Article contends that as a constitutional matter, government should not {{be in the business of}} carving out castes of people entitled to fewer civil rights than others. The denial of legal aid to certain immigrants conflicts with a Jeffersonian view of democracy and with the principle of anti-subordination at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment. Civil legal aid may not—at this point in time—be an absolute right, but it does represent an important way for indigent and powerless minorities to have their grievances heard. This Article concludes that there is no substantial justification for discriminating against immigrants as to this basic <b>democratic</b> <b>safeguard...</b>|$|E

40|$|Participation in the {{administrative}} procedure {{is the central}} theme of this research work, that is developed according to {{the perspective of the}} change between the citizen - administration relationship, leading thread of the whole investigation. The theme chosen, at first, pushes to draw the attention to the "administrative change", starting from the consideration that the organizational and functional complexity typical of the multi-classes State, linked to the need of the new administration's legitimacy, has laid the basis for a general rethinking of the administration as “public interest care function”. In this perspective, the introduction of the law 241 / 1990 marks a fundamental turning point in the history of administrative law, not only because it introduces important <b>democratic</b> <b>safeguard</b> values that arise as a corollary of the constitutional principles of impartiality and efficiency, but above all because “lays the foundation” for a new relationship between government and citizen, in which the latter "undresses" the figure of a subject to become a resource available to the administration. In emphasizing the central role of the citizen bearer of views, interests and values within the intervention areas normatively recognized in general by law 241 / 1990, the investigation focuses on the "conquest" of {{the administrative}} citizenship, which makes the concepts of participation, inclusion and sharing the paradigms of the new organizational and management culture of public administration. On these fundamental interpretations is built the research, which dedicates {{the first part of the}} work to the analysis of the participatory institutions contemplated in the Law 241 / 1990, with a careful look at the ties of these with the "two souls" of the administrative procedure, guarantee and efficiency, that precisely with reference to the participation show all their complexity and criticality. Including the legal and social relevance of “innovation” related to the law 241 / 1990, at a later time, it is addressed the issue of computerization of public administrations as a process of modernization, which requires a “structural change”, aimed at completing the process of administrative reform that makes the improved dialogue between administration and citizen his main strength. In this perspective, the research continues analysing the implications of the computerization process on participation, not so much related to new institutions as to novel ways of intervention of the citizen in the digital administrative procedure. Finally, this research attempts to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the telematics relationship between government and citizen, which, although becoming the occasion of birth of new rights and while acknowledging an active role of the citizen in the reform process, too often it collides with the unsatisfactory level of “digital development” of our country. Leaving to the following any other clarification, represents aspiration of the writer the opening to interesting and critical insights on what is, nowadays, the most profound sense of being digital administrative citizens...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} there is a limited {{separation}} of powers in the Canadian Constitution between the executive and legislative branches. The fundamental nature of the Constitution Act, 1867 which commits the law-making power to elected legislatures demands that those bodies be prohibited from delegating their primary legislative powers to the executive. Judicial tolerance of such delegation flows from the unexamined assumption that as with the British constitution, the pivotal principle of our Constitution is parliamentary supremacy. It is not. Furthermore, such tolerance is troublesome {{in view of the fact}} that in constitutional practice today, cabinet controls Parliament. Canadian courts have the tools to develop a non-delegation doctrine that would insist that only legislatures could enact new laws or change existing ones.

40|$|The British {{government}} recently {{proposed to}} replace the House of Lords with an upper house that is largely elected by proportional representation. Could such a reform paradoxically {{pose a threat to}} Westminster-style democracy? Australian experience provides one of the best guides to the likely consequences. Australia not only has over 100 years experience of an elected federal Senate, but it also has over 150 years experience of upper house reforms in the various state parliaments. These state parliaments, though rarely discussed, provide good comparative reference points for understanding the likely effects of Lords reform. Australian parliamentary history suggests six main lessons about the potential dangers of these British proposals. It also points to the importance of properly considering the option of abolishing the upper house, and it highlights the main <b>democratic</b> <b>safeguards</b> that need to be put in place if an elected second chamber is introduced...|$|R

40|$|With {{the passage}} of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, Congress {{embarked}} upon a policy of substantial federal regulation of internal union affairs. Prior to this enactment, the impact of law on this area had been determined largely by state courts with only a modicum of legislative guidance. In formulating the LMRDA Congress was greatly concerned with determining where to draw the line between necessary <b>democratic</b> <b>safeguards</b> and the preservation of union self-determination. This concern was particularly evident in drafting Title III which deals with union trusteeships. While Congress framed Title III from a somewhat limited informational base, two facts about the nature of trusteeships were apparent. One was the trusteeships were among the most effective devices which responsible international officers had to insure order within their organizations. The other was that in some instances trusteeships had been used as a means of consolidating the power of corrupt union officers, plundering and dissipating the resources of local unions and preventing the growth of competing political elements within the organization. How has this legislative mandate fared with nine years of administrative and judicial experience? The {{purpose of this article is}} to survey generally the evolution of the trusteeship device, the response of the common law to it, the congressional concern with trusteeship abuses, the legislative history of the corrective legislation, and finally to analyze in a more detailed review the administrative and judicial experience with Title III...|$|R

40|$|Fergus M. Bordewich 2 ̆ 7 s {{foray into}} Native American {{politics}} and identity is disturbing {{on a number}} of different levels. It is, on the one hand, a remarkably accurate look at Native American political dilemmas, frustrations, and achievements. On the other, it is a flawed survey {{of what it means to}} be Native American in the United States. It lacks a clear critical framework and races willy-nilly from one group to another, judging achievements on the basis of economic success or how the tribes fit into the hierarchical apparatus that runs the nation. Bordewich is at his finest when dealing with the American obsession with race. He writes elegantly about race, the invention of the 2 ̆ 2 Indian 2 ̆ 2 as the anathema of western culture, and how European invaders and Americans used imagery to justify genocide. Race was, and is, simply a social construction used to deny human rights. The color of one 2 ̆ 7 s skin and the texture of one 2 ̆ 7 s hair are simply false and useless indicators of intelligence, cultural worth, or political reliability. Unfortunately Bordewich fails to convince after he gets to his main theme. The book is essentially an argument for dropping any 2 ̆ 2 special 2 ̆ 2 rights that Indians have managed to hang on to over the last five centuries. Bordewich writes that Indians are no longer Indians anymore and should, therefore, be treated as other Americans. In a revival of the modernization theory of colonialism, Bordewich argues that: (1) Indians are out-marrying at rates which will eventually destroy any kind of racial or tribal identity; (2) many Indian groups are neither racially nor culturally homogenous; (3) most Indians have more or less adopted the general economic views, political attitudes, and social constructions of the American majority; (4) Indian tribal governments, with few exceptions, are corrupt, do not have the <b>democratic</b> <b>safeguards</b> of institutional checks and balances, and have not provided sufficiently for the basic civil rights of tribal members that are enjoyed by other Americans; (5) Indians are frightening other Americans by dredging up certain dubious rights, such as tribal sovereignty, to deny these Americans, mostly whites, their rights of property and political representation; (6) Indian traditionalists are not really environmentalists as they are often portrayed, but the dupes of the tree-hugging, no-growth radicals standing in the path of scientific knowledge and progress; and (7) most Indians, just like other Americans, are immigrants and conquerors themselves. Given all of these factors, he contends, Indian assimilation has been accomplished and the attempt to maintain separate governments and tribal sovereignty is an exercise in futility. In short, modernization is an absolute fact, as immutable, to Bordewich, as the rhythm of the ocean tides...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} concept of delegative {{democracy}} to contemporary devel-opments in Russia and Ukraine. They qualify as examples of this phenomenon insofar as leaders in these states are elected by the people but use their democratic legitimacy to justify authoritarian behavior.

Even major players such as the EU, Australia and Canada did not make any commitments to liberalise trade in these services. This was primarily to protect the domestic industries from foreign competition, promote their growth and to protect the cultural heritage of the nations from foreign influence. Many countries have repeatedly raised concerns about the capability of the GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) framework to take into account the democratic, cultural and social aspects.

40|$|The {{intrusion}} {{of the extreme}} right-wing National Front par-ty into French public libraries in the 1990 s mobilized librari-ans to confront political interference and to defend the de-mocratic values inherent in libraries. This paper reviews {{the actions of the}} extreme right in imposing their political ideol-ogy on library acquisitions and services, and the reactions they provoked. Their intervention called into question the mission of public libraries, political autonomy, acquisitions policies and practices, {{and the role of the}} librarian. French li-brarians, the nation, and ultimately the international com-munity were alerted to the National Front’s subversion of li-braries to a political agenda. These incidents triggered prac-tical and philosophical responses as librarians developed stra-tegies to combat political interference, confronted issues of censorship and the challenge of developing pluralistic col-lections, and asserted the librarian’s role in <b>safeguarding</b> <b>democratic</b> principles.

40|$|According to the {{three-dimensional}} theory of trust {{which the author}} develops in his recent work, the measure of trust that people vest on their fellow citizens or institutions depends on three factors: the "reflected trustworthiness " as estimated by themselves in more or less rational manner, the attitude of "basic trustfulness" deriving from socialization, and the "culture of trust " pervading their society and normatively constraining for each member. The culture of trust is shaped by historical experiences of a society- the tradition of trust, and by the current structural context-the trust-inspiring milieu. The author presents {{a model of a}} structural context conducive for the emergence of the culture of trust, and then argues that the democratic organization contributes to the trust-generating conditions, like normative certainty, transparency, stability, accountability etc. The mechanism of this influence is found to be doubly paradoxical. First, democracy breeds the culture of trust by institutionalizing distrust, at many levels of democratic organization. And second, the strongest influence of democracy on the culture of trust may be expected when the institutionalized distrust remains only the potential insurance of trustworthiness, a resource used sparingly and only when there appear significant breaches of trust. Of all three components in {{the three-dimensional}} model of trust, the cultural dimension is most susceptible to practical, political measures. And the most promising method to elicit the culture of trust is designing <b>democratic</b> institutions and <b>safeguarding</b> their viable functioning...|$|R
40|$|Election law {{scholars}} are currently {{engaged in a}} vigorous debate regarding the wisdom of judicial supervision of democratic politics. Ever since the Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1962 decision in Baker v. Carr, the Court has increasingly supervised {{a dizzying array of}} election-related matters. These include the regulation of political parties, access to electoral ballots, partisanship in electoral institutions, the role of race in the design of electoral structures, campaign financing, and the justifications for limiting the franchise. In particular, and {{as a consequence of the}} Court 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the 2000 presidential elections in Bush v.

These events have spurred many scholars to argue that the Court should play a reduced role in supervising the democratic process.

Recently, two important and extremely thoughtful scholars of law and politics have staked opposing positions on this dynamic debate. Professor Richard L.
