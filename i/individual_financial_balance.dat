The <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> assumes that the assets, which cannot be paid, by volume and time correspond to the scope and time to availability of the funding.

Also, within the study we tried to highlight the main differences between the analysis of the <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> based on the regular balance sheet and its analysis based on the <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> sheet.

The results of the study have shown significant differences between the analyzes made on different types of balance sheets. These results could open new research directions, such as more detailed analyzes based on the <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> sheet, but could also raise the awareness of the stakeholders (except the governments) about the fact that the balance sheet, in its present form (form which is imposed by the law), has some boundaries, and for a meaningful analysis of the <b>financial</b> position (<b>financial</b> <b>balance)</b> it is often necessary to resort to derivative forms of the balance sheet...|$|R

We do not know that the Romanian economic literature to be treated that aspect. That is why we consider the study as being useful to managers, members, shareholders, and all business partners to form the economic decisions. The purpose of this financial analysis is to examine critically the accounting and financial information ofered by the companies to assess their performance and their financial position (Laurence Le Gallo). The financial position of firms is assessed based on the financial structure and <b>financial</b> <b>balance.</b> In a same time the <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> is approached from a static perspective based on the: net situation, working capital, necessary of working capital, net treasury. The present analyses deals with <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> in a static manner based on these four indicators listed. The sources of data for the analysis of <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> are offered mainly in the financial statement.

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{studies the}} {{statistical}} {{correlation between the}} return on assets and some measures of <b>financial</b> <b>balance.</b> The research relies on the assumptions that the <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> influences most of the indicators of performances of a company. Therefore, we chose the return on assets as dependent variable, as it represents the final result of the company’s business. As independent variables, meaning measures that point out the <b>financial</b> <b>balance,</b> we selected 24 indicators. All these indicators were calculated for 40 Romanian companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange and included a period of 4 years between 2007 and 2010. The data required to calculate these indicators were extracted from the annual financial statements of these companies. The study includes two years of economic growth for Romania (2007 and 2008) and two of downturn (2009 and 2010). It is thus expected that most indicators analyzed to worsen {{in the past two}} years. We concluded, at the end of research, that the profitability of the Romanian firms declined {{as a result of the}} economic crisis. Before crisis (2007) it was significantly influenced by the financial structure and the <b>financial</b> <b>balance.</b> After the crisis, the importance of indicators emphasizing the business administration (as profit margin and rates of turnover) increased, but also the importance of the random external factors, uncontrollable by the management.

In this study, the author examined the factors influencing the <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> of 1570 societies in this scheme from 1974 to 1981, by analyzing 20 of 213 items obtained from the report on striking a <b>financial</b> <b>balance.</b> The results are summarized as follows: (1) 'The ordinary <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> of each society' is influenced by both 'the type of enterprise' and 'the type of society', with the former more influential than the latter. (2) Among societies, there are greater differences of factors, such as 'the sex ratio of insured persons', 'the total costs for health and welfare facilities', 'the ratio of costs for health education', 'the ratio of costs for preventive measures', 'the ratio of costs for promotion of sports', 'the costs for additional benefits per one insured person', 'the costs for additional benefits per one dependant', 'the total costs for benefits per capita', than other factors, when the author compares them. (3) From the result of the correlation analysis among the factors, 'the mean age of insured persons' shows a high correlation not only with 'the ordinary <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> of each society' but also with many other factors. 'The total costs for health and welfare facilities' does not directly reflect the health care activity of each society. (4) 'The number of insured persons' has not directly influenced 'the ordinary <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> of each society' but shows the financial stability of the society among the special type of society. (5) To show the synthetical character of each society, such factors as 'the average monthly standard remuneration', 'the type of enterprise', 'the type of society' and 'the number of insured persons' are adequate in respect of the total <b>financial</b> <b>balance.</b> In the same way, 'the total costs for benefits per capita', 'the number of insured persons' and 'the costs for additional benefits per one dependant' are adequate in respect of expenditure.
