5|$|The castle {{had three}} tiers of {{artillery}} – the heaviest and longest range weapons occupying the upper levels, including the keep – {{with a total}} of 39 firing positions, and 31 gunloops in the basement for handguns should close defence be required. The embrasures in the walls were all widely splayed to provide the maximum possible space for the <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> operate and traverse, and the interior of the castle was designed with vents to allow the smoke from its <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> escape.|$|E
5|$|Between the two World Wars, Nevada {{served in}} both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. Though she had {{originally}} been equipped with 21 five-inch (127mm)/51 cal <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> defend against enemy destroyers, this number was reduced to 12 in 1918, due to the overly wet bow and stern positions of the other nine.|$|E

5|$|Broadside {{armament}} {{also had}} disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, {{the adoption of}} ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire. These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, Bristol merchants {{concentrated}} on developing trade with Spain and its American colonies. This included the smuggling of prohibited goods, {{such as food}} and <b>guns,</b> <b>to</b> Iberia during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604). Bristol's illicit trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.|$|E

5|$|In December, {{the ship}} became the testbed for the Navy's RQ-2Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The drone was {{designed}} {{to serve as an}} aerial spotter for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> be used against an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter spotter. Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the Mahan-class destroyers began {{a wartime}} {{armament}} refitting process, {{but most of}} the class was not fully refitted until 1944. The notable refits to the Mahan class included the removal of one 5-inch/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin Bofors 40 mm guns (1.6in) and between four and six 20 mm Oerlikon (0.9in) <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> increase the ships' light anti-aircraft (AA) armament.|$|E
50|$|In March and April 1945, two prototypes were built, one {{equipped}} with the 100 mm D-10 tank <b>gun</b> (<b>to</b> be designated SU-101 when inducted into actual service), the other with the 122 mm D-25S tank <b>gun</b> (<b>to</b> be named SU-102).

5|$|In early 1945, {{while under}} repair for combat damage, Mississippi {{received}} a new secondary battery. The old 51-caliber 5-inch guns were removed, and eight {{more of the}} 25-caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed, along with thirteen quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm Oerlikon <b>guns.</b> <b>To</b> compensate for the added weight, the ship's armored conning tower was removed.|$|E
5|$|The Ingeborg, {{built in}} 1776, had an eight-12-pounder {{centerline}} armament which {{was open to}} the elements, but two heavy 18-pounders in the bow and two 6-pounder chase guns in the stern. The rowing benches with room for three men per bench were {{on either side of}} the centerline battery, but had to swing forwards and outwards to allow the <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> pivot to either side.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} triple expansion engines consumed {{large amounts}} of internal space that could otherwise {{have been used for}} magazines. Without sufficient magazine capacity to support superfiring centerline turrets, designers were compelled to distribute six main turrets in an unusual hexagonal configuration. Two twin turrets were mounted fore and aft (one on each end), and two were mounted on each flank of the ship. Firing directly forward and aft, the ships could bring 6 <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> bear, and 8 on the broadside; this was the same theoretical capability as Dreadnought, but the Nassau-class ships required two additional <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> achieve it. It was considered that this arrangement provided a useful reserve of heavy guns that were shielded from enemy fire.|$|E

At 12:30 on 19 September Liman von Sanders ordered the 13th Depot Regiment at Nazareth and the military police, {{a total of six}} companies and 12 machine <b>guns,</b> <b>to</b> occupy Lejjun and defend the Musmus Pass.|$|E
5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> sweep the Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area {{was used as a}} bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft <b>guns.</b> <b>To</b> increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|E

5|$|Bouvet was {{the last}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. The first ship was , which formed the basis for Bouvet and three other ships. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> single turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E
5|$|By 13 August, the {{offensive}} had fully halted, with German forces being {{driven out of}} Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks and assault <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> Allied counter-attacks and air strikes, {{more than two-thirds of}} their committed total. As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West in danger of being encircled by Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s and 1890s, {{both the}} power of naval {{artillery}} and the speed of warships had further increased, leading to further investment in the castle between 1888 and 1893. The keep's magazine, which could hold up to 2,250 shells, was reinforced with concrete and the south bastion of the old castle was filled in with shingle and concrete for additional protection. New 6-pounder (2.7kg) quick-firing guns were installed in a battery {{on the end of}} the east wing, supported by machine <b>guns,</b> <b>to</b> enable them to target fast moving vessels, particularly the new torpedo boats. Further emplacements for 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed, including one on the top of the keep.|$|E
