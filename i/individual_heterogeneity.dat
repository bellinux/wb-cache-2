40|$|<b>Individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> and {{correlations}} between life history traits play {{a fundamental role in}} life history evolution and population dynamics. Unobserved <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in survival {{can be a}} nuisance for estimation of age effects at the individual level by causing bias due to mortality selection. We jointly analyze survival and breeding output from successful breeding attempts in an island population of Silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis chlorocephalus) by fitting models that incorporate age effects and <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> via random effects. The number of offspring produced increased with age of parents in their first years of life but then eventually declined with age. A similar pattern was found for the probability of successful breeding. Annual survival declined with age even when <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> was not accounted for. The rate of senescence in survival, however, depends on the variance of <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> and vice versa; hence, both cannot be simultaneously estimated with precision. Model selection supported <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in breeding performance, but we found no correlation between <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in survival and breeding performance. We argue that individual random effects, unless unambiguously identified, should be treated as statistical nuisance or taken as a starting point in a search for mechanisms rather than given direct biological interpretation.

40|$|The {{modelling}} of predator prey dynamics is {{of great}} importance in ecology. Models based on differential equations aim to understand the interactions between populations of prey and predators at population scale, but {{they are unable to}} handle spatial and <b>individual</b> behaviour <b>heterogeneities</b> (<b>individual</b> scale). In this study, a population-driven individual-based model is proposed that has been developed from the archetypical Lotka-Volterra model. The population scale was retained for processes with slower dynamics, such as reproduction for both species and the natural death of predators. The individual scale was only used for the predation process, defining local rules for individual movements of prey and predators (related to a perception distance of predators and the presence of shelters for prey in the spatial environment) and to locate births and deaths. This model was compared with the Lotka-Volterra model. Simulations were able to exhibit the overall classic periodic evolution of population sizes with local variations. The effects of spatial heterogeneity were then explored through a range of prey refuge densities. The model was implemented on the Netlogo platform. This work illustrates how both individual and population scales may be linked through methodological choices in order to focus on the impacts of spatialisation and take into account the effects of spatial and <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Mark-recapture {{analysis}} {{is a fundamental}} tool for understanding populations, since it allows the estimation of demographic parameters, such as survival, movement and reproduction, {{which can be used}} to infer population status and predict dynamics. As individuals in wild populations do not all behave in the same way, a challenge is presented in the collection and analysis of these data. Within a natural population, animals may exhibit substantial individual variation which can manifest through these demographic parameters. Inherent individual dierences in movement and behavior can introduce bias into mark-recapture estimates (most notoriously, of population size), and are often of considerable interest in their own right. There has been much focus in mark-recapture research on the development of methods to account for <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity,</b> yet easily applied, accurate methods are still lacking. The most natural, but computationally complex, approach for modeling <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> assumes a continuous distribution using random eects. This method introduces the complexity of solving for the individual random eects which has been a stumbling block of much work in the mark-recapture eld. The focus of this thesis is the development of methods to better estimate <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in mark-recapture data. In chapter 1 I introduce the concepts arising in this thesis and briey outline techniques for modeling <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity.</b> Chapter 2 explores the population consequences of <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in spatial use {{in the context of a}} marine protected area. Using population projections, I explore the population consequences of <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in proportion of time spent inside a marine protected area. The projections indicate that <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in spatial use and site delity could have important implications under certain conditions for the dynamics of populations managed using marine protected areas. In several scenarios, high <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> resulted in larger population size and positive population trajectories, compared to decline and eventual extinction with low <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in site delity. I then present three novel statistical approaches for handling <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> using random effects. The rst, developed in chapter 3, is an approach using Laplace approximation with Gaussian random efects, implemented in the language Automatic Dierentiation Model Builder (ADMB). In chapter 4 I develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling framework with a parametric distribution for the <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity.</b> This is extended in chapter 5 to incorporate the non-parametric Dirichlet process prior. The natural subgroups often seen in mark-recapture studies, and the complexity of real mark-recapture data means that parametric and discrete style models can be insucient. Non-parametric models avoid these often restrictive assumptions. The Dirichlet process prior is a flexible extension to a parametric model as it avoids assumptions about the functional form of the distribution, and it extends discrete style models to the infinite limit by avoiding any prespecications about the number of groups. Each of these methods was tested using simulated data. In each case the simulation studies demonstrated accurate estimation of true parameter values with random effects. In the case of the Dirichlet process, the simulation studies were used to explore the ability and limits of the Dirichlet process in identifying multiple behavioural modes. The methods are applied to data for up to 1100 individually identified North Atlantic humpback whales, where an unseen individual may be present but not seen, temporarily absent, or dead.

Second, accounting for cross-equation correlations does not seem to improve the prediction performances and finally, ignoring <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> introduces substantial loss in prediction accuracy...|$|E

This thesis {{can be divided into}} two parts, presenting two ways for studying <b>individual</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in financial markets and economy. One way to study the behaviour of heterogeneous individuals is building models based on microsimulations where one can model agents with different preferences and behavioural rules and investigate behavioural characteristics and individual interactions which lead to the behaviour of the market as a whole. Another way to study the behaviour of heterogeneous individuals is studying the observed individual behaviour with the help of micro-level data retrieved from various surveys. When studying individual behaviour using survey responses, a researcher often needs to create reliable measures which may represent a behavioural characteristic under consideration. Sometimes a researcher encounters many alternatives when approaching a specific question. Therefore, it is also necessary to investigate the relations between these alternatives and whether they might represent the same underlying behavioural factor. ...|$|E

These features of the model are very appealing {{in the case of}} convergence in the euro Eurozone. Countries with different economic sizes and structures may appear to follow a similar development path but at different speeds so that they are currently at different stages on that path. The effect on technological and capital accumulation caused by the different economic policies in different countries may also be important to explain different speeds of convergence.
