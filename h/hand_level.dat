Like {{the town and the}} village, Hunter takes its name from John Hunter, a somewhat despised local landlord. It is not known when the mountain was first climbed, or by whom.

For a time before Arnold Henry Guyot identified Slide, either Hunter or nearby Black Dome, central peak of the Blackhead Mountains, was thought to be the range's highest, in contrast to the claims of nearby hoteliers for Kaaterskill High Peak.|$|E

First, PEEP could alter the reliability of transpulmonary thermodilution by having opposite effects on the diffusion volume of the cold indicator.

On the other <b>hand,</b> high <b>levels</b> of PEEP could increase the cold indicator diffusion volume by recruiting some atelectatic lung regions and reducing hypoxic vasoconstriction, leading to an overestimation of EVLWI [58].|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} {{endoscopic}} procedures, coupled with decreasing insurance reimbursement, has necessitated improvement in endoscopy unit operational performance measures, such as increasing throughput and reducing staff overtime without {{an increase in}} patient waiting time. In pursuit of improving these measurements, maintaining the nurse-to-patient ratio requirements in the recovery area throughout the clinic’s operation time is a challenging problem for endoscopy units. To maintain compliance with this ratio, patients occasionally have {{to be held in}} the procedure rooms during the clinic’s peak time. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>level</b> loading could potentially increase the amount of overtime. In this paper, we describe our efforts to use discrete event simulation to investigate the impact of several strategies to address the minimum recovery nurse requirements in the endoscopy unit of Duke University Medical Center. Our objective was to minimize patient flow times and nurse overtime while sustaining the required nursepatient staffing ratio in recovery. ...|$|E

We aimed to study the relationship between eating disorders and rest levels, ICAM- 1, E-selection, and ghrelin hormone in obese people. Materials and Methods  In this quasi-experimental study, 120 obese men (25 - 30 years old) were purposefully selected. Then the data about their eating disorders gathered with eating attitudes test (EAT- 26) questionnaire. In the next phase in the rest condition and after overnight fasting, blood samples are collected for measurement of rest levels, ICAM- 1, E-selection, and ghrelin hormone. Finally the data were analyzed with appropriate statistical tests in SPSS version 18. Results Mean and deviation of rest levels, ICAM- 1, E-selection, and ghrelin hormone were respectively 3064. 19, 61. 5 ± 19. 7, and 2. 5 ± 1. 5 and there was not any statistical significance relationship between eating disorders ICAM- 1, E-selection, and ghrelin hormone in obese men (...|$|E

Biomonitoring has been proven to be necessary supplementary to the traditional monitoring techniques and hence the importance of Bacillariophyceae as ecological indicators of water quality has been stressed...|$|E
