It is promoted by VH1 since 2010. Gaga received one award and has been nominated five times.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Do</b> <b>Something</b> Awards {{is a joint}} awards {{ceremony}} held by the <b>Do</b> <b>Something</b> Services and the American cable television network VH1. The Vampire Diaries received two nominations in 2012, one in the Best TV Drama category and one for Somerhalder.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{negative}} and constructive criticism have their appropriate uses, but {{often it is}} considered a requirement of criticism that they are combined. Thus, it is often considered that those who find fault with something should also offer an option for putting it right. More generally, any rule for behavior of any kind usually implies both [...] "do's" [...] and [...] "don't s". <b>Doing</b> <b>something</b> usually also implies not <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else, and, not <b>doing</b> <b>something,</b> often implies <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else. There is therefore a conscious choice [...] "to do this, or do that", but not {{both at the same}} time.|$|R

5|$|But now my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. I really wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} {{obedience}} and punishment driven morality {{would be a}} child refusing to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} book, Verghese claims {{that if there}} is a cost of <b>doing</b> <b>something,</b> the cost of not doing is all too often overlooked. Verghese {{suggests}} the cost of not <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> can be far greater.|$|R
5000|$|Look at that verse {{and answer}} this question: According to Jesus, what must a person {{do to keep}} from being judged for sin? Must he stop <b>doing</b> <b>something?</b> Must he promise to stop <b>doing</b> <b>something?</b> Must he have never <b>done</b> <b>something?</b> The answer is so simple that many stumble all over it without ever seeing it. All Jesus {{requires}} is that the individual [...] "believe in" [...] Him. Charles Stanley (p. 67).|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{positive}} response the game {{would go on}} to receive, Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games' last Spyro title. In an interview, CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games because they could not do anything new with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different. Future Spyro games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, and Tantalus Media.|$|E
5|$|FreeFall Stage {{discouraged}} {{people under the}} age of fifteen from attending because of {{the subject matter of the}} play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at the greatest risk of being trafficked. Several human trafficking survivors attended the performances, and other survivors sent the Eldridges messages about their personal experiences with human trafficking. Quandt said that he encountered many audience members who, because of watching the play, became determined to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to combat human trafficking.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – decided to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about {{the absence of}} peace and security in the countryside. The state police {{at the time was}} as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{campaigns for}} her staff's {{right to get}} flu shots from Dr. Leo Spaceman (Parnell), but Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) will not allow it due to a limited supply. Meanwhile, Jack tries to think of {{creative}} ways {{to spend time with}} his girlfriend, Elisa (Hayek), as she works seven days a week. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) try to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> nice for the crew.|$|E
5|$|Jokes {{from earlier}} scripts were used. In one scene, Carla Tortelli orders a phone caller to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about their unruly children. When {{one of the}} bartenders {{suggests}} hiring a babysitter, Carla replied that the caller was the babysitter. The cast {{did not know the}} ending of the pilot episode during production, since the final draft of the script was dated April 16, 1982.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E

5|$|The {{widespread}} anxieties and consternation over government inactivity {{throughout the}} crisis could be deflected and resolved by rescuing {{a handful of}} children. In terms of recovering a sense of agency (in a conflict characterised by protestations of powerlessness by political and military authorities alike), the desire to do (and be seen to <b>do)</b> <b>something</b> was expressed and assuaged by transporting and incorporating some of the need and distress into the UK where it could be tended to and made better.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She wants to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that's so {{over the top and}} use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.|$|E

We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E

5|$|At the 2007 Oscar ceremony, DiCaprio {{and former}} Vice President Al Gore {{appeared}} {{to announce that}} the Academy Awards had incorporated environmentally intelligent practices in its production. He presented at the 2007 American leg of Live Earth, and in 2010 his environmental work earned DiCaprio a nomination for the VH1 <b>Do</b> <b>Something</b> Award, honoring people who do good. In 2014 he was appointed as a United Nations representative on climate change, and later that year he made an opening statement {{to members of the}} UN Climate Summit. He again spoke at the UN in April 2016 prior to the signing of Paris Climate Change Agreement.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At {{the time of its}} demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E

40|$|Labels like vegan, virgin, or {{nonsmoker}} {{get thrown}} around to identify forms of abstinence, {{but for many}} abstainers such labels are also proud declarations of who they are. Setting aside the moral debates and psychological assessments surrounding abstinence, Jamie L. Mullaney here asks {{why it is that}} the act of not <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> plays such {{a crucial role in the}} formation of our personal identities. Based on interviews with individuals who abstain from habits as diverse as sex, cigarettes, sugar, and technology, Everyone Is NOT Doing It identifies four different types of abstainers: quitters; those who have never <b>done</b> <b>something</b> and never will; those who haven't <b>done</b> <b>something</b> yet, but might in the future; and those who are not <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> temporarily. Mullaney assesses the commonalities that bind abstainers, as well as how perceptions of abstinence change according to social context, age, and historical era. In contrast to such earlier forms of abstinence as social protest, entertainment, or an instrument of social stratification, not <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> now gives people a more secure sense of self by offering a more affordable and manageable identity in a world of ever-expanding options...|$|R
