5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} {{that he is going}} to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E
5|$|The {{group and}} Botnick {{organized}} a makeshift recording studio at their private rehearsal space, the Doors' Workshop, in a two-story building at 8512 Santa Monica Boulevard. They could then record {{in a more}} comfortable and relaxed setting while avoiding the expenses of a professional studio. A mixing console previously owned by Elektra was installed upstairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Workshop,</b> while studio monitors, microphones, and keyboards were set up downstairs. To compensate {{for the lack of}} an isolated vocal booth, Morrison recorded in the bathroom doorway, singing into the same microphone used on the Doors' final tour.|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} diversity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> of <b>the</b> Zinneke Parade, a community arts project in Brussels. Participants work together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> {{to create a}} performance that {{will be part of}} an urban parade. Participants are typically EU expats, local inhabitants, illiterate migrants as well as primary school children and young Belgian professionals. <b>The</b> <b>workshops</b> focus on <b>the</b> creation of parade movements and dance choreographies, as well as the making of costumes, hats and floats. We present four workshop scenes in this article. These scenes present the sociomaterial connections and the direct engagement between and entanglement of objects and bodies gathered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> to create <b>the</b> parade performance. The focus on the bodily and material connections of diverse participants draws attention to <b>the</b> conclusion that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops,</b> dealing with diversity happens by giving form to a common world. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was fresco, {{in which}} the paint is applied to damp plaster. Michelangelo had been an apprentice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mold because it was too wet. Michelangelo had to remove it and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E
5|$|The true {{and only}} {{practicable}} object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, {{not of the}} minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop,</b> but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.|$|E
5|$|Once the Imps are working, {{the player}} must then {{set up a}} basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as food, are bred), and a Treasury. After {{connecting}} the dungeon to a 'Portal', minions will arrive. Minions include dragons, warlocks, and the horned reaper, as well as undead creatures such as vampires and skeletons. As the game progresses, the player moves along a technology tree, unlocking further rooms and spells. Rooms can only be built on tiles belonging to the player. The player is red and the tiles are coloured accordingly. Other keepers have different colours, and the heroes are white. Unaligned creatures and rooms are multicoloured. The player can build traps and doors, created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop.</b> Traps include lightning and boulder traps, the latter instantly killing creatures it comes into contact with. As with rooms, they can only be built on tiles that belong to the player. Traps are not built instantly; Imps need to place them on the blueprint. The Temple is a room where creatures are made happy, and the player can sacrifice creatures to the dark gods. The gods may reward or punish the player, or be indifferent depending on the sacrifice.|$|E

In 1959, the front-engined CF-series was introduced with the CF65 and CF75 (later CF66 and CF76). The CF-series was built until 1966.|$|E
25|$|Born Filippo Lippi in Prato, Tuscany, the illegitimate son of {{the painter}} Fra Filippo Lippi and Lucrezia Buti, Filippino first trained under his father. They moved to Spoleto, where Filippino served as {{workshop}} adjuvant {{in the construction of}} the Cathedral there. When his father died in 1469, he completed the frescos with Storie della Vergine (Histories of the Virgin) in the cathedral. Filippino Lippi completed his apprenticeship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> of Botticelli, who had been a pupil of Filippino's father.

25|$|He was presumably born in Nijmegen, {{then in the}} Duchy of Guelders, {{which was}} bought by Philip the Bold in 1473, {{and is in the}} modern Netherlands. He {{probably}} trained there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> of his father, the artist Willem Maelwael (his uncle was also an artist), and is recorded as an artist in 1382. He was the uncle of the famous manuscript illuminators, the three Limbourg brothers, whom he introduced to Philip's service around 1400. Malouel also worked as an illuminator, but seems mostly to have produced larger works.|$|E

25|$|Claims are {{sometimes}} made that Leonardo da Vinci was an alchemist. He was trained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist {{in so much}} as that he experimented with different media for suspending paint pigment. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with the Last Supper deteriorating within a century, and the Battle of Anghiari running off the wall. In Leonardo's many pages of notes about artistic processes, {{there are some that}} pertain to the use of silver and gold in artworks, information he would have learned as a student.|$|E
25|$|He worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> of Alexandru Săndulescu, a {{shoemaker}} who was {{an active}} member in the then-illegal Communist Party.

He was first arrested in 1933, {{at the age of}} 15, for street fighting during a strike and again, in 1934, first for collecting signatures on a petition protesting the trial of railway workers and twice more for other similar activities. By the mid-1930s, he had been in missions in Bucharest, Craiova, Câmpulung, and Râmnicu Vâlcea, being arrested several times.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, all pilots were conscripted into the military {{and there was a}} ban on civilian aviation. In 1940, the company started air ambulance flights for the military. Following the German invasion of Norway, many of Widerøe's pilots and aircraft were flown to Mjøsa where they served as part of the defence. All civilian aircraft were grounded during the occupation, and German authorities demanded that magnetos and propellers be handed <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> <b>workshop</b> at Bogstad was kept busy with production of ambulance sleds for the German military. In secret, the company also started building the Hønningstad C-5 Polar ambulance aircraft at Bogstad.|$|E
