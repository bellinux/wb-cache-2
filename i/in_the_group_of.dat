5|$|These {{ideas can}} be {{illustrated}} by drawing objects in pairs. It {{is difficult to}} depict zero groups of two, or to emphasize the nonexistence of a leftover object, so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> five objects, there are two pairs. More importantly, there is a leftover object, so 5 is odd. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> four objects, there is no leftover object, so 4 is even. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> just one object, there are no pairs, {{and there is a}} leftover object, so 1 is odd. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> zero objects, there is no leftover object, so 0 is even.|$|E

For the majority of the battle, the IBattle Squadron formed the center of the line of battle, behind Rear Admiral Behncke's IIIBattle Squadron, and followed by Rear Admiral Mauve's elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the IIBattle Squadron. Nassau was the third ship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> four, behind Rheinland and ahead of Westfalen; Posen was the squadron's flagship. When the German fleet reorganized into a nighttime cruising formation, the order of the ships was inadvertently reversed, and so Nassau was the second ship in the line, astern of Westfalen.|$|E

5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> seven females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E
