She also participated in the DVD commentary for Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters. From March 28 to June 22, 2008, the Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain in Paris hosted a major exhibition of the visual artwork of Patti Smith, Land 250, drawn from pieces created between 1967 and 2007. At the 2008 Rowan Commencement ceremony, Smith received an honorary doctorate degree for her contributions to popular culture.|$|E

25|$|Effective {{blinding}} can {{be difficult}} to achieve where the treatment is notably effective (indeed, studies have been suspended in cases where the tested drug combinations were so effective that it was deemed unethical to continue withholding the findings from the control group, and the general population), or where the treatment is very distinctive in taste or has unusual side-effects that allow the researcher and/or the subject to guess which group they were assigned to. It is also difficult to use the <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> method to compare surgical and non-surgical interventions (although sham surgery, involving a simple incision, might be ethically permitted). A good clinical protocol will foresee these potential problems to ensure blinding is as effective as possible. It has also been argued that even in a double-blind experiment, general attitudes of the experimenter such as skepticism or enthusiasm towards the tested procedure can be subconsciously transferred to the test subjects.|$|E
25|$|Although Linus Pauling {{is known}} for highly respectable {{research}} in chemistry and biochemistry, he is also known for promoting the consumption of vitamin C in large doses. Pauling wrote multiple books endorsing vitamin C megadosing. Although he claimed and stood firm in his claim that consuming over 1,000mg is helpful for one’s immune system when fighting a head cold, the results of empirical research do not align with this view. Researchers Vitetta, Sali, Paspaliaris, and Reavley (2002) completed a <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> randomized control study with 400 healthy participants. Throughout the 18 month experiment, there were 189 reported cases of head colds. Researchers {{found that there were}} no significant differences between the medication groups, and taking 1,000mg of vitamin C at the first signs of a head cold did not help (Vitetta et al., 2002). There are also some minor yet unwanted ailments associated with vitamin C megadosing. These ailments were first noted in 1981 by Dr. Fong, who said that large doses of vitamin C can cause diarrhea and urethritis for limited amounts of time (Fong, 1981).|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to naproxen. After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group compared to the group that received naproxen. The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of naproxen. The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) study was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its data safety and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking at the results of the study, it showed a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a news release announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E

40|$|We {{designed}} a randomized, <b>double</b> <b>blinded,</b> 3 -months controlled prospective clinical study to investigate effects of oral uridine on the ocular surface in dry eye patients. Twenty-seven patients who diagnosed as dry eye with lower than 5 mm of wetting in the Schirmer strip, with corneal epithelial erosion and who completely followed-up till 3 months were enrolled. Corneal-conjunctival fluorescein staining, non-anesthetic Schirmer test, impression cytology, and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) were evaluated {{in the experimental}} and placebo groups at the baseline, 1 and 3 months after start of medication in a <b>double</b> <b>blinded</b> manner. Fluorescein stain score of the cornea was markedly decreased in oral uridine group compared to the placebo group at 3 months after medication (P= 0. 032, Mann-Whitney U test). The Schirmer wetting score for the oral uridine group was significantly increased (P= 0. 001, Wilcoxon signed rank test) at 3 months and its difference between two groups was statistically significant (P= 0. 030, Mann-Whitney U test). OSDI scores were significantly decreased at 1 and 3 months in treatment group. Oral uridine is effective in treatment of dry eyes...|$|R

25|$|Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an {{antioxidant}} {{that is made}} naturally {{by human}} cells. It can also be administered in capsules or {{can be found in}} foods such as red meat, organ meats, and yeast. Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful free radicals that can cause damage to tissues and organs. It has {{an important role in the}} Krebs cycle as a coenzyme leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular glutathione, and nerve-growth factors. Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve nerve conduction velocity. Because flavors are perceived by differences in electric potential through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a neuropathy. ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for burning mouth syndrome spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia. In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months followed by a two-month treatment of ALA. The results reported show that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group. After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement. This study suggests that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients and supports that full <b>double</b> <b>blind</b> randomized studies should be performed.|$|E

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a common}} chronic disorder {{that is associated with}} significant disability and health care costs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review and assess published randomised controlled trials examining the clinical effectiveness of interventions for IBS for 1987 - 1998. A literature search was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials of IBS treatments: 45  studies were identified that described randomised controlled trials and of these, six fulfilled all three criteria used to assess the quality of randomised controlled trials, as described by Jadad and colleagues. 1 These criteria are: adequate description of randomisation, <b>double</b> <b>blinding,</b> and description of withdrawals and dropouts. It is concluded that there are few studies which offer convincing evidence of effectiveness in treating the IBS symptom complex. This review strongly suggests that future work should include well designed trials that: describe the randomisation method; use internationally approved diagnostic criteria; and are <b>double</b> <b>blinded</b> and placebo controlled. Clear well defined outcome measures are necessary. Inclusion of quality of life measures allows comparison between trials in different therapeutic areas. Conducting such studies will help to overcome some of the difficulties identified in this review. ...|$|R
