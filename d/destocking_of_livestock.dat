40|$|This study explores how {{households}} in low-income country, without {{full access to}} credit and insurance market, built their productive asset {{in the face of}} shocks and subsistence constraints to their income. Particularly, it investigates {{the extent to which the}} Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) can be viewed as an effective program for household’s livestock building in the face of shocks and subsistence constraint in Tigray, Ethiopia. Two years of panel data was collected from 15 villages of the region. The panel data was supplemented with a household survey group discussion about the impact of the program. A combination of Propensity score matching and fixed effect estimator are applied to evaluate the impact of the program. I found that the program has positive effects on livestock buildings from both methods, though it is not statically significant in the fixed effect estimator. This is because households are reducing selling their livestock to cover food consumption. Accordingly, PSNP does not cause <b>destocking</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> assets rather it helps to maintain the existing livestock and filling farm households’ food consumption shortage. When households have own products for consumption, some of the income from PSNP allocates to by livestock’s (sheep, goat and chicken). From our survey, I found that about 19 % of the beneficiaries used the income from the PSNP to buy livestock. Besides, the program has a positive correlation with reducing the need to migration in slack season for searching of labor. Thus the program creates an incentive to have more livestock and crowding in effects in households’ labor endowments...|$|E
40|$|Pastoralists {{are people}} who, for their livelihood, depend on {{livestock}} raising using the natural pasture. Sustainability of pastoralist production {{is important for}} their livelihood {{as well as to}} the supply of animal-based protein. However, concerns with the pastoralist production system have also been voiced, particularly, on the ecological implications of the system. As a consequence, sustainability of the pastoral system and pastoralists that operate therein is a central issue in many debates among development practitioners, academics, and policy makers). Central to this debate is whether pastoralists can be expected to adapt their livestock production strategies to the varying availability of natural resources (i. e., pasture and water). Thus, herd size management in terms of stocking and <b>destocking</b> <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> by pastoralists has become a central issue in the debate. The stocking and destocking decision in anticipation of changing external conditions can be conceived of as a marketing challenge to pastoralists, not only contributing to their livelihood and profit, but also to the sustainability of the system. As such, markets (and therefore, marketing) relates not only to economic and social aspects of sustainability, but also to the ecological aspects. This study investigates whether and how marketing can contribute to the sustainability of pastoralists. For this purpose, four lines of research are explored: (1) Is pastoralism in principle a sustainable production system?; If so under which conditions is such system sustainable?, (2) How does marketing relate to the conditions under which pastoralism is sustainable?, (3) Which concepts from the marketing literature can generate insights that potentially contribute to the sustainability of pastoralism?, and (4) How do these concepts empirically relate to the social and economic aspects of sustainability and to the resource dilemma that characterizes the ecological aspect of pastoralists’ sustainability? The thesis indicates that marketing can help pastoralists to strengthen their livelihood and to adapt to changing natural conditions through strategic selling and buying of livestock. In that respect only strategic marketing with a central view on the creation of customer value can contribute to economic, social and ecological sustainability at the same time. Thus, the thesis shows evidence that if pursued with a strategic intent marketing is a viable tool also for the sustainable development of the pastoralist system. Market orientation (in terms of customer orientation and interfunctional coordination) is in that respect the key concept. The thesis also contributes to the literature on the role of marketing in emerging economies indicating that market orientation theory is not restricted to formal economies with bounded organizations, but generalizable to informal economies such as pastoralists. To help pastoralists to live in a sustainable manner, policy should support their adaptation along the lines of the market by not just  strengthening market integration, but by advocating and facilitating a market orientation.    ...|$|E

40|$|Aims: Investigating the {{distribution}} and origin of Cryptosporidium species in a water catchment affected by <b>destocking</b> and restocking <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> {{as a result of}} a foot and mouth disease epidemic. Methods and Results: Surface water, livestock and wildlife samples were screened for Cryptosporidium and oocysts characterised by sequencing SSU rRNA and COWP loci, and fragment analysis of ML 1, ML 2 and GP 60 microsatellite loci. Oocyst concentrations in water samples (0 – 20 Æ 29 per 10 l) were related to rainfall events, amount of rainfall and topography. There was no detectable impact from catchment restocking. Cryptosporidium spp. found in water were indicative <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> (Cryptosporidium andersoni and Cryptosporidium parvum) and wildlife (novel genotypes) sources. However, C. andersoni was not found in any animals sampled. Calf infections were age related; C. parvum was significantly more common in younger animals (< 4 weeks old). Older calves shared Cryptosporidium bovis, Cryptosporidium ryanae and C. parvum. Wildlife shed C. parvum, Cryptosporidium ubiquitum, muskrat genotype II and deer genotype. Conclusions: Several factors affect the occurrence of Cryptosporidium within a catchment. In addition to farmed and wild animal hosts, topography and rainfall patterns are particularly important. Significance and Impact of the Study: These factors must be considered when undertaking risk-based water safety plans...|$|R

The performance <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> export has been found noteworthy. The liberalization policy initiated in 1991 seems to have improved the performance <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> exports. The study has revealed that India is competitive in export of meat products, except poultry. The export of buffalo meat has been increasing consistently and the poor domestic demand has further fuelled its export. But, the export of mutton {{does not seem to}} have much prospects in the short-run, as even the domestic demand is not being met by domestic production. In milk and milk products, India has some advantage at the farm level, but is not competitive in export of milk and milk products under the prevailing world market situation. The domestic policy initiatives and increased production and productivity have been identified as the important factors in increasing the export <b>of</b> <b>livestock</b> products.
