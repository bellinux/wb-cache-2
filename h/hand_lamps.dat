60|$|By {{the time}} that we had {{finished}} this most refreshing bath the sun was setting; indeed, {{when we got back to}} the big cave it had already set. The cave itself was full of people gathered round fires--for several more had now been lighted--and eating their evening meal by their lurid light, and by that of various lamps which were set about or hung upon the walls. These lamps were of a rude manufacture of baked earthenware, and of all shapes, some of them graceful enough. The larger ones were formed of big red earthenware pots, filled with clarified melted fat, and having a reed wick stuck through a wooden disk which filled the top of the pot. This sort of lamp required the most constant attention to prevent its going out whenever the wick burnt down, as there were no means of turning it up. The smaller <b>hand</b> <b>lamps,</b> however, which were also made of baked clay, were fitted with wicks manufactured from the pith of a palm-tree, or sometimes from the stem of a very handsome variety of fern. This kind of wick was passed through a round hole at the end of the lamp, to which a sharp piece of hard wood was attached wherewith to pierce and draw it up whenever it showed signs of burning low.|$|E

50|$|In 1906, the {{tungsten}} filament was introduced {{and used to}} produce 200 to 3,000 candlepower dive lights. The Siebe Gorman & Company introduced a 250-watt mercury vapor hand lamp in 1919 that could produce as much as 18,000 candles. For diving in turbid water, 45-watt Sodium <b>hand</b> <b>lamps</b> became the preferred choice. These early lights had to be turned on underwater to avoid cracking the heated glass as it entered cold water.|$|E

50|$|The {{freight train}} passed the {{entrance}} signal as normal, then {{pulled into the}} station, expecting the dispatcher's instructions. Although not strictly necessary according to the rules, the dispatcher declared that he showed a red <b>hand</b> <b>lamp</b> to the approaching freight train to make absolutely sure it would stop (according to the rules, the 'stop' board was enough to halt the train). It is unclear what happened next, but the train failed to stop as it was meant to, and departed toward Wuppertal. The driver later claimed that the train dispatcher had signalled him with a green light using his <b>hand</b> <b>lamp,</b> the signal to pass the 'stop' board. The train trailed the points already set for the passenger train, as the points' seal, which ruptures in such an event, was later found to be missing. About 800 m north of the station, on a curve, both trains collided. The motor coach of the two-car special train was compacted to one third of its length and pushed backwards 100 m by the freight train locomotive, which was five times as heavy and 20 cm higher than the railbus.|$|R

50|$|Dahlerau {{station was}} {{equipped}} with entrance signals, which could show aspects Hp 0 (stop) or Hp 1 (proceed); but it lacked exit signals to control departing trains. In place of exit signals, 'stop' boards were provided {{at the end of}} the platform. In absence of any other signal, all trains were obliged to stop at the board to await instructions; the dispatcher, however, could show a green <b>hand</b> <b>lamp</b> to an approaching train, which allowed its crew to ignore the stop board. This is what would normally have happened to the freight train.|$|R

60|$|The {{dead man}} {{lay on his}} back, {{sprawling}} with outstretched limbs in {{the centre of the}} room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which covered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet. The doctor knelt beside him and held down the <b>hand</b> <b>lamp</b> which had stood on the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly injured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a {{foot in front of the}} triggers. It was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had been wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive.|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of synathropic rodents {{may be difficult}} since they are animals with nocturnal activity. Methods of their detection and monitoring rely mostly on indirect signs of their activity such {{as the presence of}} faeces, urine, consumed foods and damaged materials. Our experimental hypothesis was that the production of fluorescent faeces - following consumption of fluorescent bait - may be used for rodent monitoring. For this purpose we studied the production of fluorescent faeces, temporal dynamics and detectability in wild black rat (Rattus rattus). Wild black rats were individually housed in experimental cages with the wire-mesh grid floor and faeces were collected in short-time intervals. The peak of fluorescent activity in faeces was detected 10 - 20 hours after bait ingestion. We found that there is only relatively short delay between bait consumption and defecation and fluorescent faeces are easily detectable at distance using an ultraviolet <b>hand</b> <b>lamp.</b> Thus, this method can contribute to effective monitoring of rodent pests...|$|R
40|$|This NebGuide {{contains}} {{hand signals}} useful for communicating around noisy equipment {{and from a}} distance. Throughout history, man has devised methods of contacting others who were out of voice range or {{who could not be}} heard because of excess noise. The Indians were skilled at using smoke signals or by imitating some form of wildlife such as the owl or coyote. The early explorers used other signs to guide them. The slashing of bark on trees or sticks pointed in a certain direction were keys for keeping the persons from getting lost or for others to follow. The railroad used a system of lantern signals to make contact between the trainman and the engineer. The Navy used semaphore or a system of flags to communicate between ships at sea. In fact, the Jolly Roger was really a signal to other ships that they were in for trouble. Think of some of the devices used for signaling. They include alarm, beacon, bell, buzzer, fire, flag, gong, gun, <b>hand,</b> <b>lamp,</b> lantern, light, mast, post, rocket, shot, siren, whistle, and others...|$|R
50|$|A coal train {{preceding}} the Flying Scotsman {{on the main}} East Coast up (south-bound) line was normally scheduled to be shunted into a siding at Abbots Ripton to allow the much faster Flying Scotsman to pass. Because of a very bad snowstorm, both the coal train and the Flying Scotsman were running late and the signalman at Holme, the next station north of Abbots Ripton, judged that the coal train needed to go into sidings at Holme {{if it was not}} to delay the Flying Scotsman. He therefore set his signal levers to danger so as to stop the coal train, but it continued on the main line until it reached Abbots Ripton, where as expected the signalman waved it on to his box with a <b>hand</b> <b>lamp,</b> and directed it to shunt. The goods train had nearly completed shunting into the Abbots Ripton siding when the Scotch express ran into it at speed. The wreckage obstructed the down (northbound) line and a second collision occurred some minutes later when a northbound express to Leeds crashed into the wreckage. Thirteen passengers died in the collisions, and 53 passengers and 6 traincrew members were injured.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{investigation}} of the electric and photometric characteristics of energy efficient lamps. These lamps consume less active power and produce higher luminous power as compared with the traditional incandescent ones. However, a lot of those lamps operate at relatively low power factor, demanding additional reactive power from the utility system. On the other <b>hand</b> those <b>lamps</b> introduce significant harmonic distortion to the distribution system. In this paper measurements of the above characteristics on many types of energy saving lamps are presented...|$|R
40|$|Here chemosensor {{materials}} of trinuclear copper(I) pyrazolate complexes {{have been successfully}} synthesized and isolated using two types of 3, 5 -dimethyl and 4 -(3, 5 -dimethoxybenzyl) - 3, 5 -dimethyl pyrazole ligands. Upon excitation at 280 nm, the resulting trinuclear 3, 5 -dimethyl copper(I) pyrazolate complex (complex A) and trinuclear 4 -(3, 5 -dimethoxybenzyl) copper(I) pyrazolate complex (complex B) showed emission bands centered at 590 and 604 nm, respectively. These results were in good agreement with their greenish-white powders and it is characteristic of phosphorescent metal complexes from the weak Cu(I) -Cu(I) metallophilic interaction. Upon direct or stepwise exposure to ethanol vapor with series of concentrations (12. 5, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 μL in 22 mg of chemosensor), the emission of chemosensor complex A was not shifted even after 1 d. Interestingly, chemosensor complex B showed gradually changes in both emission band with shifting from 602 to 552 nm and color with changing from orange to green under Ultra-violet (UV) <b>hand</b> <b>lamp</b> (254 nm) at the dark room due to the attachment of benzyl ring to the pyrazole ligand. This positive response for chemosensor complex B was reversible; hence, this optical phosphorescent material {{can be used for}} developing vapochromic sensors of ethanol...|$|R
50|$|The Rother Valley Railway {{opened a}} small {{platform}} at Junction Road in 1900 as an informal private stopping {{place for the}} benefit of the tenant of the adjoining fields who enjoyed shooting rights over the land. The station was situated on the eastern side of a level crossing adjacent to Udiam Farm on the turnpike road from Hawkhurst to Hastings called Junction Road (now part of the B2244 road). The crossing was originally gated but cattle grids were later provided. The existence of the platform was discovered by the Board of Trade in January 1903 during an inspection of the line by Major Pringle who had stopped at the site to examine the new cattle grids. After the inspection, Colonel Stephens, the proprietor of the Rother Valley Railway, wrote to the Board of Trade to obtain permission to open the halt to the public. The station would be unstaffed and trains would only call as required. The Board of Trade indicated its willingness to authorise the halt so long as the railway provided suitable lights for trains calling in the hours of darkness. Despite Stephens' reply that guards would be instructed to aid passengers with a <b>hand</b> <b>lamp,</b> the Board of Trade still insisted on lights.|$|R
