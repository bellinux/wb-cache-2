50|$|Several Latin American nations {{formed the}} Contadora Group {{to work for}} a {{resolution}} to the region's wars. Later, Costa Rican President Óscar Arias succeeded in convincing the other Central American leaders to sign the <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement,</b> which eventually provided the framework for ending the civil wars.|$|R
50|$|His {{appointment}} as Secretary General of the Central America Integration System (SICA) was announced on June 29, 2017, during the 49th gathering in San Jose, Costa Rica.

50|$|During the central-American wars {{taking place}} in {{neighboring}} El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua; both Costa Rica and Mexico led mediation dialogues between waring factions in each nation {{in order to bring}} peace and stability to the region. Mexico (along with Colombia, Panama and Venezuela) created the Contadora Group which helped create the framework for the <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement,</b> led by Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias.|$|R
50|$|While the Contadora group {{ultimately}} {{failed to}} establish a credible peace formula {{with the backing of}} all regional governments, it did lay the foundations for such a plan to emerge in subsequent years. Under the leadership of Costa Rican president Óscar Arias, the so-called <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> emerged from the remains of Contadora in 1986 and led to a fundamental reshaping of Central American politics.|$|R
50|$|While {{still at}} UCR, Solís joined the National Liberation Party (PLN for its Spanish initials) in 1977. Solís was {{an adviser to}} Óscar Arias in the Foreign Ministry, working on the <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> for which Arias would later win a Nobel Peace Prize. Solís served as Director of International Relations for the PLN. During José María Figueres Olsen's time in office, Solís was {{ambassador}} of Central American Affairs.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> was an {{initiative}} {{in the mid-1980s}} to settle the military conflicts that had plagued Central America for many years, {{and in some cases}} (notably Guatemala) for decades. It built upon groundwork laid by the Contadora Group from 1983 to 1985. The agreement was named for Esquipulas, Guatemala, where the initial meetings took place. The US Congress lobbying efforts were helped by one of Capitol Hill's top lobbyists, William C. Chasey.|$|R
5000|$|Resolution 637 went on {{to express}} its support for the <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> and the Joint Declarations, calling upon the Presidents to {{continue}} their efforts to achieve a firm and lasting peace in Central America. It also appealed to countries with links and interests to the region to support the efforts, including those which support irregular forces and insurrectional movements in the area immediately halt the aid, {{with the exception of}} humanitarian aid.|$|R
50|$|The third film in {{the series}} focuses {{on the story of}} the little-known ex-President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias Sanchez. Centering on frank and {{illuminating}} conversations with Arias himself, his daughter, brother, former colleagues and critics, the film reveals how Arias gained immense popularity in his home country after bringing peace to Central America through the <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> and then squandered his success by running as President for a second term from 2006 to 2010.|$|R
50|$|The 1969 Football War between Honduras and El Salvador, {{two members}} of the CACM, {{effectively}} suspended attempts at regional integration until 1987, when the <b>Esquipulas</b> II <b>agreement</b> was signed. By 1970 the industrial sector was undergoing little additional import substitution, and the collapse of the CACM meant that Nicaragua's economic growth, which had come from the expanding manufacturing sector, halted. Furthermore, the manufacturing firms that had developed under the tariff protection of the CACM were generally high-cost and inefficient; consequently, they were at a disadvantage when exporting outside the region.|$|R
5000|$|He has {{received}} numerous {{national and international}} awards, including an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (LH.D) from National University (California) for his lobbying efforts for the Central American Peace Plan, <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement,</b> on behalf of Nobel Peace Laureate, President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, author of the plan. [...] Chasey and his wife Virginia, founded the Third World Prosthetic Foundation. They were honored by President Cristiani of El Salvador for their {{work on behalf of}} the war-torn country's amputee population of soldiers and children. They provided over 1,000 prosthetic devices to land mine victims.|$|R
5000|$|The United Nations Security Council {{formally}} created ONUCA ("United Nations Observer Group in Central America") when it approved Resolution 644 on 7 November 1989. The 625-person group, {{located in}} 33 regional bases, {{was responsible for}} halting cross-border infiltration and cutting support for rebels in the Central American region, and consisted of 260 unarmed military observers along with supporting technicians. Hemisphere countries involved in ONUCA included Spain, Sweden, Ireland, India, Venezuela, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Colombia.ONUCA's initial mandate, composition and operational concept reflected the UN reluctance {{to get involved in}} internal conflicts. It was to be a verification and peace-observing mission, not a full-scale peacekeeping interposition mission, and certainly not peace-enforcement, although as events unfolded there were brief periods when Contra reluctance to disband threatened to convert ONUCA's role to one of enforcement. The scope of the operation was briefly moved up the conflict resolution spectrum for the period of Contra demobilization, but the UN consistently defined ONUCA's mission as a verification one. This limited definition of ONUCA's role was also a reflection of the Latin American resistance to peacekeeping, and their preference for smaller observation missions with the lowest possible military profile. The Canadians, who were used to larger peacekeeping missions, frequently called ONUCA a [...] "minimalist" [...] operation, noting that it would have difficulty verifying the <b>Esquipulas</b> <b>Agreement</b> in the large geographic area assigned to it.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{emergency}} measures were taken before 1982. In December 1979 special courts called [...] "Tribunales Especiales" [...] were established {{to speed up}} the processing of 7,000-8,000 National Guard prisoners. These courts operated through relaxed rules of evidence and due process and were often staffed by law students and inexperienced lawyers. However, the decisions of the [...] "Tribunales Especiales" [...] were subject to appeal in regular courts. Many of the National Guard prisoners were released immediately due to lack of evidence. Others were pardoned or released by decree. By 1986 only 2,157 remained in custody and only 39 were still being held in 1989 when they were released under the <b>Esquipulas</b> II <b>agreement.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Duarte's {{tax reform}} plans, bitterly opposed by ARENA, were judged unconstitutional. In August, {{he participated in}} the {{historic}} <b>Esquipulas</b> II <b>agreement</b> with other leaders {{to lay the groundwork}} for a firm and lasting peace in Central America, outlining the demobilization of the guerrilla groups in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. On October 5, 1987, dialogue with the FMLN began again in which it was the Third dialogue, and on October 28, Congress passed an amnesty law, just two days after Herbert Anaya, the president of the special United Nations Human Rights Commission for El Salvador, was assassinated. Anaya's assassination was interpreted by some as a sign of disapproval of the peace process.|$|R
50|$|Parlacen {{was born}} as a {{parliamentary}} body emulating the Federal Republic of Central America, with Costa Rica an observer. It {{evolved from the}} Contadora Group, a project launched during the 1980s to deal with civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Although the Contadora Group was dissolved in 1986, the concept of Central American integration is implicitly referenced in several countries' constitutions. The <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> (among other acts) agreed {{to the creation of}} a Central American Parliament composed of 20-22 directly-elected deputies from each country. Costa Rica has not ratified the agreement, and is not represented in the Parlacen. Parlacen is seen by some (including former President of Honduras Ricardo Maduro) as a white elephant.|$|R

50|$|In 1987, then President Óscar Arias {{authored}} {{a regional}} plan {{that served as}} the basis for the <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> and Arias was awarded the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his work. Arias also promoted change in the USSR-backed Nicaraguan government of the era. Costa Rica also hosted several rounds of negotiations between the Salvadoran Government and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), aiding El Salvador's efforts to emerge from civil war and culminating in that country's 1994 free and fair elections. Costa Rica has been a strong proponent of regional arms-limitation agreements. Former President Miguel Ángel Rodríguez recently proposed the abolition of all Central American militaries and the creation of a regional counternarcotics police force in their stead.|$|R
5000|$|Esquipulas II: Internet searches, {{even further}} {{scholarly}} research reveal little. Nonetheless, Envio (1989) reports that following {{the presentation of}} the report {{on the eve of the}} fourth meeting of Central American presidents, the European Economic Community (EEC) responded positively with satisfaction for the peace process undertaken. The summit resulted in the Esquipulas II framework for regional development, peace and cooperation. The report claims that the “Stanford Commission Report, the presidential summit and the EEC meeting have opened a new space in Central American politics” (Envio 1989). While the <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> isolates the United States, the EEC continued with its support in Central America by increasing foreign aid with the dismantling and resettling of Honduras’ contra troops in February 1989, showing progress for regional diplomacy.|$|R
50|$|Arias {{had been}} seen as the front runner {{throughout}} the campaign. Arias served as President of Costa Rica from 1986 to 1990. He is best known worldwide {{for his role in}} the signing of the <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> which is regarded as the crucial plan which led to the eventual end to the series of civil wars that took place throughout Central America, most notably in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala, during the 1980s. For his role he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987. With the monetary portion of the award he started the Arias Foundation for Peace and Human Progress, an advocacy group for demilitarization, women's rights and conflict resolution through dialogue. Through this group Arias helped to settle conflicts throughout Latin America, participating in the process to demilitarize Haiti and Panama.|$|R

50|$|The PARLACEN origins {{date back}} to the Contadora Group, a project of the 1980s that sought to help resolve the civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Although the Contadora group was disbanded in 1986, the idea of a greater Central American {{integration}} remained, giving rise to the <b>Esquipulas</b> II <b>Agreement,</b> which among other things, created the Central American Parliament.The Treaty establishing the Central American Parliament and other political bodies was signed in 1987; its first formal session was carried out on 28 October 1991 in Guatemala City.The PARLACEN as a political body in the region is part of the Central American Integration System SICA, established by the Protocol of Tegucigalpa to the Charter of the Organization of American States (ODECA) signed on 13 December 1991. SICA has the fundamental aim to realize an integration that is political and ideological representative in a pluralistic democratic system that guarantees free elections and participation under equal conditions for political parties.|$|R
5|$|Up to 1990, Nicaragua {{had lived}} with forty years of the Somoza dictatorship, through a decade of civil warfare and Sandinista rule, and five years of US imposed {{economic}} sanctions. On 25 February 1990, Chamorro won the election with a 54.7% share of the vote, ousting the incumbent Ortega and becoming the first elected woman president in the Americas. Because the election {{was held in the}} midst of a civil war, it was important both domestically and internationally that the vote was seen to be legitimate. The <b>Esquipulas</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> which had been brokered by Arias, called for monitoring of elections by the Organization of American States and the United Nations, among other provisions. The election was the most strictly monitored of any in Latin America and involved 2,578 international observers among them former US President Jimmy Carter; Raul Alfonsín, former President of Argentina; Alfonso López Michelsen, former President of Colombia; Rodrigo Carazo Odio, former President of Costa Rica and many Caribbean and US dignitaries. Ortega and his supporters conceded defeat without argument and observers left only a skeleton staff to assist with the transition of power.|$|R
