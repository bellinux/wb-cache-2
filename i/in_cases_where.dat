40|$|We are {{concerned}} with the classification of positive radial solutions for the system Δ u=v^p, Δ v=f(|∇ u|), where p> 0 and f∈ C^ 1 [0,∞) is a nondecreasing function such that f(t) > 0 for all t> 0.

Similar optimal conditions are derived <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> the system is posed in a ball of R^N.
