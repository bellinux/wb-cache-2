5|$|Meanwhile, the {{investigation}} has found traces of this {{drug in the}} other victims, with Black believing that the killer not only has access to it through his occupation but is likely consuming it himself while committing his crimes in order to readily act on his sexual fantasies. Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>working</b> at the time, but Black realizes he must be the killer. He interviews Nesbitt's wife (Barbara Howard), finding {{that they have not}} had sex in eighteen years of marriage—however, Nesbitt has recently become interested in trying again.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Phil calls Sal, wanting Louise's (now {{played by}} Tilly Keeper) address, {{and when he}} goes to her house, Peggy is there, having {{returned}} a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>working</b> and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try and make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.|$|E

5|$|The {{students}} learn {{during their first}} day of classes that academics are weighed equally with performance. Doris, overwhelmed by the energy and spontaneity in the lunchroom, flees and meets Montgomery. As the year progresses, Coco tries to convince Bruno to book performing gigs with her. Doris befriends Montgomery, but worries that she is too ordinary against the colorful personalities of the other students. Leroy and his English teacher, Mrs. Sherwood, clash over his refusal to do homework. It is later revealed that Leroy is illiterate and ashamed to admit it. Bruno and his father argue over Bruno's reluctance to play his electronic music publicly. Miss Berg, the school's Dance teacher, warns Lisa that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>working</b> hard enough. Michael, a graduating senior, wins a prestigious scholarship and tells Doris that the William Morris Agency wants to send him out for auditions for television pilots.|$|E
5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>working</b> at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E
5|$|Paul meets an old friend, Kim Taylor (Jenny Young), and learns he is {{the father}} of her sons David (Takaya Honda) and Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Paul and Kim manage to stop Amy and Leo from consummating their relationship. David bonds with Paul soon after, {{although}} Leo stays away from him due to their business rivalry, but eventually comes to accept Paul as his father. Paul tries to pursue a relationship with Terese, but she rejects him and later gets engaged to Gary. After receiving compensation from the Quill group, Paul buys and moves back into the Lassiter's Penthouse, with Amy and Jimmy. Terese confides in Paul that she has breast cancer, and he does his best to support her. However, once it is obvious that her chemotherapy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>working,</b> Terese visits her brother Nick in prison, who is later granted bail with the help of Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine), much to Paul's chagrin. Paul soon learns that Amy and Nick are dating. In addition, Paul and Leo are bought out of Robinsons after Amy encourages Steph to help Nick set up a wellness centre in the premises. Paul and Terese have sex, but she chooses to stay with Gary. After attempting to give Nick money to leave town, Paul frames him by having someone plant stolen medication in Nick's hotel room, resulting in his parole being revoked. Amy is furious to discover that Paul has set Nick up, and when Paul does not confess his crime to the police, she and Jimmy move back into No. 26. After Terese makes it clear that she and Paul will never be in a relationship, and Amy refuses to move back into the penthouse, Paul decides to leave Erinsborough for a few weeks supposedly to visit his family in New York City, but David reveals that Paul never arrived. Paul returns a few weeks later and reveals he is engaged to Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). He also buys Mr Udagawa's (Lawrence Mah) share of Lassiters making him Terese's boss.|$|E

25|$|Trimethylaminuria (TMAU; primary trimethylaminuria), {{also known}} as fish odor {{syndrome}} or fish malodor syndrome, is a rare metabolic disorder that causes a defect in the normal production of an enzyme named flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). When FMO3 <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>working</b> correctly or if not enough enzyme is produced, the body loses the ability to properly convert trimethylamine (TMA) from precursor compounds in food digestion into trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), through a process called N-oxidation. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor or strong body odor. A variant of TMAU (secondary trimethylaminuria or TMAU2) exists {{where there is no}} genetic cause, yet excessive TMA is secreted, possibly due to intestinal dysbiosis, altered metabolism, or hormonal causes.|$|E
25|$|Zheng's game is characterised by consistency, intellect, quick {{reflexes}} {{and fighting}} spirit. She {{is not the}} strongest player, but makes up for this with her careful thinking of where to place her shots and willingness to change game plans if a strategy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>working.</b> Her shots are {{of a lot of}} pace and very well placed, making Zheng an excellent defensive counterpuncher. She has one of the best footwork and court coverage on the tour, which allows her to keep shots in play that would normally be winners; so few shots get by her that after the final match of 2005 Hobart International, the finalist Gisela Dulko described her game as 'The Great Wall of China' because 'she didn't miss one ball'. Also an accomplished doubles player, she is very comfortable when playing at the net. Zheng's best shot is her backhand. Zheng's main weakness is her serve; however she is sometimes able to neutralize her weak serve with her quickness or by serving to the body or to the opponent's weaker groundstroke.|$|E
