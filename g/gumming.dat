500|$|Despite the {{limitations}} of the knee brace, Goebel led the Wolverines to victory in the first game played at Ohio Stadium. The official [...] "Dedication Day" [...] for the stadium was October 21, 1922, and the opponent was Michigan. Ohio State fans recalled for years afterward how Goebel and his teammate Harry Kipke managed to turn Dedication Day sour for the Buckeyes. Michigan shut out the Buckeyes, 19–0, with Goebel and Kipke scoring all the points. In the first period, Goebel blocked a punt and then kicked a long field goal from the 30-yard line for the game's first points. He also penetrated into the Ohio State backfield in the second quarter to recover a fumble. As the game wore on, the Buckeyes [...] "seemed to realize (Goebel's) importance in the Michigan lineup because he was forced to take plenty of punishment." [...] Football writer Billy Evans described Goebel's performance against Ohio State this way: [...] "No end in recent years has played a greater game (than) that which Goebel put up against Ohio State. For three periods Goebel was the mainspring of the Michigan eleven. He seemed to be in every play. It was always Goebel who was <b>gumming</b> things up for State. No man could go through an entire game at the speed with which Goebel played in the first three quarters. It was beyond the power of any human being. With a few minutes to play in the third period the big fellow practically collapsed. Even when three or four of his teammates were carrying him off the field the old spirit was still there. He tried to induce his teammates {{that he was able to}} play, and tried to break away from their grasp, but the punch was gone and he was forced to give way as the big crowd cheered him to the echo. If any one man made possible the defeat of State by Michigan, it was Captain Paul Goebel." ...|$|E

In this study, rheological and interfacial properties of almond <b>gum</b> and <b>gum</b> arabic aqueous dispersions were comparatively investigated. The interfacial tension of almond <b>gum</b> and <b>gum</b> arabic aqueous dispersions was measured using the pendant drop method in hexadecane. The asymptotic interfacial tension values for almond <b>gum</b> were significantly lower than the corresponding values measured for <b>gum</b> arabic, especially at high concentration. Rheological properties were characterized by steady and oscillatory tests using a coaxial geometry. Almond <b>gum</b> flow curves exhibited a shear thinning non-Newtonian behavior with a tendency to a Newtonian plateau at low shear rate, while <b>gum</b> arabic flow curves exhibited such behavior only at high shear rate. The influence of temperature (5 - 50 [*][*]℃) on the flow curves was studied at 4 % (m/m) <b>gum</b> concentration and the Newtonian viscosities at infinite and at zero shear rate, for <b>gum</b> arabic and almond <b>gum,</b> respectively, were accurately fitted by an Arrhenius-type equation. The dynamic properties of the two <b>gum</b> dispersions were also studied. Both <b>gum</b> dispersions exhibited viscoelastic properties, with the viscous component being predominant in a wider range of concentrations for almond <b>gum,</b> while for <b>gum</b> arabic the elastic component being higher than the elastic one especially at higher concentrations.
