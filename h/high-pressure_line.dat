50|$|FAC was {{the cause}} of several {{high-profile}} accidents in power plants, for example, a rupture of a <b>high-pressure</b> condensate <b>line</b> in Virginia Power's Surry nuclear plant in 1986, that resulted in four fatalities and four injuries.|$|R
5000|$|The systems use an {{individual}} injection pump {{mounted on the}} engine block for each cylinder so it is primarily designed for OHV or [...] "cam in the block" [...] engines. The fuel pumps are driven by an extra camshaft lobe where each pump unit {{is connected to the}} injector via a short precise length <b>high-pressure</b> fuel <b>line</b> as opposed to Unit Injector systems which combines both a pump and an injector element in a compact unit.|$|R
2500|$|In the United States, Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 50, Appendix A, General Design Criteria (GDC 54-57) or {{some other}} design basis {{provides}} the basic design criteria for isolation of lines penetrating the containment wall. Each large pipe penetrating the containment, such as the steam lines, has isolation valves on it, configured as allowed by Appendix A; generally two valves. [...] For smaller lines, one {{on the inside and}} one on the outside. For large, <b>high-pressure</b> <b>lines,</b> space for relief valves and maintenance considerations cause the designers to install the isolation valves near to where the lines exit containment. In the event of a leak in the high-pressure piping that carries the reactor coolant, these valves rapidly close to prevent radioactivity from escaping the containment. Valves on lines for standby systems penetrating containment are normally closed. [...] The containment isolation valves may also close on a variety of other signals such as the containment high pressure experienced during a high-energy line break (e.g. main steam or feedwater lines). [...] The containment building serves to contain the steam/resultant pressure, but there is typically no radiological consequences associated with such a break at a pressurized water reactor.|$|R
50|$|Many CPB {{circuits}} now {{employ a}} centrifugal pump {{for the maintenance}} and control of blood flow during CPB. By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by centrifugal force. This type of pumping action {{is considered to be}} superior to the action of the roller pump by many because it is thought to produce less blood damage (hemolysis, etc.), but mostly due to the centrifugal pump being pressure limited, therefore less likely to rupture the system if a sudden occlusion occurs on the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>line</b> system.|$|E

The 9 missile silos {{controlled by the}} 570th Strategic Missile Squadron remained on alert for over 20 years during the Cold War. On 8 August 1965, at launch site 373-4, 53 contractor workers died in a flash fire while installing modifications to the launch silo.

30|$|On {{transmission}} networks, cleaning {{was mostly}} restricted to substation facilities. A special hot-stick (insulated pole) was developed with a {{compressed air line}} attached for live (energised) cleaning. A hot-stick with a <b>high-pressure</b> water <b>line</b> was also developed, but due to the uncertain conductivity of tephra at the time, this was only used when the system was de-energised. When facilities were de-energised, tephra could also be wiped off surfaces with a cloth where practical. There was some benefit from rain cleaning accumulated tephra, but it was unclear to what extent.|$|R
50|$|In 9 August 1965, a {{fire and}} {{resultant}} loss of oxygen when a <b>high-pressure</b> hydraulic <b>line</b> was cut with an oxyacetylene torch in a missile silo (373-4) near Searcy, Arkansas, killed 53 people, mostly civilian repairmen doing maintenance. The fire occurred while the 750-ton silo lid was closed, which contributed to a reduced oxygen level for the men who survived the initial fire. Two men escaped alive, both with injuries due to the fire and smoke, one by groping in complete darkness for the exit. The missile survived and was undamaged.|$|R
50|$|In lieu of the CCTV system, docking {{distances}} were {{relayed to}} the bridge by portable radio. Berthing was complete within 5 minutes of the original fire alarm and fresh water was taken on board to replenish the Hi-fog fire suppression system whilst all 551 passengers were safely off-loaded. The fire brigade attended and the Hi-fog water mist was deactivated at their request. A nine-month Marine Accident Investigation Branch investigation found the fault to be incorrect fitting of a compression fitting used for a <b>high-pressure</b> fuel <b>line</b> leading to fuel spraying and igniting upon contact with the hot turbo-charger unit.|$|R
50|$|A sewer jetter is {{composed}} of a controlled high-pressure water source such as a pressure washer or reciprocating displacement pump, a flexible <b>high-pressure</b> <b>line</b> (called a jetter hose which connects the high-pressure engine to the mini-reel) of up to hundreds of metres (several hundred feet) in length, the Mini-Reel (a hose reel which can be taken {{a distance from the}} engine) and a nozzle that uses hydraulic force to pull the line into sewer drains, clean the sides of pipes, and flush out residue. High-pressure sewer jetters can be mounted on trolleys, inside vans or on trailers. The power of a Sewer Jetter ranges from 1000 psi up to 5000 psi. Sewer jetter nozzles come in different sizes and applications; a bullet-type nozzle with a streamlined profile can clear a hole for the larger root cutting nozzle. Root-cutter nozzles are designed to cut roots with a spinning nozzle that shoots a jet stream horizontally inside the pipe. 5000 psi sewer jetters with root-cutting nozzles can clear a hole through the center of a root-infested sewer line and with its rear-facing jet streams cut the roots and clean the pipe walls, flushing the root debris through the sewer line. The sewer jetter has been labeled as a technological advancement of the plumber's snake (also known as an electric eel) drain clearing method.|$|E

40|$|Decompressing a <b>high-pressure</b> {{transmission}} <b>line</b> gas to low-pressure distribution requirements is conventionally done via {{a governor}} {{through which the}} mechanical energy contained in the gas under pressure is dissipated as friction. The gas must be preheated to avoid low temperatures following the expansion. By expanding the gas through a turbine, however, operators can recover the mechanical energy of the gas to generate electricity, although this process calls for more thermal energy at the preheating stage. Case studies show, though, that the overall energy balance is positive by a margin wide enough to provide power to run the plant and produce a lot of electrical energy. ...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{pressure}} release valve is described: {{it can be made}} locally by the chromatographer and installed in the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>line</b> of a liquid chromatography system to avert accidental overpressure. The device consists mainly of a single-ferrule union fitting with a replaceable aluminum diaphragm designed to release the pressure at a preselected level, e. g., at 3000 psi.

40|$|A micro Joule-Thomson cold {{stage was}} designed, built and tested, {{as part of}} the micro cooling {{research}} project at the University of Twente. The cold stage consists of a stack of three glass wafers. In the top wafer, the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>line</b> is etched as a rectangular channel with supporting pillars. The <b>high-pressure</b> <b>line</b> ends in a flow restriction and an evaporator volume that crosses the center wafer into the bottom wafer. The bottom wafer contains the low-pressure line, again etched as a rectangular channel containing supporting pillars, thus forming a counter-flow heat exchanger. A design aimed at a net cooling power of 10 mW at 96 K and operating with nitrogen as the working fluid was optimized based on the minimization of entropy production. The optimum cold finger measures 28 mm x 2. 2 mm x 0. 8 mm (max. dimensions). It should be able to generate a net cooling power of 10 mW at 96 K at a nitrogen flow of 1 mg/s at a high pressure of 80 bar and a low pressure of 6 bar. A batch of 14 prototype coolers were made for 8 different designs, including a design of the theoretical optimum. Liquid nitrogen is collected in the evaporator, and since the low pressure is 6 bar, the temperature should be 96 K. However, due to some thermal resistance in the thermocouple attached to the cold tip, a temperature of 105 K was achieved. A net cooling power of 5 mW was measured. In the paper, the design of the coolers will be discussed along with experimental results...|$|E
50|$|Unit direct {{injection}} also injects fuel {{directly into the}} cylinder of the engine. In this system the injector and the pump are combined into one unit positioned over each cylinder controlled by the camshaft. Each cylinder has its own unit eliminating the <b>high-pressure</b> fuel <b>lines,</b> achieving a more consistent injection. This type of injection system, also developed by Bosch, is used by Volkswagen AG in cars (where it is called a Pumpe-Düse-System—literally pump-nozzle system) and by Mercedes-Benz ("PLD") and most major diesel engine manufacturers in large commercial engines (MAN SE, CAT, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, Electro-Motive Diesel, Volvo). With recent advancements, the pump pressure has been raised to , allowing injection parameters similar to common rail systems.|$|R

5000|$|Along {{with the}} name change, came other major {{improvements}} and tweaks for the final model year of the conventional cab pickups. Single-point electronic throttle-body fuel injection (TBI) was introduced on GM's full-size pickups, with new electric fuel pumps and <b>high-pressure</b> fuel <b>lines.</b> In addition, a [...] "smart" [...] powertrain control module (PCM) was also introduced, which controlled the fuel injection system, fuel-to-air burn ratio, engine ignition timing, and (if equipped with an automatic transmission) the Turbo Hydra-Matic's turbine torque converter clutch.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{computational}} model of industrial-purpose hydraulic drive with two hydraulic volume adjustable working chamber machines (pump and motor). Adjustable pump {{equipped with the}} pressure control unit can be run together with several adjustable hydraulic motors {{on the principle of}} three-phase hydraulic socket-outlet with <b>high-pressure</b> <b>lines,</b> drain, and drainage system. The paper considers the pressure-controlled hydrostatic transmission with hydraulic motor as an output link. It shows a possibility to create a saving hydraulic drive using a functional tie between the adjusting parameters of the pump and hydraulic motor through the pressure difference, torque, and angular rate of the hydraulic motor shaft rotation. The programmable logic controller can implement such tie. The Coulomb and viscous frictions are taken into consideration when developing a computational model of the hydraulic volume displacement drive. Discharge balance considers external and internal leakages in equivalent clearances of hydraulic machines, as well as compression loss volume caused by hydraulic fluid compressibility and deformation of pipe walls. To correct dynamic properties of hydraulic drive, the paper offers that in discharge balance are included the additional regulated external leakages in the open circuit of hydraulic drive and regulated internal leakages in the closed-loop circuit. Generalized differential equations having functional multipliers and multilinked nature have been obtained to describe the operation of hydraulic positioning and speed drive with two hydraulic volume adjustable working chamber machines. It is shown that a proposed computational model of hydraulic drive can be taken into consideration in development of LS («Load-Sensing») drives, in which the pumping pressure is tuned to the value required for the most loaded slave motor to overcome the load. Results attained can be used both in designing the industrial-purpose heavy-duty hydraulic drives with improved adjusting characteristics and in creating the multilink hydraulic drives to work with the centralized powers sources of restricted power...|$|R

25|$|In 2007, marine {{forensic}} investigators {{considered that}} {{an explosion in}} the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility. It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, of one sort or another, in the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the <b>high-pressure</b> steam <b>lines</b> to the turbines.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of fluid resonance in <b>high-pressure</b> hydraulic <b>lines</b> {{has been made}} with two types of fluid dampers (or filters) installed in the line. One type involved the use {{of one or more}} closed-end tubes branching at right angles from a main line, and the other type was a fluid muffler installed in-line. These devices were evaluated in forced vibration tests with oscillatory disturbances over a 1000 -Hz range applied to one end of the line and with oscillatory pressures measured at various stations along the main pipe. Limited applications of acoustic-wave theory to the branched systems are also included. Results show varying attenuations of pressure perturbations, depending on the number and location of branches and the type of muffler. Up to three branches were used in the branch-resonator study, and the largest frequency range with maximum attenuation was obtained for a three-branch configuration. The widest frequency ranges with significant attenuations were obtained with two types of fluid mufflers...|$|R
50|$|Most present-day {{diesel engines}} use a {{mechanical}} single plunger high-pressure fuel pump {{driven by the}} engine crankshaft. For each engine cylinder, the corresponding plunger in the fuel pump measures out the correct amount of fuel and determines the timing of each injection. These engines use injectors that are very precise spring-loaded valves that open and close at a specific fuel pressure. Separate <b>high-pressure</b> fuel <b>lines</b> connect the fuel pump with each cylinder. Fuel volume for each single combustion is controlled by a slanted groove in the plunger which rotates only a few degrees releasing the pressure and is controlled by a mechanical governor, consisting of weights rotating at engine speed constrained by springs and a lever. The injectors are held open by the fuel pressure. On high-speed engines the plunger pumps are together in one unit. The length of fuel lines from the pump to each injector is normally the same for each cylinder {{in order to obtain}} the same pressure delay.|$|R
500|$|Almost {{two years}} later, {{beginning}} on 17March 1986, Iowa underwent her overdue InSurv inspection {{under the supervision}} of Rear Admiral John D. Bulkeley. The ship failed the inspection. Among many other deficiencies, the ship was unable to achieve her top speed of [...] during a full-power engine run. Other problems discovered included hydraulic fluid leaks in all three main gun turrets, totaling [...] per turret per week, Cosmoline (anticorrosion lubricant) which had not been removed from all the guns, deteriorated bilge piping, frequent shorts in the electrical wiring, pump failures, unrepaired soft patches on <b>high-pressure</b> steam <b>lines,</b> and frozen valves in the ship's firefighting system. [...] Bulkeley personally recommended to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral James Watkins, and the Secretary of the Navy, John Lehman, that Iowa be taken out of service immediately.
