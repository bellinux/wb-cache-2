30|$|While {{there exists}} many classes of {{asynchronous}} circuits/systems (Sparsø and Furber 2001; Myers 2001), relative-timing (Stevens et al. 2003) was proposed and suggested to {{be a very}} efficient asynchronous design style which can aggressively optimize area, delay, and power parameters much more than any other asynchronous design method. This was validated through the relative-timed design of an asynchronous <b>instruction</b> length <b>decoder</b> in (Stevens et al. 2003). However, design metric optimizations are achieved by relative-timed designs at the expense of trading off robustness, i.e., by incorporating certain timing assumptions. However, {{it should be noted that}} timing assumptions are implicit in robust asynchronous design methods such as isochronic forks (Martin 1990; Martin and Prakash 2008) in quasi-delay-insensitive designs (Toms 2006; Balasubramanian 2010), which form the weakest compromise to delay-insensitivity (van Berkel 1992), and zero or negligible wire delays in speed-independent designs (Beerel and Meng 1992; Kondratyev et al. 1994; Keller et al. 2009), while timing assumptions are made explicit in the case of relative-timing to optimize the design metrics.|$|R

Extreme parallelization, conditional and speculative execution of operations is essential to meet the processor performance goals.

50|$|One {{barrier to}} {{achieving}} higher performance through instruction-level parallelism stems from pipeline stalls and flushes due to branches. Normally, whether a conditional branch {{will be taken}} isn't known {{until late in the}} pipeline as conditional branches depend on results coming from a register. From the time that the processor's <b>instruction</b> <b>decoder</b> has figured out that it has encountered a conditional branch instruction to the time that the deciding register value can be read out, the pipeline needs to be stalled for several cycles, or if it's not and the branch is taken, the pipeline needs to be flushed. As clock speeds increase the depth of the pipeline increases with it, and some modern processors may have 20 stages or more. On average, every fifth instruction executed is a branch, so without any intervention, that's a high amount of stalling.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1970s memory had become cheap, {{but at the}} cost of lower performance; CPU designs now ran many times faster than the memory they talked to.

Each of these versions of the instructions took up room on the CPU, but did little or nothing to improve performance because they communicated with the slow memory, {{while at the same time}} the memory savings were now unnecessary. During this period the RISC design philosophy flourished. The basic aim was to reduce access to memory as much as possible, using internal high-performance registers for most instructions. As a side-effect, the wide variety of different modes for instructions disappeared; there might be only one [...] instruction instead of many. Removing these instructions reduced the complexity of the <b>instruction</b> <b>decoder</b> and freed up considerable space on the CPU, space that was used to greatly increase the number of registers.|$|E
5000|$|Westinghouse {{explored}} the latter solution {{in a project}} known as Solomon. Since the highest performing computers were being used primarily for math processing in science and engineering, they decided to focus their CPU design on math alone.

The CU was attached to an array of processors built to handle floating point math only, the [...] "processing element"s, or PEs. Since much of the complexity of a CPU is due to the instruction fetching and decoding process, Solomon's PEs ended up being much simpler than the CU, so many of them could be built without driving up the price. Modern microprocessor designs are quite similar to this layout in general terms, with a single <b>instruction</b> <b>decoder</b> feeding a number of subunits dedicated to processing certain types of data.
