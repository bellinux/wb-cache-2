40|$|A <b>goodness-of-fit</b> <b>test</b> for {{exchangeable}} Archimedean copulas is presented. In {{a large-scale}} simulation study it is {{shown that the}} test performs well according to the error probability of the first kind and the power under several alternatives, especially in large dimensions. The proposed test is compared to other known tests for Archimedean copulas. In contrast to the latter, the former is simple and easy to apply in any dimension. Commonly applied goodness-of-fit tests are numerically demanding according to precision and runtime, especially as the dimension increases, which is also investigated in this work. The presented <b>goodness-of-fit</b> <b>test</b> {{is based on a}} transformation originally intended for sampling random variates from exchangeable Archimedean copulas and its correctness is proven.

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance of <b>goodness-of-fit</b> <b>testing</b> to detect relevant violations of the assumptions underlying the criticized "standard" two-class latent class model. Often used to obtain sensitivity and specificity estimates for diagnostic tests in the absence of a gold reference standard, this model relies on assuming that diagnostic test errors are independent. When this assumption is violated, accuracy estimates may be biased: <b>goodness-of-fit</b> <b>testing</b> is often used to evaluate the assumption and prevent bias. Study Design and Setting We investigate the performance of <b>goodness-of-fit</b> <b>testing</b> by Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation scenarios are based on three empirical examples. Results <b>Goodness-of-fit</b> <b>tests</b> lack power to detect relevant misfit of the standard two-class latent class model at sample sizes that are typically found in empirical diagnostic studies. The <b>goodness-of-fit</b> <b>tests</b> that are based on asymptotic theory are not robust to the sparseness of data. A parametric bootstrap procedure improves the evaluation of goodness of fit in the case of sparse data. Conclusion Our simulation study suggests that relevant violation of the local independence assumption underlying the standard two-class latent class model may remain undetected in empirical diagnostic studies, potentially leading to biased estimates of sensitivity and specificity...|$|R

40|$|A {{central limit theorem}} for the {{integrated}} squared error of the directional-linear kernel density estimator is established. The result enables the construction and analysis of two testing procedures based on squared loss: a nonparametric independence test for directional and linear random variables and a <b>goodness-of-fit</b> <b>test</b> for parametric families of directional-linear densities. Limit distributions for both test statistics, and a consistent bootstrap strategy for the <b>goodness-of-fit</b> <b>test,</b> are developed for the directional-linear case and adapted to the directional-directional setting.
