40|$|Standardized {{intellectual}} {{assessment is}} a required component of many psycho-educational evaluations based on state guidelines which regulate {{the identification of}} handicapping conditions and subsequent provision of special education services. Although the professional literature is replete with studies related {{to many of the}} traditional intellectual assessment instruments, few have investigated the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale: Fourth Edition with specific diagnostic groups. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate differences in the performance of four groups of children ranging from seven through twelve years-of-age and to determine if the Stanford-Binet: Fourth <b>Edition</b> <b>area</b> and factor scores were useful in differentiating among these populations. These groups included children identified as learning disabled, mentally disabled, behavior disordered, and non-handicapped. Two analyses of variance were conducted to determine mean differences on (a) factor scores computed according to Sattler 2 ̆ 7 s method (Sattler, 1988) and (b) area scores described in the scoring guide (Thorndike, Hagen, 2 ̆ 6 Sattler, 1986). Significant interactions were found for group and area and group and factor, and additional simple effects analyses were completed. Discriminant and classification analyses were utilized to investigate the relationships between area scores and group, and factor scores and group. Findings indicated that both area and factor scores correctly classified individuals at a higher rate than predicted by chance. ...|$|E

40|$|Building peace {{requires}} more than simply bringing an end to armed conflict; it also requires strengthening the rule of law. UNODC and the Department for Peacekeeping Operations have partnered to publish a revised edition of the United Nations Criminal Justice Standards for United Nations Police. The handbook summarizes the international human rights and criminal justice principles that United Nations police personnel must know, abide by and promote when deployed in peacekeeping operations and special political missions. As such, {{it is designed to}} serve a dual purpose. Firstly, it is a code of conduct for police operating under the United Nations flag. Secondly, it is a reference source to help national authorities to improve policing. The first edition of this handbook was published in 1994 in the six official languages of the United Nations and has been used in training courses for the police components of United Nations missions in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique. Among the areas covered in this handbook are the role of police and other law enforcement officials, different types of crimes, investigation, arrest, detention and imprisonment. The handbook also covers trials and extralegal arbitrary and summary execution. This updated <b>edition</b> includes <b>areas</b> not covered in the first edition, such as the issue of the integrity of police and other law enforcement officials, assistance to victims (in particular child victims) and children in conflict with the law.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the validity of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale: Fourth <b>Edition</b> (SB:FE) <b>area</b> and composite scores and Sattler's SB:FE factor scores as predictors of school performance on the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement (WJTA). The subjects were 80 Caucasian third grade students enrolled in regular education in a rural and small town school district in northeastern Indiana. The SB:FE and WJTA were administered to all students. Two canonical analyses were conducted to test the overall relationships between sets of SB:FE predictor variables and the set of WJTA criterion variables. Results indicated that the SB:FE area scores and Sattler's SB:FE factor scores were valid predictors of academic achievement at a general level. To clarify the results of the canonical analyses, series of multiple regression analyses were conducted. Results of multiple regression with SB:FE area and composite scores indicated that the best single predictor of all WJTA scores was the SB:FE Test Composite Score. No other SB:FE variable provided a significant contribution to the regression equation for reading, math, and written language achievement over that offered by the Test Composite Score. Multiple regression analyses were also employed with Sattler's SB:FE factor scores and the WJTA scores. The optimal predictor composite for reading included the Verbal Comprehension and Memory factor scores. To predict math, the best predictor composite consisted of the Nonverbal Reasoning/Visualization and Verbal Comprehension factor scores. The optimal predictor composite for written language included the Nonverbal Reasoning/Visualization and Memory factor scores. Results of the regression analyses indicated that, without exception, the predictor composites composed of the SB:FE area and composite scores were superior in their prediction of school performance to the predictor composites developed from Sattler's SB:FE factor scores. The regression equation containing the SB:FE Test Composite Score alone was determined to be the preferred approach for predicting WJTA scores. Use of the Test Composite Score sacrifices only a minimal degree of accuracy in the prediction of achievement and requires no additional effort to compute.

40|$|Whether {{you like}} a certain {{geophysical}} book or not, largely depends on your background. The field of radiative transfer and atmospheric radiation, in particular, combines people {{with a wide range}} of mathematical skills: from theoretical astrophysicists and nuclear physicists to meteorologists and ecologists. There is always a delicate balance between physical explanations and their mathematical interpretations. This balance is very personal and is based on your background. I came to the field of atmospheric radiative transfer as a mathematician with little knowledge of atmospheric physics. After being in the field for more than a decade, I still have gaps in my atmospheric science education. Thus I assess a radiative transfer book fi-om two main criteria: how well does it describe the material that is familiar to me (the radiative transfer equation and its numerical solutions) and how well does it help me to fill the gaps in my personal knowledge. So I present this review fi-om the perspective of a former mathematician working in the field of atmospheric radiation.. After being asked to review the book, my first intention was to compare the new edition with the previous one (Liou, 1980). In doing so, you can clearly follow the progress made in the field of atmospheric radiation over the past two decades. If there are few changes (as in Fundamental Radiative Transfer) or no changes at all (as in the Maxwell s equations), then the field has not seen much development. To the contrary, many differences between the two <b>editions</b> illustrate <b>areas</b> of major progress in the field, such as evidenced in Thermal Ineared Radiative Transfer and even in the creations of completely new fields like Three-Dimensional Radiative Transfer or Light Scattering by Nonspherical Particles. Obviously, the major changes happened not in the theory, which is at least half a century old, but in data quality and completely new measurements (mostly due to new satellite data) with higher accuracy and more reliability.

40|$|Objective: To review {{research}} articles in psychiatry and psychology involving Latin American populations and/or produced by Latin American scholars {{to investigate the}} differential diagnosis between spiritual/anomalous experiences and mental disorders in order {{to contribute to the}} validity of the International Classification of Diseases towards its 11 (th) <b>edition</b> in this <b>area.</b> Method: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and SciELO) using relevant keywords (possession, trance, religious experience, spiritual experience, latin*, Brazil) for articles with original psychiatric and psychological data on spiritual experiences. We also analyzed the references of the articles found and contacted authors for additional references and data. Results: There is strong evidence that psychotic and anomalous experiences are frequent in the general population and that most of them are not related to psychotic disorders. Often, spiritual experiences involve non-pathological dissociative and psychotic experiences. Although spiritual experiences are not usually related to mental disorders, they may cause transient distress and are commonly reported by psychotic patients. Conclusion: We propose some features that suggest the non-pathological nature of a spiritual experience: lack of suffering, lack of social or functional impairment, compatibility with the patient's cultural background and recognition by others, absence of psychiatric comorbidities, control over the experience, and personal growth over time...|$|R
