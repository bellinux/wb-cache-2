40|$|The {{following}} {{article examines}} the contribution of German feature films about the Third Reich and the Holocaust to memory discourse {{in the wake of}} German unification. A comparison between East and West German films made since the 1990 s reveals some startling asymmetries and polarities. While East German film-makers, if they continued to work in Germany’s reunified film industry at all, made very few films about the Third Reich, West German directors took advantage of the recent memory boom. Whereas films made by East German directors, such as Erster Verlust and Der Fall Ö, suggest, in liberating contradiction to the anti-fascist interpretation of history, that East Germany shared the burden of guilt, West German productions subscribe to the normalisation discourse that has gained ideological hegemony in the East-West-German memory contest since unification. Films such as Aimée & Jaguar and Rosenstraße construct a memory of the past that is no longer encumbered by guilt, principally because the relationship between Germans and Jews is re-imagined as one of solidarity. As post-memory films, they take liberties with the traumatic memory of the past and, by following the generic conventions of melodrama, family saga and <b>European</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>cinema,</b> even lend it popular appeal...|$|R

40|$|What is <b>European</b> <b>cinema?</b> First: <b>European</b> <b>cinema</b> {{does not}} exist, {{except as a}} bureaucratic dream or a promotional tool for {{national}} producers and distributors of art house films. Second: insofar as it is willed into existence, <b>European</b> <b>cinema</b> has {{over the past three}} decades been funded mainly by governmental subsidy schemes, public service television, or via the European Union, i. e. the taxpayer. Third: since the end of WWII, national cinema new waves have been created by Europe's leading festivals, such as Cannes and Venice, rather than emerging from their national film cultures, where on the whole, such auteurs and new waves were viewed by the film-going public as too difficult or elitist. Fourth: <b>European</b> <b>cinema</b> today, when considered as a counter-Hollywood, avant-garde or auteur cinema is best subsumed under the umbrella categories of "world cinema," "global art cinema," or "international festival cinema. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>cinema</b> was {{and still}} is often assimilated by film {{consumers}} as art cinema which is more difficult to understand and ultimately to reach a big number of consumers. The objectives of this paper were to examine the pathway of <b>European</b> <b>cinema</b> market and the relationship with its consumers along with their interests and attitudes towards European films and to research the most important measures taken by European Union institutions under their competition policy to support European films through state aid schemes. In order to give shape to these objectives, in-depth interviews with five elite specialists from the Romanian film industry were used, specialists who possess international expertise and recognition. The problems of the qualitative research are: the modification of consumer behaviour face to <b>European</b> <b>cinema</b> and support measures. The findings suggest that regarding its relationship with consumers and their interests in the seventh art, <b>European</b> <b>cinema</b> faces many different difficulties ranging from the competition with American films and insufficient funds, to the increased comfortableness or coziness of the movie consumers of our times. The paper concludes with examples of measures suggested by the respondents, to help <b>European</b> <b>cinema</b> become more attractive to consumers, measures which are already being implemented by the industry, making the results of our study useful for policy and decision makers within this cultural area. ...|$|R
