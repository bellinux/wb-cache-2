The limited immunity afforded honorary consular officers is specified in Article 71 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR). Such individuals do not enjoy personal inviolability, and may be arrested pending trial if circumstances should otherwise warrant. However, appropriate steps are provided to accord to such officers the protection required {{by virtue of their}} official position. In addition, the consular archives and documents of a consular post headed by an <b>honorary</b> <b>consular</b> <b>officer</b> are inviolable at all times, and wherever they may be, provided they are kept separate from other papers and documents of a private or commercial nature relating to other activities of an <b>honorary</b> <b>consular</b> <b>officer</b> or persons working with that consular officer.|$|E

Together with diplomatic missions, an honorary consul promotes economic and cultural relations between Finland and the country in question, and takes part in strengthening Finlandâ€™s image abroad. An honorary consul can advise Finnish companies, for instance, in obtaining information about local business culture and in finding cooperation partners.|$|R
