50|$|Andrena scotica, the {{chocolate}} <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> or hawthorn bee, is {{a species of}} <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> from the family Andrenidae. It occurs in western Europe {{and is one of}} the most frequently encountered <b>mining</b> <b>bees</b> found in Great Britain, where it had been previously misidentified as Andrena carantonica.|$|R
50|$|Andrena trimmerana, Trimmer's <b>mining</b> <b>bee,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> from the family Andrenidae. It occurs in the western Palearctic but its true status in some areas is muddled due to issues of {{taxonomy}} and misidentification.|$|R
50|$|Larvae feed on <b>mining</b> <b>bees.</b>|$|R
50|$|As in {{the case}} of most <b>bees,</b> adult willow <b>mining</b> <b>bees</b> drink nectar, whereas willow <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> larvae feed both on nectar and pollen. The nests of the willow <b>mining</b> <b>bees</b> are created when a mated female bee excavates a small tunnel that branch off into small {{branches}}. These branches each contain a brood cell, and once each cell has pollen and nectar for the larva to feed on - a small doorway to the brood cell is closed. The larva grows rapidly, but the bees do not emerge until spring.|$|R
50|$|The tawny <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> {{lives in}} Europe, {{ranging from the}} Balkans to {{southern}} Scandinavia and the United Kingdom. It lives in light woodlands and dry grasslands, and also in parks and gardens. It is widely distributed but has a low population density. The Tawny <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> flies from March until May. It prefers to fly in a multitude to different nectar-bearing plants. It lives in a nest in the ground, and occasionally in larger colonies.It mates in spring, after which the male dies and the female starts to build a nest. Sometimes {{more than a hundred}} females build nests in a few square metres but the tawny <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> normally does not create a colony: each female has her own nest. The tawny <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> is therefore classified amongst solitary and communal bees.|$|R

50|$|The ashy <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> {{is common}} and {{widespread}} throughout Europe. ranging from Ireland across central Europe and into Scandinavia. They are common throughout the United Kingdom although less frequent in northern Scotland. Generally docile, {{they are considered}} safe around children and pets. The ashy <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> flies from April until early June, most noticeably during the flowering periods of fruit trees, {{of which they are}} an important pollinator. They are also commonly seen hovering just above the ground after mating in spring. Following mating, the male dies and the female starts to build a nest. Each female has her own nest and the ashy <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> is therefore classified amongst solitary bees. They prefer to nest in tended lawns, flowerbeds, parkland, calcareous grassland, orchards and on the borders of agricultural land.|$|R
50|$|Andrena salicifloris, {{commonly}} known as the willow <b>mining</b> <b>bee,</b> is a bee in the genus Andrena. The bee ranges from Colorado to California and north to British Columbia, and often inhabits arid and alpine lands. The bee is often black or dark brown, and is sparsely coated with grayish hair on the thorax, legs and on the abdomen. The pollen basket is on most of the hind leg. The wings of the willow <b>mining</b> <b>bee</b> are smokey, and their veins are black.|$|R

50|$|A {{recent study}} in the journal Functional Ecology also showed that {{invasive}} Rhododendron nectar was toxic to European honeybees (Apis mellifera), killing individuals within hours of consumption. It also paralyzed bees of the species Andrena carantonica, a solitary <b>mining</b> <b>bee.</b> Bees became paralysed and exhibited excessive grooming or other distress behaviours after feeding on Rhododendron nectar, and ate less food than bees fed a control nectar. In contrast the buff-tailed bumblebee was not affected by the rhododendron nectar.|$|R
50|$|Epeolus cruciger, the red-thighed epeolus, is {{a species}} of cuckoo bee from the family Apidae. It is endemic to Europe where its main host is the common colletes (Colletes succintus), {{although}} other species of Colletes <b>mining</b> <b>bees</b> have been recorded as hosts.|$|R
50|$|The flowers produce pollen, but no nectar. Small insects such as sweat bees (Lasioglossum and Halictus), <b>mining</b> <b>bees</b> (Andrena), honeybees (Apis mellifera), and hoverflies {{visit the}} flowers to collect or feed on pollen. Some bees likely visit searching {{in vain for}} nectar.|$|R

Around 30 species removed from Perdita {{were placed in the}} genus Macrotera.|$|R
5000|$|Andrena, {{commonly}} called the <b>mining</b> <b>bee,</b> {{is the largest}} genus in the family Andrenidae, and is nearly worldwide in distribution, with the notable exceptions of Oceania and South America. With over 1,300 species, {{it is one of}} the largest of all bee genera. Species are often brown to black with whitish abdominal hair bands, though other colors are possible, most commonly reddish, but also including metallic blue or green.|$|R
50|$|These <b>mining</b> <b>bees</b> nest on {{the ground}} in {{hardened}} paths. Normally they dig vertical tunnels in the ground, with a circular entrance surrounded by a cone of earth. In most cases a single female of Halictus scabiosae use a single nest, but sometimes they have a primitive social organization, with multiple females reproducing in a common nest.
