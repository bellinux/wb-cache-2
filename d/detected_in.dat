5|$|In January 2011, the closely {{orbiting}} planet Kepler-10b {{was confirmed}} in {{the orbit of}} the star Kepler-10 after measurements of its transiting behavior (where it crosses in front of Kepler-10, periodically dimming it) and a radial velocity effect <b>detected</b> <b>in</b> Kepler-10's spectrum provided the information needed {{to prove that it}} was indeed a planet. An additional, longer-period dimming was <b>detected</b> <b>in</b> Kepler-10's spectrum, suggesting that a second planet existed in the system; however, there remained the possibility that this signal could have some other cause, and that the transit event was a false positive. Attempts to measure the radial velocity effects of this object, now named KOI 072.02, were fruitless; therefore, to rule out false positive scenarios, the Kepler team used a technique called Blender.|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{skeletal}} injuries, PMCT <b>detected</b> comminuted fractures <b>in</b> {{the vault}} {{of the skull}} and facial bone fracture in 8 of 12 cases, while autopsy <b>detected</b> these <b>in</b> 6 cases (K (0.67), P[*]<[*] 0.01; Figs.  1 and 3; Table  1).
