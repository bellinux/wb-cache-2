5|$|Globocnik and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Operation Reinhard, {{which was}} in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E

"As you know, Dan, you and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{missile defense}} before {{you set up}} High Frontier in September of '81...You and {{a small group of}} dedicated, {{determined}} people helped us move the SDI concept over all the roadblocks put up by people of less vision and belief in American capacity. God bless you!"—President Ronald Reagan, March 1993 ...|$|E
2500|$|In another interview, Amos explained, [...] " [...] {{said to me}} in March when I {{was visiting}} him in New York, 'I’ve {{always wanted to know}} what you would do with a {{seasonal}} album. You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E

60|$|ZOO. Images, images, images. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> men, {{not about}} images.|$|R
60|$|Traddles {{looked at}} me, {{as if he}} {{wondered}} what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] said Mrs. Cadwallader, {{with a sharp}} note of surprise. [...] "It {{is hardly}} a {{fortnight}} since you and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Armley and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{this after}} noon's decision," [...] he continued. [...] "There {{will be no}} secret about it to-morrow. It has been decided to carry out our autumn manoeuvred as usual in South em waters." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dixon {{shook his}} head. [...] "Greatest bunch I ever looked at. But I think they resented our presence. Pat and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> them. It's strange, Dorn, but I believe these Blue Devils that have saved France and England, and perhaps America, too, don't like our being here." ...|$|E
5000|$|Präteritum: Es regnete. [...] "It rained. / It <b>was</b> raining." [...] (<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a past event.) ...|$|R
60|$|He is a {{dangerous}} fellow, this wandering Wind; he leads me astray. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> our architect.|$|R
60|$|Jone {{looked at}} me hard, and said he'd feel easier in his mind if he {{understood}} what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I retired {{early that}} night, and, being young, forgot my perplexities in heavy slumber. The next morning I noticed that Alice's eyes seemed heavy, and I {{wondered}} {{what could be}} the reason. In after years I mentioned it when Grace and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> old times together, but she only smiled gravely, and said, [...] "I sometimes think your cousin was too good for this world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Just so,” {{said the}} other meaningly. “You know that all my people like you very much, though they hold various {{opinions}} as to your discretion. Only the other day Jane, you know my married sister, and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> you. She was extremely distressed. I assured her that you must be very far away or very deeply buried somewhere not to have given a sign of life under this provocation.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might go}} to the Devil, for all I cared for you," [...] said the old man, with the {{contempt}} which he no longer cared to make ironical. [...] "But I guess you better {{go back to your}} office, and go to work as if nothing had happened--till something does happen. I shall close the paper out as soon as I can. I was thinking of doing that just before you came in. I was thinking of taking you into the law business with me. Marcia and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it here. But I guess you wouldn't like the idea now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I'm talking {{nonsense}} now?" [...] she said, pouting. [...] "You {{liked me}} better when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the pigs; didn't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. I didn't {{expect to}} meet Miss Hyslop. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{the boat and}} thought Miss Hyslop might like to see her." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gene Simmons {{stated in}} {{reference}} to the song: [...] "Lyrically, I had no idea what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Sometimes stuff means a lot, sometimes it means nothing.".|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{very well}}, very well indeed," [...] he answered, brightly. [...] "It's very odd, but Edith and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> you all only last night, and wishing {{we could see}} you again. Edith is most uncommonly well. During the summer Mrs. Bentley had some rather severer attacks than usual, and the care and anxiety told upon Edith, but since the cooler weather has come she has picked up wonderfully." [...] He {{did not say that}} Mrs. Bentley had shared this gain, and I {{imagined}} that he had a reluctance to confess she had not. He went on, [...] "You're going to stay and spend the night with me, aren't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What an honour to {{have had}} you for a brother-in-law, you are thinking? To be {{sister-in-law}} to George Osborne, Esquire, son of John Osborne, Esquire, son of--what was your grandpapa, Mr. Osborne? Well, don't be angry. You can't help your pedigree, and I quite {{agree with you that}} I would have married Mr. Joe Sedley; for could a poor penniless girl do better? Now you know the whole secret. I'm frank and open; considering all things, it was very kind of you to allude to the circumstance--very kind and polite. Amelia dear, Mr. Osborne and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> your poor brother Joseph. How is he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're right, Peg, {{only you}} mustn't take it so hard. Things {{will work out}} all right. Homans and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> that to-day. You see, Worry wants the boys to elect a captain soon. But perhaps he has not confided in you youngsters. He will suggest that you elect Homans or me. Well, I won't run for the place, so it'll be Homans. He's the man to captain us, that's certain. Graves thinks, though, that he can pull the wires and be elected captain. He's way off. Besides, Peg, he's making a big mistake. Worry doesn't like him, and when he finds out about this break in {{training}} we'll have a new third-baseman. No doubt Blake will play the bag. Graves is the only drag in Worry's baseball machine now, and he'll not last.... So, Peg, don't think any more about it. Mind you, the whole team circles round you. You're the pivot, and as sure as you're born you'll be Wayne's captain next year. That's something for you {{to keep in mind}} and work for. If Graves keeps after you--hand him one! That's not against rules. Punch him! If Worry knew the truth he would pat you on the back for slugging Graves. Cheer up, Peg! Even if Graves has got all the kids on his side, which I doubt, Homans and I are with you. And you can just bet that Worry Arthurs will side with us.... Now run along, for I must study." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bless me, Martin {{thought to}} himself, he doesn't know what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> He hasn't {{understood}} {{a word of}} it. What did he do with his education, anyway? ...|$|R
5000|$|Burley later {{attempted}} to clarify his remarks, tweeting: [...] "Seems my tweet has <b>been</b> misunderstood. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{the way it}} was handled in the show, not multiculturalism itself." ...|$|R
60|$|The weather {{changed on}} the third day,—Oh! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> our present trip now,—and we started from Oxford upon our homeward journey {{in the midst of}} a steady drizzle.|$|R
5000|$|... "Clive Davis and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{this song}} that I'd heard a demo of and loved. And he says, 'Why don't {{you do it}} with Whitney?' So we did, {{and it turned out}} fantastic. Clive was very nice about letting Whitney sing with me — I'm not even an Arista artist.", Iglesias explained.|$|E

5000|$|Nobuhiro Watsuki praised on Satoh being {{cast for}} the role: “When this project just started, {{my wife and}} <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> who would suit the role of Kenshin, and Satoh Takeru-san {{was the one who}} came up on our mind first. So, when it was {{confirmed}} (that Satoh will be taking the role), I was surprised, but was also very happy. I’m looking forward to seeing his wonderful acting.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I learn. She's a holy of holies. But I {{promised to}} say nothing further about her, and <b>I</b> haven't. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> your Speaker of the House of Commons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{pleased to}} hear this. <b>I</b> had always <b>been</b> pretty sharp in the office, but I had never dreamed that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> in the City in this fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "We do. Love is {{one thing}} and {{friendship}} quite another. Because I'm younger than you.... I've got imagination.... I know what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Mr. Capes, do you think... do you think I don't {{know the meaning of}} love?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I love it. I can’t believe I {{get paid}} for talking rubbish every Saturday {{with one of the}} funniest people in the country who also happens to be my mate. My funniest moment so far is when Rhod and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a mouse in the house and I ended up {{role-playing}} a mouse in a restaurant ordering penne arrabiata with Rhod as the waiter. It’s the most I’ve laughed on air, although in fairness you probably had to be there.|$|E
5000|$|I was {{painting}} {{a portrait of}} Mr Thomas Brock A.R.A., now Sir Thomas Brock R.A., which was subsequently hung at the Royal Academy... During one of the sittings, Mr Brock and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Mr Frith's group representing a Private View at the Royal Academy. I observed that I {{would like to try}} my skill and see whether I could produce an Artistic picture of some similar scene. Mr Brock suggested a picture of the Private View at the Old Masters Exhibition. I thought this an excellent subject possessing great artistic possibilities.|$|E
5000|$|The Real Chrisparkle commented: [...] "When Bad Wolf and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> {{the show}} beforehand, we both agreed that “Sing” is {{probably}} our least favourite number, {{because of its}} potential to irritate; just slightly. But {{it occurred to me}} whilst watching it, that it must be extraordinarily demanding for its performers. You need the verbal dexterity of a Gilbert and Sullivan patter song, coupled with immaculate comedy timing and, from Kristine, the ability to sing credibly off-key." [...] StageWhispers named it a [...] "funny, rapid-fire duet". The Rider News noted [...] "“Sing!” makes for a great contrast in the play, breaking the tension and adding in quirky humor".|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a concept}} album based on China. Vangelis in 1979 {{interview}} said [...] "I’ve never <b>been</b> there, <b>I</b> had the idea long before the events that placed China {{at the forefront of}} the news. For years <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> passionate about the Chinese. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> politics, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the old China, the new China as well, about this enormous nation and the people who live there. What is happening there is miraculous, it touches me".|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep {{your own}} secrets," [...] he said; [...] "I {{only want to}} spare Mrs. Farnaby a dreadful disappointment. But I must know what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> when <b>I</b> go to her. Can't {{you tell me how}} you found out this abominable swindle?" ...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{canons of}} writing {{that is often}} {{repeated}} {{is that if you}} write, you should write about something you know about. I will apply that belief to my comments today. I will <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> something that I know (at least a little) about. For the past twenty plus years <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> studying the linkage between science and public policy making. The science <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> science as defined by the scientific method, which posits that we should follow such tenets as causation, empiricism, objectivity, and replication. The public policy <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> the policies that are determined through our democratic process, highlighted by its construction by our governing bodies, implementation by our executives, and interpretation by our courts...|$|R
