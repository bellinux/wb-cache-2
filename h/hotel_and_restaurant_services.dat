40|$|This study first {{explains}} why tourist satisfaction and perceived service value {{are important to}} a destination by empirically measuring {{the impact of these}} two factors on visitors' repurchase intentions. It then illustrates how tourist satisfaction in a given situation can be measured, diagnosed, and thereby managed. Samples of airline, <b>hotel,</b> <b>and</b> <b>restaurant</b> <b>services</b> in Hong Kong were used to realize two research objectives. The first was to empirically test, through logistic regression analyses, research hypotheses on the impact of tourists' overall satisfaction and perceived service value on their repurchase intentions. The results indicate that both tourists' overall satisfaction and their perceived service value significantly predict their repurchase intentions across the hotel and restaurant service samples, and that perceived service value, but not overall satisfaction, significantly predicts their repurchase intentions in the airline sample. The second objective was to assess the attribute satisfaction of tourists across the three samples, which was achieved by using importance and performance analysis (IPA). The overall IPA results, which take all seven tourist source markets in Hong Kong as a whole, indicate that Hong Kong's airline, <b>hotel,</b> <b>and</b> <b>restaurant</b> <b>services</b> do an excellent, very good, and good job, respectively, in satisfying their corresponding visitors. However, some weak points in Hong Kong's tourist services were identified. When each of Hong Kong's seven source tourist markets was taken individually, it was found that whereas some service attributes were captured in the same IPA quadrant across several different source markets, other attributes were captured in different IPA quadrants. A brief discussion is provided of the study findings and their implications from the perspectives of tourism management and marketing. 贯穿全文我们将探讨两个问题。首先，通过游客满意感和物有所值感对其重购意向的影响，探讨游客满意感和物有所值感对旅游目的地的重要性。其次，通过案例分析游客的具体满意感(即测量和诊断游客的具体满意感) ，探讨目的地改善游客满意感的可能性和可行性。具体来讲，本文以香港航空、酒店业和餐饮业游客为研究样本，旨在实现以下两个研究目标。一是以航空、酒店和餐饮服务为例，实证检验游客对目的地行业服务的总体满意感和”物有所值„感，与其重购意向之间的因果关系。LOGISTIC回归分析结果表明，上述因果关系分别在餐饮业和饭店业总体样本中，充分得到了支持性的验证。然而，在航空业总体样本中，仅得到了部分支持性的验证:：即仅有航空游客对服务经历的物有所值感与其重购意向之间存在显著性的关联。二是采用”IPA„(重要性及其表现) 分析法，测评游客对香港上述每一个旅游行业的具体满意感。IPA分析具体体现在两个层面:：总体IPA和客源市场IPA。就游客对香港的旅游服务的具体感知和评价而言，在总体IPA中我们视所有客源市场为统一的整体;；而在客源市场IPA中，我们则视香港七大客源市场为各个不同的单体进行分析。结果表明，总体上讲，香港航空业、饭店业和餐饮业，就其游客的具体满意感而言，评估结果分别为卓越、非常好和良好。与此同时，通过IPA分析，我们还发现了香港旅游服务体系中一些亟待改进的不足之处。具体来讲，七大旅游客源国对香港航空，酒店和餐饮服务的具体满意感既有相似之处，但更有不同的地方。最后，本文对以上诸多研究发现及其启示也进行了简要的探讨。School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{benefits}} of international trade in a low-income context is the presumed ability, through trade, to access higher levels of technology through imports. Despite this, very {{little research has been}} done on international trade in a low-income (as opposed to middle-income) context, and even less concretely exploring the role of imports, largely because of the paucity of data available. This paper explores the consequences of importing on the utilization of skills in the low-income context of Rwanda, utilizing a unique linked dataset. In particular, the causal impact of imports on skill utilization is explored, with particular attention {{to whether or not the}} imports are sourced from high-income countries (and therefore of higher quality/technology). The causal impact of imports is obtained through the use of an instrumental variable procedure where the changes in the exchange rates faced by a firm during the sample period on the basket of goods imported by the firm prior to the sample period are used as instruments for the changes in imports during the sample period. A theoretical model is built that incorporates the skill complementarity hypothesis (as well as a trade-related required services hypothesis due to Matsuyama (2007)), and this model is tested in the context of Rwanda, using data on all firms with registered payroll in Rwanda (not just manufacturing firms). We investigate the effects for different import sources, as well as importing within different sectors (manufacturing, <b>hotel</b> <b>and</b> <b>restaurant</b> <b>services,</b> wholesale & retail trade, etc.) ...|$|E

One of the most important components of sustainable development is the environmental protection that globally, several actions have been taken by the international community. Their goal was to evaluate the environmental impacts of emissions. Under the Kyoto Protocol, member states are committed to reduce the greenhouse gases to 1990 levels or lower until 2012 - 2010. Accordingly, this study is to examine the level of pollution in Iranian economy sectors. Data in this study include six fuels, gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, LPG, natural gas and gas oil that are available in the country's energy balance sheet. Input-Output (IO) analysis was used to calculate emissions of five pollutants, COx, NOx, CO, HC and SPM, in distinguishing 20 economic sectors in Iran. Then with TOPSIS technique and Entropy weighted, five pollutants are combined and pollution levels have been determined. The results indicate that <b>hotel</b> <b>and</b> <b>restaurant</b> <b>services,</b> real estate and other business services, basic metals and metal products made, textile products, clothing, leather, wood, paper products and machineries and equipment gain the highest level of sustainable development in terms of environmental protection.

40|$|Production and {{employment}} have grown faster in the Helsinki Region {{and in the}} Province of Uusimaa compared to growth rates for Finland as a whole. At the same time, the extent of specialisation has diminished. The production structure of this region is now much more {{similar to that of}} the overall Finnish economy than it was in earlier decades. Still, the region continues to specialise heavily in business services, finance and insurance, and in wholesale trade. In addition to these, regional activity is also specialised in logistics, <b>hotel</b> <b>and</b> <b>restaurant</b> <b>services,</b> and other social and personal services. With respect to industrial production, the region has maintained its specialisation only in electrical equipment and electronics manufacturing. Specialisation in these rapidly growing sectors partially explains why growth in the Helsinki Region has outpaced that in the rest of Finland. On the basis of industrial linkages, one can say that there are four clusters in the Helsinki Region : a business services (KIBS) cluster, an ICT cluster, a wholesale trade cluster and a logistics cluster. This study examines the logistics cluster in more detail. The new harbour and fast growth in air traffic, together with their firm agglomerations, will have a positive effect on the future development of the cluster. The waning importance of the shipyard may have a negative effect on the marine technology industrynew companies may not emerge while existing ones could leave the area.

40|$|There is a {{constantly}} {{growing demand for}} the fast data delivery {{especially in the case}} of business surveys. Monthly or quarterly surveys which should provide these data are usually based on samples and are focused just on few variables (i. e. turnover, number of employees). The main goal is to get results of sufficient quality as quickly as possible. Since the deadlines for the publishing of results are becoming shorter and shorter there is a temptation of publishing data of poor quality just for the sake of timeliness. Therefore there is of great importance to constantly measure different aspects of quality of these data in order to avoid publishing results which would not satisfy agreed quality standards. In the paper we present the system for quality control of statistical results in the case of the short term surveys of enterprises from 3 different areas: retail trade, <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> <b>restaurants,</b> <b>services.</b> The published results of the surveys are different time based indices. Quality is controlled by the set of indicators defined on the base of the Standard Quality Report and other methodological documents prepared by Eurostat. Since most of the statistical process is automated the aim was to incorporate into this process also the calculation of the majority of defined quality indicators so that consequently we would have the indicators at disposal at the same time as the estimated indices. We describe which indicators are calculated automatically, which were the problems that we faced and what are our plans for the future work in this area. ...|$|R
