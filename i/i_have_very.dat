500|$|Tabloid {{criticism}} of Islam4UK and Choudary since {{news of the}} proposed march first became public has, generally, been vitriolic, calling him a [...] "hate preacher". In January 2010, appearing on the BBC's The Daily Politics, he was asked by its presenter, Andrew Neil, for his opinions on the banning of Islam4UK, before being asked to comment on his financial status, claiming that it was [...] "relevant to our viewers". [...] Choudary told Neil that his finances were a personal matter, {{and that he was}} [...] "doing something, and I don't want to discuss that with you. [...] I'm not on Jobseeker's allowance, {{but at the same time}} I have family allowance, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> firmly held views which I'm propagating at the same time." [...] Responding to the media's {{criticism of}} him, Choudary said [...] "I do believe that people have been whipped up into an anti-Islam anti-Muslim frenzy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{identifies}} as a feminist. In an August 2014 interview with Glamour magazine, Anderson said: [...] "I have feminist bones and when I hear things or see people react {{to women in}} certain ways <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little tolerance." [...] Anderson has several tattoos; all of them, as she described, are in some way about [...] "peace of mind, right mind, right action". She practices meditation daily.|$|E
2500|$|Slash is a dual {{citizen of}} the United Kingdom and the United States. A British {{national}} since his London birth, he has resided in Los Angeles since 1971 but did not acquire American citizenship until 1996. He said in 2010, [...] "I do consider myself British. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> strong feelings about my British heritage. My first years were there, I went to school there, and I have seemingly endless family {{on that side of}} the pond. So I've always felt most comfortable in England." ...|$|E

2500|$|When asked {{during the}} Meet the Press {{interview}} {{if she would}} take back her previous comments that Obama [...] "may have anti-American views" [...] and that his administration had [...] "embraced something called gangster government", Bachmann backed her statements, saying [...] "I do believe that actions {{that have been taken}} by this White House—I don't take back my statements on gangster government. I think that there have been actions taken by the government that are corrupt... I said <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> serious concerns about the president's views, and I think the president's actions {{in the last two years}} speak for themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morris left Princeton in 1972, enrolling at Berkeley as a Ph.D. {{student in}} {{philosophy}}. At Berkeley, he once again {{found that he}} was not well-suited to his subject. [...] "Berkeley was just a world of pedants. It was truly shocking. I spent two or three years in the philosophy program. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> bad feelings about it," [...] he later said. He became a regular at the Pacific Film Archive. As Tom Luddy, the director of the archive at the time, later remembered: [...] "He was a film noir nut. He claimed we weren't showing the real film noir. So I challenged him to write the program notes. Then, there was his habit of sneaking into the films and denying that he was sneaking in. I told him if he was sneaking in he should at least admit he was doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s the {{incidence}} of mesothelioma in former workers at the factory began to rise, but cases were also being found in people who had never worked for T, although they {{had lived in the}} vicinity of Midland Works or had relatives who were former employees. In 1987 Richard Taylor, a journalist with the Yorkshire Evening Post, began checking through the [...] coroner's court reports, examining death certificates and interviewing relatives and neighbours of the deceased. As a result, Taylor was able to demonstrate a pattern [...] "of an incredibly high incidence of mesothelioma deaths in Armley around the Roberts factory." [...] Philip Sanderson Gill, the coroner, agreed with the findings, and said: [...] "It was only as a trend {{over a number of years}} that a more precise picture appeared. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> few other cases from other areas of Leeds. It is significant that virtually all the cases we have come from that area." [...] The Yorkshire Evening Post produced a series of articles about the ongoing contamination and disease, which they dubbed the [...] "Armley Asbestos Tragedy".|$|E

2500|$|Since 1906, {{with his}} cousin Nolinikanta Kar, Atul had been frequenting Jatindranath Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) who was their {{neighbour}} in Kushtia Sub-division. They both entered the local Anushilan Samiti. W. Sealy in his Report will note [...] "Atul Ghosh and Nolini Kanta Kar, two dangerous and important absconders of the gun-running conspiracy." [...] (p23). At Kolkata, thanks to Jatin, they both {{came very close}} to Sri Aurobindo. Whereas Nolini practised wrestling with Kikkar Singh, Atul became an expert trainer in self-defence at the Pataldanga branch of the Anushilan Samiti: Atul Krishna Ghosh & Jatindranath Mukherjee founded PATHURIAGHATA BYAM SAMITY which was an important centre of armed revolution of Indian National Movement. Here he came across a number of revolutionaries, including Sachin Sanyal’s Benares group and Biren Datta Gupta whom he recommended to Jatindranath. Biren received from the latter, in January 1910, the mandate to assassinate Samsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who was man-handling the under-trial prisoners of the Alipore Bomb case. In connection with Biren’s successful mission, Jatindranath with forty-six associates were placed on trial in the Howrah conspiracy case. Inside the prison, Jatindranath learnt from his emissaries abroad that Germany was preparing for war against Great Britain. After his release in 1911, Jatindranath suspended all extremist activities, left Kolkata under the responsibility of Atul, himself forging a grand federation of regional units in the districts. A relentless organiser, Atul sheltered revolutionaries from various units as much in his parents’ house at Jaduboyra, [...] as at the Kolkata residence of Meghamala and K.P. Basu, at 11 Mahendra Gossain’s Lane, where there was a free dormitory with homely meals. Even leaders of rival parties like Pratul Ganguli of Dhaka admit having enjoyed this hospitality, at great expense and risk on Atul’s side: [...] "We became great friends with Atulkrishna and had confidence in him. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> often been to his Darjipara residence and spent nights there. He had grown intimate with several of our members, almost close friends. We considered him to be, somewhat, our own colleague and he sincerely hoped to unite our parties so that we could all work together. Frankly speaking, it was thanks to his wish that I met Jatin Mukherjee…". Disappointed by the duplicity of the Dhaka branch, [...] "some of its important workers, however, like Sachin Sanyal and Nagen (Girija) Datta, severed their connection with it and, introduced by Atulkrishna, worked with Rasbehari Bose in Upper India." [...] Atul’s elder brother Aghorenath, a civil surgeon, often looked after the bullet wounds received by the patriots.|$|E
