A separate result is proved for the case that K lies entirely in the boundary of D. 1. Principal Ideas We begin by defining the central idea <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>paper.</b> <b>Definition</b> 1. 1. Let K be {{a subset of the}} closure D of a bounded domain D ⊂ Cn. The set K {{is said to be a}} determining subset of D if, whenever g is an automorphism of D that is continuous up to the boundary of D and g(k) = k ∀k ∈ K, then g is the identity map of D. In our previous paper [FKKM] we considered K lying entirely in D (and auto-morphisms were not necessarily continuous up to the boundary). Our goal now is to study the situation when some, or all, of the points of K lie in the boundary of the domain D. Recall that, when the domain D is the disc in the plane, then two interior points are a determining set for automorphisms; but it takes three bound...|$|E
40|$|Background: Verrucae are benign proliferations seen in {{skin and}} mucosae due to {{infection}} with papillomaviruses. They may present differently according to clinical appearance and localization. In time, about 60 % of verrucae spontaneously resolve. Since {{there is no}} single effective treatment method, a few different methods may be combined or sequentially applied. Local treatment meth-ods of verrucae will be discussed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>paper.</b> <b>Definition</b> Verrucae are benign proliferations seen in skin and mucosae due to infection with papillomaviruses. These viruses cause slow growing lesions that do not cause acute symptoms or signs [1, 2]. Historical Aspect Verrucae have been known since ancient Greece and Rome. Up until the 19 th cen-tury, verrucae were believed to be a form of syphilis or gonorrhea [2]. An infectious eti-ology was first questioned by Payne when he contracted verrucae after treating a pa-tient. Viral etiology was first proposed by Ciuffo in 1907 and Strauss et al. isolated the small DNA virus in 1949. Joseph Mel-nick used the term papovavirus in 1960. The virus was characterized by following re-search and it was named human papilloma virus (HPV) [3]. In 1974, Zur Hausen pro-posed that there may be different types of virus and 4 types were identified in 1976 [4]. Today, due to advanced recombinant DNA technology, over 100 different geno-types of HPV have been identified [2]...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{algebraic}} tool {{to solve}} the constraints of propositional calculus. Any constraint of propositional calculus {{can be described in}} terms of equations in a Boolean algebra, and also translated into equations of a Boolean ring where the constraint is represented {{in the form of a}} finite set of polynomials. We give an algorithm which produces a rewriting system for a given Boolean constraint, which reduces Boolean polynomials equivalent under the constraint to the same normal form. The algorithm is a central part of the constraint solver in CAL (Contrainte avec Logique), which is a constraint logic programming language being developed at ICOT. 1. Boolean ring We assume that the reader is familiar with elementary algebraic notions such as ring and ideal (see [Waerden 37, 40], for example), and the terminology of rewriting systems (see [Huet 80], for example). For a Boolean algebra , define x+y=def(x∧ y) ∨(xΛ y) and x y=defx∧ y for each x, y in B, then is known to be a commutative ring with a unit with the following properties.
