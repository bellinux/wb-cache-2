50|$|Zhu Ziyan, {{a history}} {{professor}} from Shanghai University, felt that Cao Ding's tooth alone cannot be used as evidence to determine Cao Cao's ancestry. He was sceptical about whether those who claim to be Cao Cao's descendants are really so, because genealogical records dating from the Song dynasty (960-1279) are already so rare in the present-day, much less those dating from the Three Kingdoms era (220-280). Besides, according to historical records, Cao Ding was a younger brother of the eunuch Cao Teng, who adopted Cao Cao's biological father, Cao Song. Therefore, Cao Cao had no known blood relations with Cao Ding. In other words, Cao Ding was not Cao Cao's real granduncle (this assuming {{that there was no}} intra-family adoption, which was actually common in China). Zhu Ziyan mentioned that <b>Fudan</b> <b>University's</b> research only proves that those self-proclaimed descendants of Cao Cao are related to Cao Ding; it does not directly relate them to Cao Cao.|$|R

30|$|Unfortunately, by necessity, {{this special}} issue {{does not reflect the}} full breath of {{important}} research being conducted in cultural sociology. Most importantly, we have chosen to showcase recent, cutting-edge work by scholars who study Chinese society but from outside mainland China. 4 As Western-based scholars, we have chosen to more deeply delve into one part of the global conversation we seek to promote between global cultural sociologists and domestic Chinese scholars: overseas-based scholars talking to and about China for a global audience. We have done this with the knowledge that other facets of the conversation have and will be carried out in other forums. To take only one important example, the recently-published inaugural issue of <b>Fudan</b> <b>University’s</b> Chinese language 社会学刊 (Journal of Sociological Studies) has been centered around cultural sociology, featuring a number of papers authored by Chinese scholars intended for a Chinese-speaking audience.

50|$|Russian and Chinese leaders {{regularly}} {{call for}} greater {{cooperation and coordination}} in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation between their two countries {{in the context of}} their broader goal of promoting of multilateral diplomacy. In a joint statement issued on May 23, 2008, Russia and China asserted that “International security is comprehensive and inalienable, and some countries’ security cannot be guaranteed at the cost of some others’, including expanding military and political allies.” Zhao Huasheng, Director of Russian and Central Asian Studies at <b>Fudan</b> <b>University’s</b> Shanghai Cooperation Center, has argued that economic cooperation will ensure the long-term relevance of the SCO, as current security threats recede. While China and Russia do enjoy some bilateral energy cooperation, which experts predict will continue to grow in the future, the two countries have emerged as rivals for Central Asian oil and gas supplies. With the rise in the price of oil in the mid-2000s, Russia has sought to renew its influence in Central Asia, in particular the region's southern flank, to guarantee access to gas supplies for reexport to Europe and for its own domestic needs. As China’s energy needs have grown and its policymakers have sought to develop its western provinces, China, too, has sought to expand its influence in Central Asia.|$|R

40|$|Preferential {{attachment}} [...] - {{by which}} new nodes attach to existing nodes with probability {{proportional to the}} existing nodes' degree [...] - has become the standard growth model for scale-free networks, where the asymptotic probability of a node having degree k is proportional to k^-γ. However, the motivation for this model is entirely ad hoc. We use exact likelihood arguments and show that the optimal way to build a scale-free network is to attach most new links to nodes of low degree. Curiously, {{this leads to a}} scale-free networks with a single dominant hub: a star-like structure we call a super-star network. Asymptotically, the optimal strategy is to attach each new node to one of the nodes of degree k with probability proportional to 1 /N+ζ(γ) (k+ 1) ^γ (in a N node network) [...] - a stronger bias toward high degree nodes than exhibited by standard preferential attachment. Our algorithm generates optimally scale-free networks (the super-star networks) as well as randomly sampling the space of all scale-free networks with a given degree exponent γ. We generate viable realisation with finite N for 1 ≪γ 2. We observe an apparently discontinuous transition at γ≈ 2 between so-called super-star networks and more tree-like realisations. Gradually increasing γ further leads to re-emergence of a super-star hub. To quantify these structural features we derive a new analytic expression for the expected degree exponent of a pure preferential attachment process, and introduce alternative measures of network entropy. Our approach is generic and may also be applied to an arbitrary degree distribution.

40|$|Globalization brings greater {{movement}} of people, goods, capital and ideas. One {{of the advantages}} of globalization is sharing of not only products and services, but also knowledge and culture between people and countries. International research projects, such as the case study in this paper, -ISSC, are a good example of communication and cooperation between researchers from different culture backgrounds. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find out how cultural differences influenced the management of the international ISSC research project, which consists of five different partners. The partners include FPX (a Swedish organization), KI (a Swedish medical institute), <b>Fudan</b> and Huazhong <b>Universities</b> (Chinese Universities), and Heidelberg University (German University). Qualitative methods, such as questionnaires, phone conversation and face-to-face interviews have been used in this research study.

40|$|East Asia {{has been}} rapidly moving toward modernization, {{driven by the}} force of globalization. The result of that process is that country values are {{converging}} from traditional ones to modern ones. Countries have been congregating towards various ideologies, “meritocracy ” in particular, as they continue to modernize. This study aims to shed light on how globalization influences the work values of undergraduate students in Japan, China, and Korea. These three countries share a Confucian background which produces many interesting findings. Samples collected from Waseda, <b>Fudan,</b> and Korea <b>Universities</b> are examined using statistical analysis methods, and conclusions are drawn. While work values are converging, they are not completely integrated. Each country still possesses its own unique set of characteristics that separate it from the other nations. However, Japanese and Korean students were found to possess similar work values when compared to Chinese students. Interestingly, Chinese students have two conflicting ideologies: one of “egalitarian socialism ” that places emphasis on the equality between people, and another of “modern meritocracy ” that puts weight on individual development and reward. How Chinese students will continue to reconcile this delicate balance as time goes by is a fascinating topic for future research...|$|R
