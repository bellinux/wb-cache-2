500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much {{it might as well have}} been a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> cost us sales..." ...|$|E

We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of the season four finale, with which D. Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout.

Internally and externally I feel there's an expectation of Square Enix to offer something new, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the Final Fantasy team could create something completely different, but at the moment they're strictly catering to the particular audience they have now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you gone, that you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you {{for as long as you}} wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is the best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. It was all right for the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I would go off with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons for a number of years afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
