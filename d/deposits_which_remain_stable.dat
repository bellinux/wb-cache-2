40|$|SummaryThe {{arrangement}} of β cells within islets of Langerhans {{is critical for}} insulin release through the generation of rhythmic activity. A privileged role for individual β cells in orchestrating these responses has long been suspected, but not directly demonstrated.

Mapping of islet functional architecture revealed the presence of hub cells with pacemaker properties, <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> <b>stable</b> over recording periods of 2 to 3  hr. Using a dual optogenetic/photopharmacological strategy, silencing of hubs abolished coordinated islet responses to glucose, whereas specific stimulation restored communication patterns. Hubs were metabolically adapted and targeted by both pro-inflammatory and glucolipotoxic insults to induce widespread β cell dysfunction. Thus, the islet is wired by hubs, whose failure may contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R
