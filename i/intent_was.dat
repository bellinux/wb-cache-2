5|$|In 2012, Rob Cantor of Tally Hall {{produced}} a song describing LaBeouf as a murderous cannibal. In 2014, Cantor {{produced a}} music video {{based on this}} song. Despite the title and lyrics, the <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> humorous and non-serious, and LaBeouf appeared {{at the end of}} the video, applauding.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault {{ceiling of the}} main {{sanctuary}} cracked, {{and had to be}} repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{the song}} was a {{collaborative}} effort between Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Andrae Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale. Jackson's <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to create a song that was lyrically deep yet melodically simple, so the whole world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could sing along. He conceptualized a song that had an emotional message.|$|E
50|$|Explicit <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> an <b>intent</b> that <b>is</b> {{publicly}} stated {{and made}} available for the participants.

50|$|Common <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> an <b>intent</b> that <b>is</b> {{shared and}} {{understood}} by all participants, i.e. {{there is no}} discrepancy between {{the intent of the}} participating humans. Common <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> an idealized view of intent.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed of Portland stone, largely over two storeys {{but with a}} three story octagonal tower between the two wings, {{as well as a}} square tower to the north above the porte-cochère. The walls feature castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles, giving the building the feel of a castle in the gothic style. The building has an asymmetric feel, in a picturesque style, with varying shapes and elevations to different sections. The <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to give a castle style to the building, reminiscent of historical fortresses, but with the comfortable interior of a house.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 2013, Beyoncé {{worked on}} the project in strict secrecy, sharing details of the album with a small circle of people and {{continually}} shifting the deadline, which was only finalized a week before its release. She later explained that her <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to reinstate {{the idea of an}} album release as a significant, exciting event which had lost meaning in the face of hype created around singles.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 {{when he was}} {{contacted}} by Chicagoan Burton Spain. Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 {{and set out to}} perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's original <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks were in high demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E

50|$|In philanthropy, donor <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> the purpose, {{sometimes}} publicly expressed, {{for which}} a philanthropist intends a charitable gift or bequest. Donor <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> most often expressed in gift restrictions, terms, or agreements between a donor and donee, {{but it may also}} be expressed separately in the words, actions, beliefs, and giving practices of a philanthropist. Donor <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> protected in American law regarding charitable trusts, and trustees' primary fiduciary obligation is to carry out a donor's wishes.|$|R
5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, he {{returned}} to Henderson and resumed his law practice. He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866. In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him. Powell believed {{that many of the}} legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally. In light of this belief, he urged the Democrats to withdraw his name and nominate someone more palatable to Union sympathizers. This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected.|$|E
5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a bomb that blew out the front of Nussbaum's house, while {{he and his wife}} were {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of his congregation blamed it on Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups from using the synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to put an end to the interracial meetings that Nussbaum held there.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{producing}} an English-language version of Let the Right One In began in 2007 shortly {{before it was}} released to audiences. In 2008, Hammer Films acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from Stockholm to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20 million.|$|E
30|$|After intent, intent {{filter and}} <b>intent</b> {{resolution}} <b>are</b> defined, Android applications’ safety against crashes due to <b>intents</b> <b>is</b> formally defined. The definition resolve {{is used to}} formally describe crash-safety property intent_crash_safety of an intent (Listing 15). This property is too strong: it defines an <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> crash safe if it must {{be accepted by the}} filter. To define crash-safety of an intent with respect to the entire device, a recursive function intent_crash_safetey_env is defined in Listing 16. An <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> crash-safe in the device if there exists at least an application (filter) that accepts the intent.|$|R
50|$|Reader {{response}} critics {{view the}} authorial intent variously. In general, they {{have argued that}} the author's <b>intent</b> itself <b>is</b> immaterial and cannot be fully recovered. However, the author's intent will shape the text and limit the possible interpretations of a work. The reader's impression of the author's <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> a working force in interpretation, but the author's actual <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|R
30|$|To do this, first a {{broadcast}} message (<b>intent)</b> <b>is</b> precisely defined in Listing 22. A broadcast <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> accepted (resolved to) by every application inside Android device environment that has declared a receiver for it. For simplicity, we assume every application on the mobile device (system) has declared broadcast receiver. This concept is formalized using recursive function broadcast in Listing 22. It takes an intent and system environment (list of applications’ filters) and returns true if the <b>intent</b> <b>is</b> accepted by every application on the device.|$|R
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie {{would give}} him a global brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his way onto the ship, many in the crowd at the dock reached out to touch him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E
5|$|National {{governmental}} {{bodies and}} charities were rapidly formed to produce memorials for these sites. The British government, for example, {{set up the}} Battle Exploits Committee in 1919 to create national battlefield memorials, alongside {{the work of the}} IWGC. Initially their <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to celebrate the more heroic aspects of the fighting, and to avoid the flavour of memorials to the fallen that were being built elsewhere; by 1921, however, the committee had entered into a partnership with IWGC and adopted the same focus on the sacrifice of the fallen soldiers. The Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission (CBMC) was similarly established in 1920 to produce war memorials for the major battlefields involving Canadian forces.|$|E

5|$|On 1 October 1941, the Australian Military Board {{issued an}} order re-raising the 39th Battalion {{as a single}} {{battalion}} of the Australian Military Forces, as Militiamen were called up for national service. The <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to raise the battalion to relieve the Queensland-based 49th Battalion, which was serving as a garrison force around Port Moresby, and from the outset the battalion was formed from men who were transferred {{from a variety of}} infantry and light horse units, including the 24th/39th Battalion that had been deployed at Nagambie Road, in Seymour, Victoria, as well as elements from the Militia 2nd Cavalry and 3rd and 4th Infantry Divisions. Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Conran became the battalion's new commanding officer, having previously served with the 23rd Battalion during World War I, and in the Citizens Military Force after the war.|$|E
5|$|Rita {{finds out}} from a county sheriff that Paul, her abusive ex-husband who {{attacked}} her the night before, is pressing charges against her for assault. She talks with a lawyer, who tells her that since she invited Paul into her house, she cannot prove that her <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to defuse the situation. At a hearing, it is revealed that Rita violated her and Paul's custody agreement, making Paul's case against her even stronger. When Paul drops by Rita's house to return their children, he threatens Dexter when the two are alone in the kitchen, and Dexter responds by hitting him with a frying pan. Paul loses consciousness, so Dexter drives his body back to Paul's hotel and frames him for drug abuse. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{transmission}} of Bob & Rose, Davies was approached by Abbott to write for his new BBC show Linda Green. He accepted the offer and wrote an episode where the titular character (portrayed by Liza Tarbuck) and her friends attend a schoolmate's funeral and become psychologically haunted by the deceased woman's solitary life. His first work for the BBC in eight years prompted them to approach him with additional concepts for period dramas, which he invariably declined as his sole <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to revive Doctor Who, which had then been on hiatus for over a decade.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's father, King Thomas, {{had great}} ambitions for him. An attempt {{to expand into}} Croatia proper by marrying Stephen to a wealthy widow failed, and {{negotiations}} for a marital alliance with the Sforzas of Milan were abandoned when a more prestigious opportunity presented itself: marriage to the heiress Maria of Serbia in April 1459 made Stephen the ruler of {{the remnants of the}} neighbouring country. The <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to unite the Kingdom of Bosnia and the Serbian Despotate under Stephen to combat the expanding Ottoman Empire. Stephen's Catholicism made him unpopular in Orthodox Serbia. After ruling it for merely two months, however, Stephen surrendered it to the encroaching Ottoman forces and fled back to his father's court, which earned him the contempt of the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus and other Christian rulers in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{appointed}} corporate {{head of the}} IBM Design Program in 1989, Tom Hardy, {{initiated a}} strategic design management effort, in collaboration with IBM design consultant Richard Sapper, {{to return to the}} roots of the IBM Design Program first established in 1956 by Eliot Noyes, Paul Rand and Charles Eames. The <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to reprise IBM's brand image with customer experience-driven quality, approachability and contemporary product innovation. The highly successful IBM ThinkPad was the first product to emerge from this strategy in 1992 and, together with other innovative, award-winning products that followed, served to position design as a strategic asset for IBM's brand turnaround efforts initiated in 1993 by newly appointed CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{divergent}} {{costs for}} the project were discussed. The original estimate was £140,000 if the railway was built, and £200,000 if the tunnel was built. Opponents suggested the cost would be nearer £700,000, and John Rennie estimated the tunnel line would cost £440,790 in 1809. Opponents argued that the real <b>intent</b> <b>was</b> to improve the water supply for the Basingstoke Canal or to line the pockets of George Hollis, {{the owner of the}} Itchen Navigation. There was considerable interest in the scheme, as 1,244 shares of £100 had been subscribed by early 1809, but with opposition from land and mill owners, and Rennie's report indicating much higher costs, the project was dropped.|$|E
30|$|<b>Intent</b> <b>is</b> a data {{structure}} describing a specific task {{which can be}} performed in a physical environment.
