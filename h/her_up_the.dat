5|$|TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon is {{due for a}} root canal. To avoid feeling lonely on Valentine's Day, she {{schedules}} her {{surgery for}} that day, but soon realizes she will need someone to escort her home from the dentist's office due to the aftereffects of anesthesia. She asks her colleagues at the 30 Rock building for a ride home, {{but all of them}} have Valentine's Day plans and cannot help. When Liz calls the dentist's office to say she does not have anyone to pick <b>her</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> receptionist (Shinnerrie Jackson) informs her that after her procedure she can only leave alone if she signs a liability waiver. Liz initially intends to sign the document, but is dissuaded at a party by musician Jon Bon Jovi, and instead decides to claim to the receptionist that she has a ride home after all.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E
5|$|Roughly a {{thousand}} {{years prior to the}} events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hell-like demon dimension—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings. For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer <b>her</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone. During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father, only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself. In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans. She became their guardian and ally, and she helped them kill vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities thanks to her demonic power to absorb souls. However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten. Although she eventually managed to slay him, she was turned in the process. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of running her kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while.|$|E

Zhang Ershen (literally Second Aunt Zhang), an elderly maid of the landlord, is very {{sympathetic}} of Xi'er. Xi'er dozes off while trying to take a short break. The mother of the landlord comes on the scene and, with her hairpin, pokes Xi'er's face to wake <b>her</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> landlord mother then orders Xi'er to prepare her a lotus seed soup. When the soup is served, the landlord mother, displeased with the taste, pours the still-boiling soup on Xi'er's face. Outraged by the pain and anger, Xi'er picks up the whip that the landlord uses to punish her, and beats up the landlord mother. The landlord mother falls and crawls on the floor attempting to flee while Xi'er continues to whip her with her utmost strength. Xi'er gets her vengeance, but she is subsequently locked up by the landlord.|$|E

500|$|After {{he arrived}} in Russia, Worsley was {{selected}} to go to Archangel where he organised equipment and supplies for the British forces stationed there. He provided extensive advice, derived from his polar experience, to soldiers on how to best make use of their resources and trained them {{in the use of}} skis. [...] He participated in several patrols and due to a shortage of officers, occasionally took command of platoons of British infantry. In April 1919, he was posted back to Murmansk, where he took command of the gunboat HMS Cricket. He took <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Dvinia River and targeted Bolshevik gunboats and villages along the river.

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "White Horse" [...] {{are written in}} first person, with Swift {{reflecting}} on an occasion when a relationship, which seemed like a fairytale in the commence, fell apart: [...] "I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale/ I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet/ Lead <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairwell." [...] The track spoke about pain and disillusionment, in the clear perspective of a reborn realist. Due to the heartbreak, the protagonist escapes from the small town that she resided in. Several music critics, like Kate Kiefer of Paste, noted the lyrical disparity between [...] "White Horse" [...] and Swift's previous single, [...] "Love Story", where Swift viewed fairytales in a positive light, with a happy ending. Kiefer assumed that [...] "White Horse" [...] withdrew everything she said in [...] "Love Story".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} notorious and widely {{condemned}} scenes in Gone with the Wind depicts what is now legally defined as [...] "marital rape". The scene begins with Scarlett and Rhett {{at the bottom of the}} staircase, where he begins to kiss her, refusing to be told 'no' by the struggling and frightened Scarlett; Rhett overcomes her resistance and carries <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs to the bedroom, where the audience is left in no doubt that she will [...] "get what's coming to her". The next scene, the following morning, shows Scarlett glowing with barely suppressed sexual satisfaction; Rhett apologizes for his behavior, blaming it on his drinking. The scene has been accused of combining romance and rape by making them indistinguishable from each other, and of reinforcing a notion about forced sex: that women secretly enjoy it, and it is an acceptable way for a man to treat his wife.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{received}} {{orders from}} the Admiralty in June 1838 to have Temeraire valued in preparation for her sale out of the service. She fired her guns {{for the last time}} on 28 June in celebration of the Coronation of Queen Victoria, and work began on dismantling her on 4 July. Kennedy delegated this task to Captain Sir John Hill, commander of [...] Her masts, stores and guns were all removed and her crew paid off, before Temeraire was put up for sale with twelve other ships. She was sold by Dutch auction on 16 August 1838 to John Beatson, a shipbreaker based at Rotherhithe for £5,530. Beatson was then faced with the task of transporting the ship 55 miles from Sheerness to Rotherhithe, the largest ship to have attempted this voyage. To accomplish this he hired two steam tugs from the Thames Steam Towing Company and employed a Rotherhithe pilot named William Scott and twenty five men to sail <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Thames, at a cost of £58.|$|E

[...] In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her [...] "if I chose to go their way". [...] Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs into a darkened room. [...] She told the court she [...] "saw nothing brought uphen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". [...] She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window {{at the north end of}} the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. [...] She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. [...] When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. [...] Canning was cross-examined by William Davy, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. [...] Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: [...] "Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [...] morning." [...] Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted [...] "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".|$|E

Why not just enjoy it?" [...] The Escapist noted that the character's behavior and sex appeal defined the character rather than serving as an extraneous aspect, stating [...] "Ivy's oversexed dominatrix demeanor perfectly compliments her confident, punishing move set." [...] UGO.com repeated the sentiment, noting in their [...] "Top 11 Girls of Gaming" [...] article [...] "Soul Calibur's mega-bombastic whip-wielding hottie isn't the only babe in the game, or even the best-endowed...but her combination of sultry moves and revealing outfits shoots <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> charts." [...] In an examination of feminist viewpoints regarding women in gaming, comedian and writer Liana Kerzner cited Ivy as an example of misperception of an empowered female character, noting that when compared to characters such as Wonder Woman the latter was considered a positive character for being [...] "empowered" [...] despite sharing similar exposing outfits and physical builds. She further went on to state that the character was interesting for having [...] "to fight her own flawed battle with no help from anyone", and that women passionate about gaming had more in common with the character: [...] "aggressive, intimidating, combative, and scrabbling through life by sheer will, armed with homemade weapons".|$|E
