He {{got his first}} break as a cinematographer in 1971 in the Malayalam film [...] Nellu. Ramu Kariat, the director of Nellu, was impressed by A View from the Fortress, Mahendra's diploma film at the FTII. Though the filming of Nellu began in 1971, production delays postponed its release for three years. Meanwhile, Kariat signed up Mahendra for another film titled Maaya which released in 1972. However, P. N. Menon's Panimudakku (1972) got released before Maaya, thus becoming Mahendra's first release. He continued to work in Malayalam films such as Sasthram Jayichu Manushyan Thottu (1973), Kaliyugam (1973) and Chattakari (1974).|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how the {{increasing}} labor supply of <b>fresh</b> <b>graduates</b> with modern IT (information technology) skills impacts {{the careers of}} incumbent workers during periods of fundamental technological change. To identify the causal effect within a difference-in-difference framework, we exploit a regulatory change in a mandatory German apprenticeship training regulation that obligated <b>fresh</b> <b>graduates</b> of a large manufacturing occupation to acquire modern IT skills. The paper shows that <b>fresh</b> <b>graduates</b> with modern IT skills crowd incumbent workers out of their jobs and occupations. As a result, even young incumbent workers, who lack modern IT skills, experience long-lasting earnings reductions. The earnings effects prevail for more than 20 years and incumbent workers {{are more likely to}} leave their occupation or to become unemployed...|$|R

30|$|Entrepreneurship is {{increasingly}} a viable solution for tackling {{the problem of}} unemployment in developing nations (Asaju et al., 2014). <b>Fresh</b> <b>graduates</b> in Nigeria are regarded as potential entrepreneurs, thus both government agencies and non-governmental organizations continually provide several entrepreneurial schemes for <b>fresh</b> <b>graduates.</b> However, according the Global Entrepreneurship Index (2017) published by the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute (GEDI), Nigeria has recorded a significant drop in global rankings of entrepreneurship within Sub-Saharan Africa from 4 th in 2016 to 12 th in 2017. With entrepreneurship being touted {{to be a viable}} solution to the problems of unemployment in Nigeria, this drop in entrepreneurship ranking poses a new challenge for <b>fresh</b> <b>graduates</b> within the country. It may therefore be inferred that there is either an increase in the rate of business failure or a stagnation/decline in the start-up of more business ventures in the country. While there are various external factors that may impede the start-up and success of business, it has been argued that, ceteris paribus, the innate entrepreneurial skills of nascent entrepreneurs are key factors that determine the growth and sustainability of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria (Osalor, 2016).|$|R

40|$|Entrepreneurship is {{becoming}} increasingly important in today’s world due to its effectiveness and applicability in a country’s economic development. In this regards, many developed and developing countries are investing maximum resources and efforts to promote entrepreneurship. To achieve the goal, policy makers {{as well as economic}} stakeholders are playing their roles in promoting entrepreneurship. This includes educational institutions emphasizing on motivating <b>fresh</b> <b>graduates</b> to choose entrepreneurship as their future career. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to highlight the factors that resist and encourage <b>fresh</b> <b>graduates</b> to choose and set up their own business. This paper categorises four factors namely demographic, motivational, challenges of obstacles and government support. This paper proposes that motivational factors such as family security, independence, intrinsic and extrinsic rewards influence fresh graduates’ decision to choose and set up a new business. With reference to challenges, this paper highlights that a lack of finance, complicated processes involved in setting up a business, high rate of taxes and duties, poor business infrastructure resist <b>fresh</b> <b>graduates</b> to dabble into entrepreneurial activities. This paper also points out that demographic factors like gender, previous experience and family background do influence fresh graduates’ decision to choose and set up a new business. In addition, this paper explains that government support in terms of providing business assistances like microfinance schemes, business-friendly system, low rate of taxes and duties. Easy business-related rules and regulations also encourage <b>fresh</b> <b>graduates</b> to choose and set up a new business. Finally, the paper proposes few propositions based on the previous literature and invites any researcher to empirically test them in order to further strengthen the entrepreneurship literature...|$|R
