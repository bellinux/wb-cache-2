40|$|We have {{fabricated}} several germanium immersion gratings by single crystal, {{single point}} diamond flycutting on an ultra-precision lathe. Use of a <b>dead</b> <b>sharp</b> tool produces groove corners less than 0. 1 micron in radius and consequently high diffraction efficiency. We measured first order efficiencies in immersion of over 80 % at 10. 6 micron wavelength. Wavefront error was low averaging 0. 06 wave rms (at 633 nm) across the full aperture. The grating spectral response {{was free of}} ghosts down to our detection limit of 1 part in 10 {sup 4 }. Scatter should be low based upon the surface roughness. Measurement of the spectral line profile of a CO{sub 2 } laser sets an upper bound on total integrated scatter of 0. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiological}} {{depiction of}} stab wounds in soft-tissues using multislice computed tomography {{is difficult and}} the hereby obtained images often lack contrast. To overcome these shortcomings we tried a new method. We gently instilled the contrast medium Lipiodol((R)) Ultra-fluide into five experimentally induced stab wounds on a pork haunch. Subsequent MSCT reconstructions of the wounds delivered clear, for medical laymen easily appreciable images regarding the stab direction and the stab depth. We believe that this easy and rapid technique {{can be useful in}} the examination of stab wounds in living and <b>dead</b> victims of <b>sharp</b> trauma...|$|R
60|$|It did {{not take}} me long to realize what my mustang was made of. His name was Foxie, which suited him well. He carried me at a fast pace {{on the trail of}} some one; and he seemed to know that by keeping in this trail part of the work of {{breaking}} through the brush was already done for him. Nevertheless, the <b>sharp</b> <b>dead</b> branches, more numerous in a cedar forest than elsewhere, struck and stung us as we passed. We climbed a ridge, and found the cedars thinning out into open patches. Then we faced a bare slope of sage and I saw Emett below on his big horse.|$|R
6000|$|Peter took a {{short cut}} across the Green Meadows. It took him past a certain tall, <b>dead</b> tree. A <b>sharp</b> cry of [...] "Kill-ee, kill-ee, kill-ee!" [...] caused Peter to look up {{just in time to}} see a trim, {{handsome}} bird whose body was about the size of Sammy Jay's but whose longer wings and longer tail made him look bigger. One glance was enough to tell Peter that this was a member of the Hawk family, the smallest of the family. It was Killy the Sparrow Hawk. He is too small for Peter to fear him, so now Peter was possessed of nothing more than a very lively curiosity, and sat up to watch.|$|R
60|$|I rose hastily, and was striding forward, when I {{distinctly}} {{noticed a}} covert movement {{somewhere near the}} middle of the carriage, and heard a low gurgle, which was instantly suppressed. I stopped <b>dead</b> at this <b>sharp</b> reminder that I was probably not the only curious person in the room, and for a long moment we both lay low, after which, I am glad to remember, I made the first advance. Earlier in the day I had arranged some likely articles on a side-table: my watch and chain, my bunch of keys, and two war-medals for plodding merit, and with a glance at these (as something to fall back upon), I stepped forward doggedly, looking (I fear now) a little like a professor of legerdemain. David was sitting up, and he immediately fixed his eyes on me.|$|R
500|$|Williamson {{subsequently}} {{ordered the}} US 1/503rd Battalion—under {{the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel John Tyler—to change the direction of its advance. During the morning the battalion had conducted platoon-sized patrols south, south-west and west, locating a well-constructed defensive position, including bunkers and trenches connected by tunnels. With no contact as yet made with the Viet Cong, the battalion prepared {{to move to a}} new AO in the north by 13:30. During this move the battalion, and armour from Troop D, US 16th Cavalry Regiment, engaged a dug-in Viet Cong Main Force company less than [...] west of the Australians. Following air-strikes and heavy artillery bombardment the communists withdrew, leaving 29 <b>dead</b> during a <b>sharp</b> engagement. The US 2/503rd Battalion had also sent out a number of squad-sized patrols during the day, but no recent signs of Viet Cong activity were found, and only minor sniper fire encountered. However, like the Australians, the American paratroopers also uncovered a large number of tunnels and other fortifications.|$|R
50|$|Eloko (pl, Biloko) {{is a term}} in a Mongo-Nkundo {{language}} {{referring to}} a kind of dwarf-like creature that lives in the forests. They are believed to be the spirits of ancestors of the people living there. Legend has it that they haunt the forest because they have some grudge to settle with the living and are generally quite vicious. Biloko live in the densest and darkest part of the rain forest in central Zaïre, jealously and ferociously guarding their treasures: the game and the rare fruits of the forest. Only intrepid hunters are said to enter the deepest forest and survive, because in order to be successful, hunters have to possess strong magic, without which they would never see any game at all. There are many tales about wives who insist upon joining their husbands in the forest only to faint as soon as they see their first Eloko. The Biloko live in hollow trees and are dressed only in leaves. They have no hair; only grass grows on their bodies; they have piercing eyes, snouts with mouths that can be opened wide enough to admit a human body, alive or <b>dead,</b> and long, <b>sharp</b> claws. They possess little bells, which, in Central Africa are believed to be able to cast a spell on passers-by. Possessing an amulet or a fetish can offer protection from this type of magic.|$|R
