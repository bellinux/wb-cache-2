5|$|The C5's {{users were}} an eclectic group. They {{included}} holiday camps who wanted C5s to rent to campers; the British Royal Family – Princes William and Harry each had one {{to drive around}} Kensington Palace before they {{were old enough to}} drive; Sir Elton John, who had two; the magician Paul Daniels, who bought a <b>demonstration</b> <b>model</b> he saw being driven around the BBC Television Centre car park; Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as The Times reported, some of the early buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.|$|E

25|$|One energy {{research}} project, however, was being considered quietly by two physicists, Alvin Trivelpiece and Evgeny Velikhov. The project involved collaboration {{on the next}} phase of magnetic fusion research — the construction of a <b>demonstration</b> <b>model.</b> At the time, magnetic fusion research was ongoing in Japan, Europe, the Soviet Union and the US. Velikhov and Trivelpiece believed that taking the next step in fusion research would be beyond the budget of any of the key nations and that collaboration would be useful internationally.|$|E
25|$|While the USSR {{provided}} most of {{the military}} aircraft to Chiang Kai-shek in the late 1930s, many early Chinese aircraft were supplied by the American Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. In 1937 the Hawk II and Hawk III biplanes comprised the backbone of Chinese fighter aviation. These were soon followed by the Hawk 75 monoplane. The <b>demonstration</b> <b>model</b> Hawk 75N, with non-retractable landing gear was purchased in 1938 and became the personal aircraft of the American advisor to the Aviation Committee, Claire Chennault who oversaw training and lobbied for the procurement of American aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In {{line with}} the {{convention}} for aircraft produced by de Havilland Canada being named after animals, {{it was decided that}} the new bush plane would be named after the beaver, which was known for its hard-working nature. On 16 August 1947, the maiden flight of the DHC-2 Beaver was in Downsview, Ontario; it was flown by Second World War flying ace Russell Bannock. After completing its flight test programme, the prototype received several adjustments and improvements in order for it to serve as a flying <b>demonstration</b> <b>model</b> ready for the sales circuit. The prototype was ultimately sold to Central British Columbia Airways, as a routine day-to-day working air-taxi airplane and continued to fly as such with various until 1980, after which it was retired and preserved. In April 1948, the first production aircraft was delivered to the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests, who had been a design partner.|$|E
2500|$|The depot {{facilitated}} the first testing of {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG) buses in 1992, when a dual-fueled CNG/Diesel bus was housed in the facility. The bus was fueled at the Brooklyn Union Gas Company facility in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. In November 1995, the NYCTA installed a fueling station (leased from Brooklyn Union) {{at the cost of}} $1.6 million for several Transportation Manufacturing Corporation (TMC) RTS-06 CNG <b>demonstration</b> <b>model</b> buses. The depot was fully equipped with CNG on June 7, 1999, with the original [...] "slow-fill" [...] fueling station replaced with a [...] "fast-fill" [...] station.

50|$|Though Pieter Teyler van der Hulst was {{a patron}} {{of the arts and}} sciences, he was {{not a member of the}} Natuur- en Sterrekundig Collegie, a science society in Haarlem that was founded in the Patientiestraat in 1775. The {{popularity}} of the study of science and the ideals of the Dutch enlightenment were such that after his death however, when Martin van Marum joined the young Teylers Stichting, this proved quickly to become the emphasis of the society in the years to come. Teylers Museum was not alone. The society Oefening door Wetenschappen was also started in Haarlem in 1798 and lasted until 1892. It was Haarlem's reputation for the study of science that attracted Van Marum to settle there. When he became director of the collection of the Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen in 1778 and later, also of Teylers in 1784, he used the funds of both institutions to purchase expensive instruments and even whole scientific collections from personal estates. He started before he even worked there with a proposal to build his large elektriseermachine that forms the center attraction of the instrument room. Van Marum was not only the curator of the cabinet, he gave public laboratorium lectures from 1777-1803 on physics and geology. The number of <b>demonstration</b> <b>models</b> in the collection is directly related to his and his successors' need for <b>demonstration</b> <b>models</b> in Teylers lectures. Van Marum collected 350 <b>demonstration</b> <b>models</b> and set a precedent as lecturer-demonstrator for curators who came after him. Today there are over a thousand in the collection altogether.|$|R

50|$|This is an {{extremely}} simple motor, such that <b>demonstration</b> <b>models</b> may be easily constructed for teaching purposes. As a practical motor it has several disadvantages. Magnetic field strength drops off rapidly with increasing distance.

Vibration is also an issue.|$|R
