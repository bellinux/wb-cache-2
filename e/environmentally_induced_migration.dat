40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} {{environmental}} migrants occurs {{frequently in the}} policy debate, in particular with regard to climate change and the incidence of such migration in low-income countries. This article reviews the economic studies of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration.</b> It includes recent empirical analyses that try to link environmental change to migration flows and the spatial distribution of population.

40|$|<b>Environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> farmer <b>migration</b> is an {{important}} livelihood strategy, yet little is known of the effects on the destination region agroecosystem information networks and management practices. In the forest-savanna transition zone (Brong Ahafo Region) of Ghana, where migration from northern regions (migrant) and from neighboring regions (settler) is active, we chart the role of migrant famers {{and the type of}} agroecosystem management practices embedded in information networks using a social networks approach. Based on empirical network data from 44 respondents across three communities, we illustrate a diffuse information network, with variable tie frequency between settlement categories (local, settler, or migrant) of farmers. The cohesion of this network is dependent on a few strategic bridging ties initiated by migrant farmers, who are thus centrally positioned to exchange agroecosystem management practices between geographically and socially distant groups. At the individual level, migrant and settler farmers are more likely: (1) to have larger networks with more ties between members of their networks, (2) to be brokers positioned between non-migrant farmers, and (3) to tend (although not statistically significantly) to use pro-environmental management regimes, including agroforestry practices, new planting methods, and plot-scale weeding. We conceptualize this phenomenon as extended social and environmental experience and the deployment of social-ecological memory, with migrant farmers as potential agents of innovation and adaptive management...|$|R

The aim is to delve into locally held understandings of the phenomenon and {{to gain a better understanding}} of these migration processes, which are actively intertwined with local experiences. Both Indian and Bangladeshi experts were interviewed using semi-structured, in-depth interviews in order to explore insights from locally held perceptions and understandings of contextual factors. In total, 10 Bangladeshi and 15 Indian experts were interviewed, covering different disciplines, sectors, regions and job types, together providing a more complete and grounded picture of views of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> in Bangladesh and India. The results show that climate change is perceived by local experts as one of the key factors influencing migration in Bangladesh, both internally and externally.

40|$|LLM (Environmental Law and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 <b>Environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> {{has been}} a {{contentious}} topic {{over the last two}} decades. Estimates show that over 30 million people worldwide are annually forced to migrate due to serious environmental degradation, natural disasters and depletion of natural resources. Thus the environment is irrefutably changing, and clear linkages can be drawn between environmental change and human mobility. Africa‘s developing status and its vulnerability in the context of environmental shocks compels research on prospective impacts and outcomes in order to develop proper mitigation and adaptation strategies, especially in Southern African Development Community (SADC) where the likelihood of protection measures being successfully implemented is relatively low. This dissertation is aimed at providing the reader with a detailed analysis of the regional normative framework regulating the issue of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> in SADC. Because environmental migrants are not considered to be ―refugees‖ in international law and on account of the fact that many policy makers and practitioners have their reservations as regards even acknowledging the existence of environmental migrants, protection and regulation in this regard is understandably lacking. A comprehensive framework is nonetheless required to regulate this phenomenon as it prompts serious security and sovereignty concerns. Until quite recently, most African countries had not even put in place national migration policies. Although many states have policies in place now, most have not yet been fully and effectively implemented. The normative framework governing specifically <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> in SADC similarly renders rather disappointing results. Most of the applicable instruments do not directly raise the issue and the provisions indirectly touching upon the subject matter are subject to interpretation. A binding protocol must therefore be adopted by SADC Member States embracing elements contained in the instruments comprising the current framework. Such a protocol will however have to be liberal enough to acknowledge and provide for <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> in its entirety whilst conservative enough so as not to undermine protection regimes for refugees in the true sense of the word. Conflicting interests and sovereignty considerations will, however, undoubtedly continue to hinder progress in this regard. The way forward is therefore away from ultimate sovereignty preservation and toward a regionalised approach where human rights no longer take a backseat. Master...|$|E

A considerable number of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced,</b> cancer-related p 53 mutations in human tumors have been found in a highly conserved proline-rich sequence of the p 53 protein encompassed by amino acid residues 147 - 158. Using conformational energy analysis based on ECEPP (Empirical Conformational Energy for Peptides Program), we have determined the low-energy three-dimensional structures for this dodecapeptide sequence for the human wild-type p 53 protein and three <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced,</b> cancer-related mutant p 53 proteins with His- 151, Ser- 152, and Val- 154, respectively. The results suggest that the wild-type sequence adopts a well-defined low-energy conformation and that the mutant peptides adopt well-defined conformations that are distinctly different from the conformation of the wild-type peptide. These results are consistent with experimental conformational studies demonstrating altered detectability of antigenic epitopes in wild-type and mutant p 53 proteins.

40|$|CC and CXC {{chemokine}} receptor signalling {{networks are}} regulated in different ways. Here {{we show that}} intracellular calcium release and cell migration occur independent of Gβγ activation in response to CCL 3, whereas CXCL 11 <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> of activated T-lymphocytes depends on Gβγ activation. Treatment {{of a range of}} cell types with gallein, a pharmacological inhibitor of Gβγ signalling, did not result in a reduction in CCL 3 <b>induced</b> cellular <b>migration,</b> but resulted in enhanced calcium mobilisation following chemokine stimulation. Inhibition of PI 3 kinase (PI 3 K) and AKT, which are activated downstream of Gβγ, equally had no effect on calcium release and a minor effect on cell migration. Similarly, inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 did not prevent CCL 3 <b>induced</b> <b>migration.</b> Interestingly, Gβγ as well as PI 3 K activation is necessary for CXCL 11 <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> of activated T-cells. These data not only confirm a role for Gβγ signalling in CXCL 11 <b>induced</b> <b>migration,</b> but also demonstrate that targeting Gβγ as a therapeutic target to prevent migration in inflammatory disease may not be beneficial, at least not for CCL 3 <b>induced</b> <b>migration.</b> This highlights the distinct differences in the mechanisms on how CC- and CXC-receptors activate cellular migration.

40|$|The {{physical}} presence of historic villages and habitats on the Indus Delta is observed {{to be under}} threat due to environmental changes and permanent disasters. The delta of River Indus has distinct social, economical and environmental features {{as compared to the}} rest of the coast of Pakistan. The delta population, being the lower riparian of the River Indus, receives a limited flow of fresh water. This is causing environmental degradation and negatively impacting traditional livelihoods, survival and resilience patterns in the presence of high levels of social inequality. Climate and environmental changes over time are deemed as a root cause of the rise of sea level which is leading to a loss of land, rendering it unusable for cultivation, increase in salinity, depletion of mangrove forests and a decline in fish catch. This paper is an outcome of field visits to the Indus delta's inland and the island villages in Kharo Chan in particular.

40|$|Claims {{that climate}} change will shape the future of global {{migration}} are continuously being made in academia as well as popular and policy circles. This paper questions the empirical basis for such claims, drawing on a critical review of 13 case studies of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> in the Sahel and the wider migration and development literature. It highlights some of the conceptual and methodological flaws that recur {{in many of these}} studies. First, their terminology is often confused, with concepts such as environment and climate, change and variability being conflated. Second, some do not acknowledge the extreme climate variability and unstable environments that are the norm for many Sahelian people; in this context, mobility can be a successful coping mechanism, potentially reducing environmental stress. Third, the paper criticises the use of static push-pull frameworks which suggest that migrants are being 'pushed out' of marginal and degraded environments, neglecting the intertwined environmental, political, economic and cultural factors. Fourth, the paper highlights flaws in the sampling and questionnaires used, particularly in some of the more recent studies. In conclusion, the paper calls for more open research that explores the complex inter-relationship between environmental factors and mobility rather than starting from the assumption of a simplistic causal relationship...|$|E

40|$|In the West African Sahel, the {{majority}} of the population depends on subsistence farming and livestock breeding and is thus particularly vulnerable to climatic changes. One possible response to natural hazards is migration. Recent research suggests that environmentally induced mobility is closely linked to the social vulnerability and adaptive capacity of individuals and groups. However, only little attention has been paid thus far to the role of formal education in this context. Our objective was to fill this gap by examining the role of formal education in <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> as one characteristic of social vulnerability to environmental change. Our analysis focuses on two regions in the West African Sahel, Bandiagara in Mali and Linguère in Senegal, that are presumed to be particularly affected by climate change and environmental degradation. Our results reveal that formal education plays an important role in reducing vulnerability to environmental stress because people with a higher level of education are usually less dependent on environmentally sensitive economic activities such as farming. Moreover, an agricultural economic activity can be an obstacle to a high level of formal education. We found no significant effect of people's education on the migration experience as such. However, motives for migration differ considerably depending on the amount of education received, suggesting that migration constitutes a livelihood strategy, particularly for the lower educated...|$|E
40|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} the numbers of migrants generated by changes in climate have commonly been calculated by projecting physical climate changes on an exposed population. These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the response of an individual to variations in climate. However, empirical evidence of <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> does not support such a structural approach and recognises that migration decisions are usually both multi-causal and shaped through individual agency. As such, agent-based modelling offers a robust method to simulate the autonomous decision making process relating to environmental migration. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provides a basis {{that can be used}} to effectively break down the reasoning process relating to the development of a behavioural intention. By developing an agent-based model of environmental migration for Burkina Faso from the basis of a combination of such theoretical developments and data analysis we further investigate the role of the environment in the decision to migrate using scenarios of future demographic, economic, social, political, and climate change in a dryland context. We find that in terms of climate change, it can be seen that that change to a drier environment produces the largest total and international migration fluxes when combined with changes to inclusive and connected social and political governance. While the lowest international migration flows are produced under a wetter climate with exclusive and diverse governance scenarios. In summary this paper illustrates how agent-based models incorporating the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be used to project evidence based future changes in migration in response to future demographic, economic social and climate change...|$|E
40|$|Migration—environment {{linkages}} are at {{the centre}} of media attention because of public concern about climate change and a perceived "flooding" of migrants from less developed countries into more affluent parts of the world. In the past few years, a substantial body of conceptual literature about <b>environmentally</b> <b>induced</b> <b>migration</b> has evolved, {{but there is still}} a paucity of empirical work in this area. Moreover, the environmental causes of migration have been studied largely in isolation of the environmental consequences. In this paper we present an analysis of migration and vegetation dynamics for one country (Ghana) to assess four migration—environment linkages. On the one hand, we look at two environmental drivers of migration: environmental push and pull. On the other hand, we look at the environmental impact of migration on source and destination areas. Census data at the district level (N= 110) are used to map domestic migration flows in Ghana, which are then related to vegetation dynamics retrieved from a remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset (1981 — 2006). The analysis shows that at the national level, there are significant but weak correlations between migration and vegetation cover and trends therein. Districts with a migration deficit (more out-migration than in-migration) tend to be more sparsely vegetated and have experienced a more positive NDVI trend over the past quarter century than districts with a migration surplus. A disaggregation of data in three principle migration systems shows stronger correlations. Namely that north—south migration and cocoa frontier settlement have important environmental dimensions, but environmental factors do not seem {{to play a major role}} in migration to the capital, Accra. An important insight from this paper is that migration flows in Ghana can be explained partly by vegetation dynamics but are also strongly related to rural population densities. This is because access to natural resources is often more important than the scarcity or abundance of natural resources per se. This study further shows that satellite remote sensing can provide valuable input to analyses of migration—environment linkages...|$|E
