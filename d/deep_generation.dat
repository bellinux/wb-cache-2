(<b>Deep</b> <b>generation</b> involves reasoning about conceptual and rhetorical facts, as opposed to the narrowly linguistic reasoning that takes place during realization.)

It is shown that contradictions between survival and self-expressionpolitical values often lead to political crises. The Arabic Spring is proved to have been a consequence of a <b>deep</b> <b>generation</b> crisis. Dangerous consequences of cultural and civilization crisis within globalization are underlined. The influence of illegal migration, extremism and intolerance on axiological crises is considered. A special attention is paid to modernization possibilities of high school within axiological crisis. The necessity of reforming of high school in order to avoid negative consequences of axiological crises is underlined. International experience in high school reforms is analyzed.

A biophotonics approach {{based on the}} nonlinear optical process of second harmonic generation is presented and demonstrated on malignant human cell lines labelled by harmonic nanoparticles. The method enables independent imaging and therapeutic action, selecting each modality by simply tuning the excitation laser wavelength from infrared to visible.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general, self-contained treatment of convexity or intersection cuts. It describes two equivalent ways of generating a cut | via a convex set or a concave function | and {{a notion of}} strongest cuts. We characterize {{the structure of the}} sets and functions that generate strongest cuts. We then specialize the framework to the case of 0 - 1 mixed-integer linear programming (MIP). For this case, we formulate two kinds of the <b>deepest</b> cut <b>generation</b> problem, via sets or via functions. We then consider some special cases of the <b>deepest</b> cut <b>generation</b> problem which are amenable to ecient computation. We conclude with computational tests of one of these procedures on a large set of MIPLIB problems...|$|R
40|$|A Chinese {{generation}} module in {{a speech}} to speech dialogue translation system is presented here. The input of the generation module is the underspecified semantic representation. Its design is strongly influenced by the underspecification of the inputs and the necessity of real-time and robust processing. We design an efficient generation system comprising a task-oriented microplanner and a general surface realization module for Chinese. The microplanner performs the lexical and syntactic choice and makes inferences from the input and domain knowledge. The output of the microplanner is fully instantiated. This enables the surface realizer to traverse the input in a top-down, depth-first fashion, which in turn speeds the whole generation procedure. The surface realizer also combines the template method and <b>deep</b> <b>generation</b> technology in the same formalism. Preliminary results are also presented in this paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|Interlingua-based machine {{translation}} {{is an important}} approach to implement multi-lingual speech-to-speech (S 2 S) translation. The natural language generation (NLG) {{is one of the}} key components in the interlingua-based {{machine translation}} systems. This paper introduces our approach to Chinese generation based on the Interchange Format (IF) developed by the C-STAR organization. In our approach, the hybrid method of feature-based <b>deep</b> <b>generation</b> method and template-based method are employed. The deep generator ensures that the generation component possesses the merits of flexibility and domain portability. The template-based generator makes the system more efficient. We also introduce another simplified Chinese generator applied in specific domain. The experimented results show that our approach is effective and practical for the natural language generation in the Interchange-Format (IF) based S 2 S translation system. 1...|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>deep</b> <b>{{generation}}</b> with statistical-based {{surface generation}} merits from response utterances readily available from corpus. Representation {{and quality of}} the instance data are the foremost factors that affect classification accuracy of the statistical-based method. Thus, in classification task, any irrelevant or unreliable tagging of response classes represented will result in low accuracy. This study focused on improving dialogue act classification of a user utterance into a response class by clustering the semantic and pragmatic features extracted from each user utterance. A Decision tree approach is used to classify 64 mixed-initiative, transaction dialogue corpus in theater domain. The experiment shows that by using clustering technique in pre-processing stage for re-tagging response classes, the Decision tree is able to achieve 97. 5 % recognition accuracy in classification, better than the 81. 95 % recognition accuracy when using Decision tree alone...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that people use both embodied perceptual simulations and linguistic distributional knowledge during conceptual processing, with linguistic information especially useful for shallow tasks and rapid responding. Using two conceptual combination tasks, we show that this linguistic shortcut is evident in both shallow and deep conceptual processing of novel stimuli. Specifically, in both shallow sensibility judgement and <b>deep</b> interpretation <b>generation</b> tasks, people use the linguistic shortcut as a “quick and dirty ” guide to whether the concepts are likely to combine in a coherent situated simulation. Linguistic distributional frequency predicts both the likelihood and timecourse of rejecting a novel word compound as nonsensical or uninterpretable. However, it only predicts the timecourse of successful processing in shallow sensibility judgement because <b>deeper</b> interpretation <b>generation</b> requires conceptual processing in the simulation system...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on connection between attitude toward music of parents and their children. The goal of the thesis was a questionnaire survey on the sample of adolescent population and their parents, analysis of results and evaluation of hypotheses. 123 pupils of secondary school, 94 fathers and 120 mothers took part in research. Pupils and their parents filled in the questionnaires that were subsequently conjugated and analyzed concerning the connections between them. Hypotheses supposed significant parents' influence toward their children in selfassessment of musical skills, parents' musical experience affecting children musical education and finaly indirect effect of parents on children's musical preferences. Findings of research indicate stronger alliance between mothers' musical attitudes and attitudes of children. In spite of common perception, which supposes <b>deep</b> <b>generation</b> gap between {{children and their parents}} in the field of music, research results indicate, that parents and children often accept their favourite music respectivelly, or at least they know it. However, it is impossible to assert, that children simply copy music attitudes of their parents.
