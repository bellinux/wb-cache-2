When Abaoji first established the system, these two governments did not have strict territorial boundaries, but Emperor Shizong established formally <b>delineated</b> boundaries for the two administrations early in his reign. The newly <b>delineated</b> Northern Administration had large Chinese, Balhae, and Uighur populations, and was given its own set of parallel northern and southern governments.|$|E
5|$|In {{explaining}} {{this separation}} of species, Rasmussen points to morphological divergence and {{significant differences in}} vocalization. Ornithologist Edward C.

5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the Western High Plateau, although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been <b>delineated</b> by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, Jack Souther {{produced}} {{a synthesis of}} volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera and <b>delineated</b> several Neogene to Quaternary volcanic belts throughout British Columbia. One of these was the linear Anahim Volcanic Belt, which included the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field at its eastern end. However, its origin {{had not yet been}} understood. In 1979, two volcano tectonic models had been proposed by Jack Souther, Mary Bevier and Richard Armstrong. This included a hotspot and a propagating crack controlled by stress fields related to large-scale plate tectonics of western North America.|$|E

5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first <b>delineated</b> by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Southard {{returned}} to Boston State Hospital and it was reorganized. He was relieved of his directorship at Boston Psychopathic and named director of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Institute, a unit of Boston Psychopathic. Free of his previous hospital administration duties, Southard was able to concentrate on research. Southard <b>delineated</b> several priorities for his scientific work and writing. He hoped to publish four books; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919. The second book, on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for psychiatric hospitals. The third would report on the expansion of psychiatric social work, and the final work (a requirement for his academic post) would be an overview of neuropathology.|$|E
5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are <b>delineated</b> in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines {{the areas in which}} severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent {{world in which}} players can {{interact with each other}} and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly <b>delineated</b> by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server and the client computer and players are recommended to choose a server in their region. Regardless of server or language, the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players who speak different languages to communicate.|$|E

40|$|A key {{component}} of scientific inquiry, especially inquiry devoted to developing mechanistic explanations, is <b>delineating</b> the phenomenon to be explained. The task of <b>delineating</b> phenomena, however, has not been sufficiently analyzed, even by the new mechanistic philosophers of science. We contend that Marr’s characterization {{of what he called}} the computational level (CL) provides a valuable resource for understanding what is involved in <b>delineating</b> phenomena. Unfortunately, the distinctive feature of Marr’s computational level, his dual emphasis on both what is computed and why it is computed, has not been appreciated in philosophical discussions of Marr. Accordingly we offer a distinctive account of CL. This then allows us to develop two important points about <b>delineating</b> phenomena. First, the accounts of phenomena that figure in explanatory practice are typically not qualitative but precise, formal or mathematical, representations. Second, <b>delineating</b> phenomena requires consideration of the demands the environment places on the mechanism—identifying, as Marr put it, the basis of the computed function in the world. As valuable as Marr’s account of CL is in characterizing phenomena, we contend that ultimately he did not go far enough. Determining the relevant demands of the environment on the mechanism often requires detailed empirical investigation. Moreover, often phenomena are reconstituted in the course of inquiry on the mechanism itself...|$|R
5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly <b>delineated</b> the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these player versus environment (PvE) challenges, two forms of player versus player (PvP) combat exist in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. The first type, the Wolves' Den, is an arena featuring structured four-versus-four battles; players may queue into a battle with up to three teammates to challenge another four-person team. The second type, Frontlines, is a large battleground instance in which players form teams of up to 24 characters. Teams are <b>delineated</b> by players' allegiance {{to one of three}} Grand Companies and the team which reaches the target number of points first wins the match. Four modes are available with differing locations and rulesets, such as King of the Hill, capture the flag, and team deathmatch. Within the fiction, Frontlines is presented as an organized set of military exercises between the three nations with the ulterior goal of jockeying for dominance of regions rich in magical artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} cathedral are so specifically detailed and the elements of Gothic and contemporary architecture so well <b>delineated,</b> that art and architecture historians have concluded that van Eyck must have had enough architectural knowledge to make nuanced distinctions. More so, given the finesse of the descriptions, many scholars have tried to link the painting with a particular building. Yet, and as with all buildings in van Eyck's work, the structure is imagined and probably an idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect architectural space. This is evident {{from a number of}} features that would be unlikely in a contemporary church, such as the placing of a round arched triforium above a pointed colonnade.|$|E
