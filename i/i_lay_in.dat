25|$|E: As <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors {{tell my parents}} {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Gaga {{released}} {{a preview of}} [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] prior to her performance of September 1, 2013 at the iTunes Festival in London. In the video, she sings [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> bed I touch myself and I think of you". The video then shows Gaga rehearsing for the festival and displays in pink font, [...] "We wanna give you #sexdreams'". Gaga also promoted the song on social media by posting song lyrics ("Last night damn, you were in my #SexDreams doing really nasty things"), and encouraging use of a hashtag containing lyrics (#whenilayinbeditouchmyselfandthinkofyou).|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the group harmonising [...] "Sha la la la" [...] over pianos. The lyrics are about puppy love, as they yearningly sing [...] "Last night <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> bed so blue / Cause' I {{realized}} the truth/ They can't love me like you / I tried to find somebody new / Baby they ain't got a clue/ Can't love me like you." [...] Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line [...] "They try to romance me but you got that nasty and that's what I want" [...] as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line [...] "He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar" [...] does not fool listeners into thinking that [...] "they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500." [...] Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles.|$|E

2500|$|I was to {{have dinner}} that night with [...] Cadogan. As <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> my bath, I {{reflected}} that the last time I had seen him {{had been in his}} room at the Foreign Office when I had handed him my letter of resignation from the Diplomatic Service. [...] It seemed a long time ago. [...] Looking back on the few but crowded years between, it occurred to me forcibly how fortunate I had been in my decision and how lucky not to miss the experiences which had fallen to my lot in the intervening space of time. To me, it was not disagreeable to look forward to a future of uncertainty and insecurity, with none of the slow inevitability of a career in the Government service; to feel myself, in however small a way, the master of my destiny. With my left foot I turned the hot-water tap full on and wallowed contentedly.|$|E

[...] The Midrash read the words, [...] "then He whose house it is shall come," [...] in [...] to allude to God, about Whom [...] says, [...] "Because of My house that lies waste." [...] The Midrash read the words, [...] "and He shall tell the priest," [...] in [...] to allude to Jeremiah, who [...] identified as a priest.

[...] The Midrash read the words, [...] "and he shall break down the house," [...] in [...] to allude to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who [...] reports destroyed the Temple. The Midrash read the words, [...] "and they shall pour out the dust that they have scraped off outside the city," [...] in [...] to allude to the Israelites taken away to the Babylonian Captivity, whom [...] reports Nebuchadnezzar [...] "carried ... away into Babylon." [...] And the Midrash read the words, [...] "and they shall take other stones, {{and put them in the}} place of those stones," [...] in [...] to allude to the Israelites who would come to restore Israel, and of whom [...] reports God saying, [...] "Behold, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> Zion for a foundation stone, a tried stone, a costly corner-stone of sure foundation; he that believes shall not make haste." ...|$|E
