5|$|At {{this point}} Díaz {{tried to come}} to terms with Madero, {{particularly}} after the capture of Cuautla by the Zapatistas in south-central Mexico. Together with his finance minister and main advisor, José Yves Limantour, Díaz planned to make concessions to the fairly moderate Madero and, once Madero was pacified, crack <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> more radical elements among the rebels. A truce was agreed to on April 23.|$|E
5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Van Nistelrooy was {{immediately}} confronted by Arsenal players Martin Keown, Lauren, Ray Parlour, Ashley Cole and Kolo Touré. Keown jumped {{up next to}} Van Nistelrooy and brought his arms <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dutchman's back, while Lauren pushed Van Nistelrooy {{in the back and}} Parlour and Cole offered verbal abuse. Van Nistelrooy did not react and was escorted away by Manchester United captain Roy Keane, but the incident escalated away from the two of them. In defence of their teammate, Manchester United players Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gary Neville, Mikaël Silvestre, Quinton Fortune and Rio Ferdinand also became involved in the situation.|$|E
5|$|ZAPU members {{attempted}} to bomb or burn down {{the houses of}} blacks who joined or supported white-led political parties, {{as well as the}} churches they attended. Rival nationalists also used violence against each other as they jostled for prominence. In an attempt to restore confidence in the government and end the political intimidation, Smith cracked <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> militant nationalists, arresting political agitators in the townships for criminal offences and jailing ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo in Gonakudzingwa Restriction Camp, a remote detention unit in the country's south-east. The British government, worried that Southern Rhodesia might issue a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) rather than continue with negotiations, placed troops in Aden on alert.|$|E
50|$|The Committee to Protect Journalists {{expressed}} concern about the deterioration of press freedom in lead up to the election. Reporters without Borders also placed Egypt in the bottom 35 of 175 countries regarding press freedom. While, local journalists said the government has cracked <b>down</b> <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> press.|$|R

5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a quilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E
5|$|One of the Smith government's first actions was {{to crack}} <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> black {{nationalist}} political violence that had erupted following {{the establishment of}} a second black nationalist organisation, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), by disgruntled ZAPU members in Tanzania in August 1963. The rival movements were split tribally, ZAPU being mostly Ndebele and ZANU predominantly Shona, and politically—ZAPU, which had relabelled itself the People's Caretaker Council (PCC) within Southern Rhodesia to circumvent its ban, was Marxist–Leninist and backed by the Warsaw Pact and its allies, while ZANU had aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by communist China. Their respective supporters in the black townships clashed constantly, also targeting non-aligned blacks whom they hoped to recruit, and sporadically attacked whites, businesses and police stations.|$|E
5|$|The city {{authorities}} {{proceeded to}} punish severely {{the leaders of}} the Huttwil League. Bern did not accept the terms of the peace of Melligen with its amnesty, claiming the treaty was invalid on its territory, and cracked <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rural population. The peasants were fined large sums and were made to cover the expenses for the military operations. The peace of the Murifeld was declared null and void by the Bernese city council, as was the Huttwil League. The rural population was disarmed. Many of the exponents of the movement were incarcerated, tortured, and finally sentenced to death or to hard labour on galleys, or exiled. Christian Schybi was executed at Sursee on July 9, 1653. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered at Bern on September 6, 1653; his head was nailed at the gallows together with one of the four copies of the Bundesbrief of the Huttwil League. Punishment was hardest in the canton of Bern, where 23 death sentences were handed down and numerous other prominent peasants were executed in courts-martial by von Erlach's army, compared to eight and seven death sentences in Lucerne and Basel, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly {{the most important factor}} in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push <b>the</b> cars' tyres <b>down</b> <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|R
50|$|Since the Islamic Revolution, {{however, the}} institutionalization of Islamic Sharia law has come <b>down</b> {{especially}} <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Assemblies of God because of their unique success in converting Muslims to Christianity. This success is due principally to its principle of using the vernacular Persian language as the language of its prayer {{and not one of}} the several ancient languages (i.e., Syriac, Armenian) used for prayer by the other Christian groups.|$|R
5|$|While Noriega {{was out of}} the country, Díaz Herrera {{considered}} {{using the}} uproar around Spadafora to seize power, but despite mobilizing some troops, eventually decided against following through with the coup, realizing he could not count on sufficient support. Furthermore, Noriega had made a deal with his deputy, to the effect that he would step down as military leader in 1987 and allow Díaz Herrera to succeed him. In 1987, however, Noriega went back on this agreement, announced he would be heading the military for the next five years, and assigned Herrera to a diplomatic post. Díaz Herrera retaliated by making public statements accusing Noriega of rigging the 1984 election, murdering Spadafora, and of trafficking in drugs, as well as of assassinating Torrijo with a bomb on his plane. These statements provoked huge protests against Noriega, with 100,000 people, approximately 25% of the population of Panama City, marching in protest on June 26, 1987. Noriega charged Herrera with treason, and cracked <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protesters. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution asking Noriega to step down until Herrera could be tried; in response Noriega sent government workers to protest outside the U.S. embassy, a protest which quickly turned into a riot. As a result, the U.S. suspended all military assistance to Panama, and the CIA stopped paying Noriega a salary. The Senate resolution had the effect of identifying the U.S. with the effort to remove Noriega; Noriega exploited the rising anti-American sentiment to strengthen his own position. Without the support of the U.S., Panama defaulted on its international debt, and that year the country's economy shrunk by 20%. However, though the U.S. considered not recognizing the new president, the state department decided not to do so, as that would amount to breaking relations with Noriega.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the Jellaz Incident, the French {{authorities}} imposed martial law on Tunis for almost a decade. Within months however, popular discontent manifested itself in the Tunis Tram Boycott. In response the authorities clamped <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Young Tunisian movement several of whose leaders were exiled from the country. After this the movement, which had generally sought to work for the advancement of Tunisia in collaboration with France, became disillusioned with this approach. When the leaders returned form exile, they took a different political approach and founded the Destour party in 1920.|$|E
25|$|Originally a {{bodyguard}} of Charles V of Spain, {{he was sent}} to Mexico to counterbalance the influence of the leader of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hernán Cortés, since the King worried he was becoming too powerful. As Governor of Pánuco, Guzmán cracked <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> supporters of Cortés, stripping him and his supporters of property and rights. He conducted numerous expeditions of conquest into the northwestern areas of Mexico, enslaving thousands of Indians and shipping them to the Caribbean colonies. In the resulting power struggles where he also made himself an enemy of important churchmen, Guzmán came out the loser.|$|E

Tegumai's spear was made of wood with shark's teeth at the end, and before he had caught any fish at all he accidentally broke it clean across by jabbing it <b>down</b> too <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the river. They were miles and miles from home (of course they had their lunch with them in a little bag), and Tegumai had {{forgotten}} to bring any extra spears.|$|R
50|$|In this episode, Trevor appears {{repeatedly}} {{to treat the}} spinal injuries of Sybil, who was shot during an attempted border crossing. (Her lover, Onan, succeeded.) Trevor provides Sybil {{with a box of}} ampoules (which are inserted into the gap in her spine, allowing her to function normally). Trevor also repeatedly sexually stimulates Sybil by manipulating the nerves in her spinal column at the location of the aforementioned gap. At one point, Trevor mentions that he lets Æon bomb a factory, implying that he uses her terrorist actions as justification for cracking <b>down</b> even <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> populace.|$|R
25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, {{took them to the}} ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E
500|$|Khalid bin Ahmed {{became the}} Royal Court Minister in 1999. In a 2007 leaked Wikileaks cable, the U.S. {{ambassador}} noted that King Hamad [...] " [...] little to reign in Shaikh Khalid" [...] and instead {{allowed him to}} [...] "call the shots" [...] and [...] "crack <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> demonstrators". It also named Khalid as [...] "one of the key hard-liners". The same cable quoted Mansoor al-Jamri, the editor-in-chief of Al-Wasat newspaper, as calling Khalid the [...] "de facto PM". Michael Field mentioned that Khalid was very powerful and [...] "control access to the King".|$|E

5000|$|Other {{methods of}} soring include {{pressure}} shoes, where the hoof is trimmed {{to the quick}} so that the sole is {{in direct contact with}} the pad or shoe. The horse may then be [...] "road foundered", ridden up and <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> surfaces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> over-trimmed hooves, until they are very sore. Trainers sometimes place objects, such as metal beads, nails, or screws, under the pad, causing intense pressure, although this practice has begun to decrease with the use of fluoroscopy to detect such methods. Abusive use of chains (such as using them with chemical soring agents) is also a common practice.|$|R
5000|$|Indlamu (...) is a {{traditional}} Zulu dance from South Africa where the dancer lifts one foot {{over his head and}} brings it <b>down</b> <b>hard,</b> landing squarely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> downbeat.

2500|$|After the {{sanctions}} were announced, CBSSports.com's Gregg Doyel {{wrote that the}} severity of the punishments handed down to Williams, Payton and Loomis proved that Goodell was truly sincere in his desire to [...] "take the thuggishness out of the NFL." [...] Doyel also said that while many players had chafed at what they saw as Goodell's heavy-handed approach to discipline, he was actually standing up for their safety in the Saints' case. Pereira, now an analyst for Fox Sports, wrote that based on his experience in the league office, he wasn't surprised that Goodell came <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saints. He recalled that Goodell was always upset when officials didn't penalize hits on defenseless players.|$|E
2500|$|The Shimabara Rebellion, {{led by a}} young Christian {{man named}} Amakusa Shirō Tokisada, took place against the shogunate in 1637. The {{rebellion}} broke out over economic desperation and government oppression but later assumed a religious tone. [...] About 27,000 people joined the uprising, but it was crushed by the shogunate after a sustained campaign. The reigning shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, who had issued the Sakoku Edict, restricting trade and effectively isolating Japan, two years earlier, came <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Christians. Many Japanese were deported to Macau or to the Spanish Philippines. Many Macanese and Japanese Mestizos are the mixed-race descendants of the deported Japanese Catholics. 400 were officially deported {{by the government to}} Macau and Manila, but thousands of Japanese were pressured into moving voluntarily. About 10,000 Macanese and 3,000 Japanese were moved to Manila.|$|E
2500|$|The Economic Journal {{predicts a}} rout {{as a result}} of growing {{alienation}} and disaffection with the system and with traditional politics. It criticised the means the government employed to deal with the problem, and said that: [...] " [...] legitimacy to govern has been deeply damaged. Officials may be made scapegoats for the mass protests, and the police may have forfeited much of their hard-earned reputation and sound relationship with citizens following charges of brutality and links with triads. The judiciary has also taken a beating after it issued injunctions against the occupation of roads in Mong Kok and Admiralty. This has left many people with the perception that it has colluded with the government and the checks and balances between the two powers are now gone. The government's ill-conceived plan to crack <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protesters under the guise of assisting bailiffs sets a dangerous precedent." ...|$|E
5000|$|The eclipsing of {{manufacturing}} and manufacturing goods by knowledge-production and information-processing {{as the primary}} economic activity. This was significantly expanded <b>on</b> in <b>the</b> sequel Powershift, where Toffler nearly drew {{the line between the}} two along gender lines, coining the term [...] "Material-Ismo" [...] (a play on [...] "machismo") to represent the infatuation with the industrial era world {{of manufacturing}} (as opposed to paper-pushing), and equating value with product (as opposed equating value with information). The criticism came <b>down</b> particularly <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> former Stalinist societies, that have in recent years seen a substantial dislocation, particularly along gender lines, with female life expectancy now as much as 10 years greater than male life expectancy throughout the former USSR.|$|R

25|$|As {{the strike}} entered its fourth week, the police cracked <b>down</b> even <b>harder</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wobblies. The Los Angeles {{headquarters}} of the KKK handed out a pamphlet to local citizens to get more supports and help the police force break up the strike. Members of the Ku Klux Klan, with or without their hoods regularly came to the San Pedro docks to be a force of intimidation. The latter began to look <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dispute as a free-speech fight and continued to hold meetings near the water front at a point known as Liberty Hill, a privately owned parcel of land used {{with the permission of}} the owner. Local sympathizers and members of the American Civil Liberties Union joined the IWW leaders in seeking to maintain rights of free speech. They included such prominent Los Angeles and Pasadena figures as Upton Sinclair.|$|R
2500|$|Australian quadruple Olympic {{gold medal}} winning swimmer Dawn Fraser called for Australia {{to boycott the}} games event, citing fears of a tragedy similar to that which {{unfolded}} in the Munich Olympics of 1972. Fraser pronounced that reports of missed construction deadlines and other irregularities in games planning meant Indian authorities' [...] "word for providing security {{should not be taken}} at its face value." [...] However, the Australian Commonwealth Games Organising Committee was quick to dismiss Fraser's fears with ACGA chief executive, Perry Crosswhite saying he believed there will be no security issues during the games event. John Coates, Australia's Olympic chief, came <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> organisers, alleging teams were being forced to temporary accommodation at hotels. [...] "I don't think it is a cultural thing. When you agree to host , you are required to provide the basics in terms of health and hygiene for the athletes.

2500|$|Weather {{conditions}} were deteriorating during Flight 2605's instrument approach. A 5:00 weather report indicated visibility of 2-3 nautical miles depending on direction; by 6:00 AM, visibility {{was described as}} [...] "zero". [...] Flight 2605 was on short final to the closed runway at 5:42 AM. Cockpit voice recording audio of the last seconds of the flight indicated that the first officer and captain agreed that they were cleared for 23R (not the runway they were still on approach to). The captain further stated {{that they were in}} fact (still) on the approach to 23L. [...] The crew decided to abort the landing at this point. [...] The flight's first officer began to describe the ILS approach's missed approach procedure, a climb to 8,500 feet, in a [...] "nonurgent, perfunctory manner".

2500|$|Perhaps {{a darker}} example of campus lore is the infamous Death League, a student {{organization}} whose members—mostly upperclassmen—were dedicated to making life miserable for freshmen. They often used the justification {{that it was}} discipline or {{that they were trying}} to [...] "make men out of boys." [...] They wore white robes and masks modeled after the Ku Klux Klan when they performed organization rites of passage. Favorite disciplinary tricks were brutal paddlings or lashing a victim to a tombstone in the cemetery and making him preach for two hours. Earlier in its history, many upperclassmen and several faculty members approved of the Death League because they saw it as serving a necessary function. Eventually, President Keister came <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> organization after a particularly bad beating took place. The result was that the Death League was officially abolished and its hazing activities forbidden. It has since faded into the past as a distant memory. [...] The Quittapahilla 1918 has the last picture of the current Death League on page 212. [...] The Quittapahilla 1919 makes mention of the Death League.|$|E

50|$|The {{animal was}} {{extremely}} robust with powerfully built jaws and very strong fore limbs. It possessed retractable claws, a unique trait among marsupials. This {{would have allowed}} the claws to remain sharp by protecting them from being worn <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>hard</b> surfaces. <b>The</b> claws were well-suited to securing prey and for climbing trees. The first digits ("thumbs") on each hand were semiopposable and bore an enlarged claw. Palaeontologists believe {{this would have been}} used to grapple its intended prey, as well as providing it with a sure footing on tree trunks and branches. The hind feet had four functional toes, the first digit being much reduced in size, but possessing a roughened pad similar to that of possums, which may have assisted with climbing. It is unclear whether the marsupial lion exhibited syndactyly (fused second and third toes) like other diprotodonts.|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} an electronic lexical resource for German {{and the structure}} of its lexicon entries, notably the structure of verbal single-word and multi-word entries. The verb as the center of the sentence structure, as held by dependency models, is also a basic principle of the JAKOB narrative analysis application, for which the dictionary is the background. Different linguistic layers are combined for construing lexicon entries with a rich set of syntactic and semantic properties, suited to represent the syntactic and semantic behavior of verbal expressions (verb patterns), extracted from transcripts of real discourse, thereby lexicalizing the specific meaning of a specific verb pattern in a specific context. Verb patterns are built by the lexicographer by using a parser analyzing the input of a test clause and generating a machine-readable property string with syntactic characteristics and propositions for semantic characteristics grounded in an ontology. As an example, the German idiomatic expression an den Karren fahren (to come <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> somebody) demonstrates <b>the</b> overall structure of a dictionary entry. The goal is to build unique dictionary entries (verb patterns) with reference to the whole of their properties...|$|R
