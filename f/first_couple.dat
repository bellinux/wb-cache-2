50|$|The C V had a four-cylinder de Glehn {{compound}} engine. Its low-pressure cylinders were external, {{operating on}} the second coupled axle, and were located between the bogie and the <b>first</b> <b>coupled</b> axle. The high-pressure cylinders were internal and worked the <b>first</b> <b>coupled</b> axle. The engines still lacked a superheater. In terms of its power (160 tons at top speed), the C V could only {{be used for a}} few years in heavy express train services. As early as 1903 the locomotives were relegated to secondary duties, but even there they did not stay long.|$|R

Such symptoms do gradually lessen over time, eventually disappearing altogether.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of years, Phillips made music {{compilation}} discs {{for local}} businesses {{such as the}} local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, children playing an instrument, or even a neighbour’s dog howling along to piano accompaniment. As the record shop and studio took over the business, he had a brass plate made which he put on the wall just outside the front door, and had labels made for the discs, but changed {{the design of the}} disc label every year. By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle.|$|E

5|$|Having {{performed}} in parlor theatricals as a child, from 1916 Simonovich-Efimova began staging puppet shows for fellow artists. The plays were so well received {{that she and}} her husband were invited to create a children's puppet theater by the Russian authorities in 1918, becoming two of the first professional puppeteers in Russia. She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work by publishing books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She and her husband are known as the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft. They performed over 1,500 shows throughout Russia between 1920 and 1940, moving from place to place with their traveling puppet theater.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September, the {{squadron}} began flying missions to escort B-24 Liberator bombers. The Japanese had 200 aircraft at Kahili Airfield and Balalae Island, opposed by only 50 aircraft from the U.S. squadrons in the area. The <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of missions that {{the squadron}} undertook were relatively quiet but, on 16 September, VMF-214 {{was attacked by}} a group of 35 Japanese A6M Zeros. The squadron repelled the strike, destroying 11 Japanese aircraft for the loss of only one of their own. Several costly engagements with the strong Japanese forces in the area followed. Bolt did not score any victories during this time, but was promoted to first lieutenant that month.|$|E
5|$|The EMS {{command post}} {{was set up}} almost {{immediately}} following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle {{a large number of}} patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> hours following the bombing.|$|E

5|$|The last {{building}} constructed at Fort Yellowstone was the chapel, {{located just}} south of the original guardhouse. Army policy did not mandate that army forts provide places of worship. However, at the insistence of park superintendent Pitcher, U.S. Commissioner Meldrum and Wyoming state senator Francis E. Warren, Congress appropriated the funds {{for the construction of a}} chapel in 1909 and the building was finished in January 1913. On September 19, 1914, Katharine Piercy Edmunds and Captain Albert Ady King, 1st U.S. Cavalry, were the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> to be married in the new chapel. Reverend Pritchard, an Episcopalian missionary, traveled to the fort from Emigrant, Montana to perform the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Well {{established}} in the imperial capital, Honório Hermeto campaigned in 1829 to become a general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national lower house) as a representative for his native Minas Gerais. He was elected to {{a seat in the}} legislature for the term beginning April 1830. He {{became a member of the}} Liberal Party, which stood in opposition to PedroI and his policies. As a general deputy, Honório Hermeto had an unobtrusive role for the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of years, having been overshadowed by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, the leader of the deputies representing Minas Gerais. Short, slim and with a speech impediment, the dark-haired Honório Hermeto appeared an unimpressive figure at first glance. Like his father, he was headstrong, opinionated and often scathing. However, he had self-confidence and a powerful charisma, and was energetic, intelligent, perspicacious and a natural born leader.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television and Gene Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and {{was the sort of}} place where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On the advice of a cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of Fighting Chance, a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.|$|E

5|$|Even in the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> {{of years}} of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with {{the theme of the}} press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally {{as much to do with}} the arrival in Romania, at the time of the Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Christopher {{was part}} of an optimistic 1945 Athletics team, so much so that coach Earle Mack felt that Christopher, Black, Newsom and Jesse Flores were the best quartet of starting pitchers in the league. He spent most of spring training holding out for a new contract, which was eventually agreed on in the middle of March. He missed the <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> weeks of the season due to injury, and won his season debut on April 18, a 12-inning shutout against the Senators. He followed that up with a victory over the Boston Red Sox, allowing only one earned run in his first 21 innings of the season. In mid-June, Christopher had won ten games, which not only led the league, but was more than the seven the rest of the Athletics pitching staff had combined. On July 21, Christopher {{was part of}} a 24-inning game against the Tigers that ended in a 1–1 tie; he went 13 innings in the game while Joe Berry pitched the other 11. Although Christopher had a strong start to the season, he struggled during the second half. He lost seven straight games over a two-month period before winning another on August 19 against the Tigers. He finished the year with a 13–13 record and a 3.17 ERA. He was selected to the American League All-Star team, however the game was canceled as a result of World War II.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded with}} their first {{extended}} period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqué. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Touré kicked at thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59thminute – despite appearing to be level with the last defender – Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward stepped over the ball several times {{in an attempt to}} wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to slide the ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing a few moments later, but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqué, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had a two-cylinder {{compound engine}} with a Walschaerts valve gear and Lindner starting system (Anfahrvorrichtung). The engine drove the <b>first</b> <b>coupled</b> axle. The front twin-axled bogie had an axle base of 2,150 mm and side play of 39 mm.|$|R
