All five appeared in his 2007 film The Mist, along with Thomas Jane, who originally was set to star in the series when it was pitched to HBO. Jane was later in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series as of fall 2010, but with Darabont's departure, it is unknown whether the guest spot will happen or not. Laurie Holden also appeared in the 2001 film The Majestic (as Adele Stanton, Jim Carrey's character's love interest), which Darabont directed. DeMunn has also appeared in several of Darabont's films; in addition to The Mist and The Majestic, he appeared in The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999).

500|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] was {{directed}} by Ernest Dickerson and co-written by Scott M. Gimple and showrunner Glen Mazzara. The storyline between Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh reaches a climax in [...] "18 Miles Out", {{in which the two}} men get into a heated argument, ultimately engaging in a physical confrontation. Gimple conceived and wrote the scene into the episode's script. In the fight scene, the moves were choreographed. Dickerson collaborated with Lonnie Smith, Jr. who served as the stunt coordinator. Smith cast two stuntmen to demonstrate and act out the scene for Lincoln and Bernthal so they could duplicate the choreography. Jeremy Connors portrayed Rick, while Trent Bry played the role of Shane. In the fight sequence, Shane topples a motorcycle onto Rick's legs, temporarily immobilizing him. The motorcycle weighed an estimated 800 pounds; in order to decrease the weight of the vehicle, Dickerson and his team emptied the gas tank. This was rehearsed at the series' production studios. Scalan Backus, The Walking <b>Deads</b> special effects technician, rigged the vehicle's footpeg to prevent it from sliding and making contact with the actors' legs. Backus also added a rod with a secure stable so it would give further clearance to the actors and increase the motorcycle's height from the ground. The cameramen filmed the shots at an angle, creating the illusion that the vehicle did hit the actors' legs. Writer Robert Kirkman summated on the aftermath of the confrontation: ...|$|E

Sandow himself figures little in Dismal Light, the main character being his son, who is delaying his escape from an unstable star system in order to force his distant father to come in and ask him personally.

2500|$|The {{same year}} Day of the Dead premiered, Night of the Living Dead co-writer John Russo {{released}} a film titled The Return of the Living Dead that offers an alternate continuity {{to the original}} film than Dawn of the Dead. Russo's film spawned four sequels. Return of the Living Dead sparked a legal battle with Romero, who believed Russo marketed his film in direct competition with Day of the Dead as a sequel to the original film. In the case Dawn Associates v. Links, Romero accused Russo of [...] "appropriat part of {{the title of the}} prior work", plagiarizing Dawn of the <b>Deads</b> advertising slogan ("When there is no more room in hell [...] the dead will walk the earth"), and copying stills from the original 1968 film. Romero was ultimately granted a restraining order that forced Russo to cease his advertising campaign. Russo, however, was allowed to retain his title.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to these complaints, Valve marketer Doug Lombardi stated that the announcement of Left 4 Dead 2 at E3 {{should not be taken}} to indicate that Valve would no longer support the first game. He asked the community to [...] "trust [...] a little bit," [...] and told them that while their team was eager to get new material to players of Left 4 Dead, they determined that a sequel would be the best option for several reasons: the demand for new campaigns, enemies and weapons could not be met as a simple DLC; both Faliszek and project lead Tom Leonard found that too much of the content relied on each other, making it very difficult to release incremental patches in the same style as Team Fortress 2; the development team liked the idea of rolling up the content into a sequel to be released a year after Left 4 <b>Deads</b> release. Faliszek stated that Newell was skeptical of the idea when the team brought the sequel forward, but still allowed the project to go through.|$|E
2500|$|A {{subsequent}} licensing {{deal with}} Warner Bros. Entertainment brought the studio {{the rights to}} develop games based on Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead and Bill Willingham's Fables comics. The first endeavor completed was the 2012 The Walking Dead video game, which had the same episodic nature as the studio's earlier games but was built more on developing characters and story over traditional puzzle elements. The game required the player to make significant game-changing decisions including the death of non-playable characters, sometimes {{with only a few}} seconds to deliberate which option to select through quick time events. Choices made would create determinants that would carry through the remaining episodes and into subsequent seasons, allowing players to come to feel as if the story they are presented was more personal due to the choices they made. The game was praised critically for its emotional story and use of the adventure genre, as well as designed its release around a timed episodic schedule. The Walking Dead was considered very successful, and one of the biggest surprises for the video game industry in 2012, and a [...] "refresh" [...] of the adventure game genre; Ron Gilbert noted that The Walking <b>Deads</b> approach to appear to the mass market can make adventure games as relevant as other genres to larger publishers. Following The Walking Dead, Telltale secures further deals to produce additional seasons of The Walking Dead, and seasons based on the A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones book series, and the Borderlands and Minecraft video games, among other deals. Telltale's episodic and deterministic narrative model has also been used by other developers, including Life Is Strange and Dreamfall Chapters.|$|E
