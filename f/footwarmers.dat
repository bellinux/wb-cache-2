5000|$|Myers {{was born}} in Germantown, Pennsylvania. [...] He began his {{professional}} career in the American South, gaining his nickname [...] "Serious" [...] for his love of classical music. [...] He played drums with Bessie Smith in the mid-1920s, and also played guitar and banjo professionally. He first played bass with King Oliver, then with the Bechet-Ladnier New Orleans <b>Footwarmers.</b> In the 1930s he played in Europe in the bands of Django Reinhardt, Lucky Millinder, and Willie Lewis. On his return he played in New York City and Philadelphia with Sidney Bechet and Mezz Mezzrow, as well as leading his own band and contributing arrangements. [...] One of his key recordings, as bassist and vocalist, was [...] "Preachin' Blues", first recorded with Bechet's New Orleans <b>Footwarmers</b> in 1940, and described as a precursor of rhythm and blues music. [...] He also worked with the Spirits of Rhythm in the 1930s and 1940s, and in the latter decade played with Jimmy Dorsey, Bob Mosley, Tiger Haynes, Rex Stewart, and {{for a short time}} with Duke Ellington.|$|E

Other tasks included spring manufacture, construction of stainless steel <b>footwarmers,</b> and assembly of pantographs for electric trains, with a staff of 720 employed during 1966. By the 1980s refurbishment work was also being carried out on Melbourne suburban electric multiple units.|$|E

40|$|An office {{equipped}} with personal <b>footwarmers</b> was maintained at cooler-than-normal indoor {{temperatures in the}} winter, producing great energy savings.   The occupants’ thermal comfort was not affected.   The <b>footwarmers</b> provide individual heating control over {{a segment of the}} body that most strongly influences comfort perception when one is cool overall.   If cooler ambient indoor temperatures could be made comfortable, savings in central heating energy would be possible.   During a six-month winter period in Berkeley California, knowledge workers with low-energy <b>footwarmers</b> experienced a lowering of room heating set point from 21. 1 ºC (70 ºF) to 18. 9 ºC (66 ºF). Surveys showed equal thermal comfort in the original ‘higher heating setpoint no-footwarmer’ condition and the ‘lower heating set point plus occupant-controllable footwarmer’ condition.  Heating energy was closely monitored throughout.   It dropped 38 % to 75 % depending on the setpoint reduction and outdoor conditions. The added plug load energy from the low-energy <b>footwarmers</b> was much less than the central heating energy saved by lowering the heating set point (3 - 21 W vs 500 - 700 W average power per occupant during occupied hours).  A few subjects had ergonomic issues with the particular <b>footwarmers</b> used, so usage was not universal.   Additional foot- and leg-warmer design options would help...|$|E
40|$|Personal comfort systems provide comfort by {{targeting}} heating or cooling {{to important}} parts of the human body, making tight ambient temperature control less important. This paper provides evidence that comfort is possible under cooler-than-normal ambient temperatures when occupants have personal control over a very local thermal condition—the warmth of their feet. During a six-month winter period in Berkeley California, office workers were given low-energy adjustable <b>footwarmers</b> and the room heating set point was gradually lowered from 21. 1 C (70 F) to 18. 9 C (66 F). Occupant surveys showed statistically equivalent thermal comfort for the original ‘higher heating setpoint no-footwarmer’ condition and the ‘lower heating set point plus occupant-controllable footwarmer’ condition. The overall reduction in heating energy varied between 38 % and 75 % depending on the setpoint reduction and outdoor conditions. The added plug load energy from the low-energy <b>footwarmers</b> was substantially less than the heating energy saved by lowering the heating set point (11 - 21 W vs 500 - 700 W average power per occupant during occupied hours).  A few subjects had ergonomic issues with the particular <b>footwarmers</b> used, so usage was not universal.   Additional designs or options will be needed in future applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{have reached}} a point in which {{lowering}} building energy consumption and thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions is an ecological imperative. Rethinking how we mechanically condition our buildings is an important means for substantially lowering building energy consumption. Rather than using large amounts of energy for space heating and cooling to condition the full volume of interior air to be within a narrow temperature range, people can be comfortable with a wider room temperature range {{as long as they}} have personalized control over local conditioning, which is similar to task- ambient lighting design already well understood in theory and practice. This field study tested low-energy <b>footwarmers</b> as one way in which occupants can personally control their own thermal environment. During a six month winter period, participants in an office in Berkeley, California, were given a low-energy footwarmer with an easily accessible knob for adjusting the heat provided by the footwarmer to their desired level. The room heating set point was gradually lowered from 70 F to 66 F. The building management system and independent data acquisition recorded data from which the energy consumption data of the mechanical system and the individual plug loads of each workstation could be determined. Three times per day, participants took an online survey about their thermal comfort. The results show that the added plug load from the low-energy <b>footwarmers</b> was substantially less than the heating energy saved by lowering the heating set point. There was a 38 - 75 % overall reduction in heating energy, which depended on the setpoint and outdoor conditions. Occupant surveys showed equivalent thermal comfort ratings when comparing the existing conditions to when people had the footwarmer and a lower heating set point. From low-cost retrofits of sealed VAV offices to the design of new buildings, low- energy personal thermal control systems can effectively provide thermal comfort when set points are expanded. Rethinking the fundamentals of set points can lead to scalable impact in reducing building energy consumption and ultimately in lowering our ecological footprint...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} reconstructs, wherever possible, {{the interior}} of the Cape house between 1670 and 1714 from the evidence preserved in surviving inventories and vendu rolls located in the Cape Archives. Chapter I examines those inventories which contribute something to our knowledge of the architecture of the period. Chapter II reconstructs certain features of doors, windows, fireplaces etc., from clues in the inventories and vendu rolls. Chapter III considers the way the different rooms in a cape house were furnished, and relates this to the developments in interior organisation and design that were taking place in seventeenth-century Europe in general and the Hague in particular. Chapter IV examines beds, window curtains, seat furniture, footstools, <b>footwarmers</b> and screens. Chapter V examines tables, carpets, chests, coffers, cupboards, cabinets, writing boxes, cellarets, mirrors, pictures, and wall racks. Chapter VI deals with lighting equipment, aids to cleanliness, basketware, skins, leatherware and cooperage. Chapter VII examines the various items devoted to eating and drinking. Chapter VIII covers the domestic pursuits: smoking, reading, writing, sewing, knitting, spinning, music, indoor games, clocks, watches, scientific instruments, weapons and domestic pets. The Conclusion attempts to place the domestic world at the Cape in the context of contemporary Dutch culture. Comparisons are drawn between the Cape and other Dutch societies, and particularly between the Cape inventories and those of the Hague and New York, in order to pinpoint those qualities and features which are unique to the Cape house and the people who lived in it.
