5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E

25|$|In March 2016, Blizzard {{announced}} {{that they would be}} releasing comics and animated shorts based on Overwatch in 2016. The related media included plans for a graphic novel called Overwatch: First Strike, which would have focused on the story of several in-game characters including Soldier: 76, Torbjörn, Reaper, and Reinhardt. The novel was to be penned by writer Micky Neilson and artist Ludo Lullabi. Blizzard opted to cancel First Strike in November 2016, with Chu stating that since the announcement of the graphic novel, Overwatchs narrative development has <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> somewhat different direction, changing out these origin stories would work. Blizzard still plans to reveal more of the characters' backstory in time.|$|E

500|$|Released in July 1992, Countdown to Extinction {{entered the}} Billboard 200 chart at number two and was {{certified}} double platinum in the United States.

It received a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, and its title track won a Genesis Award from the Humane Society in 1993 for raising awareness for animal rights issues. Ellefson later {{said that he and}} Friedman were disappointed that Megadeth did not win the Grammy: [...] "It was such a bizarre moment, because {{it was as if the}} amount of work it had taken to ramp up to that hopeful night was literally <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second." ...|$|E
500|$|Original [...] "Tribbles" [...] creator David Gerrold was {{contacted}} by The New York Times, {{who wanted to}} interview him about the anniversary and the rumored [...] "tribbles" [...] episode. When he questioned Berman about the episode, Berman initially denied it. [...] Gerrold responded that he didn't want to embarrass anyone, but {{would like to be}} able to endorse the project. [...] Berman asked what the endorsement would cost, to which Gerrold requested public acknowledgement of his work and to be cast as an extra in the episode. [...] Berman agreed. Gerrold compared inserting new footage into an existing episode to Back to the Future Part II (1989) and later said that he would have <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different direction had he written the story. [...] Nonetheless, he felt the final product ended up being better than anything he would have created.|$|E

500|$|When McKinley {{heard that}} Bryan {{was likely to}} be the nominee, he called the report [...] "rot" [...] and hung up the phone. The Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination, stating his view that the silver {{sentiment}} would be <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> month. When McKinley and his advisers, such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna, realized that the views were more than transitory, they began intensive fundraising from corporations and the wealthy. The money went for speakers, pamphlets, and other means of conveying their [...] "sound money" [...] campaign to the voter. With far less money than McKinley, Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then-unprecedented scale. [...] McKinley on the other hand, opted for a front porch campaign. Both men spoke to {{hundreds of thousands of people}} from their chosen venues.|$|E
500|$|... "The Only Exception" [...] was {{released}} {{as the third}} single from the band's 2009 studio album Brand New Eyes in February 2010. It was noticed by music critics that, Paramore, who usually write and record darker material, mainly of the alternative genre, had, musically, <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different direction with [...] "The Only Exception". Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "a subtle, Radiohead-esque ballad." [...] The song's lyrics pertain to the protagonist not believing that love exists and trying to live without it, mainly to avoid rejection, but eventually realizing that it does exist, describing the person as being their [...] "only exception". Many fans believe that the song was written as an ode to Chad Gilbert from New Found Glory. Incidentally, Williams has declined to comment directly on the issue, merely saying, [...] "Read a couple blogs, and you'll figure it out." ...|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV News {{called the}} video [...] "jaw-dropping". Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly {{commented that the}} video was similar to visuals by Lady Gaga and Madonna, further noting that Aguilera [...] "did indeed seem desperate" [...] in the [...] "unoriginal" [...] clip, saying that [...] "maybe she should have <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> totally {{different}} direction to avoid comparisons". On behalf of Rolling Stone, Daniel Kreps stated that [...] "Aguilera assumes no less than a dozen different guises, all scantily clad, ranging from carbon copies of Lady Gaga (borrowing heavily from her unique wardrobe), Madonna, Beyoncé, Gwen Stefani, the girls from Robert Palmer's [...] "Simply Irresistible" [...] video and Michelle Pfeiffer's S Catwoman from Batman Returns. Despite the video's attempt to shock, it's unlikely Aguilera will ever out-Gaga Gaga or out-controversy Madonna. ... Hopefully next time she steps {{in front of the}} lens she'll be more herself and less like everyone else". NME ranked the [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] music video at number 8 on its list of the [...] "50 Worst Music Videos Ever".|$|E

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night. Hall, who was having personal worship time during the drive, recounts that he wondered [...] "Who am I to think I can just call up to God whenever I want, from the middle of nowhere, and expect Him to hear me?" [...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand that my life is a vapor, and me being able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me". [...] "Who Am I" [...] was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman. It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Larry Jordan. When Carey and Boyz II Men got together to record [...] "One Sweet Day", {{they did not have}} enough time to re-unite and film a video. Instead, a filming crew was present during the song's recording, and filmed bits of Carey and Boyz recording the song. Walter Afanasieff later told Fred Bronson that shooting the video was [...] "crazy", stating [...] "They had film crews and video guys, while I'm at the board trying to produce. And these guys were running around having a ball, because Mariah and them are laughing and screaming and they're being interviewed. And I'm tapping people on the shoulder. 'We've got to get to the microphone!' They're <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> couple of hours, so I recorded everything they did, praying that it was enough." [...] After the song's release, Carey expressed her content with the video. that she was happy a real music video was never filmed, fearing that no video could truly capture the song's [...] "precious message". Critics agreed, feeling that the song was a perfect match for the video and its message. Aside from the recording sessions, the video also shared bits of Carey and Boyz bonding and sharing their ideas in the studio, where Carey felt they [...] "bonded".|$|E
500|$|Lindelof {{stated that}} [...] "When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. [...] And {{the way we}} tell stories will be {{different}} too", and confirmed that the [...] "whooshing sound" [...] effect {{will continue to be}} used as the transition for the new storytelling device. [...] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. [...] They've <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.|$|E

He said that [...] "many people ask us if we like the direction they have gone in but it is so alien to what we created it is pointless to answer now. We understand that some people love the Soul Reaver series and we think that is great. However, it is not what we would ever have done". In a 2008 interview, he elaborated his sentiment that [...] "if you look at Legacy of Kain where it is right now -- so diluted, so dysfunctional -- as a property itself, it's pretty much <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> completely different direction than we would have ever taken it. [...] Even if the developer's good, and I think Crystal Dynamics is not a bad developer, you get this dilution of the content, because the original author is gone".|$|E
