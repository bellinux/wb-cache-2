5|$|Clive Campbell was {{the first}} of six {{children}} born to Keith and Nettie Campbell in Kingston, Jamaica. While growing up, he saw and <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> systems of neighborhood parties called dance halls, and the accompanying speech of their DJs, known as toasting. He emigrated with his family at the age of 12 to The Bronx, New York City in November 1967, where they lived at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are <b>heard.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sound</b> may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Abu-Jamal did {{not make}} any public {{statements}} about Faulkner's murder until May 2001. In his version of events, he claimed that {{he was sitting in}} his cab across the street when he heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, and <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of gunshots. Upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, Abu-Jamal ran to him from the parking lot and was shot by a police officer. Abu-Jamal's brother William Cook, who had been stopped by the police officer, did not testify or make any statement until April 29, 2001. At that time {{he said that he had}} not seen who had shot Faulkner.|$|E
60|$|As D'Arnot {{watched the}} spot where the body had entered <b>the</b> tree he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of {{movement}} there.|$|R
60|$|Another day passed quietly, {{and then}} {{during the night}} <b>the</b> watch <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of blows with axes, and of falling trees.|$|R
60|$|Saluting, he too {{passed away}} into the dark, and {{presently}} I <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of spear-blades striking together and of rifles being cocked.|$|R
5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|Just after midday, the 21st Panzer Division {{received}} {{permission to}} attack the landings. Luck ordered the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment, east of the River Orne, towards the bridges. The column was quickly spotted, and engaged {{for the next two}} hours by Allied artillery and aircraft causing heavy losses. The 1st Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment and the 100th Panzer Regiment, attacking from west of the canal, had more success reaching the beaches between the British landing area of Sword and the Canadian Juno. At 13:30, the men at the bridges <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of bagpipes, played by Bill Millin of the 1st Commando Brigade. As the commandos arrived, they crossed the bridges and joined the rest of 6th Airborne Division defending the eastern perimeter. Some of the tanks accompanying the commandos moved into Bénouville to reinforce its defences, while others crossed the bridges with the commandos. At 15:00, a boat loaded with German infantry approached from Caen. It was engaged with the anti-tank gun manned by number One Platoon, hit in the stern by the second round fired and then retreated back toward Caen.|$|E
5|$|Zieten {{then decided}} to pull back his forces towards the village of Fromentières. There, Zieten was joined by Generals Kleist and Kapsevitch, who, having <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the guns, had begun to move their {{respective}} Army Corps in that direction, coming from Champaubert. The French also moved forward, with Marmont's two divisions (Lagrange and Ricard) in pursuit of Zieten, {{along the road to}} Fromentières. Marmont was now supported on his left by General Grouchy, who had just arrived on the field of battle with the divisions of Saint-Germain and Doumerc, moving past the village of Janvilliers, in order to cut off Zieten's retreat. Further French reinforcements were now available, this time on Marmont's right: the division of Leval, who had been steadily moving up the valley of the Petit Morin river, in a bid to outflank the Prussians. With the French Imperial Guard artillery now also deployed and firing at them, Zieten's Prussians drew back in good order, and formed in squares to fend off Grouchy's cavalry. Towards 2 o'clock in the afternoon, after assessing the situation, Blücher realised that he was facing Napoleon himself and thus decided to immediately withdraw. He ordered all of his forces to retreat through Champaubert and directed a part of his artillery to safety, towards Étoges.|$|E

60|$|Leaving the stateroom {{they were}} in, {{they went out}} on deck and began to untie the houseboat. While they were doing so they <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of two horses approaching.|$|R
6000|$|Marguerite and Armand, {{clinging}} to one another, {{not knowing what}} to think, nor yet what to fear, <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> mingling with those immediately round them, and Marguerite murmured under her breath: ...|$|R
25|$|Heat {{lightning}} is {{a lightning}} flash {{that appears to}} produce no discernible thunder because it occurs too far away for the thunder to be <b>heard.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sound</b> waves dissipate {{before they reach the}} observer.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu was {{in charge}} of music arrangement. Some of the pieces he {{arranged}} became widespread. He once <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a cowbell ringing and thought of using cowbells as an instrument to fine tune musical pieces.|$|E
25|$|George {{would wake}} up {{to the sound of the}} front door slamming. He would race downstairs to find the dog {{sleeping}} soundly at the front door. Nobody else <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> although it was loud enough to wake the house.|$|E
60|$|As {{he moved}} {{cautiously}} along {{the stone floor}} the loud barking of the little black dog, kept by the watchman, told that his sharp ears had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of his steps.|$|R
60|$|Goro {{was nearly}} gone when <b>the</b> apes <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of <b>the</b> {{approach}} {{through the trees}} of the two they awaited, and presently Tarzan, followed by Taug, swung into a nearby tree.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll fire a shot, anyway," [...] said Tom at last, {{and aimed}} in the {{direction}} where they had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> last. To his intense surprise a yelp and a snarl followed.|$|R

25|$|On 11 February 1858, Soubirous {{went with}} her sisters Toinette and Jeanne Abadie to collect some {{firewood}} and bones in order to buy some bread. After taking off her shoes and stockings to wade through the water near the Grotto of Massabielle, she said she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of two gusts of wind (coups de vent) but the trees and bushes nearby did not move. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move.|$|E
25|$|Murray met no {{resistance}} at Whalers Gate, {{but as he}} approached Waireka he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of rapid firing towards the coast. He entrenched his men and opened fire on the Kaipopo pā with a rocket tube. The gunfire Murray heard was being exchanged between about 200 Māori warriors—who, armed mostly with double-barrel shotguns and some rifles, were firing from the cover of bush and flax in the river gully—and the militia and Volunteers, who had retreated {{to the safety of}} the farmhouse of settler John Jury. Most of the battle took place on the flat farm land below the pa.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{so long to}} be able to talk to you again; all {{the others}} come and visit me, but I have only <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of your {{footsteps}} as you pass by." ...|$|R
60|$|At a {{distance}} <b>the</b> young soldier <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of footsteps, and he rightfully surmised that Barringford was continuing his journey forward, {{with the rest}} of the rangers. Soon <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> died away and all became as silent as the grave.|$|R
60|$|Half an hour afterward, {{with a big}} {{plate of}} moose-steak before him and a big mug of coffee at his lips, Smoke half-started up from his seat. He had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> first. Lucy threw open the door.|$|R
25|$|Infuriated {{that his}} orders were being defied and a golden {{opportunity}} was being lost, Bragg issued new orders for Hindman to attack early September 11. Cleburne, who was not sick as Hill had claimed, cleared the felled timber from Dug Gap and prepared to advance when he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of Hindman's guns. By this time, however, Baird's division had reached Negley's, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position {{just east of the}} crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman's men skirmished with Baird's rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. Time passed {{with no sign}} of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith {{suggested}} that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} during August and September, Sadie and Wyatt may have become friends and perhaps more seriously involved. Writer Alan Barra {{suggests}} that Behan and Earp knew of their mutual attraction to the same woman before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which {{may have contributed to}} their animosity. Josephine is quoted in I Married Wyatt Earp as saying that on October 26, 1881, the day of the shootout at the O.K. Corral, she was at her home when she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of gunfire. Running into town {{in the direction of the}} shots, Josephine was relieved to see that Wyatt was uninjured.|$|E
60|$|A {{sound of}} {{footsteps}} broke the hush. They {{could see a}} figure on the path below. It stopped, seemed to consider, vanished. They <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of groping hands, of a creaking door, of uncertain feet on the stairs.|$|R
60|$|As {{the girl}} turned to bid them good night, {{she thought that}} she saw a shadowy form moving in the {{darkness}} beyond them, and almost simultaneously she was sure that she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of stealthy movement in the same direction.|$|R
6000|$|Presently, {{through the}} open door of <b>the</b> smoking-room, we <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of {{energetic}} splashings, mingled with the inarticulate groans of the miserable Gumbo. Moore could not sit still, but kept pacing the room, smoking fiercely. Presently Peter came to the door-- ...|$|R
25|$|Despite Sheridan's later {{criticism}} of Warren for moving slowly and his removal of Warren from command the next day, when {{at the end}} of the Battle of White Oak Road Warren <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division to reinforce Sheridan intending that Bartlett attack Pickett's flank. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since it was dark when Bartlett's men reach Gravelly Run, they did not try to cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire. The dark night hid the size of Bartlett's force from close scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|At {{approximately}} 11:40 (09:40 UTC), Auvinen {{entered the}} school's ground-floor main hallway at Jokela High School, having missed his first lesson. He encountered {{a student in}} the corridor and killed him at 11:42, then moved to the lavatories. Soon after, other students found the victim's body, but assumed he was rendered unconscious from a bump to his head. Other students <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of gunshots, but did not recognise them. At the lavatories, Auvinen fatally shot two more students, prompting the school nurse to call emergency services. After shooting and killing a student outside the lavatory, Auvinen ran after the nurse, caught up to her, and fatally shot her and another student at 11:46.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, either June 17 or 18, {{the band}} of about 30 Native Americans {{returned}} to their hidden positions and awaited the settlers. When the settlers awoke, Brigham and Phillips went onto the porch of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the moccasin tracks around the property. Phillips {{decided to go to}} his cabin, about a half mile (.8km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents. Brigham, intending to accompany Phillips, entered his cabin for a moment, and once inside he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of musket fire outside. Phillips, mortally wounded, fell to the ground, struck by two musket balls. The band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their tomahawks.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not until}} he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of {{preparation}} for departure that he left the skeleton's tent, and then, with Mr. Stubbs clasped tightly to his breast, he hurried over to the wagon where Old Ben was nearly ready to start.|$|R
60|$|The lads {{were still}} some {{distance}} from the college grounds when they <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of horns and rattles. Then they beheld a glimmer of light down by the river bank. Soon the light brightened until it covered a goodly portion of the sky.|$|R
6000|$|Probably {{a modern}} bishop {{would say that}} there were no noises at all, that every one who <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> was under <b>the</b> {{influence}} of [...] "suggestion," [...] caused first in Mrs. Ricketts' own mind by vague tales of a gentleman in drab seen by the servants.|$|R
