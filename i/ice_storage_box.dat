40|$|This article {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} thermal {{performance of a}} heat pump system with an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> subcooler. The system supplies heating and cooling demands to two greenhouses with temperature ranging 308 similar to 323 K and 273 similar to 291 K respectively and utilizes an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank to subcool the condensed refrigerant, which can enhance the system coefficient of performance (COP). The <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank charges for storing ice, when the cooling load {{is less than the}} nominal cooling capacity. While the cooling load is larger than the nominal cooling capacity, the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank discharges for subcooling. The results show that in the charge mode the heat pump COP of <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> system is 12 % higher than that without <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank. Under the discharge mode, the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> system provides the refrigerator COP 15 % higher than that without <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

During a 7 -day <b>ice</b> <b>storage,</b> K-value, TVB-N, TMA-N and organic acids contents increased with increasing storage time (p< 0. 05). Changes in free amino acid, such as aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, glycine, arginine and proline were observed throughout the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> (p< 0. 05), while total free amino acids were found to decrease significantly (p< 0. 05).

Based on a real air-conditioning system, the data, including the return temperature of chilled water, the supply temperature of chilled water, the return temperature of <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> water, and the supply temperature of <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> water, are measured. The least-squares regression (LSR) is used to obtain the input-output (I/O) curve for the cooling load and power consumption of chillers and <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank. The objective is to minimize overall cost in a daily schedule while satisfying all constraints, including cooling loading under the time-of-use (TOU) rate. Based on the Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and Ant Colony Optimization, an Ant-Based Radial Basis Function Network (ARBFN) is constructed in the searching process.

40|$|<b>Ice</b> thermal <b>storage</b> is {{promising}} technology to reduce energy costs by shifting the cooling cost from on-peak to off-peak periods. The paper discusses the optimal design of <b>ice</b> thermal <b>storage</b> {{and its impact}} on energy consumption, demand, and total energy cost. A tool for optimal <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> design is developed, considering the charging and discharge times and optimal sizing of <b>ice</b> thermal <b>storage</b> system. Detailed simulation studies using real office building located near Orlando, FL including utility rate structure are presented. The study considers the effect of the <b>ice</b> thermal <b>storage</b> on the chiller performance and the associated energy cost and demonstrates the cost saving achieved from optimal <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> design. A whole building energy simulation model is used to generate the hourly cooling load for both design day and entire year. Other collected variables such as condenser entering water temperature, chilled water leaving temperature, outdoor air dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures are used as inputs to a chiller model based on DOE- 2 chiller model to determine the associated cooling energy use.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimal dispatch model of an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air-conditioning system for participants to quickly and accurately perform energy saving and demand response, {{and to avoid}} the over contact with electricity price peak. The schedule planning for an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air-conditioning system of demand response is mainly to transfer energy consumption from the peak load to the partial-peak or off-peak load. Least Squares Regression (LSR) is used to obtain the polynomial function for the cooling capacity {{and the cost of}} power consumption with a real <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air-conditioning system. Based on the dynamic electricity pricing, the requirements of cooling loads, and all technical constraints, the dispatch model of the ice-storage air-conditioning system is formulated to minimize the operation cost. The Improved Ripple Bee Swarm Optimization (IRBSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the dispatch model of the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air-conditioning system in a daily schedule on summer. Simulation results indicate that reasonable solutions provide a practical and flexible framework allowing the demand response of <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air-conditioning systems to demonstrate the optimization of its energy savings and operational efficiency and offering greater energy efficiency...|$|R

This remarkable <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> {{is no longer in}} use today but {{is one of the last}} monumental witnesses of the European industry of ice and is therefore listed since 1993. A real estate project influencing the immediate surroundings of this <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> motivated a thorough evaluation of its condition and stability. The actual structural behaviour of the underground <b>ice</b> <b>storage,</b> Glacières Royales, was studied. 2 D and 3 D numerical models based on linear elastic finite elements were used for the masonry.

40|$|With the {{development}} of social economy, the electricity consumption by air conditioning increases unceasingly. Even the electricity peak due to the air conditioning is often {{at the same time}} with the industry trade peak, which worsen creates the peak electric power resources shortage, and the electricity difference between on-peak hours and off-peak hours is becoming larger. The ice-storage air conditioning system, as a powerful technology of balancing electric loads from on-peak hours, has the great significance to the electric network. The dynamic <b>ice</b> cold <b>storage</b> technique is the important research direction of the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air conditioning system, In order to obtain guidelines for engineering applications, experiments were conducted using the dynamic <b>ice</b> cold <b>storage</b> air conditioning system developed by Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion,and the paper mainly focused on the following aspects; 1) The influences of different initial cool thermal storage rate, different cooling load of end-users, different discharge water flow rate and different ice-melting velocity on the discharging characteristics were analyzed in detail, the results show that the ice-melting velocity {{plays an important role in}} discharging characteristics, and initial cool thermal storage rate, discharge water flow rate and cooling load of end-users have little effect on the discharging characteristics. 2) In order to get the optimum pipeline designs in <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank during the ice charging process, several ice-melting experiments were conducted. The results show that there exists an optimum pipeline arrangement in the discharging process considering ice discharging efficiency, and the output water of the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank has little effect on the velocity of ice-melting. 3) The influence on the discharging efficiency of the velocity field in the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank produced by the input water and output water was analyzed. Through this experimental study, the crucial discharging parameters of the dynamic <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air conditioning system were obtained; at the same time, an optimum pipeline design in the <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> tank during <b>ice</b> discharging process was also obtained. And the experimental foundation and the design instruction were to be provided for the product development of the dynamic <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> air conditioning. 随着社会经济水平的不断发展，人们对生活环境和工作环境的要求有了很大提高，空调用量不断增加。并且空调用电高峰往往与工商业用电高峰同步，进一步造成高峰期电力资源短缺，电力峰谷差矛盾的加剧。冰蓄冷空调就是为了实现电网负荷削峰平谷而发展起来的一项实用技术，对电网移峰填谷具有重大意义。 动态冰蓄冷技术是冰蓄冷空调的重要研究方向，为了更好的指导工程应用，本文利用中科院广州能源研究所自主研发的动态冰蓄冷空调系统，主要作了以下几项工作： ⑴ 进行动态冰蓄冷空调系统的融冰实验，分析不同初始蓄冰量、不同末端负荷、不同取冷流量、槽内回水速度等因素对融冰取冷特性的影响。结果表明：初始蓄冰量、末端负荷、取冷流量对融冰取冷特性的影响很小，槽内回水速度对融冰取冷起关键作用。 ⑵ 通过改变取水、回水布管方式，以获得最佳取冷速率（或融冰速度）的取水口和回水口的基本设计原则和依据。结果表明，存在最佳的融冰布管方式，取水口对融冰效率的影响很小。 ⑶ 定性阐明蓄冰槽内因回水和取水引起的速度场或其他参数对融冰速度的影响规律； 通过本课题的实验研究，得到了动态冰蓄冷空调系统融冰取冷特性的关键参数和取回水的基本设计原则，为动态冰蓄冷空调的进一步研发提供了参考依据...|$|R

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The South African gold {{mining sector}} consumes 47 % of the mining industry’s electricity. On a deep level gold mine, 20 % {{of the energy}} is {{consumed}} by the refrigeration system. The refrigeration system cools 67 ˚C virgin rock temperatures underground. Underground cooling demand increases significantly with deeper mining activities. Various cooling systems are available for underground cooling. This study focuses on the electricity usage of an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> system versus a chilled water system for underground cooling. An energy-savings approach was developed to determine possible power savings on the surface refrigeration system of Mine M. The savings approach involved converting an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> system to a chilled water system and varying the water flow through the system. The water flow was varied by installing variable speed drives on the evaporator and condenser water pumps. The feasibility of the energy-efficiency approach was simulated with a verified simulation model. Simulation results indicated the feasibility of converting the thermal <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> to a chilled water system and implementing the energy-efficiency approach on Mine M. Simulated results indicated a 9 % electricity saving when using a chilled water system. Various problems encountered by the mine were also a motivation to convert the thermal <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> system. Converting an <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> facility to a chilled water system for energy efficiency on a deep level gold mine Energy management is achieved through the monitoring, controlling and reporting of the implemented savings approach. Converting the glycol plant and recommissioning the chilled water plant gave the mine an additional chiller as backup to sufficiently meet underground demand. An annual summer power saving of 1. 5 MW was achieved through the conversion and control strategy. It is concluded that conversion of the thermal <b>ice</b> <b>storage</b> system on Mine M results in an energy- and cost saving. Master...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAmong {{researchers}} worldwide, {{the combination}} of preservation methods aimed to achieve improved effects on microbial inactivation of seafood products {{is an area of}} research receiving increasing interest. Globally also, the demand for high quality minimally processed food products are on the increase. Ozone treatment, three decade – long declared ‘Generally Recognized As Safe’ and approved as food contact sanitizing agent has evolved up to recent times where it assumes the likes of domestic food-processing facilities manufactured with environment-friendly status ensuring consumer safety. On the other hand, the subject of inactivation kinetics of seafood microorganisms following ozone treatment is still under debate. Furthermore, kinetic models remain the economical and quick approach to predict the preservation parameters. Nevertheless, there is paucity of information regards aerobic microbial inactivation of crustacean product arising from fixed minimal ozone discharge. Is the phenomenon of aerobic microbial inactivation kinetics of shrimp product subject to a fixed minimal ozone discharge during <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> a fact or fib? To answer this, the aerobic microbial inactivation kinetics of shrimp during <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> of up to 11 days was inspected. The process conditions comprised of a fixed ozone concentration of 100 mg/h minimally discharged at wash time of 1 min as well as <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> of up to 11 days. Minimal ozone treatment was applied either prior to or during <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> situations. Aerobic microbial inactivation presented significant effects during <b>iced</b> <b>storage</b> (P< 0. 05). Line of fit that could best describe the aerobic microbial inactivation kinetics showed adequacy only at the fourth order of storage time ‘x’ variable, which could only but account for between 75 - 96 % of explained variance.
