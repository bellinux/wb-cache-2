40|$|Abstract — This paper investigates turbo {{methods for}} joint {{synchronization}} and decoding in pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) systems. We {{begin with a}} brief review of the turbo principle before applying it to the synchronization problem. Specifically, we propose and investigate a baud timing offset synchronization algorithm for error control coded systems. Unlike many previously proposed algorithms, which <b>feed</b> <b>estimates</b> for the coded symbols to the decoder, our algorithm calculates and exchanges extrinsic information values for the coded bits, as is consistent with the turbo principle. Simulations prove the algorithm’s utility and verify that it has performance near to that of an ideal synchronizer achieving the Cramer Rao lower bound on timing error estimation variance. We investigate both systems employing regular convolutional error correcting codes as well as serially concatenated convolutional turbo codes. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Quantification {{of feeding}} rates and {{selectivity}} of zooplankton {{is vital for}} understanding the mechanisms structuring marine ecosystems. However, methodological limitations have made many of these studies difficult. Recently, molecular based methods have demonstrated that DNA from prey species {{can be used to}} identify zoo-plankton gut contents, and further, quantitative gut content estimates by quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeted to the 18 S rRNA gene have been used to <b>estimate</b> <b>feeding</b> rates in appendicularians and copepods. However, while standard single primer based qPCR assays were quantita-tive for the filter feeding appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, feeding rates were consistently underestimated in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. In this study, we test the hypothesis that prey DNA is rapidly digested after ingestion by copepods and describe a qPCR-based assay, differential length amplification qPCR (dla-qPCR), to account for DNA digestion. The assay utilizes multiple primer sets that amplify different sized fragments of the prey 18 S rRNA gene and, based on the differential amplification of these fragments, the degree of digestion is estimated and corrected for. Application of this approach to C. finmarchicus fed Rhodomonas marina significantly improved quantitative <b>feeding</b> <b>estimates</b> compared to standard qPCR. The development of dla-qPCR represents a significant advancement towards a quantitative method for assessing in situ copepod feeding rates without involving cultivation-based manipulation...|$|R

30|$|It {{turns out}} that this naive {{ordinary}} estimate grossly underestimates the income effect compared to effects from the IV 2 SLS estimate. This implies that estimating the model using OLS is not the correct approach and ignoring these differences would bias the income effect. The findings of Babalola and Isitor (2014), Njimanted (2006), and Thirumarpan (2013) also confirm that household income {{is one of the}} key determinants of food expenditure and food security in rural areas. We also report that farm output significantly affects household food consumption. The elasticity of PCFE with respect to the gross crop value is equal to 0.063 % for IV in the water scarcity estimates. Similar effects are found in the grazing and <b>feed</b> <b>estimates</b> presented in Table  3 of columns 3 to 6. This is in line with Sarris et al. (2006) who found that agricultural productivity significantly affects PCFE in Ethiopia. The coefficient’s sign and statistical significance show that livestock ownership is positively correlated with PCFE, suggesting that farmers with high herd size have a higher food consumption expenditure. Studies by Dercon et al. (2005) in Ethiopia and Sarris et al. (2006) in Tanzania found a similar result.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The daytime {{vertical}} distribution of Sagata crassa in Tokyo Bay was examined from February 13, 1988 to February 20, 1989 High densities of larger-size chaetognaths were found near the sea bottom, whereas the smaller animals tended to inhabit the upper layers. This feature of distribution {{is discussed in}} relation to the distribution of their main food organisms, e g. Pseudodiaptomus marinus, Acartia omoru, Centropages abdommalis and Oithona davisae. The two periods of replacement of two morphs were confirmed by the vanation only in mean body length of this chaetognath, unlike the previous authors who made additional morphological observations. It was hypothesized that S. crassa has at least five generations Two generations, including mostly the larger forms, had higher growth rates than the generation consisting mainly of the small form. Yearly respiration of S. crassa was 8. 2 g C m~ 2 Yearly production of this animal was estimated to be 3. 8 g C m~ 2.

40|$|The {{humpback}} whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) makes annual migrations from Antarctic feeding grounds to tropical breeding grounds. The {{extent to which}} it feeds during migration is unknown, but thought to be very low. Whether an animal feeds during migration is likely dependent on prey availability and on the ease with which it can capture the available prey. This study used digital tags (DTAGs) and concurrent prey sampling to measure how changes in the depth and type of prey influenced the lunge feeding rates and the amount of energy consumed by migrating {{humpback whale}}s. Whales targeting krill lunged at significantly higher rates than whales targeting fish; however, the depth of the prey did not influence lunge rate. The observed lunge rates when feeding on krill, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, are higher than any previously reported rates of whales <b>feeding.</b> <b>Estimates</b> of the energetic content of the prey ingested revealed that whales may consume between 1. 2 and 3. 4 times their daily energy requirements per day while feeding on krill during migration, but less when feeding on fish. This suggests that whales may begin to restock energy supplies prior to reaching the Antarctic. Determining how often this high rate of energy intake occurs along the migratory route will assist with understanding the contribution of migratory energy intake to annual energy budgets...|$|R

40|$|Bottle {{incubation}} {{experiments are}} widely used in mesozooplankton grazing studies. However, we have shown here that traditional particle removal experiments with Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus as grazers on natural plankton may yield low or even statistically significant (p < 0. 05) negative grazing estimates, even though negative grazing rates are impossible. Low grazing rates are often reported, especially on smaller prey types, despite abundant food and significant egg production. Microzooplankton, such as ciliates, show higher biomass-specific grazing rates on algae than do copepods and other mesozooplankton. Instead, copepods often selectively feed on the microzooplankton. Thus, apparent negative rates would be expected when the release of microzooplankton grazing pressure outweighs the copepod grazing rates on the same food items in the incubation bottle. We show that this potentially large bias increases with microzooplankton community grazing pressure in the control. A simplified general method to correct for this bias is presented and compared with the original method (Nejstgaard et al. 1997, Mar Ecol Prog Ser 147 : 197 – 217). Although complexity {{and the need for}} taxonomic accuracy are reduced in the general method, the results are not significantly different between the 2 methods. Both methods also show a good fit with ingestion rates estimated from faecal pellet production. We suggest that the general method be combined with automated sample treatment in future studies. In addition, we argue that carefully estimated faecal volume production provides a simple and quick overall <b>feeding</b> <b>estimate</b> with important advantages over the common gut pigment technique, and it may be used as an independent method in bottle incubation experiments...|$|R
