On September 16, 2007, Current TV won the Outstanding Creative Achievement in Interactive Television award at the 2007 Primetime Emmys for its use of online {{technologies}} with television. In his acceptance speech, Gore stated, [...] "we are trying {{to open up the}} television medium so that viewers can help to make television and <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> of democracy and reclaim American democracy by talking about the choices we have to make.

60|$|Thus {{for an hour}} or two the {{peculiar}} awkwardness of the meeting between Harry Gilmore and Mary was removed. He was enabled to talk with energy on a matter of interest, and she could <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> But when they were round the tea-table it seemed to be arranged by common consent that Trumbull's murder and the Brattles should, for a while, be laid aside. Then Mary became silent and Gilmore became awkward. When inquiries were made as to Miss Marrable, he did not know whether to seem to claim, or not to claim, that lady's acquaintance. He could not, of course, allude to his visit to Loring, and yet he could hardly save himself from having to acknowledge that he had been there. However, the hour wore itself away, and he was allowed to take his departure.|$|E
60|$|He {{leaned forward}} to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> which had started between Lady Underhill and some friends she had {{discovered}} in the seats in front; and Jill, turning, became aware that the man on her right {{was looking at her}} intently. He was a big man with rough, wiry hair and a humorous mouth. His age appeared to be somewhere in the middle twenties. Jill, in the brief moment in which their eyes met, decided that he was ugly, but with an ugliness that was rather attractive. He reminded her of one of those large, loose, shaggy dogs that break things in drawing-rooms but make admirable companions for the open road. She had a feeling that he would look better in tweeds in a field than in evening dress in a theatre. He had nice eyes. She could not distinguish their colour, but they were frank and friendly.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Owen {{was evidently}} falling under the {{management}} of stronger hands than his own, and {{it could only be}} hoped that it was not too late. His keeper brought him at a little after eight that evening. There was a look about him as if, after the last stroke that had befallen him, he could feel no more, the bitterness of death was past, his very hands looked woe-begone and astray, without the little fingers pressing them. He could not talk at first; he shook Honor's hand as if he could not bear to be grateful to her, and only the hardest hearts could have endured to enter on the intended discussion. The captain was very gentle towards him, and talk was made on other topics but gradually something of the influence of the familiar scene where his brightest days had been passed, began to prevail. All was like old times--the quaint old silver kettle and lamp, the pattern of the china cups, the ruddy play of the fire on the polished panels of the room--and he began to revive and <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> They spoke of Delaroche's beautiful Madonnas, one of which was at the time to be seen at a print-shop--'Yes,' said Mr. Sandbrook, 'and little Owen cried out {{as soon as he saw}} it, [...] "That lady, the lady with the flowery watch."' ...|$|E

60|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the repast, during which I had been too much occupied to take notice of everything that passed, I observed that a number of small birds had flown in, and were briskly hopping over the floor and tables, also perching quite fearlessly on the heads or shoulders of the company, and that they were being fed with the fragments. I took them to be sparrows and things of that kind, but they did not look altogether familiar to me. One little fellow, most lively in his motions, was remarkably like my old friend the robin, only the bosom was more vivid, running almost into orange, and the wings and tail were tipped with the same hue, giving it quite a distinguished appearance. Another small olive-green bird, which I at first took for a green linnet, was even prettier, the throat and bosom being of a most delicate buff, crossed with a belt of velvet black. The bird that really seemed most like a common sparrow was chestnut, with a white throat and mouse-colored wings and tail. These pretty little pensioners systematically avoided my neighborhood, although I tempted them with crumbs and fruit; only one flew onto my table, but had no sooner done so than it darted away again, and out of the room, as if greatly alarmed. I caught the pretty girl's eye just then, and having finished eating, and being anxious to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> for I hate to sit silent when others are talking. I remarked that it was strange the little birds so persistently avoided me.|$|E
