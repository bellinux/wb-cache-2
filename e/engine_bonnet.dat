25|$|In 1980 the Alfetta GTV Turbodelta {{was already}} homologated in FIA Group 4, since the {{required}} number of production engines {{had been built}} and fitted to Alfetta Turbodelta Stradale and Nuova Giulietta Turbodelta models. A racing version was campaigned in rallies and developed during 1979 and 1980 seasons: entries backed by Jolly Club were driven by Pregliasco, Ormezzano and Verini. The last development of the Gp.4 Turbodelta featured wide arches, 15x11 Campagnolo rims shod with massive 290mm tyres, big brakes, light body and huge <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet</b> covering induction to intercooler and turbo system.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the long}} <b>engine</b> <b>bonnets</b> {{at each end of}} the railbus that housed the motors for driving in either direction, this railbus was nicknamed the 'Pig's Snout' (Schweineschnäuzchen). The {{vehicles}} proved to be a real saviour for the Kleinbahnen, because the high costs of the generally loss-making passenger services on north German light branch lines were able to be considerably reduced. Often the Hanover versions of the railbus replaced trains that only consisted of a loco and one or very few coaches, which were therefore very expensive to operate. But it only needed six paying passengers for the railbus to make a profit.|$|R
50|$|The same {{engine and}} cover was used, with chain drives to the axles from a Lister-built gearbox with two speeds in each direction. The driver sat {{sideways}} {{on a fixed}} pressed-steel tractor seat, being able to face in either direction. Their controls were a screw handbrake on a prominent cast-iron pillar {{in front of them}} (moved rearwards on diesels), a long gear lever and a foot-operated clutch. The throttle was operated by a pedal using the driver's right foot. The original model 'R' Rail-Truck was fitted with the same 600 cc JAP engine as the Auto-Truck. A later 'RT' model was fitted with a 980 cc v-twin engine, later, 1, 2 & 3 cylinder diesel 'LD series' engines were fitted from new without <b>engine</b> <b>bonnets</b> and the brakewheel at the driver's right hand side.|$|R
50|$|Quite an {{advantage}} of Schlüter {{was the very}} good accessibility of motor, gearbox and both axis. This was facilitated by a hydraulically pivoting driver’s cab and a hinged <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Quadrifoglio weighs 1524 kg (DIN) for a {{power-to-weight ratio}} of 3 kg/PS. This is {{achieved}} {{thanks to the}} Quadrifoglio sharing the other models' composite and light alloy construction, as well as featuring a roof and <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet</b> made of carbon fibre.|$|E
50|$|Both {{sides are}} set to the frame by screws, while the <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet,</b> which reaches {{the seat of the}} drive, is set with two {{constraints}} quick release. Two air-intakes lateral horizontal elements to allow the hot air vent on the bonnet hand, is derived the taking of fresh air for carburettors.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the diesel}} {{locomotives}} built with Rolls-Royce engines shared many design features – rounded <b>engine</b> covers (<b>bonnets)</b> narrow enough to permit walkways {{to be put}} down each side; four cab windows overlooking the engine; fuel tanks and/or battery boxes built into the running boards; walkways or balconies at each end; access to the cab from a walkway or balcony.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997 the Mantis {{name was}} re-used on a 2-seater coupé or {{convertible}} road car {{based on the}} LM series powered by the 4.6 litre all-aluminium quad-cam Ford 'Modular' engine producing [...] and capable of 170 mi/h km/h. To accommodate the <b>engine</b> the <b>bonnet</b> of the Mantis was significantly remodelled from the previous LM range (that used the Rover V8), and the upper chassis rails in the engine bay were widened. Price for the Mantis was £46883.|$|R
50|$|A {{principal}} {{cause of}} the breach had involved the determination of Deutsch to stay loyal to Panhard <b>engines</b> while <b>Bonnet</b> was keen to switch to Renault power plants. The DB Le Mans, a 2+2 convertible, continued in production as the René Bonnet Le Mans, still on a front-wheel drive Panhard-based chassis albeit now equipped with Renault engines. Renault's 1,108 cc inline-four engine was also used for the Missile, a strict two-seater convertible based on the Le Mans but with a re-worked front end, and for the mid-engined Djet.|$|R
50|$|The GT uses a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, {{with the}} engine inside the vehicle's wheelbase.The {{spaceframe}} chassis and body are made out of aluminium alloys, while the boot lid is steel and the <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet</b> magnesium.The suspensions are double wishbones front and rear, with forged aluminium wishbones and hub carriers.|$|E

50|$|The Alfa Romeo Alfetta, {{produced}} in Arese, {{rolled off the}} line with a VM Motori <b>engine</b> under the <b>bonnet</b> in 1979, signaling VM's move to the OEM automotive market. The engines still retained some maritime features, such as individual heads for each cylinder - a design which {{made it easier to}} produce different cylinder configurations.|$|R
50|$|The {{size of the}} bonnet was {{emphasized}} by square cut styling of the wings. A practical use was found {{for some of the}} extra space in front of the driver: the spare wheel was stored, ahead of the <b>engine,</b> under the <b>bonnet,</b> freeing up space {{at the other end of}} the car for more luggage.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1980s both conventional Tatra T 148 and COE Tatra T 813s were succeeded by the single line of COE Tatra T 815s. However Tatra aimed to develop a conventional heavy dump truck for use in the hardest of conditions (i.e. mines). This led to the Tatra T 162 prototype, which wasn't introduced into serial production. Later in 1995 the first prototype of the upcoming T 163 line was constructed, though it was designated as T-815-24BSK8. The traditional design offers higher safety for the driver and easier access to the <b>engine.</b> The <b>bonnet</b> is made from a light laminate and it folds forward.|$|R
50|$|Three {{peculiarities of}} the Sport body were the <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet</b> hinged {{to the right}} hand side, the rear hatch, which could be lifted {{electrically}} by an handful of centimetres to aid cabin ventilation, and the spare wheel, housed in a separate compartment, accessed from a rotating panel which held the rear number plate.The tail lights were sourced from the NSU Prinz 4.|$|E
50|$|Locomotive (air) {{and train}} (vacuum) brakes were fitted from new. Air train braking was added later, {{in some cases}} with {{high-level}} air brake pipes for use with Southern Region electric multiple units. Originally the class had radio communication sets fitted for use at Southampton Docks, the aerial located on the top right hand corner of the <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet.</b> These were removed when operation at the docks ceased.|$|E
5000|$|The chassis {{is made of}} stamped and boxed steel sections, and is {{complemented by}} two {{aluminium}} subframes: one at the front supporting the engine and providing suspension attaching points, and a tubular one at the rear supporting both suspension and differential (or the entire transmission in transaxle cars). Structural body panels are steel, the <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet</b> is aluminium and the boot lid is a single sheet moulding compound piece. The base GranTurismo 4.2 has a [...]|$|E
50|$|Brown had {{purchased}} Lagonda largely to gain Bentley's engineering expertise, and immediately placed W. O. 's newest creation, his 2.6-litre Lagonda Straight-6 <b>engine,</b> under the <b>bonnet</b> of Brown's other new acquisition, the Frank Feeley-designed DB2. This durable DOHC engine would continue in Lagondas and Aston Martins until 1959 and, W. O. noted, important design details were carried on through to their V8.|$|R
50|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{lowering}} the center of gravity, the Climax engine was tilted about 28 degrees from vertical in the Series 1, which was found to cause engine lubrication issues, so it was mounted about 17 degrees from vertical on the Series 2. To clear {{the top of the}} <b>engine,</b> a larger <b>bonnet</b> bulge with front air scoop was incorporated on the body.|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} car was SE492 {{chassis number}} 638, which was modified to add bracing {{to withstand the}} extra power and weight of the four-stroke <b>engine,</b> a taller <b>bonnet</b> (US hood) with large grille to accommodate the engine, and unfaired headlights. In mid-February 1959 this car spent two weeks at the Royal Enfield factory, during which time it covered 500 miles of general road use and 1000 mi of endurance testing at MIRA.|$|R

Top of the rang Sport, with 1,584 cc engine {{from the}} HF, {{producing}} [...] With {{a top speed}} of 118 mi/h km/h, this version was the fastest production Fulvia ever produced. The 1600 was distinguished by a matte black radiator grille with chrome edges, black rubber over-riders on the bumpers, a matte black band on the <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet,</b> and new flush door handles. Some of these new fixtures—like the black grille and door handles—found their way on late 1.3 S examples.|$|E

5000|$|In 1939 the car {{underwent}} a restyling {{of the front}} end and became the Fiat 1100, also inappropriately known as 1100 A to distinguish from the later variants. The car had gained a taller, pointed grille—which earned it the popular nickname of 1100 musone, i. e. [...] "big muzzle"—with horizontal chrome bars, the top three extending back over window-shaped louvres {{on each side of}} the redesigned <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet.</b> Available body styles were six, all carried over from the previous model: saloon, convertible saloon, cabriolet, sports berlinetta, long-wheelbase saloon and taxi. No significant changes were made to the car's mechanicals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} version (SUA), started {{production in}} July 1966 and launched in August, {{had a higher}} roofline but retained the BMW-esque look. It was a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive four-door sedan, and featured a square 1490 cc 1500 SOHC engine, producing [...] at 5500 rpm and [...] It sold poorly at [...] The 1500 SS version with twin carburettors was introduced in June 1967, producing [...] at 5500 rpm and [...] at 5500 rpm. A stroked 1.8-liter (1796 cc) 1800 engine was added in December 1968. This new model, the Luce 1800, produced [...] at 5500 rpm and 112 lbft Nm at 2500 rpm. To accommodate the taller 1800 <b>engine</b> the <b>bonnet</b> on this model has a slight bump in the middle with an air inlet on the leading edge.|$|R
50|$|Lancia built {{one very}} special {{variant of the}} Beta themselves. The twin-engined Trevi Bimotore was used for tests related to Lancia's new four-wheel drive rally cars; it was powered by one Volumex <b>engine</b> under the <b>bonnet</b> driving the front wheels, and another in the back driving the rear wheels, with air scoops in the rear doors. The two {{gearboxes}} were linked, and an electronically controlled throttle replaced the mechanical system so the two engines worked together.|$|R

50|$|The Quattroporte uses a mixed {{steel and}} {{aluminium}} unibody chassis. Front and rear crash structures, the shock towers, the front wings, all four doors, the <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet</b> and the boot lid are aluminium.Front suspension uses unequal length wishbones with a forged aluminium upright/hub carrier, and an anti-roll bar; rear suspension is a 5-link, with four aluminium links and a larger, steel fifth lower arm that {{also serves as}} spring seat.A front aluminium subframe supports the engine by two mounting points, the steering rack and the lower suspension arms. A rear subframe, made of steel, houses the differential and supports all five suspension links. Unlike previous generations, new Quattroporte has frameless doors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{harbinger of}} all Zagato Appias was the {{prototype}} {{built on a}} type 812.01 chassis, serial number 1005, and first displayed at the 1956 Turin Motor Show. It was immediately nicknamed Appia Cammello, [...] "Camel", because of the double humps it carried {{not only on the}} roof—Zagato's signature double bubble—but also on the <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet</b> and boot lid.Originally painted in two-tone blue and white, and fully finished with bumpers and over-riders, this prototype was victorious at that year's Cortina concours d'elegance. Later it was outfitted for racing—applying an amaranto (dark red) livery, removing the bumpers and fitting more conventional looking bonnet and boot lid—and entered at the 1957 Mille Miglia.|$|E

New {{camshaft}} profiles and exhaust headers raised {{engine power}} to [...] The interior was significantly revised, gaining different upholstery, door panels, centre console and new electronic switchgear.On the exterior a narrower grille left the rectangular foglights exposed; the venting on the <b>engine</b> <b>bonnet</b> was changed from silver to body-colour. New, more elegant wing mirrors were fitted, bearing a small Ferrari shield. Around the back the tail panel was body-coloured instead of matte black, and foglamps were fitted in the bumper. Lower profile Michelin TRX tyres were adopted, on metric sized wheels.A total of 1305 examples were produced, 883 Automatics and 422 GTs.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} formed by Roger Blockley {{who had worked for}} the Triumph Car Company. The car was built on the chassis of a Triumph Herald using an angle iron {{framework}} which supported aluminium over marine ply body tub panels, aluminuim <b>bonnet,</b> <b>engine</b> bay sides and 'fuel tank', with fibreglass wings and doors. The radiator grille was frequently sourced from an MG Magnette ZA/ZB. From 1975 a version was made to fit the Triumph Spitfire chassis and running gear, but only 2 of this variant were ever produced.|$|R

50|$|The John Goss Special {{cars were}} {{available}} in a choice of two accent colours, Apollo Blue metallic or Emerald Fire (green) metallic, offset against the predominant body colour of Polar White. The metallic paint (specified on the cars' compliance plates) covered the <b>bonnet,</b> <b>engine</b> bay, chassis, and feature sections on the 'A' pillar and waistline, {{as well as the}} lower sill sections and the rear feature panel between the tail-lights. Unlike other GS Rally Pack cars, the road wheels were painted in complementary Polar White, as were the bumper bars and the front grille assembly. Interior trim was mandatory white vinyl, contrasted against a black dashboard and mandatory black floor carpet.|$|R
