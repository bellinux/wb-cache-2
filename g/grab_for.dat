The City of London {{had been a}} stronghold of republicanism during the Civil War (1642–1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still {{had the potential to}} be a threat to Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the early 1660s.

However, this should not be seen as a selfish <b>grab</b> <b>for</b> power on behalf of the bishops who emerge so triumphantly from the Life of the Fathers, but rather as a bid for hegemony of doctrine and control over the practice of worship, which they believed to be in the best interests of their congregation and the wider church.|$|E

25|$|The {{postural}} feeding hypothesis {{has been}} recently supported by Dr. Kevin Hunt, {{a professor at}} Indiana University. This hypothesis asserts that chimpanzees were only bipedal when they eat. While on the ground, they would reach up for fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees, bipedalism was used to reach up to <b>grab</b> <b>for</b> an overhead branch. These bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits {{because they were so}} convenient in obtaining food. Also, Hunt's hypotheses states that these movements coevolved with chimpanzee arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. When analyzing fossil anatomy, Australopithecus afarensis has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the Australopithecus hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to humans. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture.|$|E
