5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Gyrobus</b> G3, {{the only}} {{surviving}} <b>gyrobus</b> {{in the world}} (built in 1955) in the Flemish tramway and bus museum, Antwerp ...|$|E
50|$|In 2005, the Center for Transportation and the Environment, {{working with}} the University of Texas at Austin, Center for Electromechanics, Test Devices, Inc., and DRS Technologies sought funding for the {{development}} of a prototype <b>gyrobus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Driving a <b>gyrobus</b> has {{the added}} {{complexity}} that the flywheel {{acts as a}} gyroscope that will resist changes in orientation, for example when a bus tilts while making a turn, assuming that the flywheel has a horizontal rotation axis.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Gyrobus</b> is an {{electric}} bus that uses flywheel energy storage, not overhead wires like a trolleybus. The {{name comes from}} the Greek language term for flywheel, gyros. While there are no gyrobuses currently in use commercially, development in this area continues.|$|E
5000|$|After the <b>Gyrobus</b> was {{discontinued}} in all locations, {{there have}} been a number of attempts to make the concept work. Recently, {{there have been}} two successful projects, though the original idea of storing energy has been changed considerably: In Dresden, Germany there is the [...] "Autotram", a vehicle that looks like a modern tram, but moves on a flat surface, not on tracks. It has run since 2005 and is powered by a flywheel, though the wheel is small and only used to store energy from braking. The main source of energy is a fuel cell. The second successful vehicle was the Capabus, which ran at the Expo 2010 in Shanghai. It was charged with electricity at the stops - just like the <b>Gyrobus</b> was. However, instead of using a flywheel for energy storage the Capabus utilized electric capacitors.|$|E
50|$|The initial concept {{involved}} a giant flywheel (see <b>Gyrobus)</b> for storage {{connected to a}} hydrostatic transmission. The system is under development by Eaton and several other companies, primarily in heavy vehicles like buses, trucks and military vehicles. An example is the Ford F-350 Mighty Tonka concept truck shown in 2002. It features an Eaton system that can accelerate the truck to highway speeds.|$|E
50|$|Fully charged, a <b>gyrobus</b> could {{typically}} {{travel as}} far as 6 km on a level route at speeds of up to 50 to 60 km/h, depending on vehicle batch (load), as top speeds varied from batch to batch. The installation in Yverdon-les-Bains (Switzerland) sometimes saw vehicles needing to travel {{as far as}} 10 km on one charge, {{although it is not}} known how well they performed towards the upper end of that distance.|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} bus is a bus {{powered by}} electricity.There {{are two main}} electric bus categories: autonomous, where the energy is stored in the bus; and non-autonomous, where the electric energy is supplied continuously from outside the vehicle.Autonomous electric buses mainly comprise battery electric buses, although examples of other storage modes exist, such as the <b>gyrobus</b> which used flywheels.In non-autonomous buses electricity can be supplied by contact with overhead wires, as in the trolleybus, or more recently with non-contact conductors on the ground, as with the Online Electric Vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were major}} {{problems}} related to excessive [...] "wear and tear". One significant reason for this was that drivers often took shortcuts across unpaved roads, which after rains became nothing more than quagmires. Other problems included breakage of gyro ball bearings, and high humidity resulting in traction motor overload. The system's demise, however, came because of high energy consumption. The bus operator deemed that 3.4 kWh/km per <b>gyrobus</b> was unaffordable, so closure came {{in the summer of}} 1959 with the gyrobuses being abandoned and replaced with diesel buses.|$|E
5000|$|Rather than {{carrying}} an {{internal combustion engine}} or batteries, or connecting to overhead powerlines, a <b>gyrobus</b> carries a large flywheel that is spun at up to 3,000 RPM by a [...] "squirrel cage" [...] motor. Power for charging the flywheel was sourced by means of three booms mounted on the vehicle's roof, which contacted charging points located as required or where appropriate (at passenger stops en route, or at terminals, for instance). To obtain tractive power, capacitors would excite the flywheel's charging motor so that it became a generator, in this way transforming the energy stored in the flywheel back into electricity. Vehicle braking was electric, {{and some of the}} energy was recycled back into the flywheel, thereby extending its range.|$|E
