Here, we propose to use Bayesian P-splines to relate in a smoothed way the regression coefficient with the <b>effect</b> <b>modifier.</b> We show that this method enables a large level of flexibility: if necessary, adaptive penalties can be introduced in the model (Jullion and Lambert 2007) and linear constraints on {{the relation between the}} regression coefficient and the <b>effect</b> <b>modifier</b> may easily be added. We provide an illustration of the proposed method in a PET study where we want to estimate the relation between the Receptor Occupancy and the drug concentration in the plasma.

40|$|No {{study of}} obesity risk {{for people in}} {{developed}} countries has conducted a multi-dimensional analysis {{of the association of}} socioeconomic status with obesity. In this paper, we investigated if education functions as either a confounder or an <b>effect</b> <b>modifier</b> in the association of another socioeconomic status indicator with obesity. This cross-sectional study analyzed data of an adult population sample (10, 905 men and 14, 580 women) from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010 - 2014). The study performed multivariate logistic regression analyses for three education levels and four indicators of socioeconomic status (i. e., marital status, residential area, occupation, and income). The overall prevalence of obesity was 38. 1 % in men and 29. 1 % in women (p < 0. 001). In men, while education functioned as an <b>effect</b> <b>modifier</b> in the association between marital status and obesity (p for interaction = 0. 006), it functioned as both a confounder (p < 0. 001) and an <b>effect</b> <b>modifier</b> (p for interaction < 0. 001) in the association between residential area and obesity. In contrast, in women, education functioned as a confounder in the association of residential area with obesity (p = 0. 010). However, it functioned as both a confounder (p < 0. 001) and an <b>effect</b> <b>modifier</b> (p for interaction = 0. 012) in the association between income and obesity. A prediction showed that unlike in women, education was positively associated with obesity risk for some socioeconomic indicator groups in men; for example, in a rural resident group, a higher level of education increased the probability of being obese by 19. 7 %. The present study suggests the need to examine sex-specific studies regarding the role of education on the association between other socioeconomic status indicators and obesity.

40|$|Background In {{the last}} decade, network {{meta-analysis}} of randomized controlled trials {{has been introduced}} {{as an extension of}} pairwise meta-analysis. The advantage of network meta-analysis over standard pairwise meta-analysis is that it facilitates indirect comparisons of multiple interventions that have not been studied in a head-to-head fashion. Although assumptions underlying pairwise meta-analyses are well understood, those concerning network meta-analyses are perceived to be more complex and prone to misinterpretation. Discussion In this paper, we aim to provide a basic explanation when network meta-analysis is as valid as pairwise meta-analysis. We focus on the primary role of <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers,</b> which are study and patient characteristics associated with treatment effects. Because network meta-analysis includes different trials comparing different interventions, the distribution of <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> cannot only vary across studies for a particular comparison (as with standard pairwise meta-analysis, causing heterogeneity), but also between comparisons (causing inconsistency). If there is an imbalance in the distribution of <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> between different types of direct comparisons, the related indirect comparisons will be biased. If it can be assumed {{that this is not the}} case, network meta-analysis is as valid as pairwise meta-analysis. Summary The validity of network meta-analysis is based on the underlying assumption that there is no imbalance in the distribution of <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> across the different types of direct treatment comparisons, regardless of the structure of the evidence network...|$|R

Subgroup analyses were also conducted to examine the potential <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> of the association in terms of age, sex, and occupation. Results: A positive effect of temperature was observed (ER [excess risk]= 1. 93 %, 95 % CI: 1. 05 to 2. 82 % for 1 °C increase on lag 5 day). A negative effect of relative humidity at lag 1 day and positive effects were found on lag 5 – 7 days, and an adverse effect was observed for sunshine at lag days 3 – 4 (ER=− 0. 71 %, 95 % CI: − 1. 25 to − 0. 17 % on lag day 4).

There are an estimated 16, 000 new cases of invasive cancer of the cervix and 5, 000 deaths as a result of this disease, in the United States each year. The prognosis for this disease is markedly affected by the existence of disease at the time of diagnosis. Among the major factors which influence prognosis are the stages, grade of tumor and histology type. This study examined the effects of surgical vs. radiotherapy treatments on the mortality of cervical cancer patients, stratified by histology and cancer stages. Data used was obtained from the Florida Cancer Registry between January 1994 and December 2002; a total of 6, 107 women diagnosed with Cervical Cancer in the state of Florida were included in the analyzed data set. The study was a routine database analysis; analogous in design to a cross-sectional study. The main association in the study shows that patients who underwent Radiotherapy (RT) alone were 11. 8 times more likely to die than those who underwent Surgery (SR) alone.

Background: Thigh circumference is associated with diabetes risk; however, the role of obesity as a potential <b>effect</b> <b>modifier</b> has not been well studied. Methods: We examined the association between thigh circumference and diabetes in a cross-sectional study of 384 612 Koreans aged 30 to 79 years. The association between diabetes and thigh circumference in relation to body mass index (BMI) was analyzed among 315 628 participants, using multivariate logistic regression. Thigh circumference was categorized into 9 percentile categories—namely, the 2. 5 th, 5 th, 10 th, 25 th, 50 th, 75 th, 90 th, 95 th, and 97. 5 th percentiles—and the 50 th percentile was used as the reference value for thigh circumference. Separate analyses were performed for men and women. Results: The association of thigh circumference with diabetes showed contradictory patterns before and after adjustment for BMI and waist circumference. Small thigh circumference was associated with greater risk of diabetes among men and women.

40|$|Marginal {{structural}} models (MSM) {{provide a}} powerful tool for estimating the causal effect of a treatment, particularly in the context of longitudinal data structures.

40|$|Effect {{modification}} is recognised as {{an important}} phenomenon in epidemiological studies and occurs when the exposure-response relationship depends {{on the level of}} a third variable (the <b>effect</b> <b>modifier).</b> Effect modification is common at the individual level — for example, age or genetic factors are known to increase individual susceptibility to disease due to certain risk factors. However, effect modification may also occur at a group (area) level due to e. g. contextual effects (say, living in a poor area) or the effectiveness of the health care system. In this talk, we discuss the use of varying coefficient regression models to capture geographical heterogeneity in the effects of risk factors on disease outcomes. We consider small-area ecological regression models, which involve fitting a Poisson model to counts of disease cases in a set of contiguous geographical areas and modelling these as a log-linear function of mean exposure in each area. Spatially structured random effects are generally included to account for the effects of unmeasured risk factors that may vary smoothly across space. Varying coefficient models replace the constant regression coefficient by a separate coefficient for each area, the idea being to capture the interaction between the effect of exposure and location (where the latter represents a proxy for the <b>effect</b> <b>modifier).</b> One difficulty with suc...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) can reveal {{a range of}} degenerative findings and anatomical abnormalities; however, the clinical importance of these remains uncertain and controversial. We aimed to investigate if the presence of MRI findings identifies patients with low back pain (LBP) or sciatica who respond better to particular interventions. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched. We included RCTs investigating MRI findings as treatment <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> for patients with LBP or sciatica. We excluded studies with specific diseases {{as the cause of}} LBP. Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria of the Cochrane Back Review Group. Each MRI finding was examined for its individual capacity for effect modification. Results: Eight published trials met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of trials was inconsistent. Substantial variability in MRI findings, treatments and outcomes across the eight trials prevented pooling of data. Patients with Modic type 1 when compared with patients with Modic type 2 had greater improvements in function when treated by Diprospan (steroid) injection, compared with saline. Patients with central disc herniation when compared with patients without central disc herniation had greater improvements in pain when treated by surgery, compared with rehabilitation.

40|$|Introduction: The {{impact of}} {{ergonomic}} interventions may {{be offset by}} other changes at the work place, primarily rationalizations. These have previously been shown to imply a dominant negative effect on health and risk factors, thus causing effect modification (Westgaard & Winkel 2011). The present paper aims to present assessment of potential <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> in intervention studies at hospital wards in Denmark, Iceland and Sweden. Material and methods: The <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> were assessed by a newly developed method (the EMA method; Edwards & Winkel 2016). It {{is a type of}} group interview including 3 - 6 participants representing all occupational groups in the investigated organization. The group is asked to write down significant changes at the workplace during the investigated period. The method also includes a semi-qualitative assessment of the potential Work Environment (WE) impact of each modifier. It aims to capture both the individual and collective account of all significant events that may have caused a significant impact in relation to the specific aim of the investigated intervention. Thirteen hospital wards went through interventions based on either the lean tool VSM (Value Stream Mapping) (6 wards) or the ErgoVSM method (Jarebrant et al, 2010) where additional focus is on ergonomic issues (7 wards). Results: In total 120 interventions were implemented. However, 322 significant modifiers were assessed to have occurred during the intervention period. Of these, 120 were assessed to imply impaired WE, 166 a positive impact, 33 no impact and 3 were not assessable. The number of significant modifier events varied between wards from 8 - 48, while the number of implemented interventions varied from 0 - 28. The semi-qualitative assessments suggested a major impact on WE due to modifiers. At seven wards the dominating impact of the modifiers was estimated to improve WE; at two wards the modifiers were estimated mainly to impair WE while four wards showed a mixture of modifiers, some estimated to improve and other to impair WE. Conclusion: Numerous <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> occurred parallel to the investigated interventions. This jeopardizes any inference regarding impact of the investigated interventions on WE. The study thereby highlights the significance of considering <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> in ergonomic intervention research...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In a {{recently}} published randomized controlled trial (RCT), a targeted occupational health (OH) intervention was found effective in an intention-to-treat analysis in controlling sickness absence among workers with {{high risk of}} sickness absence, compared to usual care. We performed an exploratory subgroup analysis in order to detect possible <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> and mediators. Methods Age, gender, working status, severity of physical impairment, depression score, self-rated working ability, co-morbidity, and sickness absence characteristics in the previous 12  months were identified as potential <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> (n =  382). We conducted regression analyses with the potential <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> and a mediator (treatment attendance as intended) as explanatory variables. The difference of sickness absence days {{during the previous year}} and the follow-up year was the dependent variable. Results The intervention was especially effective in the subgroups of workers who were certain {{that they will not be}} able to continue working in their current job due to health-related reasons (− 74  days; 95 % CI − 105 to − 43), had co-morbidities (− 22. 5  days; 95 % CI − 35. 5 to − 9. 5), or severe physical impairment at work (− 17. 5  days; 95 % CI − 28. 5 to − 6. 5). A modifying effect of age, gender, working status, depressive symptoms, or prior sickness absence on the effectiveness of this OH intervention was not found. Conclusions This targeted OH intervention seems especially suitable for workers who consider that they are no longer able to continue working due to health reasons and have high level of physical impairment or co-morbidities. The findings from these exploratory analyses should be tested in future RCTs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Comorbidity indices {{summarize}} complex medical histories into concise ordinal scales, facilitating stratification and regression in epidemiologic analyses. Low subject prevalence in {{the highest}} strata of a comorbidity index often prompts combination of upper categories into a single stratum (2 ̆ 7 collapsing 2 ̆ 7). OBJECTIVE: We use data from a breast cancer cohort to illustrate potential inferential errors resulting from collapsing a comorbidity index. METHODS: Starting from a full index (0, 1, 2, 3, and 3 ̆e/= 4 comorbidities), we sequentially collapsed upper categories to yield three collapsed categorizations. The full and collapsed categorizations were applied to analyses of (1) the association between comorbidity and all-cause mortality, wherein comorbidity was the exposure; (2) the association between older age and all-cause mortality, wherein comorbidity was a candidate confounder or <b>effect</b> <b>modifier.</b> RESULTS: Collapsing the index attenuated the association between comorbidity and mortality (risk ratio, full versus dichotomized categorization: 4. 6 vs 2. 1), reduced the apparent magnitude of confounding by comorbidity of the age/mortality association (relative risk due to confounding, full versus dichotomized categorization: 1. 14 vs 1. 09), and obscured modification of the association between age and mortality on both the absolute and relative scales.

40|$|Background: Alcohol {{drinking}} is an oral cancer (OC) risk factor; tobacco smoking (TS) and betel quid chewing (BQC) are oral carcinogens and <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> of drinking. Although {{the assessment of}} the independent effect of drinking on OC must necessarily account for <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers,</b> no observational study has included interaction terms between drinking, TS, BQC in regression analyses. In order to assess the independent association between drinking and OC, this pooled analysis focused on subjects who were not exposed to such <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers.</b> Methods: Case-control studies on OC, which discriminated non TS/non BQC drinkers from multiexposed drinkers were searched. Exposed subjects (>= 1 drink daily, >= 10 years) were compared to unexposed subjects (non/occasional drinkers). Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were extracted/calculated. Pooled ORs were assessed with the random-effect method, which assumed high between-study heterogeneity (assessed with Cochran's Q). Robustness of estimates was investigated through use of adjusted ORs, correction for publication bias, sensitivity analysis to inclusion criteria. The drinking-TS interaction was assessed with the Interaction Contrast Ratio (ICR) and the Attributable Proportion due to Interaction (AP). Results: Sixteen studies were used, with substantially high heterogeneity. The pooled OR was 0. 787 (95 CI, 0. 677 - 0. 914). Use of adjusted ORs, correction for publication bias, sensitivity analysis corroborated these results. ICR and AP were 2. 444 and 54. 6 %. Conclusions: Consistent with stratified analyses reporting non significant/negative associations between alcohol drinking and OC in non multiexposed subjects, an OC preventive activity of {{drinking is}} inferable. However, given the high prevalence and the oral carcinogenicity of concomitant drinking and smoking, drinking control policies remain essential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Furthermore, we aim to identify <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> to response to treatment, to determine the natural course of PFP, and to explore its proposed continuum to patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In varying-coefficient {{models as}} {{considered}} by Hastie & Tibshirani (1993) coefficients {{are allowed to}} change smoothly across the value of other variables, the so-called effect modifiers. That means one has two types of regressors, the usual covariate x and the <b>effect</b> <b>modifier</b> u. For the wide class of multivariate 2 generalized linear models the varying-coefficient type has the form E(yjx; u) = h(Z(x) fi(u)) (1) where h : IR q ! IR q is the response function, Z(x) is a design matrix composed from covariates x and fi(u) is the parameter vector varying across values of u. If fi(u) is non varying but a fixed...|$|E
40|$|B ecause of the {{epidemic}} of sedentarylifestyle worldwide, there has been asecular decline {{in the amount of}} daily life energy expenditure (1). Daily life activities represent the accumulation of complex behaviors in daily life, and few middle-aged individuals engage in physi-cal training or physical activity at their jobs or during leisure time. Thus, it is im-portant to examine whether overall phys-ical activity in daily life contributes to a reduction of the risk of cardiovascular risk factors (2, 3). Because BMI has been previously identified as an <b>effect</b> <b>modifier</b> of physical fitness on the risk of cardio-vascular risk factors (4), we prospectively examined the relationship between dail...|$|E
40|$|The GSTM 1 (glutathione S-transferase mu- 1) null {{genotype}} {{is suspected}} of increasing an individual’s susceptibility to tobacco smoke carcinogens because of impaired carcinogen detoxification. We were interested in whether there were differences in lung cancer susceptibility to smoking within the GSTM 1 genotypes {{and the impact of}} antioxidant supplementation on this. For this purpose, we conducted a nested lung cancer case-control study and evaluated the role of GSTM 1 within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. GSTM 1 genotype status was determined for 319 cases and 333 controls using a PCR-based approach. GSTM 1 was evaluated as an independent risk factor and as an <b>effect</b> <b>modifier</b> of smoking usin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction: The {{pathogenic}} {{and consistent}} effect of discrimination {{on mental health}} has been largely documented in the literature. However, there are few studies measuring multiple types of discrimination, evaluating {{the existence of a}} dose-response relationship or investigating possible <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> of such an association. Objective: To investigate the association between experiences of discrimination attributed to multiple reasons and common mental disorders, including the adjustment for potential confounders, assessment o...|$|R
30|$|Subsequently, the {{statistical}} {{analysis of the data}} was carried out using SPSS 22.0 software for Windows and STATA for Windows, in order to assess the predictive conceptual model having AA as dependent variable and BS as an independent main variable. The independent variables (covariates) considered as potential <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers</b> were as follows: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol consumption; the confounding variables were as follows: gender, education, working time at the Health Unit, physical activity, and anxiety.|$|R
40|$|While studies {{investigating}} {{the health effects}} of racial discrimination for children and youth have examined a range of <b>effect</b> <b>modifiers,</b> to date, relationships between experiences of racial discrimination, student attitudes, and health outcomes remain unexplored. This study uniquely demonstrates the moderating effects of vicarious racism and motivated fairness on the association between direct experiences of racism and mental health outcomes, specifically depressive symptoms and loneliness, among primary and secondary school students. Across seven schools, 263 students (54. 4...|$|R
