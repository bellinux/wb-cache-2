2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 December, four MiG-21s from No. 28 Squadron, flying from Gauhati {{under the command of}} Wing Commander B. K. Bishnoi at very low level, climbed up to 5,000 meters {{altitude}} and then dived at 900km/h, hitting Tejgaon airstrip with 500kg. bombs, scoring several hits on the runway and rendering it unusable for operations. The airport was without air cover at that time, as a PAF ground support mission had just landed and the duty flight had not yet taken off. Two craters, each ten meters deep and twenty meters wide and separated by 1200 meters, had rendered the runway unusable (the bombs were BETAB-500, anti-airstrip ordnance). However, Kurmitola was to remain operational until {{the morning of}} 7 December, when Mig-21s of No. 28 Squadron again hit that runway. Although No. 7 Squadron was pulled out of the eastern operations on 6 December to help the army in the west, repeated attacks by MiG-21s and Hunters of No. 14 and No.28 Squadrons kept the runway cratered. An aviation website stated, [...] "A notable fact remains that the MiG-21FL was neither as easy to fly nor to operate in combat under conditions the IAF had to <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of a new war with Pakistan. It was designed as simple point-defense fighter-interceptor that was to operate under close GCI-control and attack its targets from the rear hemisphere with R-3S (ASCC-Code AA-2 Atoll) heat-seeking missiles. However, pleased with the speed and handling of the MiGs during operational conversions, Indian pilots trained intensively and gained not only considerable confidence, but also expertise. The Indians were to use it as an air superiority fighter as well as fighter bomber over extended ranges and well inside the enemy airspace, with minimal or no GCI-support at all." ...|$|E
