25|$|There are {{at present}} a few {{industrial}} scale biomass gasification plants. Since 2008 in Svenljunga, Sweden, a biomass gasification plant generates up to 14 MWth, supplying industries and citizens of Svenljunga with process steam and district heating, respectively. The <b>gasifier</b> uses biomass fuels such as CCA or creosote impregnated waste wood {{and other kinds}} of recycled wood to produces syngas that is combusted on site. In 2011 a similar <b>gasifier,</b> using the same kinds of fuels, is being installed at 's CHP plant. The CHP plant will generate 2 MWe (electricity) and 8 MWth (district heating).|$|E
3000|$|... (3) Entrained flow gasifier: Pulverized coal {{particles}} of size less than 0.1  mm are suspended {{in a stream}} of steam and oxygen at high speed. Depending upon the method of coal feeding, dry (Nitrogen as a transport gas used) or wet (carried in water slurry), <b>gasifiers</b> are accepting almost any type of coal. Entrained flow <b>gasifiers</b> ensures high carbon conversion because they operate at a high temperature of 1400 – 1600  °C (well above the ash slagging temperature). Entrained flow <b>gasifiers</b> are high capacity <b>gasifiers</b> because the gas residence time is measured in seconds. Commercial entrained bed <b>gasifiers</b> for a large scale of applications are Texo, Koppers-Totzek and Shell. Entrained bed <b>gasifiers</b> are available for the much larger capacities such as greater than 100 MWe than other two types of <b>gasifiers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{summarizes}} {{recent development}} in integrated gasification combined cycle technology and lists existing and planned IGCC plants. A brief outlook on the IGCC gasification technology is given with focus on entrained-flow <b>gasifiers</b> where the low-quality coal waste slurry fuel can be used. Desired properties of coal and ash for entrained-flow <b>gasifiers</b> are listed. The coal waste slurries, which were deposited at impoundments in Upper Silesian Coal Basin, were {{considered as a}} direct feed for such <b>gasifiers.</b> The average ash content, moisture content and lower heating value were analysed and presented as an average values. Entrained-flow commercial <b>gasifiers</b> {{can be considered as}} suitable for the coal slurry feed, however the ash content of coal slurries deposited in impoundments is too high for the direct use as the feed for the <b>gasifiers.</b> The moisture content of slurries calculated on as received basis meets the requirements of entrained-flow slurry feed <b>gasifiers.</b> The content of fines is relatively high which allow to use the slurries in entrained-flow <b>gasifiers...</b>|$|R

25|$|MBT {{systems can}} form an {{integral}} part of a region's waste treatment infrastructure. These systems are typically integrated with kerbside collection schemes. In the event that a refuse-derived fuel is produced as a by-product then a combustion facility would be required. This could either be an incineration facility or a <b>gasifier.</b>|$|E
25|$|General Electric is {{currently}} designing an IGCC model plant that should introduce greater reliability. GE's model features advanced turbines optimized for the coal syngas. Eastman's industrial gasification plant in Kingsport, TN uses a GE Energy solid-fed <b>gasifier.</b> Eastman, a fortune 500 company, built the facility in 1983 without any {{state or federal}} subsidies and turns a profit.|$|E
25|$|A dry {{pulverized}} solid, an {{atomized liquid}} fuel or a fuel slurry is gasified with oxygen (much less frequent: air) in co-current flow. The gasification reactions {{take place in}} a dense cloud of very fine particles. Most coals are suitable for this type of <b>gasifier</b> because of the high operating temperatures and because the coal particles are well separated from one another.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} the gas from {{different}} <b>gasifiers</b> varies a great deal. Staged <b>gasifiers,</b> where pyrolysis and gasification occur separately, instead of in the same reaction zone {{as was the case}} in, e.g., the World War II <b>gasifiers,</b> can be engineered to produce essentially tar-free gas (less than 1 mg/m³), while single-reactor fluid-bed <b>gasifiers</b> may exceed 50,000 mg/m³ tar. The fluid bed reactors have the advantage of being much more compact, with more capacity per unit volume and price. Depending on the intended use of the gas, tar can be beneficial, as well by increasing the heating value of the gas.|$|R
50|$|According to the Gasification and Syngas Technologies Council, a trade association, {{there are}} {{globally}} 272 operating gasification plants with 686 <b>gasifiers</b> and 74 plants with 238 <b>gasifiers</b> under construction. Most of them use coal as feedstock.|$|R
30|$|They are of {{particular}} significance to the operation {{of all types of}} <b>gasifiers</b> (Bryers 1996; Wall et al. 1998). For instance, to allow continuous slug tapping, it is necessary that the operating temperature in the entrained flow <b>gasifiers</b> is above the flow temperature (Hurst et al. 1996). In the case of fluid-bed <b>gasifiers,</b> AFTs set the upper limit for the operating temperature at which the ash agglomeration is initiated (Song et al. 2010).|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{production}} of chemicals from coal {{has been used}} since the 1950s and has become established in the market. According to the 2010 Worldwide Gasification Database, a survey of current and planned gasifiers, from 2004 to 2007 chemical production increased its gasification product share from 37% to 45%. From 2008 to 2010, 22% of new <b>gasifier</b> additions were to be for chemical production.|$|E
25|$|A smaller {{fraction}} of the ash is produced either as a very fine dry fly ash or as a black colored fly ash slurry. Some fuels, in particular certain types of biomasses, can form slag that is corrosive for ceramic inner walls that serve to protect the <b>gasifier</b> outer wall. However some entrained flow type of gasifiers do not possess a ceramic inner wall but have an inner water or steam cooled wall covered with partially solidified slag. These types of gasifiers do not suffer from corrosive slags.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{different}} feedstock types for use in a <b>gasifier,</b> each with different characteristics, including size, shape, bulk density, moisture content, energy content, chemical composition, ash fusion characteristics, and homogeneity of all these properties. Coal and petroleum coke are used as primary feedstocks for many large gasification plants worldwide. Additionally, a variety of biomass and waste-derived feedstocks can be gasified, with wood pellets and chips, waste wood, plastics and aluminium, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Refuse-derived fuel (RDF), agricultural and industrial wastes, sewage sludge, switch grass, discarded seed corn, corn stover and other crop residues all being used.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant. Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler, the coal is gasified (see coal gasification) to create syngas, which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity (just like {{natural gas is}} burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a {{heat recovery steam generator}} which powers a supplemental steam turbine. Thermal efficiencies of current IGCC power plants range from 39% to 42% (HHV basis) or ≈42–45% (LHV basis) for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies (Shell, GE <b>Gasifier,</b> CB). IGCC power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions, and allow for relatively easy carbon capture.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gasifiers</b> are {{the heart}} of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power system {{currently}} being developed {{as part of the}} DOE's Vision 21 Fossil Fuel Power Plant. A gasification chamber is a high pressure/high temperature reaction vessel used to contain a mixture of O 2, H 2 O, and coal (or other carbon containing materials) while it is converted into thermal energy and chemicals (H 2, CO, and CH 4). IGCC systems are expected to play a dominant role in meeting the Nation's future energy needs. <b>Gasifiers</b> are also used to produce chemicals that serve as feedstock for other industrial processes, and are considered a potential source of H 2 in applications such as fuel cells.

The throughput for this type of <b>gasifier</b> is relatively low. Thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low. However, this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures, so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use.
