5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in <b>group</b> <b>VI,</b> and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E

These victories were claimed over aircraft of 2 Gvardeyskiy Smeshannyy Aviatsionny Polk (2 GSAP—2nd Soviet Guards Composite Aviation Division), which lost ten Hurricanes destroyed and three damaged. He claimed his 20th victory on 15 May when he shot down a Hurricane [...] west of Murmansk. In June 1942, JG5 was augmented by another <b>group,</b> <b>VI.</b> Gruppe (4th Group) under the command of Hauptmann Hans Kriegel. This led to a number of Staffel redesignations. Weissenberger's 10.(Z) Staffel was renamed as 13.(Z) Staffel and remained subordinated to JG5. He transferred from the reserve force to active service and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 1 July 1942. In early September he was transferred to 6. Staffel of JG5, now flying the single-engine, single-seat, Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter. By this date, Weissenberger, as a Zerstörer pilot, had claimed 23 aerial victories in addition to 15 locomotives, 2 FLAK installations, a radio station, a railway station and other ground targets destroyed and was awarded the German Cross in Gold (...) on 8 September 1942.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{examined}} the genetic diversity of 80 inbred waxy maize lines using 22 SSR molecular markers {{that could be}} used to achieve heterosis in waxy maize. Eighty inbred waxy maize lines with different phenotypes, 40 yellow, 25 white, 13 black, and two red lines were analyzed by SSR molecular marker fingerprint and cluster analysis. Using a standard genetic distance of 0. 55, the 80 waxy maize inbred lines were clustered into nine groups. Among them, group II, group V, groups VII and VIII, and group IX were divided into three subgroups at a genetic distance of 0. 46, into two subgroups at 0. 49, into two subgroups at 0. 46, and into four subgroups at 0. 493, respectively. All but one of the yellow waxy maize inbred lines were clustered in <b>groups</b> <b>VI,</b> VII, VIII, and IX. Group IX (30 lines) contained 28 yellow lines; the other 11 yellow lines were distributed among <b>groups</b> <b>VI,</b> VII and VIII. Among the 25 white lines, 21 were clustered in <b>groups</b> III, V, <b>VI</b> and the third subgroup of group II. The black line N 72 was in a group of its own. The black lines N 75, N 76 and N 78 were distributed in groups VII, VIII and IX, respectively. The other nine black lines were clustered in group II. The red lines were distributed in the second subgroup of group II and there was no difference in genetic distance between them. In conclusion, there were considerable genetic differences among waxy maize inbred lines of different colors. The mean genetic distance of inbred lines of the same color was significantly less than that of lines 255 ©FUNPEC-RP www. funpecrp. com. brGenetics and Molecular Research 11 (1) : 254 - 260 (2012) Genetic distance by SSR analysis of different colors.

This category of polymers includes systems where the metallic moiety is coordinated to the arenes prior to, or following polymn. Nucleophilic arom. substitution of transition metal complexed haloarenes with various di-nucleophiles gave rise to polymeric materials with pendent metallic moieties. Condensation reactions of monomer complexes with org. reagents were employed in the synthesis of these materials. An alternative approach {{to the formation of}} organometallic polymers is via coordination of metallic moieties to the arom. backbone of purely org. polymers. The polymeric materials with pendent metallic moieties generally exhibited an increase in soly. relative to their org. analogs. Some of these polymers have also displayed interesting electrochem. and optical properties...|$|R
