25|$|The MTJ {{consists}} in a SrTiO3 (STO) tunnel barrier that separates half-metallic oxide LSMO and <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>metal</b> CoCr electrodes. The MTJ's usual two device resistance states, {{characterized by a}} parallel or antiparallel alignment of electrode magnetization, are altered by applying an electric field. When the electric field is applied from the CoCr to the LSMO electrode, the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio is positive. When the direction of electric field is reversed, the TMR is negative. In both cases, large amplitudes of TMR {{on the order of}} 30% are found. Since a fully spin-polarized current flows from the half-metallic LSMO electrode, within the Julliere model, this sign change suggests a sign change in the effective spin polarization of the STO/CoCr interface. The origin to this multistate effect lies with the observed migration of Cr into the barrier and its state of oxidation. The sign change of TMR can originate from modifications to the STO/CoCr interface density of states, as well as from changes to the tunneling landscape at the STO/CoCr interface induced by CrOx redox reactions.|$|E

The carrier spin- 3 / 2 and large spin-orbit interaction, leading to spin non-conservation, introduce significant conceptual differences from spin torques in <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>metals.</b> We determine the spin density in an electric field in the weak momentum scattering regime, demonstrating that the torque on the magnetization is intimately related to spin precession under the action of both the spin-orbit interaction and the exchange field characteristic of ferromagnetism.

In order to sustain rotation, the stator field must rotate {{in advance of the}} rotor poles, thus constantly [...] "pulling" [...] the rotor along.

5000|$|Equipment {{sometimes}} requires {{isolation from}} external magnetic fields. For static or slowly varying magnetic fields (below about 100 kHz) the Faraday shielding described above is ineffective. In these cases shields made of high magnetic permeability metal alloys can be used, such as sheets of Permalloy and Mu-Metal (trademark of Magnetic Shield Corporation, Illinois), or with nanocrystalline grain structure <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>metal</b> coatings. [...] These materials don't block the magnetic field, as with electric shielding, but rather draw the field into themselves, providing {{a path for}} the magnetic field lines around the shielded volume. The best shape for magnetic shields is thus a closed container surrounding the shielded volume. The effectiveness {{of this type of}} shielding depends on the material's permeability, which generally drops off at both very low magnetic field strengths and at high field strengths where the material becomes saturated. So to achieve low residual fields, magnetic shields often consist of several enclosures one inside the other, each of which successively reduces the field inside it.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{research}} performed between 1999 and 2003, Bowen et al. published experiments in 2006 on a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) endowed with bi-stable spin-dependent states(resistive switching).The MTJ consists in a SrTiO3 (STO) tunnel barrier that separates half-metallic oxide LSMO and <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>metal</b> CoCr electrodes. The MTJ's usual two device resistance states, {{characterized by a}} parallel or antiparallel alignment of electrode magnetization, are altered by applying an electric field. When the electric field is applied from the CoCr to the LSMO electrode, the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio is positive. When the direction of electric field is reversed, the TMR is negative. In both cases, large amplitudes of TMR {{on the order of}} 30% are found. Since a fully spin-polarized current flows from the half-metallic LSMO electrode, within the Julliere model, this sign change suggests a sign change in the effective spin polarization of the STO/CoCr interface. The origin to this multistate effect lies with the observed migration of Cr into the barrier and its state of oxidation. The sign change of TMR can originate from modifications to the STO/CoCr interface density of states, as well as from changes to the tunneling landscape at the STO/CoCr interface induced by CrOx redox reactions. Reports on MgO-based memristive switching within MgO-based MTJs appeared starting in 2008and 2009. While the drift of oxygen vacancies within the insulating MgO layer has been proposed to describe the observed memristive effects, another explanation could be charge trapping/detrapping on the localized states of oxygen vacanciesand its impact on spintronics. This highlights the importance of understanding what role oxygen vacancies play in the memristive operation of devices that deploy complex oxides with an intrinsic property such as ferroelectricity or multiferroicity.|$|E

The exchange bias structure provides a shift field to NiFe, which can separate the magnetization of NiFe from that of YIG in M-H loops. As a result, the ISHE related to magnetization of YIG and the ANE related to the magnetization of NiFe can be separated as well.
