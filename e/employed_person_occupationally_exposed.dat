These retroviruses include simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV), simian type D retrovirus (SRV), and {{simian foamy virus}} (SFV). Although occasional infection with SIV, SRV, or SFV in <b>persons</b> <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> to NHPs has been reported, the characteristics and significance of these zoonotic infections are not fully defined. Surveillance for simian retroviruses at three research centers and two zoos identified no SIV, SRV, or STLV infection in 187 participants. However, 10 of 187 persons (5. 3 %) tested positive for SFV antibodies by Western blot (WB) analysis. Eight of the 10 were males, and 3 of the 10 worked at zoos. SFV integrase gene (int) and gag sequences were PCR amplified from the peripheral blood lymphocytes available from 9 of the 10 persons. Phylogenetic analysis showed SFV infection originating from chimpanzees (n = 8) and baboons (n = 1). SFV seropositivity for periods of 8 to 26 years (median, 22 years) was documented for six workers for whom archived serum samples were available, demonstrating long-standing SFV infection.

We studied 1, 321 people from the general adult population (mean age 49 yrs, 640 women and 681 men) and 198 individuals, mostly men, all of whom had encountered a NHP with a resulting bite or scratch. All of these, either Pygmies (436) or Bantus (1085) live in villages in South Cameroon.

In the general population, 2 / 1, 321 (0. 2 %) persons were found to be infected. In the second group, 37 / 198 (18. 6 %) persons were SFV positive. They were mostly infected by apes (37 / 39) FV (mainly gorilla). Infection by monkey FV was less frequent (2 / 39). The viral origin of the amplified sequences matched with the history reported by the hunters, most of which (83 %) are aged 20 to 40 years and acquired the infection during the last twenty years. The (pro) viral load in 33 individuals infected by a gorilla FV was quite low (, 1 to 145 copies per 10 5 cells) in the peripheral blood leucocytes.

40|$|Abstract Background Foamy viruses are {{exogenous}} complex retroviruses {{that are}} highly endemic in several animal species, including monkeys and apes, where they cause persistent infection. Simian foamy viral (SFV) infection {{has been reported in}} few <b>persons</b> <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> to non-human primates (NHP) in zoos, primate centers and laboratories, and recently in few hunters from central Africa. Most of the epidemiological works performed among NHP populations concern cross-sectional studies without long-term follow-up. Therefore, the exact timing and the modes of transmission of SFVs remain not well known, although sexual and oral transmissions have been suspected. We have conducted a longitudinal study in a free-breeding colony of Macaca tonkeana in order (1) to determine the prevalence of the infection by foamy viruses, (2) to characterize molecularly the viruses infecting such animals, (3) to study their genetic variability overtime by long-term follow-up of several DNA samples in a series of specific animals, and (4) to get new insights concerning the timing and the modes of SFVs primary infection in these monkeys by combining serology and molecular means, as well as studies of familial structures and long-term behavioral observations. Results/conclusion We first demonstrated that this colony was highly endemic for SFVs, with a clear increase of seroprevalence with age. Only 4. 7 % of immatures, and 43, 7 % of sub-adults were found seropositive, while 89. 5 % of adults exhibited antibodies directed against SFV. We further showed that 6 different strains of foamy viruses (exhibiting a very low intra-strain and overtime genetic variability in the integrase gene) are circulating within this group. This suggests a possible infection by different strains within an animal. Lastly, we provide strong evidence that foamy viruses are mostly acquired through severe bites, mainly in sub-adults or young adults. Most cases of seroconversion occur after 7 years of age; from this age individuals competed for access to sexual partners, thus increasing the likelihood of being wounded. Furthermore, all the serological and molecular data, obtained in this free-breeding colony, argue against a significant transmission of SFVs from mother or father to infants as well as between siblings. </p...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous {{scanning}} fluorescence with a fixed wavelength difference (AX) of 34 nm between excitation and emission {{was used}} to quantitate benzo[a]pyrene-diol epoxide (BPDE) -DNA adducts. Fluorescence emission maxima occurred at 382 nm for BPDE-DNA and at 379 nm for benzo[a]pyrene-tetrols and-triol, which are hydrolysis products of BPDE. Similarly, the peak for pyrene was at 372 nm and for 1 -nitropyrene at 386 nm. The minimum detectable amount of BPDE-moieties in in vitro modified BPDE-DNA, after hydrolysis in HC 1, was 20 fmol in 100 /tg of DNA, which is equivalent to 1 adduct per 1. 4 x 107 nucleotides. The correlation of fluorescence in-tensity {{and the amount of}} BPDE-moieties was linear between 20 fmol and 1 pmol. DNA isolated from human lymphoblasts incubated with BDPE had the same fluorescence peak and the correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the amount of BPDE in the incubation mixture was linear. Among the DNA-samples from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 aluminum plant workers, only one sample was found to con-tain a peak similar to BPDE-DNA. None of the DNA-samples from 10 <b>persons</b> not <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> were positive. Measurement of BPDE-DNA adducts by synchronous fluorescence spectrophotometry should be useful in monitor-ing human exposure to benzo[a]pyrene...|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to study}} {{subjective}} and objective hearing loss in a population of aircraft maintenance workers and identify predictors. A total of 327 aircraft maintenance personnel answered a self-administered work environment questionnaire (response rate 76 %) and underwent audiometric test. The mean values for the hearing threshold at 3, 4, and 6 kHz for the ear with the most hearing loss were compared with a Swedish population database of <b>persons</b> not <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> to noise. Equivalent noise exposure during a working day was measured. Relationships between subjective and objective hearing loss and possible predictors (age, years of employment, self-reported exposure to solvents, blood pressure, and psycho-social factors) were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. At younger ages (< 40 years), aircraft maintenance workers had higher hearing thresholds (1 - 3 dB) compared to the reference group, but such a difference was not found in older employees. Relationships were found between age and objective hearing loss, and between exposure to solvents and reported subjective hearing loss. Equivalent noise exposure during working days were 70 - 91 dB(A) with a maximal noise level of 119 dB(A). Aircraft maintenance workers are exposed to equivalent noise levels above the Swedish occupational standard, including some very high peak exposures. Younger employees have a higher age-matched hearing threshold level compared with a reference group. Thus, {{there is a need}} for further preventive measures...|$|R
40|$|Formaldehyde (CH 2 O) {{the most}} simple and {{reactive}} of all aldehydes, is a colorless, reactive and readily polymerizing gas at normal temperature (Zang et al., 2009). It has a pungent, suffocating odour that is recognized by most human subjects at concentrations below 1 ppm (Speit et al., 2007). According to the Report on Carcinogens, formaldehyde (FA) ranks 25 th {{in the overall}} U. S. chemical production with more than 11 billion pounds (5 million tons) produced each year (NTP, 2005).

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{was adapted}} to measure total and Brucella abortus-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies. The results were {{compared with those of}} conventional serological tests for B. abortus antibody on the sera of a number of normal controls, apparently healthy <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> workers, and patients with suspected acute brucellosis. Relative to other tests, the B. abortus {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} was found to be both highly sensitive and highly specific. The serological results obtained in <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> workers indicate a higher "normal range" for this group and therefore a possibility of false-positive results and overdiagnosis. It is therefore important to establish a separate "normal range" for <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> workers. Investigation of patients with acute brucellosis showed that the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin M was the most sensitive serodiagnostic test and was likely to be of value in the serodiagnosis of acute brucellosis in <b>occupationally</b> <b>exposed</b> workers...|$|R

Manifold in vitro studies clearly indicated that FA is genotoxic. FA induced various genotoxic effects in proliferatin cultured mammalian cells.
