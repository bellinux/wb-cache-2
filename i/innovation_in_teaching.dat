40|$|The author, {{who has had}} {{previous}} experience as a nurse researcher, has been engaged in helping nurse lecturers to undertake evaluation research studies into <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> their <b>teaching,</b> learning and assessment methods. In order to undertake this work successfully, {{it was important to}} move from thinking like a nurse researcher to thinking like an educational researcher and developing the role of the nursing lecturer as researcher of their teaching. This article explores the difference between evaluation and evaluation research and argues for the need to use educational research methods when undertaking evaluation research into <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> <b>teaching,</b> learning and assessment. A new model for educational evaluation research is presented together with two case examples of the model in use. The model has been tested on over 30 research studies into <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> <b>teaching,</b> learning and assessment over the past 8 years...|$|R

30|$|The topical {{collection}} of Fashion and Textiles {{is a result}} of 2014 KSCT-ITAA Joint Symposium which took place at the ITAA Annual Conference in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. The theme of the joint symposium was The Culture of Collaborations: New Directions in Clothing and Textiles Teaching and Research, and over fifty papers were presented at the conference. Session 1 included presentations on Curriculum, Undergraduate Programs, and Industry Relations, and Session 2 included research presentations on Innovative Research/Creative Activity in Clothing and Textiles. Authors of the presented papers were invited to submit their manuscripts to the Topical Collection of Fashion and Textiles. One out of the four articles in this collection (Ha-Brookshire), was originally presented in Session 1 and the other three were presented in Session 2 : one in the field of consumer behavior (Yun, Jung, and Choo) and two in the field of product development (Kim; Sang and Park). The articles suggest directions for <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> <b>teaching</b> and practices, thus the topical collection was titled <b>Innovations</b> <b>in</b> <b>Teaching</b> and Industry Practices.|$|R
