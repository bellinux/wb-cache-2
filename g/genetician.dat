40|$|Objective: Treacher Collins {{syndrome}} or {{mandibulofacial dysostosis}} {{is a rare}} genetic syndrome characterized by a small mandible and ear anomalies. Some of the patients have congenital heart disease. Case report: A 10 -months old female infant with micrognathia, bilateral conductive hearing loss needing hearing aid, and patent ductus arteriosus is presented. Chromosomal study yielded normal karyotype and Treacher Collins syndrome was the first diagnosed by the <b>genetician.</b> The ductus was occluded by a pfm coil. Conclusion: In general, patient affected with Treacher Collins syndrome have no mental or skeletal problems {{and they can be}} productive members of the society. So diagnosis and treatment of their congenital heart abnormalities has a greater importance in comparison with patients affected by other genetic syndrome...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{resource}} sharing P 2 P systems with autonomous partici- pants, each peer {{is free to}} use the ontology with which it annotates its resources. Semantic heterogeneity occurs when the peers do not use the same ontology. For example, a contributing peer A (e. g. a doctor) may annotate its photos, diagrams, data sets with some ontology of its own, while peer B (e. g. a <b>genetician)</b> uses another one. In order to answer a query issued in the system, peers need to know alignments that state correspondences between entities of two ontologies. Assuming that each peer has some partial initial knowledge of some alignments, we focus on correspondences sharing between the peers {{as a means to}} learn ad- ditional correspondences. We first provide several measures of semantic heterogeneity that enable to draw a semantic picture of the system and to evaluate the efficiency of protocols independently of query evaluation. We propose CorDis, a gossip-based protocol that disseminates the cor- respondences that the peers want to share in the system. To overcome the peers’ storage limitations, we propose to consider a history of past queries and to favor the correspondences involving frequently used enti- ties. We study several policies that a peer may adopt in case of inconsis- tency i. e. when shared correspondences conflict with its own knowledge. We conduct experiments with a set of 93 ontologies actively used in the biomedical domain. We evaluate the CorDis protocol with respect to the proposed measures of semantic heterogeneity and show its good behavior for decreasing them in several contexts...|$|E

40|$|T herapeutic {{efficacy}} is {{a complex}} issue that obviously in-cludes in the first line a good diagnosis, {{but even if the}} diagnosis is unquestionable, every clinician and every partici-pant of a clinical trial knows that there is always, for any drug, a group of non-responders. <b>Geneticians</b> have tried for a long time, to bring their solution to the problem and to help the therapist to better adapt a treatment to a given patient by try-ing to link various genotypes and drug efficacy. This review aims to define the basis of both pharmacogenetics and of pharmacogenomics, and then to show examples of linkages between either therapeutic efficacy or therapeutic accidents and single nucleotide or insertion/deletion polymorphisms. Pharmacogenetics Versus Pharmacogenomics Pharmacogenetics was born in the 1950 s when it was re-ported that several therapeutic accidents could be hereditary.

40|$|Sudden death (SD) in {{children}} and young adults is a complex multifactorial problem that entails medical forensic and socio-familial implications. Forensic pathology {{plays an important role in}} these cases due to the fact that they tend to occur unexpectedly, and therefore a postmortem examination is needed to determine cause and mechanism of death. Most of these deaths are of cardiovascular origin and many of them have a hereditary component. The autopsy may be the only way to establish the correct diagnosis of the underlying condition enabling the family to receive proper medical counseling, to identify asymptomatic relatives at risk, and to prevent subsequent deaths. A proper approach requires the collaboration of various medical specialties (coroners, pathologists, pediatricians, cardiologists, microbiologists, <b>geneticians),</b> who must work in coordination in accordance to international protocols. In this article, the epidemiologic and clinical-pathological features of the main conditions that may lead to SD {{in children}} and young adults are reviewed and a case series from Seville and Biscay provinces is presented. Finally, the importance of forensic pathology in the management and prevention of these cases is underlined...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{a large group}} of 217 patients with skeletal dysplasias from almost all regions of Czech and Slovac Republics. I personally performed clinical-genetic investigations in 142 patients of the group. In 75 cases the diagnosis has been established with the help of photographic documentation and X-rays, and eventually by means of molecular biology. The most frequently encountered skeletal dysplasias within our group were those changes in the FGFR 3 gene (achondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, hypochondroplasia). The most frequently occuring skeletal dysplasia from our group of patients was achondroplasia (62 patients, predominantly children). Out of those, 4 patients presented with familiar achondroplasia and 58 with sporadically occuring achondroplasia. Achondroplasia can be diagnosed very soon, actually in the neonatal period. 52 patients of achondroplasia underwent the FGFR 3 gene evaluation, and we found Gly 380 Arg mutation of the FGFR 3 gene in 48 (i. e. 92 %) of them. Such a high finding of the mutation proves the clinical homogeneity of this most frequently occuring dysplasia and as in favour of a reliable clinical diagnosis procedure. The most frequently occuring lethal skeletal dysplasia, the thanatophoric dysplasia, is diagnosed with a lesser sensitivity. Various rare lethal forms of skeletal dysplasias are erroneously diagnosed as thanatophoric dysplasia. The principal source of errors when establishing the diagnosis of thanatophoric dysplasia is the low gestational age of the foetus. In such cases, a great experience is necessary to assess the prenatal ultrasonography with consecutive evaluation of the X-ray picture and the phenotype of the foetus after the termination of the pregnancy. In our group we have 15 cases of thanatophoruic dysplasia diagnosed pre- and postnatally. In 13 cases (87 %) we have found the FGFR gene mutations. In contrast to achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia the diagnosis of hypochondroplasia remains the least certain. The principal reason is the apparent genetic heterogeneity of hypochondroplasia and the absence of specific clinical and radiological changes. We performed the molecular diagnosis in 69 patients (mostly children) with suspected hypochondroplasia. In most of the patients, there was no accompanying documentation, or the radiologic documentation was incomplete. In only 10 cases (13 %) we have confirmed the molecular diagnosis of hypochondroplasia. The children with confirmed mutation (Asn 540 Lys) had a phenotype similar to that of a "grown" achondroplasia and clinically they were almost interchangeable with achondroplasia. In our group of 217 patients we have diagnosed several rare skeletal dysplasias. In two cases there were new, previously not yet described dysplasias of an unknown aetiology. These have been entered into the world syndromologic programme POSSUM/OSSUM as new types of skeletal dysplasias, termed as "Rhizo-mesomelic bone dysplasia -Bratislava type" and "Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia - Bratislava type". In cases of rare skeletal dysplasias, the same as in the cases of FGFR 3 mutations-induced dysplasias, we have documented case reports at the scientific level required by the world syndromologic programs (POSSUM/OSSUM, London Dysmorphology) and we have contributed to the image data of these programs. The image data (X-rays, photographs) are implemented in both the pre- and postgradual education within our faculty. The diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias requires substantial experience when evaluating the radiograms and the phenotype of the patient. The experience of the relevant specialist (paediatrician, <b>genetician,</b> radiologist) increases with the number of correctly diagnosed skeletal dysplasias. Only highly specialised centers focused on the diagnosis and therapy of skeletal dysplasias can meet such criteria. This is the only way how to achieve early and correct diagnosis and therapy in such patients. Available from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground. - Darrier's {{disease is}} a rare genodermatosis with a {{dominant}} autosomic penetrating variable transmission. The association between Darier's disease and neuropsychiatric disorders has been reported since 1996. Moreover, associations with mental retardation, schizophrenia, mood disorders and suicide have been reported. The discovery in 1999 of the ATP 2 A 2 gene of Darier's disease, localised on chromosome 12, allowed significant advances notably in understanding the pathogenicity of these symptoms. Material and methods. -In this article, we present the preliminary results of a clinical and genetic study of eight Tunisian families, involving dermatologists, psychiatrists and <b>geneticians.</b> Eight patients with Darier's disease and their first degree relatives {{were included in the}} study after they had given their written consent. Thirty-five subjects were examined, 23 of them had Darier's disease. All patients were submitted to a complete clinical examination; notably dermatological screening, genetic inquiry and blood tests for haplotype analysis. Only 13 of them underwent a psychiatric examination. Results. - The psychiatric examination was carried out only in 13 patients with Darier's disease, who revealed neuropsychiatric symptoms with a frequency of 61. 1 % (8 / 13). Two patients presented mild mental retardation; six patients had mood disorders, three of them belonged to the same family (two had recurrent depression, four belonged to the bipolar spectrum [2 bipolar disorder type 2, 2 cyclothymia]). The coexpression of the two distinct phenotypes (Darier's disease and bipolar disease), within the same three members' of the family of our study, suggests the existence of a genetic linkage between the two diseases, as has been reported in the literature.

40|$|ISSN : 0928 - 4257 The aim is {{to bring}} {{together}} electro-physiologists, embryologists and molecular <b>geneticians</b> interested {{in the development and}} plasticity of the central nervous system. The general objective is to introduce molecular mechanisms leading to the function of neuronal assemblies and to discuss how developing neural activities may influence later stages of maturation. During the past decade, considerable {{progress has been made in}} our knowledge on the neural tube development including dorso-vental patterning, antero-posterior segmentation and specification of neuronal cell fate (neurogenesis). Both embryological and genetic approaches have shown that these processes are involved directly or indirectly in pre-, peri- and post-natal pathologies of the central nervous system thereby indicating that early developmental decisions are important to allow emergence and maturation of normal brain activities. This is an initial developmental step during which basic features of the brain circuits organization and neuronal and synaptic properties might be specified. After the emergence of neural function, electrical activity plays an essential role in formation, elimination and re-organisation of synapses to eventually establish function and flexibility of adult neuronal assemblies. Thus, brain development and neural activity are tightly linked. A wealth of data has been accumulated on genes and proteins governing generation, transmission and plasticity of electrical activity on the one hand, regionalisation, neurogenesis and maturation of brain structures on the other hand. The 2002 Ladislav Tauc Conference in Neurobiology will provide a forum to share new ideas, strategies and technologies from these two domains of the neurosciences. New insights are expected on basic problems of cellular neurobiology and integrative physiology in relation to gene regulation, cell signalling, synaptic and membrane mechanisms, and transgenic animals models...|$|R
40|$|Cellular and Molecular Anesthesia: from Bench to Bedside In {{the current}} {{practice}} of anesthesia, each day, anesthesiologists {{deal with a}} great work: they use the cellular mechanisms of drug molecules to induce their desired effects for induction and maintenance of anesthesia to achieve appropriate tolerance of surgery and its pain, modulation of stress response, sedation needed for performing a variety of procedures, emergency anesthesia care, acute and chronic pain management or other everyday jobs of anesthesiologists during perioperative period. As a matter of fact, molecular anesthesia has been cited for more than 6 decades though in a very limited scale. In 1956, the molecular mechanisms of morphine and pethidine are described (1). Pauling in 1961 published an article in Science describing a molecular theorey for general anesthesia (2). In its report “the World in 2025 ”, Thomson Reuters has predicted clinical medicine {{would be the most}} active research front; while molecular biology has the 9 th rank (3). But are we still practicing in clinic the same as today? In fact, the future trend of anesthesia is highly dependent on finding the novel cellular and molecular mechanisms and the possible interactions of the newly discovered molecules and inreraction mechanisms with organ systems. Today, we emphasize on the role of pharmacologists, physiologists, immunologists, anatomists, embryologists, <b>geneticians,</b> cellular medicine specialists, physicists and other basic science specialists; some very interesting examples are published in this volume of the Journal (4 - 7). However, changes that have well started now would “revolutionize” our daily practice during the next decade {{in such a way that}} it will change the basis of medicine: presumably we will have a new model medicine known as “personalized medicine” or “precision medicine”. In this approach, the content of each patient’s genes accompanied with his/her cellular and molecular analysis is used as the basis for further diagnosis and treatment, tailoring the most appropriate treatment for each individual; some aspects of this novel approach like genetic makeup or genetic profile of an individual’s tumor is nowadays approved by FDA (8 - 10). In the approach of personalized medicine, not only clinical and psychological modalities are used for clinical management of patients, genetic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic methods are used as well. Techniques known as “bench techniques” are much more used in clinic, at times even more than the conventional assessment tools and diagnostic methods (11, 12). Personalized medicine has satrted a few years ago and we will be incorporated in every day practice; clinical anesthesia practice is not only excluded, but seems to be among the front line fields due to the nature of anesthesia; especially when looking at the nearly 7 decades history of interactions between cellular and molecular medicine and anesthesia. Cellular and molecular anesthesia is going to pave its way from bench to bedside. Possibly, in the next years, the remnants of the arbitrary line between clinical and basic medicine is completely removed; this would not take to many years. The Thomson Reuters report “the World in 2025 ” has very well quoted François Voltaire just the line after its title: “It is said that the present is pregnant with the future”...|$|R
40|$|This {{version was}} updated {{by the author}} in February 2014. According to the {{dominant}} theory of linguists, Taiwan would {{be the center of}} diversification and expansion of the Austronesian languages. The other specialists, archaeologists and <b>geneticians,</b> fit their interpretations on the presuppositions of linguists. By differently interpreting the data put forward by the linguists, a new hypothesis on the first Austronesian expansions can be proposed. Putting together the linguistic and archaeological facts, we can propose the following scenario: (i) The neolithic Austronesian homeland must be located in the coastal area of the Yangtse. At an unspecified date, Austronesian peoples started to migrate along the coasts towards the south to Guangdong and probably also towards the north. (ii) Around 4000 - 3500 BC, Taiwan began to be colonized by several waves of small groups of AN speakers coming from various places of the coasts of Fujian. (iii) During their coastal migration towards the south the continental AN languages changed and were phonetically simplified. The ancestor of MP language emerged in the area of Guangdong. (iv) Around 3000 BC, the MP speakers colonized the north of the Philippines. They introduced the red-slipped pottery. (v) While going along the chain of Babuyan and Batanes islands, MP speakers reached Taiwan from the southeast. The MP influenced the Formosans languages but did not root in Taiwan. (vi) A little before our era, the continental MP was covered by the ancestor of Tai-Kadai languages and left a substratum of core lexicon. This shared vocabulary will be the cause of the illusion of a genetic relationship between the two families. Selon la théorie dominante actuelle des linguistes, Taiwan est le centre de diversification et d'expansion des langues austronésiennes. Les autres spécialistes ajustent leurs interprétations sur les présupposés des linguistes. Toutefois, un examen attentif des arguments linguistiques permet de déceler certaines faiblesses : non prise en compte de l'origine continentale des langues austronésiennes, conceptions phylogéniques erronées, et sous-estimation du rôle de la durée dans l'espace restreint de Taiwan. En rassemblant les faits linguistiques et archéologiques, on peut proposer une nouvelle hypothèse sur les premières expansions austronésiennes. Le foyer des langues austronésiennes au néolithique doit se situer sur le continent dans la région côtière du Yangtsé. À une date indéterminée, les Austronésiens ont commencé à migrer le long des côtes vers le sud jusqu'au Guangdong, et probablement aussi vers le nord. Vers 4000 - 3500 BC aurait commencé la colonisation de Taiwan par plusieurs vagues de petits groupes de locuteurs AN venant de différents endroits des côtes du Fujian. Au cours de leur migration côtière vers le sud les langues AN continentales changent et se simplifient phonétiquement. L'ancêtre du MP s'individualise dans la région du Guangdong. Vers 3000 BC, les MP colonisent le nord des Philippines. Ils y introduisent la poterie lissé-rouge. En longeant le chapelet des îles Babuyan et Batanes, les locuteurs MP atteignent Taiwan par le sud-est. Le MP influence les langues formosanes mais ne s'impose pas dans l'île. Dans le même temps, les locuteurs MP colonisent les Philippines d'où partira la grande expansion vers le Pacifique. Enfin, un peu avant notre ère, le MP continental est recouvert par la langue ancêtre du taikadai en laissant un substrat de vocabulaire fondamental. Ce vocabulaire partagé sera la cause de l'illusion d'une parenté génétique entre les deux familles...|$|R
