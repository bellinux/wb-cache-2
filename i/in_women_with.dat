5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done <b>in</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function <b>in</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods <b>in</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E
5|$|In pregnancy, {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{is defined}} as a TSH between 2.5 and 10mIU/l with a normal thyroxine level, while those with TSH above 10mIU/l are considered to be overtly hypothyroid even if the thyroxine level is normal.

The frequencies of HCMV-specific CD 4 + T cells <b>in</b> pregnant <b>women</b> <b>with</b> serum anti-HCMV IgG antibody were detected by intracellular cytokine (ICC), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) staining. Results: The levels of intracellular cytokines <b>in</b> pregnant <b>women</b> <b>with</b> serum anti-HCMV IgG antibody were significantly higher than those <b>in</b> <b>women</b> without anti-HCMV IgG antibody (P = 0. 011 for IFN-γ and P = 0. 023 for TNF-α) but lower than those <b>in</b> non-pregnant <b>women</b> <b>with</b> serum anti-HCMV IgG antibody. Frequencies of HCMV-specific CD 4 + T cells were higher in infants with symptomatic congenital infection than in infants with asymptomatic perinatal infection.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> known {{hypothyroidism}} {{who become}} pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E

Clitoral priapism, also known as clitorism, is a rare, potentially painful medical condition and is sometimes described as an aspect of PGAD, in which the erect clitoris does not return to its relaxed state for an unusually {{extended period of time}} (ranging from minutes to days), despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation; PGAD can also be associated with morphometric and vascular modifications of the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially <b>in</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E

Menatetrenone is the brand name of a synthetic vitamin K 2 that is chemically identical to menaquinone- 4. The present review study aimed to clarify the effect of menatetrenone on the skeleton <b>in</b> postmenopausal <b>women</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis, by reviewing the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the literature. RCTs that investigated the effect of menatetrenone on bone mineral density (BMD), measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and fracture incidence <b>in</b> postmenopausal <b>women</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis, were identified by a PubMed search for literature published in English. Eight studies met the criteria for RCTs. Small RCTs showed that menatetrenone monotherapy decreased serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) concentrations, modestly increased lumbar spine BMD, and reduced the incidence of fractures (mainly vertebral fracture), and that combined alendronate and menatetrenone therapy enhanced the decrease in serum ucOC concentrations and further increased femoral neck BMD. This review of the literature revealed positive evidence for the effects of menatetrenone monotherapy on fracture incidence <b>in</b> postmenopausal <b>women</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis. Further studies are required to clarify the efficacy of menatetrenone in combination with bisphosphonates against fractures <b>in</b> postmenopausal <b>women</b> <b>with</b> osteoporosis...|$|R

5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness <b>in</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} pre-eclampsia {{are associated with}} general endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction and end-organ ischemia.

40|$|Background: Endometriosis is {{a complex}} disease that can result in {{substantial}} morbidity, including chronic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. There are contradictory reports regarding the connection between acute and chronic stress and magnesium levels in body fluids. Subjects and methods: A prospective study included 87 patients undergoing laparoscopy. The study group included 40 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis and the control group consisted of 47 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> other causes of infertility. The levels of fright were determined using HAMA scale. The measurements of Mg levels were performed using biochemical analyzer “Monarch Plus”. Results: One day before the operation, HAMA score was 9. 54 ± 7. 34 <b>in</b> the <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis, and 6. 69 ± 5. 51 <b>in</b> the <b>women</b> without endometriosis. The morning before the operation, HAMA score was 8. 64 ± 8. 10 <b>in</b> the <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis, and 4. 29 ± 2. 29 <b>in</b> the <b>women</b> without endometriosis. The second postoperative day, HAMA score was 8. 96 ± 7. 60 <b>in</b> the <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis and 6. 92 ± 5. 16 <b>in</b> the <b>women</b> without endometriosis.
