The prospects of hemispheric solidarity cannot be assumed in face of such heterogeneity of social actors. Drawing from social constructivism and the theory of structuration, the paper will propose a methodological approach to the study of transnational collective action in the Americas by stressing the political value of building discourse coalitions and embedding collective expectations. Defying the official meanings of the FTAA project, the <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Alliance</b> has been articulating a counterhegemonic critique to neo-liberal approaches to development in the Western Hemisphere.

40|$|University of Warwick, UK. Currently {{under review}} at Third World Quarterly. Do not quote without permission. 2 The <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Alliance</b> (HSA) is a {{transnational}} North-South coalition of trade union organisations, social movements and NGOs {{from all over}} the Americas. It emerged in 1997 in response to the prospects of a corporate agenda being institutionalised in the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) project. Despite the commitment of the hemispheric governments to make the FTAA a democratic and transparent process, the experience of the HSA reveals that the opportunities for engagement in a constructive dialogue with the official FTAA process were minimal or largely ineffective. This paper explores the initiatives undertaken by the HSA to open up a public debate on the consequences of creating a FTAA project (including, amongst others, issues of wealth distribution, democratic sovereignty, gender equality, and environmental justice). As a consequence of attempts to insulate the trade agenda from the demands of civil society, the HSA radicalised its position and launched a hemispheric-wide popular consultation on the FTAA at the grassroots level. It was only at this point that the largely uninformed public opinion finally recognised the FTAA project. This improved the conditions for a much-needed debate on the relation between trade and development in the region...|$|E
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>alliance</b> {{is defined}} as the {{collaboration}} between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. Building on the insights derived from the resource-based theory, we develop a conceptual framework to explain how socially entrepreneurial nonprofit organizations (SENPOs) can improve their <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> performance by adopting strategic alliance management routines. We test our framework using the data collected from 203 UK-based SENPOs in the context of cause-related marketing campaign-derived <b>social</b> <b>alliances.</b> Our results confirm a positive relationship between <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> management routines and <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> performance. We also find that relational mechanisms, such as mutual trust, relational embeddedness, and relational commitment, mediate the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> management routines and <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> performance. Moreover, our findings suggest that different types of <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> motivation can influence the impact of <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> management routines on different types of the relational mechanisms. In general, we demonstrate that SENPOs can benefit from adopting <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> management routines and, in addition, highlight how and when the <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> management routines-social alliance performance relationship might be shaped. Our study offers important academic and managerial implications, and points out future research directions...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the Internet {{has served as a}} {{strategic}} tool for international activism. It has {{played a key role in}} coordinating and strategizing the Zapatista uprising in the Mexican state of Chiapas, as well as the international protests against the Multilateral Agreement on Investment and the Seattle World Trade Organization meetings. However, these Internet-backed protests were largely the work of actors from the developed North. Less is known about how the Internet is being used contentiously by actors from the developing South, and whether Internet technologies are helping to bridge the resource gap that has persisted between geographically separated activists. This paper analyzes a more recent case of Internet-backed activism, focusing on the ongoing transnational mobilization across the Western hemisphere against the Free Trade Agreement of the America's initiative. The <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Alliance,</b> a network of hundreds of civil society organizations across the hemisphere opposed to the free market underpinnings of the FTAA, has employed Internet technologies to communicate, strategize, educate and pressure state authorities in an effort to promote an alternative socia l-developmental vision for the hemisphere. However, while the Internet has clearly reoriented protest repertoires in this ongoing campaign, this paper finds limits to the Internet's potential, as the digital divide persists between and within countries across the hemisphere. Nonetheless, despite obvious shortcomings, an appreciation of the dynamics behind this evolving case of transnational contention has important implications that go beyond the Americas context: the organization of groups transnationally, combined especially with Internet communication and coordination strategies, suggests that [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Alliance</b> (HSA) {{emerged in}} 1997 in {{reaction}} to the advance of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) neo-liberal agenda. As a transnational coalition integrated by trade union organisations, social movements and NGOs from all over the continent, the HSA denounced the detrimental social, economic and environmental consequences of the FTAA project on the most vulnerable sectors of the populations of the Americas. This thesis examines the role of the HSA in the construction of counter-hegemonic alternativest o the FTAA project. The analysis encompassesth e time period that starts with the formation of the HSA in 1997 until the halting of the FTAA process in 2005 and draws on the political process approach of social movement theory - particularly on its notion of political opportunity structures as factors conditioning the capacity of social movements to access and control political resources for the advancement of collectively defined political goals. It is argued that the actions pursued by the HSA to construct an alternative to the FTAA have led to moderate, albeit significant, results. Considerable progress was achieved in fostering a political climate of distrust and opposition to neoliberalism throughout the Americas, which contributed to the stalling of the FTAA process in 2005. In spite of this, the HSA continues to face the challenge of building political alternatives that reflect and expand a commitment to deeper forms of democracy and sustainable development in the region.

40|$|Transnational {{activism}} {{related to}} social justice claims is a watershed research area in social movements research. In particular, trade protests have a transnational dimension that {{was marked by}} the collapse of the Ministerial Meeting at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to push for further liberalisation. Between 2001 and 2007, several protests targeted international institutions representing neoliberalism. Disruptive and sporadic in nature, global protests aimed to derail the deepening of the neoliberal development model using the free trade debate as a core policy arena. This article maps out a framework to analyse social mobilisation led by civil society actors at the regional level where it emphasises collective identity-building as a central tenet to successfully change the politics of trade policy making. In this paper, I examine the insufficiency of political opportunity structures as an explanation to regional level activism. Whilst the existence of regional institutions as targets and democratisation as a window of opportunity to mobilise are relevant explanations, transnational activism requires more identity construction to forge transnational solidarity. The paper shows this using the cases of the anti-free trade network in Southeast Asia and the anti-FTAA movement in Latin America, particularly the <b>Hemispheric</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Alliance.</b> Whilst Southeast Asian activists frame anti-free trade positions in a less radical fashion, the HSA used trade protests as a springboard for further mobilisation against the broader neoliberal agenda. And although framing processes in activist coalitions have some imilarities, especially at the level of global movement, more differences can be found with regard to strategies due to the contrast in contexts of activism, which overall reflect collective identity formations in regions. Finally, cycles of protests in Latin America and Southeast Asia demonstrate how previous protests against trade liberalisation in Latin America bring about more protests compared to Southeast Asia, wherein only anti-FTA campaigns have emerged and where other forms of neoliberal resistance have yet to be linked to the FTA campaigns.

40|$|The {{perception}} and judgement of social hierarchies forms {{an integral part}} of social cognition. Hierarchical judgements can be either self-referential or allocentric (pertaining to two or more external agents). In psychiatric conditions such as dissocial personality disorder and schizophrenia, the impact of hierarchies may be problematic. We sought to elucidate the brain regions involved in judging allocentric social hierarchies. Twenty-two healthy male subjects underwent three fMRI scans. During scanning, subjects answered questions concerning visually-presented target pairs of human individual's relative superiority within a specific social hierarchy or their perceived degree of <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> (i. e., whether they were "friends or enemies"). Subjects also made judgements relating to target pairs' age, gender and fame to control for confounding factors and performed a baseline numerical task. Response times increased in line with hypothesized ascending executive load. Both social hierarchy and <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> judgements activated left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and bilateral fusiform gyri. In addition, <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> judgements activated right dorsal IFG and medial prefrontal cortex. When compared directly with <b>social</b> <b>alliance,</b> <b>social</b> hierarchy judgements activated left orbitofrontal cortex. Detecting the presence of social hierarchies and judging other's relative standing within them implicates the cognitive executive, in particular the VLPFC. Our finding informs accounts of 'normal' social cognition but our method also provides a means of probing the dissocial brain in personality disorder and schizophrenia where executive function may be dysfunctional.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{innovation}} {{in the context of}} business–non-governmental organization (NGO) partnerships for corporate social responsibility (CSR). While different aspects of business–NGO partnerships have been studied, the role of innovation and its potential implications for partnership outcomes have so far not been systematically explored. The paper defines innovation in simple and concrete terms and synthesizes from the literature what can be considered as critical ingredients to foster <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> innovation. The paper posits in turn that these ingredients correspond closely to the conception of social capital and offers a consolidated framework that helps in probing around these ingredients and social capital in accounting for innovative partnership outcomes. The empirical part consists of a comparative analysis of six case studies of business–NGO collaboration in the context of CSR in the United Kingdom. The evidence presented makes it clear that strategic partnerships are more readily capable of innovation and that social capital as an umbrella concept is very promising in explaining the differential success and performance of <b>social</b> <b>alliances</b> and central to understanding the dynamics of <b>social</b> <b>alliance</b> innovation and value creation...|$|R
