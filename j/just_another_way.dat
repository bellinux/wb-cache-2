2500|$|A {{significant}} change {{began in the}} establishment of Victorian society in Europe. In an attempt to civilize anything that seemed coarse or uncivil, much of Victorian society would adapt cultural items to suit their tastes. Ironically the British adopted the paper wrapped minced tobacco. Such an item, originally relegated to the poor in Spain, seemed at face value a contradiction; however, one must consider the need for human manipulation of tobacco, including, chopping it up, wrapping it in a man-made piece of paper, and then inserting it into a piece of cane for a mouth piece. One can then see that this was <b>just</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> of civilizing part of the coarser aspects of the British Empire. A feministic culture dominated smoking at this time as well as lots of tobacco, and this gave further rise to this [...] "dainty" [...] cigarette, bearing a feminine name.|$|E

He suggested that the figures on the reverse stand [...] "like Roman soldiers in an Antonine relief on the Arch of Constantine or Renaissance condottieri in a large fresco of court ceremonials." [...] Mermeule noted that [...] "the lettering on the obverse follows the forms and system of Pisanello" [...] and that [...] "the coin {{as a whole is}} a work of art rather than <b>just</b> <b>another</b> <b>way</b> to market a silver fifty-cent piece because all three of the mottoes that usually burden and constrict America's attempts of numismatic art are omitted."

They have also continued to sell typical Filipino dishes in bulk such as lechon.

40|$|This paper {{accepts the}} {{challenge}} posed by Godfrey Baldacchino in “Islands and despots”, published in Commonwealth & Comparative Politics in February 2012, to acknowledge and investigate {{the implications of}} the “expressions of harmony and solidarity” often observed in small island societies. To do so, aspects of the Isle of Man’s political and social life are discussed from the perspectives of popular rule and rationality. This paper argues that a homogeneity in preferences and the political practices of small island states might be a rational way of protecting a vulnerable economy and thus ensuring economic growth and a sufficient allocation to each island resident of the scarce resources required to survive. Such small island homogeneity and consensualism is therefore not necessarily indicating a deficient democratic practice, but might <b>just</b> connote <b>another</b> <b>way</b> of conducting democratic governance, spawned from a particular way of living and a particular range of need...|$|R
5000|$|The N=2 {{supersymmetry}} of Langevin SDEs {{has been}} linked to the Onsager principle of microscopic reversibility and Jarzynski equality. In classical mechanics, a relation between the corresponding N=2 supersymmetry and ergodicity has been proposed. In general form SDEs, where physical arguments may not be applicable, a lower level explanation of the TS is available. This explanation is based on understanding of the finite-time SEO as a stochastically averaged pullback of the SDE-defined diffeomorphisms (see subsection above). In this picture, the question of why any SDE has TS {{is the same as the}} question of why exterior derivative commutes with the pullback of any diffeomorphism. The answer to this question is differentiability of the corresponding map. In other words, the presence of TS is the algebraic version of the statement that continuous-time flow preserves continuity of [...] Two initially close points will remain close during evolution, which is <b>just</b> yet <b>another</b> <b>way</b> of saying that [...] is a diffeomorphism.|$|R

This would lower population densities in the city and also made as a good reason to help prove the subway expansion as necessary.|$|R

40|$|I {{argue in}} this dissertation, that {{alternative}} agriculture offers an epistemological {{challenge to the}} conventional approach to food production. To put it succinctly: alternative agriculture is not <b>just</b> about <b>another</b> <b>way</b> to grow; it's about <b>another</b> <b>way</b> to know. I test this hypothesis through {{an examination of the}} discourses of three of the more organized networks in U. S. alternative agriculture: biodynamics, organics and ecoagriculture. These networks have supported research, education and outreach activities around alternative agriculture for decades. I focus on people and institutions of the U. S. Midwest. Bruno Latour's actor-networks and his "circulatory" model of the process of "science-making" provide me with a method for analyzing the creation of alternative knowledge by these groups, from their founders to the present. This research relies on writing by Foucault and Latour as well as by agricultural geographers to inform an investigation into the alternative knowledge networks, with a focus on the discourse of soil fertility. The definition and use of science in core texts provides a central thread for the analysis, which sheds light on how different groups claim and defend territories of agricultural knowledge, and construct their arguments about soil in alternative production. I analyze the identification and labeling of material nature, as well as specific technologies developed to do this work. I also examine criteria for, and evaluation of, experts as well as how people build alliances with other scientists and with a larger public, and how they argue for the importance of their scientific contributions. Although these networks all produce arguments for "following nature," they offer radically different perspectives on what nature consists of, and different frameworks and technologies for working with it. I also juxtapose this discourse analysis with an analysis of the public discourse and regulatory language of the federal standard regulating organic production [...] -the Organic Farm Production Act of 1990, controversy around which prevented it from being implemented until 2002. This comparison sheds light on some of the specific challenges presented to mainstream production and conventional agricultural science by alternative agriculture, and on the process by which some alternative ideas become mainstream...|$|R
