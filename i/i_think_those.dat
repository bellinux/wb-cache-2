We intend to keep this country white and not allow its people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically insoluble {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E

He credits the experience for rounding out his game: [...] "I played a true third-line role, killing penalties and playing against the other team's top lines. For me, {{it was like a}} five-month crash course on developing my defensive game. My whole life, I had been an offensive player, and suddenly I was in the role of trying to be smart without the puck. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> fifty-six games helped me develop into a complete player." ...|$|E

He mocked the coverage, [...] "I think {{for the most part}} everything was wonderful. Some maniac Cohos got wild, went down on the field. Which you shouldn't have done. Bad little Cohos." [...] Tigers manager Anderson stated of the events, [...] "Beer and baseball go together, they have for years. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> kids were doing things other than beer."

500|$|Dave Marsh was {{the first}} music critic to employ the term punk rock: In the May 1971 issue of Creem, he {{described}} ? and the Mysterians, {{one of the most}} popular 1960s garage rock acts, as giving a [...] "landmark exposition of punk rock". Later in 1971, in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp, Greg Shaw wrote about [...] "what I have chosen to call [...] "punkrock" [...] bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)". Lester Bangs used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts. In his June 1971 piece in Creem, [...] "Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung," [...] he wrote, [...] "then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter. ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> were the best days ever." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, garage rock had no {{name and}} was not {{thought of as a}} genre, but as typical {{elemental}} rock of the period. [...] When it began to be recognised in the early 1970s, [...] "garage rock" [...] was not the name initially prescribed. [...] Between 1971-1973 certain rock critics began to speak nostalgically of mid-1960s garage bands (and artists perceived to be in their tradition) as a genre and for several years used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] to characterize it, making it the first musical form to bear the description. [...] Conjuring up the mid-1960s, Lester Bangs in 1971 wrote: [...] "...then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> were the best days ever".|$|E
500|$|The younger alternate-timeline Spock. Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> are all things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed his interest in the role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Feller {{announced}} that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: [...] "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession". Feller also believed it was [...] "grossly unfair" [...] that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, [...] "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him." [...] Feller's barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details {{made him one of the}} wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: [...] "They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>those</b> exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro League players were just as good as the Major League players." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nancy {{soon after}} becomes pregnant. Nancy begins helping her friend, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) who has escaped from prison. Mitzeee {{was in prison}} for the {{stabbing}} of Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Fox explained that Nancy has [...] "always known her friend was innocent" [...] as she knows that she is not capable of stabbing Mercedes. Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying [...] "something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her nose out and that's made Nancy more determined". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her [...] "really desperate to get this right for Mitzeee - to get her out and take Mercedes down!" [...] Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: [...] "They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> are all things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy has a bit of a [...] "bad girl" [...] in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got [...] "more fire in her belly than maybe we'd realised".|$|E
2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>those</b> who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO.
