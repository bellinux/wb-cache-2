Returning to Hollandia, she moved again to Alexishafen, for overhaul and installation of more antiaircraft guns, returning to Hollandia, on 7 October 1944.|$|E
25|$|Viking XPRS {{was built}} at Aker Finnyards' Helsinki New Shipyard. The {{original}} delivery {{date of the}} ship was set for January 2008, but due to numerous delays the delivery of the ship was pushed back until 28 April 2008.

Due to the propeller fault the ship sailed for <b>dry</b> <b>docking</b> at Aker Finnyards' Rauma shipyard on 8 April 2008 where the propeller was changed.

Asheville remained at that port until 24 February before she shifted to Hong Kong for fuel, supplies, a <b>dry</b> <b>docking</b> and minor repairs; she stayed there for a month before she returned to Swatow on 27 March.

2500|$|The <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> Engine Works {{had always}} had a special {{relationship}} with the nearby Detroit <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> Company, which only increased as the years passed. [...] In the 1870s, <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> Engine Works sold over 1/3 of their engines to Detroit Dry Dock; by the early 1890s that fraction had increased to nearly 2/3. [...] The ties were enhanced {{by the fact that}} Frank Kirby, John Owen, and James McMillan of Detroit <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> slowly acquired shares in <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> Engine Works. [...] By the end of the 1880s, virtually all of the <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> Engine Works shares were owned by Detroit <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> principals. [...] In 1892, James McMillan took over the presidency of <b>Dry</b> <b>Dock</b> Engine Works, and the two firms were controlled by the same person.

Whilst Harland & Wolff has no involvement in any shipbuilding projects for the foreseeable future, the company is increasingly involved in overhaul, re-fitting and ship repair, {{as well as the}} construction and repair of off-shore equipment such as oil platforms. On 1 February 2011 it was announced that Harland & Wolff had won the contract to refurbish , effectively rekindling its nearly 150-year association with the White Star Line. Structural steel work on the ship began on 10 February 2011 and was completed in time for the 2012 Belfast Titanic Festival.

Vale Beijing remained anchored off Ponta da Madeira with a crawler crane on the deck and an oceangoing tug standing by until 19 February 2012, when it left São Luís for Oman. After unloading at Sohar, the ship headed to South Korea for <b>dry</b> <b>docking</b> and arrived at STX shipyard in Jinhae, where it was delivered in September 2011, for inspection and repairs on 21 April 2012.

25|$|The {{minesweeper}} {{spent the}} year 1957, conducting various exercises in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Saipan, and Dingalan Bay, Philippines. The year 1958, began with Woodpecker conducting minesweeping exercises with the Republic of Korea Navy at Koji Do, Korea. During the year, the ship conducted two good-will tours in Japan: the first from 23 to 27 January; {{and the second}} from 28 May to 15 June. The latter encompassed eight Japanese cities. Woodpecker took part in combined minesweeping operations with the Republic of Korea and the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. Due to tension between communist China on the mainland and Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan, Woodpecker served in the Formosa Strait area from September to November. Upon her return to Sasebo on 8 November, she underwent availability and interim <b>dry</b> <b>docking</b> throughout November. She finished out the year 1958, by searching for and locating a downed US Air Force plane off Fukuoka, Japan.|$|E

25|$|The San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park {{opened to}} the public on October 2, 1963, and the ship {{opened to the}} public as a museum ship on October 10, 1963. Within years of its opening, serious {{deterioration}} threatened the ship and became critical in August 1969 when a leak raised the rate at which it took on water to 600 gallons per hour and in strong winds to 1,000 gallons per hour. The ships two pumps were capable of handling this flow, but two weeks later the leak doubled to 2,000 gallons per hour. In a dive, the leak was found and staunched with oakum and burlap and it was later reinforced to be fixed at the next <b>dry</b> <b>docking,</b> in November 1970. In October 1972, the United States Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park was intentionally included in its range. In September 1977, the State of California donated the park and the collections to the federal government and it was reorganized as the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. In 1979, the Wapamas condition had deteriorated to the point that significant repairs were needed to restore the ship's structural integrity and it was placed atop a barge.|$|E

De Soto proceeded to Havana in late February, for <b>dry</b> <b>docking</b> and repairs to her hull, before taking up a patrol station off the east coast of Florida in mid-March.

She departed on her [...] trip to the capital at 06:30 4 November 1998 with a tug boat moving her under the Braga, Mt. Hope and Newport Bridges, then up the coast to Boston. She arrived 7 November and entered Boston's Drydock Number 3, where an inspection determined the battleship was in need of additional steel plating along her hull at the water line to protect against sea water corrosion. In addition, the survey also located leaking rivets and identified a need to remove two of the battleship's propellers for repair purposes. For the next four months Massachusetts underwent repairs to correct these problems, including the addition of nearly [...] of steel to her hull and the addition of a compound known as Red Hand Epoxy to encase and protect the hull against further deterioration. In March 1999 Massachusetts emerged from her <b>dry</b> <b>docking</b> period and returned under tow to Battleship Cove, arriving at her berth at 15:30 13 March 1999 to a crowd of citizens, dignitaries, veterans, and civic officials.|$|E

500|$|On 13 January 1907, Connecticut ran onto a reef while {{entering}} the harbor at Culebra Island. The Navy did not release {{any information about}} the grounding until press dispatches from San Juan carrying news of the incident reached the mainland on 23 January. Even then, Navy authorities in San Juan claimed to be ignorant of the situation, and, that same day, the Navy Department itself said that they only knew that Captain Swift thought she had touched bottom and that {{an examination of the}} ship's bottom by divers had revealed no damage. The Navy amended this the next day, releasing a statement that Connecticut had been only slightly damaged and had returned to her shakedown cruise. However, damage to the ship was much more serious than the Navy admitted; in contrast to an official statement saying that Connecticut had only [...] "touched" [...] the rocks, she actually had run full upon the reef when traversing [...] "a course well marked with buoys" [...] in [...] "broad daylight" [...] and did enough damage to probably require a <b>dry</b> <b>docking.</b> This apparent attempt at a cover-up was enough for the United States Congress to consider an official inquiry into the matter.|$|E
