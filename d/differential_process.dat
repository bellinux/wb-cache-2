50|$|The moral self is a <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> wherein {{some people}} {{integrate}} moral values into their self-concept. This construct specifically refers to motivational processes. Research {{on the moral}} self has mostly focused on adolescence as a critical time period for the integration of self and morality, which {{gives rise to a}} moral self. In other words, self and morality are traditionally seen as separate constructs that become integrated in adolescence. However, the moral self may be established around 2-3 years-old. In fact, children as young as 5 years-old are able to consistently identify themselves as having certain moral behavioral preferences reflective of the two internally consistent dimensions of the moral self: preferences for prosocial and avoidance of anti-social behaviour. Children's moral self is also increasingly predictive of moral emotions with age. Finally, children's moral self may be a precursor to the development of one's moral identity, which formulates later in life.|$|E

While the relative price of storage has steadily decreased {{in the past}} decades, the amount of generated image and video data has increased exponentially.

The increased growth in network traffic and storage requirements means that data compression algorithms can have a large impact on data centres concerning bandwidth, physical storage space, and energy usage. This paper proposes an efficient data compression algorithm based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) together with several novel steps including the minimization of high-frequency components, a <b>differential</b> <b>process,</b> and a lookup table based search by concurrent binary algorithms at decompression stage.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the model}} of Bersted and Slee, and later Malkin and Teishev, which assumes a {{truncated}} power-law viscosity function and a nonlinear mixing rule with a constant exponent of 3. 4, Gordon and Shaw developed a differential method to determine the molecular weight distribution (MWD) from the viscosity data of polymer melts. However, the model is based on simplified assumptions and the <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> is sensitive to the quality of viscosity data. The purposes of this work were to derive the guidelines for the collection of viscosity data to ensure adequate performance of the <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> and to develop a new algorithm to increase the accuracy and the reliability of the MWD calculation from the viscosity data. ^ For the differential transformation of viscosity to MWD, a minimum point density and range is required to resolve bimodality. For given point density and range, the higher the superposition between the viscosity data and the 2 ̆ 2 knee 2 ̆ 2 in the viscosity function produced by each mode, the better the resolution. Testing time can be reduced and resolution can still be preserved by placing more points in the key region of the viscosity curve and by skipping the unnecessary points at low shear rates. ^ The nonlinear mixing rule was examined both experimentally by using real polymers and analytically. According to the theory-based quadratic mixing rule, the exponent α depends on the MWD of blends. For the middle range of the MWD, the nonlinear mixing rule, which assumes a constant α of 3. 4 for all shear rates and MWDs, is almost equivalent to the quadratic mixing rule. Thus the mixing-rule assumption of Bersted and Slee should be valid for practical applications. ^ Combining the self-consistent differential and integral approaches, we are able to resolve details of a MWD and quantify reasonably broad MWDs from many limited sets of viscosity data. The overemphasis of the high-molecular-weight end is due to the excitation of Rouse modes during the rheological measurements at high frequencies which hides the contribution of the low-molecular-weight components. A possible correction for this problem is to introduce a molecular-weight-independent Rouse dispersion at high frequencies in the simplified model. ...|$|E

However, we also require motion processing to be very sensitive to local velocity differences, so that moving objects appear sharply distinct from their background and specific differential properties of optic flow associated with the observer's motion can be detected.

40|$|It {{is still}} an open {{question}} whether psychotherapists adhere to their therapeutic conceptions in routine practice (clinician's treatment adherence) and thus {{to what extent the}} two most common approaches, cognitive-behavioural (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy (PDT), differ from each other as theoretically expected (treatment differentiation). This holds true especially in case of group therapy. The study compares essential process components of CBT and PDT group treatments under clinically representative conditions using non-participating observer ratings. Results demonstrate that CBT group therapists use more cognitive, behavioural and psychoeducational strategies, foster self-efficacy to a larger extent and are more supporting and empathetic. PDT group therapists use more interpretative and confrontative interventions and focus on interactional and dynamic aspects. The results strongly support that not only in individual psychotherapy-as shown in prior research-but also in the group setting do CBT and PDT reveal very distinct profiles and that therapists primarily abide by their theoretical training also in clinical practice. They allow one to identify <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> components of the group setting and to trace back parameters of outcome to the process of CBT and PDT for clinical routines...|$|E
40|$|Unobserved {{differences}} in individual's susceptibility to death {{are an important}} aspect {{in the analysis of}} contemporary mortality patterns. However, observed mortality rates at adult and old ages, which are usually well-described by a Gompertz curve, are often perceived inconsistent with frailty models of mortality. We therefore propose a modified DeMoivre hazard function that is suitable for the application of frailty models to adult and old ages. The proposed hazard increases faster than exponential, and when combined with unobserved frailty it can capture a broad range of patterns encountered in the analysis of adult mortality. Our application to Bulgaria during 1992 [...] 93 suggests that the stronger selection process in the male population, caused by an overall higher level of mortality, constitutes a primary mechanism leading to the convergence of male and female mortality at higher ages. Hence, the convergence between male and female mortality is not necessarily caused by a <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> of aging across sexes, but is merely a consequence of the different levels of mortality at adult ages.

However, this involvement {{has not been}} well-studied in the paradigm of macrophage polarization, which typically has been categorized by the dichotomy of classical (M 1) and alternative (M 2) statuses.

Here, through examination of viral infections targeting macrophages/monocytic cells, {{we focus on the}} direct involvement of macrophage polarization during viral infections. Type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are critical in regulation of viral pathogenesis and host antiviral infection; thus, we propose to incorporate IFN-mediated antiviral states into the framework of macrophage polarization. This view is supported by the multifunctional properties of type I IFNs, which potentially elicit and regulate both M 1 - and M 2 -polarization in addition to inducing the antiviral state, and by the discoveries of viral mechanisms to adapt and modulate macrophage polarization. Indeed, several recent studies have demonstrated effective prevention of viral diseases through manipulation of macrophage immune statuses...|$|E

Using an interdisciplinary approach and drawing from the personal narratives of multi-generational Chinese Australians, this paper seeks to address this gap by focusing on the childhood experiences of Chinese Australians who grew up in white Australia - a time when for many Chinese Australians being Chinese represented a distinct handicap or liability. This paper looks closely at the inscription of 'difference' in the lives of Chinese Australians that occurred in through social encounters that took place at the interface of mundane everyday life and the wider (white) Australian community, analysing this <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> in relation to the societal meanings with which 'Chineseness' was commonly imbued, and demonstrating the diverse ways that 'Chineseness' became inscribed in the lives of multi-generational Chinese Australians whether they saw themselves as 'Chinese' or not...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Chinese {{remainder}} theorem (CRT) reconstructs {{an integer}} from its multiple remainders that is well-known not robust {{in the sense}} that a small error in a remainder may cause a large error in the reconstruction. A robust CRT has been recently proposed when all the moduli have a common factor and the robust CRT is a searching based algorithm and no closed-from is given. In this paper, a closed-form robust CRT is proposed and a necessary and sufficient condition on the remainder errors for the closed-form robust CRT to hold is obtained. Furthermore, its performance analysis is given. It is shown that the reason for the robustness is from the remainder <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> in both searching based and our proposed closed-form robust CRT algorithms, which does no exist in the traditional CRT. We also propose an improved version of the closed-form robust CRT. Finally, we compare the performances of the traditional CRT, the searching based robust CRT and our proposed closed-form robust CRT (and its improved version) algorithms in terms of both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed closed-form robust CRT (its improved version has the best performance) has the same performance but much simpler form than the searching based robust CRT.

Furthermore, by virtue of the considerable reinforcement of means of communication, the diffusion of tourism has undergone an unprecedented acceleration and therefore the means of sourcing of information and opportunities of consumption have become numerous. In this direction, distributed hospitality needs investigated, considering that, at the current status, it is not fully understood in terms of inborn potentials by the local policy makers. In general, distributed hospitality represents a form of hospitality that is based on relations of a collaborative nature, especially suitable to generate virtual requalification processes on the territory of residential assets, of repositioning of the tourist destination, as well as reinforcing the attractiveness of the area. Moreover, even though different kinds of inter-company relations exist, the aggregation phenomenon appears to be the answer to the cognitive requirements and the means to activate a modern <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> on the market. The theme of sustainability of tourism development will therefore be faced through the identification of current forms of experience of diffused hotels that exist on an Italian level; subsequently, changing from some morphological indicators deducted by the Network Analysis, a model was proposed in the attempt to define the governance model of diffused hotels.

Alu data for other European, Caucasus and North African populations were compiled {{from the literature}} for comparison purposes to assess the genetic relationships of the Basques in a broader geographic context. Results of both MDS plot and AMOVA revealed spatial heterogeneity among these three population clusters clearly defined by geography. On the contrary, no substantial genetic heterogeneity {{was found between the}} Basque samples, or between Basques and other Europeans (excluding Caucasus populations). Moreover, the genetic information obtained from Alu data conflicts with hypotheses linking the origin of Basques with populations from North Africa (Berbers) or from the Caucasus region (Georgia). In order to explain the reduced genetic heterogeneity detected by Alu insertions among Basque subpopulations, values of the Wright's F-ST statistic were estimated for both Alu markers and a set of short tandem repeats (STRs) in terms of two geographical scales: (1) the Basque Country, (2) Europe (including Basques). In the Basque area, estimates of Wahlund's effect for both genetic markers showed no statistical difference between Basque subpopulations. However, when this analysis was performed on a European scale, F-ST values were significantly higher for Alu insertions than for STR alleles. From these results, we suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of the Basque gene pool identified in previous polymorphism studies is relatively recent and probably caused by a <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> of genetic admixture with non-Basque neighboring populations modulated by the effect of a linguistic barrier to random mating...|$|E

This study investigated the effect of chewing on alertness and cognitive performance across one night without sleep as well as the possible mediating role of cardiac autonomic activity. Fourteen adults participated in a randomized, counterbalanced protocol employing a chewing, placebo and caffeine condition. Participants completed tasks assessing psychomotor vigilance, tracking, grammatical reasoning, alertness and sleepiness each hour across the night. All participants received either placebo or caffeine (200 mg), while the chewing condition also chewed on a tasteless and odorless substance for 15 min each hour. Heart rate (HR), root mean square of the successive differences in R-R intervals on the ECG (RMSSD), and preejection period (PEP) were simultaneously recorded. Alertness and cognitive performance amongst the chewing condition did not differ or were in fact worse when compared with placebo. Similarly, measures of HR and RMSSD remained the same between these two conditions; however, PEP was reduced in the later part of the night in the chewing condition compared with a relative increase for placebo. Caffeine led to improved speed and accuracy on cognitive tasks and increased alertness when compared with chewing. Relative increases in RMSSD and reductions in HR were demonstrated following caffeine; however, no change in PEP was seen. Strong associations between cardiac parasympathetic activity and complex cognitive tasks, as well as between subjective alertness and simpler cognitive tasks, suggest a <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> mediating complex versus simple cognitive performance during sleep deprivation.

The presence of angular grains {{on the surface of}} Itokawa was not unexpected. However, the presence of rounded grains is a surprise. The presence of rounded rock or minerals in any geological setting on a planet indicates a geologically high-energy environment - one that is or was actively moving material resulting in mechanical weathering, which must be more than a one-time event in order to turn angular grains into rounded ones. Mechanical weathering of rocks or minerals is a <b>differential</b> <b>process</b> that in part depends on characteristics such as composition of the material {{and in the case of}} rocks the level of their lithification. Such geologically high-energy environments on planetary surfaces are produced by wind- or water-dominated geological settings, even ice-dominated such as glacial movement. However, on an airless body such as Itokawa, weathering of material on surfaces cannot be the product of movement of any kind of fluid, particularly on the surface of bodies. Whatever mechanism or combination of mechanisms produced the rounded grains, the young CRE ages of the returned grains indicate that they were formed or exposed near the surface relatively recently and science must explain their existence. We thus pose two questions directly related to the rounding of grains on airless bodies such as Itokawa: (1) What geologically high-energy environments exist or existed that could physically weather rock to produce rounded grains on the surface of an asteroid? (2) Does the overall physical shape and characteristics of the Itokawa particles constrain the dynamical evolution of Itokawa and, by extension, other asteroids? [...]...|$|E
