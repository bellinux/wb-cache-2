5000|$|A {{back course}} marker (BC) {{normally}} indicates the ILS back course {{final approach fix}} where approach descent is commenced. Its is identified by pairs of morse-code [...] "dots" [...] at 3000 Hz (95 pairs per minute), which will trigger the white light on a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> indicator, but with a different audio rhythm from an <b>inner</b> <b>marker</b> or en route marker.|$|R
5000|$|On {{some older}} <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receivers, {{instead of the}} [...] "O", [...] "M" [...] and [...] "I" [...] {{indicators}} (outer, middle, inner), the indicators are labeled [...] "A" [...] (or FM/Z), [...] "O" [...] and [...] "M" [...] (airway or Fan and Z marker, outer, middle). The airway marker was used to indicate reporting points along the centerline of now obsolete [...] "Red" [...] airways; this was sometimes a [...] "fan" [...] marker, whose radiated pattern was elongated at right angles across the airway course so an aircraft slightly off course would still receive it. A [...] "Z" [...] marker was sometimes located at low/medium frequency range sites to accurately denote station passage. As airway beacons used the same 3,000 Hz audio frequency as the <b>inner</b> <b>marker,</b> the [...] "A" [...] indicator on older receivers {{can be used to}} detect the <b>inner</b> <b>marker.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{specialized}} beacon used in aviation {{in conjunction with}} an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine distance to the runway. Marker beacons transmit on the dedicated frequency of 75 MHz. This type of beacon is slowly being phased-out and most new ILS installations have no <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R

50|$|On some installations, <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> {{operating}} at a carrier frequency of 75 MHz are provided. When the transmission from a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is received it activates an indicator on the pilot's instrument panel and {{the tone of}} the beacon is audible to the pilot. The distance from the runway at which this indication should be received is published in the documentation for that approach, together with the height at which the aircraft should be if correctly established on the ILS. This provides a check on the correct function of the glide slope. In modern ILS installations, a DME is installed, co-located with the ILS, to augment or replace <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b> A DME continuously displays the aircraft's distance to the runway.|$|R

50|$|Flight 128 {{departed}} Los Angeles at 17:37 Eastern Standard Time {{and operated}} to Cincinnati without incident. The flight was initially scheduled {{to make an}} Instrument Landing System approach to Greater Cincinnati Airport's runway 18. The outer <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> for runway 18 was operational, but the middle <b>marker</b> <b>beacon,</b> glide slope, and runway approach lights were inoperative. Under these conditions, proper procedure would be to maintain the minimum approach altitude of 1,290 feet {{above mean sea level}} until the pilots made visual contact with the runway.|$|R
50|$|The AN/MRN-3 was a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> set {{used by the}} Army Air Force {{during and}} after World War II, it was {{standardized}} 23 October 1943, and replaced SCR-241.|$|R
5000|$|FuBL 1 Used the Lorenz {{landing beam}} system. Consisted of the EBL 1 and EBL 2 {{receivers}} with display device ANF 2. The EBL 1 operated between 30 and 33 MHz {{and received the}} azimuth signals from a transmitter {{at the far end}} of the runway, The EBL 2 operated at 38 MHz and received the two <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> as the aircraft approached the threshold to land. The AFN 2 provided the pilot with a left/right display and a signal strength. The pilot could also hear the azimuth signal and the <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> in his headset. When the aircraft passed over the beacons a light was also illuminated in the cockpit.` ...|$|R
25|$|An {{investigation}} into the crash found the cause to be pilot error by the captain. Failure to receive the outer <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> signal (probably due to a fault that had developed in the receiver) was a contributory factor.|$|R
50|$|According to Article 1.107 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> {{is defined}} as A {{transmitter}} in the aeronautical radionavigation service which radiates vertically a distinctive pattern for providing position information to aircraft.|$|R
50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{particular}} type of VHF radio beacon used in aviation, usually in conjunction with an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine position along an established route to a destination such as a runway.|$|R
50|$|The DME/N or DME/P is an {{integral}} part of the MLS and is installed at all MLS facilities unless a waiver is obtained. This occurs infrequently and only at outlying, low density airports where <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> or compass locators are already in place.|$|R
5000|$|The LOM is {{becoming}} less important now that GPS navigation {{is well established}} in the aviation community. [...] Some countries, such as Canada, have abandoned <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> completely, replacing the outer marker with a non-directional beacon (NDB); and, more recently, with GPS fixes.|$|R
50|$|Each system {{requires}} three <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> sets, one to {{be located}} in the airport runway boundary, one at approximately one mile from the approach end of the runway, and one 4.5 miles from the approach end of the runway, all on the center line of the runway to be used. The equipment transmits a vertical pattern to be received by the RC-43, RC-193, or AN/ARN-8, AN/ARN-12. A signal, amplitude modulated at 1,300 cycles per second, may be keyed at two dashes per second, six dots per second, or may be unkeyed. The <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> transmitter projects a vertical fan-shaped pattern to a height of approximately 3,000 feet. The transmitter is placed so that the longer horizontal axis is perpendicular to the line of approach.|$|R
50|$|The term {{fan marker}} {{refers to the}} older type of beacons used mostly for {{en-route}} navigation. Fan-type <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> were sometimes part of a non-precision approach and are identified by a flashing white light and a repeating dot-dash-dot signal. Recent editions of the FAA's AIM publication no longer mention fan markers.|$|R
25|$|Radio {{aeronautical}} navigation aids (Navaids) {{use other}} frequencies. Non-directional beacons (NDB)s operate on low frequency and medium frequency bands between 190–415kHz and 510–535kHz. The Instrument landing system (ILS) glide path operates in the UHF frequency range of 329.3–335.0MHz with <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> at 75 MHZ. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) also uses UHF from 962–1150MHz.|$|R
5000|$|NDBs {{are most}} {{commonly}} used as markers or [...] "locators" [...] for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach or standard approach. NDBs may designate the starting area for an ILS approach or a path to follow for a standard terminal arrival procedure, or STAR. In the United States, an NDB is often combined with the outer <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> in the ILS approach (called a locator outer marker, or LOM); in Canada, low-powered NDBs have replaced <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> entirely. Marker beacons on ILS approaches are now being phased out worldwide with DME ranges used instead to delineate the different segments of the approach. German Navy U-boats during World War II were equipped with a Telefunken Spez 2113S homing beacon. This transmitter could operate on 100 kHz to 1500 kHz with a power of 150 W. It was used to send the submarine's location to other submarines or aircraft, which were equipped with DF receivers and loop antennas.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft use DME to {{determine}} their distance from a land-based transponder by sending and receiving pulse pairs - two pulses of fixed duration and separation. The ground stations are typically collocated with VORs or ILS systems. A low-power DME can be collocated with an ILS glide slope antenna installation where it provides an accurate distance to touchdown function, similar to that otherwise provided by ILS <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, markers were used {{extensively}} along airways {{to provide an}} indication of an aircraft's specific position along the route, but from the 1960s they have become increasingly limited to ILS approach installations. They are now very gradually being phased out of service, especially in more developed parts of the world, as GPS and other technologies have made <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> increasingly obsolete.|$|R
50|$|The VAR bridged the {{technological}} {{gap between the}} Low-Frequency Radio Range (LFR) radio navigation system and the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation system. VAR provided four courses for navigation, two using visual instrument signals functionally and technically similar to the modern localizer and backbeam components used in the ILS system and two using audio signals similar to the LFR system. VAR also used <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> similar to the ILS.|$|R
50|$|The RC-43-A (BC-357) is a UHF {{receiver}} {{which provides}} a visual indication when flying over a 75-MHz <b>marker</b> <b>beacon.</b> it operates {{in the frequency of}} 67 to 80 MHz. The receiver box is located with other radio equipment and lights a lamp on the pilot's instrument panel when over the beacon. the RC-43 is 24 volts, the RC-39 is 12 volts. the unit uses a fixed wire antenna.|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{the outer}} and middle markers; located at the {{beginning}} (threshold) of the runway on some ILS approach systems (usually Category II and III) having decision heights of less than 200 ft AGL. Triggers a flashing white light on the same <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver used for the outer and middle markers; also a series of audio tone 'dots' at a frequency of 3,000 Hz in the headset.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how differential GPS (DGPS) and miniature, low-cost Integ-rity Beacon pseudolites {{were used to}} carry out 110 successful automatic landings of a United Airlines Boeing 737 aircraft. These autopilot-in-the-loop flight tests using GPS Integrity <b>Beacons</b> (low-power, ground-based <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> pseudolites placed under the approach path) furnished evidence that GPS can provide the full performance necessary to meet the stringent specifications of Category III. The built-in geometrical redundancy provided by Integrity Beacon ranging is coupled with centimeter-level accuracy to provide the system integrity. This integrity-calculated {{to be better than}} one part in a billion probability of missed detection-is achieved independently from ground-based monitors using receiver autonomous integrity monitoring @AIM) ...|$|R
50|$|NDBs {{typically}} {{operate in}} the frequency range from 190 kHz to 535 kHz (although they are allocated frequencies from 190 to 1750 kHz) and transmit a carrier modulated by either 400 or 1020 Hz. NDBs can also be collocated with a DME in a similar installation for the ILS as the outer marker, only in this case, they function as the <b>inner</b> <b>marker.</b> NDB owners are mostly governmental agencies and airport authorities.|$|R
50|$|Using VNsight imagery {{blended with}} the {{standard}} M-PNVS forward looking infrared (FLIR) imagery, pilots can see lighting that was previously unviewable in low-light conditions. This includes lasers, <b>markers,</b> <b>beacons,</b> and tracer rounds, which were not accurately registered with the thermal image over the full sensor field of view. The VNsight upgrade ensures safer flying conditions and enhanced mission capability (especially in urban environments) by improving situation awareness in low-light-level conditions and situations where existing light sources cannot be imaged by the FLIR. It also allows the aircrew to see their own laser spot while designating targets for laser guided munition engagements, providing an extra level of certainty that the correct target and aim-point are designated. Enhanced air-to-ground communication reduces the potential for blue on blue incidents.|$|R
50|$|Two small <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> {{were also}} used: one 300 m {{off the end}} of runway, the HEZ (Haupteinflugzeichen), and another 3 km away, the VEZ (Voreinflugzeichen), both were {{broadcast}} on 38 MHz and modulated at 1700 and 700 Hz, respectively. These signals were broadcast directly upward, and would be heard briefly as the aircraft flew over them. To approach the runway, the pilot would fly to a published altitude and then use the main directional signals to line up with the runway and started flying toward it. When he flew over the VEZ he would start descending on a standard glide slope, continuing to land or abort at the HEZ depending on whether or not he could see the runway.|$|R

500|$|The {{aircraft}} was using instrument flight rules (IFR) and Torghatten {{was covered in}} fog. The visibility was within the permitted range of IFR. The commission found five errors on Widerøe's maps which could have influenced the accident. This included a formulation which gave the impression that DMR was not in use; a closed [...] "Torget" [...] <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> {{was still on the}} maps; a vertical flight plan from Lekan was not included; the height limitations in the accident area were noted through comments rather than through a graphical presentation; and confusion as to when the timing of final approach should start. The commission also criticized the airline for its checklists instructing the pilots to one of VHF channels to the company frequency during descent, at a time when non-safety-related communication is unwanted.|$|R
50|$|The Outer Marker, which {{normally}} identifies the {{final approach fix}} (FAF), is situated on the same course/track as the localizer and the runway center-line, four to seven nautical miles before the runway threshold. It is typically located about 1 NM km inside {{the point where the}} glideslope intercepts the intermediate altitude and transmits a 400 Hz tone signal on a low-powered (3 watts), 75 MHz carrier signal. Its antenna is highly directional, and is pointed straight up. The valid signal area is a 2400 ft × 4200 ft ellipse (as measured 1000 ft above the antenna.) When the aircraft passes over the outer marker antenna, its <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver detects the signal. The system gives the pilot a visual (blinking blue outer marker light) and aural (continuous series of audio tone morse code-like 'dashes') indication.|$|R
50|$|Lorenz {{could fly}} a plane down a {{straight}} line with relatively high accuracy, enough so that the aircraft could then find the runway visually {{in all but the}} worst conditions. However it required a fairly constant monitoring of the radio by the pilot, who would often also be tasked with talking to the local control tower. In order to ease the workload, Lorenz later introduced a cockpit indicator that could listen to the signals and display the direction to the runway centerline as an arrow telling the pilot which direction to turn. The indicator also included two neon lamps to indicate when the aircraft crossed over each of the <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b> Later derivatives of the system had signals of equal length in the pattern left-right-silence, to operate a visual indicator in the cabin.|$|R

25|$|Ownership of {{the airport}} passed to the CAA and the state from September 1959. This coincided with a new taxiway from the runway {{and the opening of}} the {{instrument}} landing system (ILS). This could only be used on runway 25. The Vigra Transmitter was situated in the way for the other direction. The ILS was installed without an <b>inner</b> <b>marker.</b> The tarmac was extended in 1960 {{to make way for a}} general aviation section near the control tower. Due to sinking of the runway it had to be re-asphalted the following year.|$|R
25|$|The {{radio range}} system had {{recently}} been calibrated twice and the commission found {{nothing wrong with the}} navigational aids. On the other hand, the aircraft's equipment had been turned to compass instead of antenna. This would have made the beam north of the cone of silence twenty degrees wide instead of four. Although not decisive, it was cited as giving the pilot a disadvantage in navigation. The aircraft's radio range equipment also lacked a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver, due to lack of sufficient parts. This forced the pilots to manually calculate the distance to the beacon. The crew carried out the procedural turn in the right area, but should, according to their route instruction book, have been at no lower an altitude than , thus the aircraft was too low, caused by the let-down being started too early.|$|R
2500|$|The {{doors closed}} at 15:58 and at 16:00 Key {{requested}} pushback. At 16:03 BE 548 was cleared to taxi to the holding point {{adjacent to the}} start of Runway 27 Right. During taxi, at 16:06 the flight received its departure route clearance: a routing known as the [...] "Dover One Standard Instrument Departure". This Standard Instrument Departure involved taking-off to the west over the Instrument Landing System localiser and middle <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> of the reciprocal Runway 09 Left, turning left to intercept the 145° bearing to the Epsom Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) (to be passed at [...] or more), and then proceeding to Dover. Key advised the tower that he was ready for take-off and was cleared to do so. He subsequently reported an unspecified technical problem and remained at the holding point for two minutes to resolve it.|$|R
