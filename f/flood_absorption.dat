50|$|Beervlei Dam is a dam in the Groot River, Eastern Cape, South Africa. It was {{established}} in 1957, has a capacity of , and a surface area of 23.145 km2, and the dam wall is 31 m high. The main purpose of the dam is to provide <b>flood</b> <b>absorption.</b> The Karoo sediments in the area contain a lot of salts {{and it has been}} found that lengthy storage of water results in high water salinity. Any flood water is used as quickly as possible by the downstream irrigators and the reservoir is kept empty for extended periods.|$|E

An inflow of over [...] was measured into the Vaal Dam which was already at full capacity due to good rains {{and it was only}} through the expert management of the Hydrology staff at DWAF that the maximum flood released from the dam was limited to [...] Flows above [...] would have caused serious damage downstream of Vaal Dam and the situation during the 1996 flood became extremely tense as the storage in the reservoir peaked at 118.5% of Full Supply Capacity on 19 February 1996 i.e. only [...] of <b>flood</b> <b>absorption</b> capacity remained before the full inflow would have been released causing massive damage.|$|E
50|$|The three lakes, {{also called}} the Slam Pe in the local Tay ethnic language, that form Ba Bể lake are called the Pé Lầm, Pé Lù, and Pé Lèng; all linked as one waterbody. The lake’s central part is {{contracted}} while its outer two parts are wider. The lake's hilly catchment drains 3 rivers into the lake, namely, the Tả Han, Nam Cường and Cho Leng rivers from south and west and is drained by the Năng River flowing to the north. The lake water is very clear with blue colour, {{and it is a}} flowing lake with a velocity maintained by controls at 0.5 m/s. The lake acts as a <b>flood</b> <b>absorption</b> reservoir during the high flow stages of the Năng River when reverse flow occurs from the river into the lake, preventing flooding in the Nang, Gam and Lô river deltas. The Năng River flows southwards, eventually joining the Lô River in southern Tuyên Quang Province, before debouching in the Red River west of Hanoi.|$|E
40|$|A {{plan for}} {{protecting}} nature and inspiring {{people across the}} West of England The Big Picture 1 Our vision is to enable nature to ‘recover on a grand scale’ 1, {{and over the next}} five years we will be working towards three goals that will make our vision a reality. We will deliver our goals at two levels. First, we will focus most of our effort within five landscape-scale areas prioritised for their conservation need and their potential for community engagement. Each area also offers valuable ‘ecosystem services’, such as: the provision of clean drinking water; <b>flood</b> alleviation; <b>absorption</b> of greenhouse gases; pollination services and health and wellbeing. Second, we will work to create connecting corridors for wildlife across the region. Both will be supported by generic work at an Avon-wide scale, such as reserve management and education.

40|$|Sealed {{nickel cadmium}} cells having {{undergone}} {{a large number}} of cycles were discharged using the Hg/HgO reference electrode. The negative electrode exhibited the second plateau. SEM of negative plates of such cells show clusters of large crystals of cadmium hydroxide. These large crystals on the negative plates disappear after continuous overcharging in <b>flooded</b> cells. Atomic <b>Absorption</b> Spectroscopy and standard wet chemical methods are being used to determine the cell materials viz: nickel, cadmium, cobalt, potassum and carbonate. The anodes and cathodes are analyzed after careful examination and the condition of the separator material is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Better {{understanding}} {{and evaluation of}} ecosystem services are important for applying the correct model of regional development planning. Using the physical assessment method (PAM) and the value assessment method (VAM), the ecosystem services in Lugu Lake watershed, including product supply, soil conservation, water conservation, CO, absorption, 0, release, nutrient cycle, flood storage and ecotourism, were evaluated and analysed. The {{results show that the}} total economic value of these ecosystem services was 500. 68 X 10 (6) Yuan/a (at comparable prices in 2004); ecotourism was the major component of ecosystem services, accounting for 41. 6 %; the values of 02 release, <b>flood</b> storage, CO, <b>absorption</b> and water conservation accounted for 28. 1, 13. 7, 7. 7, and 5. 5 %, respectively; the value of product supply accounted for only 2. 4 % and, therefore, was not a major part of watershed ecosystem services. Sustainable development of ecotourism and long-term preservation of the functions of 0, release and flood storage need to be assured for realising ecosystem services of Lugu Lake watershed...|$|R
30|$|The {{environmental}} conditions of any lake system {{depend upon the}} nature of that lake and its exposure to various environmental factors. Hence, surface water quality depends not only on natural processes (precipitation inputs, erosion, and weathering of crustal material, etc.) but also on anthropogenic influences (urban, industrial, and agricultural activities) (Papatheodorou et al. 2006). Their fragile ecosystem must maintain the state of environmental equilibrium with the existing surroundings particularly from a special prospective of human encroachment and pollution. However, in recent decades, population growth, agricultural practices and sewage runoff from urban areas have increased nutrient inputs many folds to the level of their natural occurrence, resulting in accelerated eutrophication (Choudhary et al. 2010; Zan et al. 2010). The lakes and reservoirs, all over India without exception, are in varying degrees of environmental degradation, might be due to encroachments, eutrophication (from domestic and industrial effluents) and silt. There has been a quantum jump in population during the last century without corresponding expansion of civic facilities resulting in lakes and reservoirs, especially the urban ones, becoming sinks for contaminants. Most urban and rural lakes have vanished under this pressure with worldwide environmental concerns (Iscen et al. 2008; Prasanna et al. 2010). However, in those lakes that could endure, drinking water supply is either substantially reduced or is non-potable, <b>flood</b> <b>absorption</b> capacity impaired, biodiversity threatened and there is diminished fish production (Zhang et al. 2009). The main reasons which resulted in impaired conditions of the lakes could be categorized into two classes namely, (a) pollutants entering from fixed point sources (viz., nutrients from wastewater, from municipal and domestic effluents; organic, inorganic and toxic pollutants from industrial effluents and storm water runoff) (b) pollutants entering from non-point sources (viz., nutrients through fertilizers, toxic pesticides and other chemicals, mainly from agriculture runoff; organic pollution from human settlements spread over areas along the periphery of the lakes and reservoirs).|$|E
40|$|Earth as a {{building}} material {{is a very}} sustainable construction option. The vulnerability of earthen buildings to water action by rain, <b>floods</b> or capillary <b>absorption</b> is the main concern, especially in countries with a high rainfall. The historical earthen buildings that have survived these actions until today demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to build durable earthen constructions. A successfully used technique in ancient buildings is the incorporation of natural products with water resistant properties, such as oils, fats and other materials generally referred to as biopolymers. Another common practice has been the use of lime (slaked or quicklime) for stabilizing soils. The main aim of this research is to improve the resistance of compressed soil against rainwater action. For this purpose, ancient and contemporary knowledge was analysed. Different mixtures of stabilized soil were studied in order to test the effects of quicklime, oils and a mineral additive. The main results obtained in this research showed that quicklime leads to increased performance in compressive strength and significantly reduced erosion in the accelerated erosion test of rain simulation. This study provides a contribution to the scientific knowledge required to achieve increased durability for new earth buildings, as well as for conservation of existing earthen construction heritage, preserving the sustainability of the construction. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} engineering industry often requires {{people to work}} in hazardous environments and to operate complicated equipment which often limits the type of training that be carried out on site. The daily job of chemical plant operators is becoming more demanding due to the increasing plant complexity together with increasing requirements on plant safety, production capacity, product quality and cost effectiveness. The importance of designing systems and environments that are as safe as possible to educate and train personnel is vital for the chemical process industries. Virtual reality offers the potential to expose personnel to hazardous situations in a safe, highly visual and interactive manner. Virtual reality has been proposed as a technological breakthrough that holds the power to facilitate learning. The ability to visualise complex and dynamic systems involving personnel, equipment and layouts during any real operation is a potential advantage of such an approach. Virtual reality and multimedia training is commonly used in many industries, aiding understanding and memory retention and creating a more interactive learning experience. Four desktop virtual reality training environments were developed for this research which highlighted issues related to chemical process dynamic simulation and plant safety. The pump training system is a virtual reality environment, which was built using the SAFE-VR virtual engine, to train personnel to operate two centrifugal pumps. The virtual hazard spotting exercise focuses on improving the users' safety awareness of electrical and occupational hygiene hazards. The virtual boiler plant is a complicated and high detailed virtual training environment, which is characterised by its flexibility and by a real time dynamic simulation of the steam generation chemical process. The virtual <b>flooding</b> and gas <b>absorption</b> experiment {{was based on an}} undergraduate laboratory experiment for the Chemical Engineering degree course at the University of Nottingham, focusing primarily on training and safety issues of students using the equipment. The dynamic features of the virtual absorption column simulation give high level of realism in the virtual environment...|$|R
