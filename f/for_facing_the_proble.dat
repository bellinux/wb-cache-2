40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{an idea of}} recognizing <b>the</b> human <b>face</b> in <b>the</b> presence of strong facial expressions using model based approach. The features extracted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image sequences can be efficiently used <b>for</b> <b>face</b> recognition. <b>The</b> approach follows in 1) modeling an active appearance model (AAM) parameters <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image, 2) using optical flow based temporal features for facial expression variations estimation, 3) and finally applying classifier <b>for</b> <b>face.</b> <b>The</b> novelty lies not only in generation of appearance models which is obtained by fitting active shape model (ASM) to <b>the</b> <b>face</b> image using objective functions but also using a feature vector which is the combination of shape, texture and temporal parameters that is robust against facial expression variations. Experiments have been performed on Cohn-Kanade facial expression database using 62 subjects of the database with image sequences consisting of more than 4000 images. This achieved successful face recognition rate up to 91. 17 % using binary decision tree (BDT), 98. 6 % using Bayesian Networks (BN) with 10 -fold cross validation {{in the presence of}} six different facial expressions...|$|R
