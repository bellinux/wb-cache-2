Focusing on the demand side of the economy, the IMF has neglected another important cause of the financial imbalances in African economies, namely the loss of import capacity and the related reduction in output resulting from external shocks. Furthermore, the IMF policy underestimates the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> and the inflexibilities in African economies.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of database marketing by firms has increased rapidly in many industries. Indeed, with increasing costs {{of marketing and}} <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets,</b> database marketing is overtaking mass marketing. The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop a framework for database marketing strategies that will help marketers and marketing researchers to better understand this mode of marketing. This paper uses interview research to build a theory about types of marketing strategies that are most suitable for implementation using a customer database. The findings of the research show that while cross-selling is an important promotional strategy in database marketing, prospecting is not. Furthermore, only two of the product strategies identified in the mainstream marketing literature, that is, new product development for customers and product modifications for customers, are frequently used in database marketing. The other two strategies of new product development for prospects and product modifications for prospects are not used by most firms. Furthermore, while the promotional strategy of cross-selling was popular, prospecting was not. It was concluded that organisations use their database to implement certain strategies because the data is available to do so and because it is the most effective way to implement a strategy. Other strategies are not implemented because they are not appropriate for an organisation's operations, or because they believe that their existing non-database strategies are effective, rather than for reasons related to the database itself...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{due to an}} {{increasing}} saturation and <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> and the subsequent competition of communications, marketers are confronted with the decreasing effectiveness of their classic marketing communications (Wohlfeil and Whelan 2004). As a consequence, event-marketing has become a popular alternative for marketers that creates 3 -dimensional brand-related realities by staging marketing-events, in which consumers are actively involved on a behavioural level (Zanger and Sistenich 1996). However, as a pull strategy within marketing communications, event-marketing strategies must be designed {{in a way that}} consumers are motivated to participate voluntarily. Thus, marketers must have an understanding of the needs consumers seek to satisfy by participating in marketing-events. As consumer behaviour in affluent societies is largely driven by the intrinsic pursuit of happiness and enjoyment of life right here and now (Opaschowski 1998) to compensate for the deficits in consumers’ everyday lives (Mitchell 1988), event-marketing is setting up the stage for consumers to experience flow (Drengner 2003), to take on roles that differ from their everyday lives (Sistenich and Zanger 1999) and even become part of the social community that they associate with the brand (McAlexander et al. 2002) or the event-content (Bauer et al. 2003). However, while previous research in event-marketing focused in detail on its effectiveness (Drengner 2003; Lasslop 2003; Nufer 2002), consumers’ predispositional involvement and their motivations to participate in marketing-events, which is crucial to the subsequent communicative success, has not been addressed in literature so far. To narrow this information gap, this research has developed a conceptual framework of how event-marketing works by proposing that consumers’ motivations to participate in marketing-events are determined by at least one of four types of predispositional involvement, which represent the long-lasting personal relevance of either the event-object (brand), the event-content (dramaturgy), event-marketing (communication strategy) or social interaction (brand community) for the consumer...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} {{research is}} to explore new forms of cultural production that are currently transforming the global marketplace cultures of today. Prior research {{has given rise to}} a number of viewpoints on how we should think about the accelerating globalization of markets and what particular cultural dynamics are at play in shaping the constantly evolving marketplace cultures. These include approaches stressing the logics of cultural assimilation or adaptation, models of cultural globalization and glocalization as well as the postmodern <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets.</b> This thesis maps out central tendencies in cultural theory regarding these approaches and directs attention to the logics of ‘translocal’ cultural production, emphasizing the role of translocal practices and communities as central constituents of transnational marketplace cultures. Digitalized and neo-tribal forms of cultural production are investigated as particular empirical examples of such emerging modes of translocal marketplace cultures. In addition, the thesis elaborates on new methods and a conceptual perspective suitable for their study. Four essays interrogate a series of interlinked research issues and form the main output of this doctoral research. Two of the essays are methodological and two empirical illustrations of the proposed methods. Essay I investigates how netnographic methods can offer {{a better understanding of the}} transnational nature of online cultural phenomena and argues that a better understanding of the new ‘translocal sites’, such as transnational online communities and consumer networks, can open up new research opportunities on an increasingly global consumer culture. Essay II gives an empirical illustration of netnographic methods and investigates the nature of translocal cultural production in web-based communities by examining new forms of environmental dialogue and political participation in a global traveller website. Essay III explores how videographic methods can be used in the study of consumer and marketplace cultures, thus paving the way for the final Essay IV in which videography is applied in a multi-sited ethnography of a translocal, neo-tribal consumer culture in extreme sports. Empirical insights are based on two primary sets of data: netnographic data gathered from online community (Essays II) and ethnographic data gathered from five countries (Essay IV). The findings demonstrate that, most importantly, consumer culture and markets can no longer be conceived or studied only in terms of national, territorial, geographical or locally bound identity or community. This research argues that a distinctive cultural logic which is inherently translocal, i. e. transnational but local in various localities and sites, is currently transforming marketplace cultures. It views markets as gradually disintegrated, rootless and de-territorial entities that are connected primarily through sociability established via translocal practices. These practices on the other hand are constantly being produced, negotiated and contested in transnational communities of people, including online communities, gathered around particular consumption activities. Regarding the existing literature, the proposed perspective calls attention to the ultimate site of the marketplace, re-conceptualizing it as continuously evolving and translocal ‘social site’ in which participants engage in. Building on practice theory, this site consists of both mental and bodily practice elements (such as doings and sayings) as well as material arrangements (setups of material objects which compose the entities where practices are carried out). This site is neither static nor bound to a location and therefore by studying it new fruitful research possibilities opens up into global marketplace cultures. In addition, new research methods including netnography and videography are proposed that are particularly suitable for analyzing translocal marketplace phenomena...|$|E

40|$|Die vorliegende Doktorarbeit führt eine empirische Studie zum Einfluss der Unternehmenskomplexität auf den Unternehmenserfolg durch. In der einleitenden theoretischen Diskussion wird das Phänomen der Komplexität ausführlich diskutiert und besonders der Zusammenhang zwischen Globalisierung und Komplexität erläutert. Es werden sechs zentrale Dilemmata identifiziert, welche durch das {{intensive}} Zusammenwirken beider Phänomene für Unternehmen entstehen und in der Praxis fundamentale Herausforderungen für Unternehmen darstellen. - Zersplitterung der Märkte contra Skaleneffekte - Mehrmarken-und Vertriebskanalkonflikte contra interne Kooperation - Lokale Führung contra Standardisierung von Prozessen - Kurzfristige Profitabilität contra Nachhaltigkeit - Strategische Flexibilität contra dominante Logik - Konzentration auf Kernkompetenzen contra Wissensakkumulation. Die Ausführungen zeigen, dass es zwei unterschiedliche theoretische Ansätze zum Umgang mit gestiegener Unternehmensumweltkomplexität gibt (Luhmann vs. Ashby). In der theoretischen Diskussion der Arbeit wird daher eine Unterscheidung zwischen marktgetriebener und organisationsgetriebener Unternehmenskomplexität vorgenommen. Dadurch wird es möglich den theoretischen „Widerspruch“ zu entschärfen. Um diese theoretischen Überlegungen empirisch zu testen, wurde im Rahmen der Dissertation ein umfassendes Messmodell für die Unternehmenskomplexität entwickelt. Es umfasst 38 Indikatoren, welche die vier zentralen Komplexitätsdimensionen nach Steger (2008) - Diversity, Interdependence, Ambiguity und Fast flux - reflektiv abbilden. Basierend auf Unternehmenskennzahlen von 305 Unternehmen wird eine empirische Studie durchgeführt die sich auf die marktgetriebene Unternehmenskomplexität konzentriert. Mit Hilfe einer explorativen Faktorenanalyse werden im ersten Schritt die Dimensionen der Unternehmenskomplexität extrahiert und die Multidimensionalität des Komplexitätsphänomens bestätigt. Im Detail werden folgende sechs Dimensionen (Treiber) der marktgetriebenen Unternehmenskomplexität identifiziert: Größe, Wertschöpfungstiefe/Forschungsintensität, organisationaler Wandel, technologische Intensität, geografische Diversifikation und Produktdiversifikation. Im zweiten Schritt wird der Zusammenhang zwischen marktgetriebene Unternehmenskomplexität und Unternehmenserfolg mit Hilfe eines Strukturgleichungsmodells getestet. Ashbys Postulat der Komplexitätsentsprechung kann für die marktgetriebene Unternehmenskomplexität bestätigt werden, da ein positiver Zusammenhang identifiziert wurde. Bei der Durchführung eines weiterführenden Multigruppenvergleichs können keine signifikanten Unterschiede in der Stärke dieses Zusammenhanges bei verschieden Komplexitätsgraden der Unternehmenskomplexität bestätigt werden. Wenn Unternehmen also mit wachsender Umweltkomplexität konfrontiert sind, ist eine Erhöhung der marktgetriebenen Unternehmenskomplexität sinnvoll (Ashby). Gleichzeitig ist aber auch darauf zu achten, die organisationsgetriebene Unternehmenskomplexität zu reduzieren (Luhmann). The thesis {{presents a}} theoretical {{discussion about the}} measurement of organizational complexity, {{as well as an}} empirical study. In the beginning, a general definition of complexity is given, and the relationship between complexity and globalization is examined. It is found that globalization and complexity are two highly interlinked phenomena and that they create the following major dilemmas for organizations. • <b>Fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> vs. economies of scale, • Multi-brand/channel conflict vs. internal cooperation, • Local leadership vs. standardized processes, • Short term profitability vs. long-term sustainability, • Strategic flexibility vs. dominant logic, • Core competencies vs. knowledge accumulation. These dilemmas express the fundamental challenges in coping with growing complexity in practice. The theoretical discussion in the thesis shows that there is no clear theoretical recommendation on how organizations can cope with growing complexity. The postulates given by Ashby and Luhmann lead to an inconsistency that current research {{has not been able to}} solve. Consequently, the hypothesis that organizations should enhance (Ashby) or reduce (Luhmann) organizational complexity to cope with growing complexity in the business environment are discussed theoretically and tested empirically in this thesis. The theoretical discussion required a differentiation between market-driven and organization-driven complexity, which enables a partial reconciliation of the inconsistency. If increasing business environment complexity challenges organizations, they should carefully enhance the market-driven complexity of the organization and be aware of the value-creating and non-value creating character of this category of organizational complexity. Furthermore, to ensure success, they should reduce organization-driven complexity. To empirically test this theoretical framework, a comprehensive model for measuring organizational complexity is developed. The empirical study focuses on market-driven complexity and is based on a data sample of 305 organizations. Firstly, an Exploratory Factor Analysis is performed to identify the underlying dimensions (drivers) of market-driven complexity and to examine the theoretical assumptions of the four major drivers. It is found that market-driven complexity is driven by six factors: size, depth and breadth, organizational change, technological intensity, globalization, product diversification. Secondly, a Structural Equation Model is designed to test the relationship between market-driven complexity and organizational performance. It shows that Ashby is right in his assumptions in regard to market-driven complexity. A positive relationship between market-driven organizational complexity and organizational performance is confirmed. In contrast to the theoretical assumption that this relationship would vary between different levels of market-driven organizational complexity, no significant differences is found. Furthermore, the Structural Equation Model confirms that the relationships between the drivers and the construct of market-driven complexity are significant and therewith confirm the multi-dimensionality of the construct. Thus, researchers should not limit their models to one overarching complexity indicator, but should rather incorporate multivariate drivers. On the level of the drivers, significant differences are found and it is noted that, for example, the driver product diversification has a negative impact on organizational performance if the level of market-driven complexity increases. Only in the lowest complexity group the influence on performance is positive. Besides that, the multi-group comparison shows that the several dimensions of organizational performance are affected in different ways and on distinct levels of market-driven complexity. In particular, it shows that growing market-driven complexity leads to significantly lower increases of shareholder value in highly complex organizations than in low complex ones. This thesis has far reaching implications for the theory of complexity science. First, the presented distinction between market-driven and organization-driven complexity allows for a partial reconciliation of the inconsistent approaches to how to respond to growing complexity in the system (business) environment. Second, the thesis contributes to the advancement of complexity theory by establishing a solid basis for future empirical studies...|$|E
