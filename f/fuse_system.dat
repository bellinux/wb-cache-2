5000|$|The M31 HEAT is a fin-stabilized {{anti-tank}} {{rifle grenade}} {{designed in the}} late 1950s to replace the Belgian ENERGA rifle grenade which {{was adopted by the}} US Army and US Marines as an emergency stop-gap measure during the Korean War. Like the ENERGA, it has a nose-initiated, based-detonated HEAT warhead, but unlike the ENERGA, the mechanical impact <b>fuse</b> <b>system</b> is replaced with a less complex and more reliable piezo-electric <b>fuse</b> <b>system</b> which also allows higher angles of impact, up to 65 degrees. On impact, the nose cover collapses, crushing a crystal-like material, which sends an electric current through a separate wire to the warhead's detonator, located in the base of the warhead. A mechanical safety, comprising a set back system located in the warhead's base, grounds the firing circuit and prevents the accidental explosion of the warhead. On firing, the sudden launch acceleration causes the set-back's three disks to rotate 90 degrees, each in succession to the other, with the rotation of the third disk removing the grounding after approximately 10 meters of flight and completing a firing circuit for the current to flow from the nose to the detonator in the base. Compared to the ENERGA, the M31 is slightly lighter in weight and has a smaller-diameter warhead—i.e. 75mm vs 66mm. Penetration for the M31 is estimated to be 200 mm / 8 inches for steel armor plating [...] and twice that estimate for concrete. The warhead technology developed for the M31 was used for the future M72 LAW antitank rocket.|$|E

A soldier would remove the antitank grenade from its sack, pull the pin, and throw it gripping the mop-head as the handle. This was dangerous, as there was no arming safety after release and the thrower could strike something in his back swing before release. Penetration was reportedly only around 50 mm.|$|E

What made the 120mm [...] "Espin" [...] unique was the electrical impact fusing system which totally eliminated dangerous duds. The system operates on a capacitor in each submunition which is charged by a wind generator {{in the nose}} of the projectile after being fired. If for what ever reason the electrical fuse fails to function on impact, approximately 5 minutes later the capacitor bleeds out, therefore neutralizing the submunition's electronic <b>fuse</b> <b>system.</b> Later a similar mortar round was offered in the 81mm caliber and equipped some Spanish Marine units.

Amended Protocol II relates to mines, booby traps and other devices and is not relevant to the legal status of cluster munitions. Instalaza may not sell any patents related to the bomb.

5000|$|In 1915, {{industries}} of the German Empire designed and began {{production of the}} original Stielhandgranate, appropriately named Model 1915. The Model 15 Stielhandgranate utilized a priming system, unlike many others of the time. Most grenades of the period used the percussion cap pin, a <b>fuse</b> <b>system</b> quite different {{to that of the}} Stielhandgranate. The easily recognizable [...] "potato masher" [...] shape is a result of a number of different styles and choices of the design. The grenade mounted a charge head within a steel sheet cylinder atop a long hollow wooden handle. Internally, the explosive filler - initially ammonal but later approximately 170 g of trinitrotoluene filling) was connected to a detonator, and a pull cord ran from the detonator {{down the length of the}} hollow handle, emerging from the base. To use, a soldier would simply pull the string downwards, dragging a rough steel rod through the igniter within the fuse. The rod's abrasive contact would cause sparks and a flame to light from within, setting the fuse burning. This fuse took approximately four and a half seconds to reach the detonator before exploding.|$|E

The results of the investigations have shown that deformational characteristics (F, N and H max, mm) in longitudinal and transverse directions differ {{with the increase of}} pre-tension level. Thus, seam allowances can be defined more accurately in more deformable direction at the stage of product development. Cotton fabric (100  %) of plain weave was used as base material for <b>fused</b> <b>systems.</b> Biaxial tension testing was performed with three types of interlinings: woven, nonwoven and knitted, which differed not only in surface density, but in the density of adhesive layer, which was 52 and 76 dots/cm 2, as well.

Outer fabric and two interlinings with polymer adhesive layer: non-woven with longitudinal threads P 1 and warp knitted TR 1 were investigated. <b>Fused</b> textile <b>systems</b> were formed by changing the orientation of interlinings at: 0  (system PAR), 90  (system PER) and 45  (system B) degrees in respect to outer fabric warp direction.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the Spanish firm Esperanza y Cia, which later {{became part of}} Instalaza SA, {{developed}} a 120mm caliber mortar bomb which contained 21 dual anti-armor/fragmentation submunitions, each of which weighs 275 grams and is 37 millimeters in diameter. What made the 120mm MAT-120s submunition unique is the electrical impact fusing system which {{for all practical purposes}} totally eliminated the risk of unexploded duds from subsequently detonating. In addition there is no electrical energy stored in the MAT-120 round during storage, transport and even at the time it is fired from the mortar tube, thus greatly reducing any risk of premature detonation. The MAT-120 submunition's electronic impact fuse operates on a capacitor power source located in each submunition which is charged in flight after being fired by a wind generator located in the nose of the projectile. If for what ever reason the electrical fuse fails to function on impact, approximately 35 seconds later a self-destruction feature causes the submunition to detonate; if the self-destruction mechanism fails, in approximately 15 minutes after impact the electrical charge in the capacitor bleeds out, therefore rendering the submunition's electronic <b>fuse</b> <b>system</b> inoperative, rendering the dud submunition inert, unless the capacitor is deliberately recharged from an outside source.|$|E

The design approach includes a procedure for design and application of the <b>fuse</b> <b>system</b> in a multi-bay, multi-story build-ing with moment resisting frames. The empirical equation developed to predict the in-plane strength of masonry infill walls equipped with structural fuse is discussed.

The design procedure is shown through application to two buildings used for example, a low-rise (4 -story) and a mid-rise (8 -story) building.

40|$|The Far UpStream Element (FUSE) {{regulatory}} system promotes a {{peak in the}} concentration of c-Myc during cell cycle. First, the FBP transcriptional activator binds to the FUSE DNA element upstream of the c-myc promoter. Then, FBP recruits its specific repressor (FIR) which acts as an on/off transcriptional switch. Here we describe the molecular basis of FIR recruitment showing that the tandem RNA recognitions motifs of FIR provide a platform for independent FUSE DNA and FBP protein binding and explaining the structural basis of the reversibility of the FBP-FIR interaction. We also show that the physical coupling between FBP and FIR is modulated by a flexible linker positioned sequentially to the recruiting element. Our data explain how the <b>FUSE</b> <b>system</b> regulates precisely c-myc transcription and suggest that a small change in FBP–FIR affinity leads to a substantial effect on c-Myc concentration.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the main {{results of the}} numerical investigations carried out on an innovative repairable fuse device for dissipative beam-to-column connections in moment-resisting composite steel frames. The fuse consists of steel plates bolted to the web and bottom flange of the beam with a specifically detailed gap in the concrete slab. The behavior of the fuse device is studied by means of two different numerical approaches. Numerical analyses performed on detailed three-dimensional finite element models of beam-to-column sub-assemblages show that potential damage concentrates only in the fuse section, without any significant damage in the other structural elements. Repair work, if needed, is therefore limited to {{the replacement of the}} fuses only. The effects of some geometrical characteristics of the flange plates on the behavior of the fuses are investigated. In order to extend the results of the numerical analyses to multi-storey frames subjected to seismic excitations, simple numerical models of the device are developed and calibrated through the experimental results of laboratory tests. Non-linear dynamic and static analyses are performed on multi-storey composite steel frames and the effectiveness of the fuse devices is evaluated.
