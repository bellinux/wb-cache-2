40|$|The {{protozoan}} haemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei has two NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, {{each with}} a different localization within the cell. One isoenzyme {{is found in the}} cytosol, as in other eukaryotes, while the other is found in the glycosome, a microbody-like organelle that fulfils an essential role in glycolysis. The kinetic properties of the purified glycosomal and cytosolic isoenzymes were compared with homologous enzymes from other organisms. Both trypanosome enzymes had pH/activity profiles similar to that of other glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenases, with optimal activity around pH 8. 5 - 9. Only the yeast enzyme showed its maximal activity at a lower pH. The <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> was more sensitive to changes in ionic strength below 0. 1 M, while the cytosolic enzyme resembled more the enzymes from rabbit muscle, human erythrocytes and yeast. The affinity for NAD of the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> was 5 - 10 -fold lower than that of the cytosolic, {{as well as the other}} enzymes. A similar, but less pronounced, difference was found for its affinity for NADH. These differences are explained by a number of amino acid substitutions in the NAD-binding domain of the glycosomal isoenzyme. In addition, the effects of suramin, gossypol, agaricic acid and pentalenolactone on the trypanosome enzymes were studied. The trypanocidal drug suramin inhibited both enzymes, but in a different manner. Inhibition of the cytosolic enzyme was competitive with NAD, while in the case of the glycosomal isoenzyme, with NAD as substrate, the drug had an effect both on K(m) and V(max). The most potent inhibitor was pentalenolactone, which at micromolar concentrations inhibited the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> and the enzymes from yeast and Bacillus stearothermophilus in a reversible manner, while the rabbit muscle enzyme was irreversibly inhibited...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosoma brucei {{contains}} two isoenzymes for glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase: one enzyme resides in a microbody-like organelle, the glycosome; {{the other is}} found in the cytosol. Previously we have reported the characterization of the gene for the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> [Michels, P. A. M., Poliszczak, A., Osinga, K. A., Misset, O., Van Beeumen, J., Wierenga, R. K., Borst, P. & Opperdoes, F. R. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 1049 - 1056]. Here we describe the cloning and analysis of the gene that codes for the cytosolic isoenzyme. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 330 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 35440 Da. The two isoenzymes are only 55 % identical. The cytosolic glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase differs from the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> in the following respects: (a) its subunit molecular mass is 3. 4 kDa smaller due to the absence of insertions and a small C-terminal extension which are unique to the glycosomal protein; (b) the cytosolic enzyme has a lower pI (7. 9, as compared to 9. 3 for the glycosomal isoenzyme), which is due to a reduction in the excess of positively charged amino acids (the calculated net charges of the polypeptides are + 2 and + 11, respectively). We have compared the amino acid sequences of the two T. brucei glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenases, with 24 available sequences of the corresponding enzyme of other organisms from various phylogenetic groups. On the basis of this comparison an evolutionary tree was constructed. This analysis strongly supports the theory that T. brucei diverged early in evolution from the main eukaryotic branch of the phylogenetic tree. Further, two separate branches for the lineages leading to Trypanosoma are inferred from the amino acid sequences, suggesting that the genes for the two glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenases of the trypanosome are distantly related and must have been acquired independently by the trypanosomal ancestor. The branching determined with the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> precedes that found with the cytosolic enzyme. The available data do not allow us to decide which of the two genes originally belonged to the trypanosome lineage and which entered the cell later by horizontal gene transfer...|$|E
40|$|Trypanosoma brucei {{contains}} two isoenzymes for glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); one enzyme resides in a microbody-like organelle, the glycosome, {{the other one}} is found in the cytosol. We show here that the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> is encoded by two tandemly linked genes of identical sequence. These genes code for a protein of 358 amino acids, with a mol. wt of 38. 9 kd. This is considerably larger than all other GAPDH proteins studied so far, including the enzyme that is located in the cytosol of the trypanosome. The <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> shows 52 - 57 % homology with known sequences of GAPDH proteins from 10 other organisms, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The residues that are involved in NAD+ binding, catalysis and subunit contacts are well conserved between all these GAPDH molecules, including the trypanosomal one. However, the glycosomal protein of T. brucei has some distinct features. Firstly, it contains a number of insertions, 1 - 8 amino acids long, which are responsible for the high mol. wt of the protein. Secondly, an unusually high number of positively charged amino acids confer a high isoelectric point (pI 9. 3) to the protein. Part of the additional basic residues are present in the insertions. We discuss the genomic organization of the genes for the glycosomal GAPDH and the possibility that the particular features of the protein are involved in its transfer from the cytoplasm, where it is synthesized, into the glycosome...|$|E

Most of the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> and several of their cytosolic isoenzymes from Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania mexicana have been purified to homogeneity or have been over-expressed. Two of the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> have been crystallized and their three-dimensional structure solved. some characteristics common to the majority of the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> and absent from all other glycolytic enzymes have been identified and studied. One typical aspect is the existence of unique peptide insertions or of N- and C-terminal extensions in the glycosomal proteins. These peptides are often characterized by and abundance of the positively charged amino acids: arginine and lysine. Three-dimensional modelling has revealed that these positively charged amino acids cluster {{on the surface of the}} proteins in two so-called hot spots that are about 40 Angstrom apart. Another important structural difference has been found in the NAD-binding region of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase. We have exploited some of these differences and this has resulted in the synthesis of compounds that specifically inhibit <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> and leave the glycolytic enzymes from other organisms unharmed...|$|R
40|$|In African trypanosomes most enzymes of the glycolytic pathway {{are found}} in a microbody-like organelle, called the glycosome.

These MAPs may serve as specificintracellular target sites for therapeutic attack against trypanosomiasis. A trypanosomal MAP (p 52) copurifies with two <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> (aldolase and GAPDH) on phosphocellulose columns.

40|$|Glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (GAPDH) {{activity was}} detected in two cell compartments of Leishmania mexicana promastigotes.

40|$|In kinetoplastid protists, {{glycolysis}} is compartmentalized in glycosomes, organelles {{belonging to}} the peroxisome family. The Trypanosoma brucei <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) does not contain {{either of the two}} established peroxisome-targeting signals, but we identified a 22 amino acids long fragment, present at an internal position of the polypeptide, that has the capacity to route a reporter protein to glycosomes in transfected trypanosomes, as demonstrated by cell fractionation experiments and corroborating immunofluorescence studies. This polypeptide-internal routing information seems to be unique for the sequence of the trypanosome enzyme: a reporter protein fused to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae peptide containing the sequence corresponding to the 22 -residue fragment of the T. brucei enzyme, was not targeted to glycosomes. In yeasts, as in most other organisms, TPI is indeed exclusively present in the cytosol.

40|$|Pentalenolactone and koningic acid are {{antibiotics}} {{known for}} their potent inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. The reactive groups present in these antibiotics are, respectively, an epoxide and an alpha-enone, which form covalent bonds with an active-site cysteine residue of the enzyme. This information {{was used for the}} design of two series of glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate analogues with similar reactive groups that could function as potential irreversible inhibitors of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. Inactivation kinetics, NMR analysis, protection experiments, and titration of free cysteine residues together indicate that the inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme and form a covalent bond with the active-site cysteine residue of the enzyme. Binding probably takes place at the inorganic phosphate site of the enzyme and may lead to a conformational change. Comparison of the reactivities of the inhibitors for the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and the rabbit muscle enzyme revealed that some of them had a preference for the trypanosome enzyme.

40|$|Most <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> of Trypanosoma brucei carry a {{relatively}} high number of positive charges.

We have synthesized a series of symmetrical long chain molecules with negative charges or strong dipoles at each end. Several of these compounds inhibited the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> more strongly than Suramin. They also exhibited a specificity for the trypanosome enzymes, when compared with homologous enzymes from other organisms. By varying the chain length of the active compounds, a 4 -nm distance between the molecules' extremes proved optimal for inhibition. Tetra-substituted compounds were better than di-substituted. Modifications introduced at the two ends indicated that a planar orientation, with an amide bond linking a phenyl ring to the chain, is preferred.

40|$|Trypanosomatids {{have the}} unique feature of compartmentalizing the {{major part of}} the glycolytic pathway inside peroxisome-related organelles called glycosomes. However, these organelles also contain enzymes of several other {{important}} pathways involved in both catabolic and anabolic processes. The enzyme content and the metabolic role of glycosomes differ between trypanosomatid species and between their life cycle stages. Several of the glycosomal pathways {{have been shown to be}} important for the viability, pathogenicity, and/or virulence of different trypanosomatid parasites. Additionally, the correct compartmentalization of <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> inside the organelles appeared to be vital for these pathogens. Therefore, many of these enzymes, as well as the proteins involved in the translocation of metabolites across the glycosomal membrane and peroxins (PEXs), proteins responsible for the biogenesis of glycosomes, are candidate drug targets. <b>Glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> and PEX proteins of Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania spp. are being studied, and compounds that interfere with their functioning are being developed for use as lead drugs against the diseases caused by these parasites. Potent, selective inhibitors of several enzymes have been obtained that exert trypanocidal activity on parasites cultured in vitro and have no or only little effect on growth of human cells.

40|$|Trypanosoma brucei {{contains}} two glyceraldehyde-phosphate (GAPDH; EC 1. 2. 1. 12) isoenzymes; one {{is located in}} glycosomes and represents 80 % of the total activity, whereas the other {{is present in the}} cytosol. The purification of the cytosolic GAPDH, which is identical in both bloodstream-form and insect-stage trypanosomes, is described, and the enzyme compared with its glycosomal counterpart. Cytosolic GAPDH is specific for NAD. It is a tetrameric enzyme with subunits of 33. 5 kDa, 5 kDa smaller than those of the glycosomal GAPDH. The native enzyme has a pI of 7. 9, which is 1. 5 pH units less basic than the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme.</b> Both enzymes display maximal activity at pH 8 but the cytosolic enzyme has a much broader activity profile especially towards lower pH values. Sequence comparison of the first 85 amino acids reveals that the N-terminal parts of both isoenzymes differ by 52 %. The N terminus of the cytosolic isoenzyme resembles the corresponding N termini of ten other known GAPDH sequences in that they all lack three amino-acid insertions, which so far only have been found in the glycosomal isoenzyme of T. brucei. This observation explains in part the great difference in subunit size between the two T. brucei isoenzymes and suggests {{that at least one of}} these insertions is responsible for import of the glycosomal isoenzyme into the organelle...|$|E
40|$|Peroxisomes {{of organisms}} {{belonging}} to the protist group Kinetoplastea, which include trypanosomatid parasites of the genera Trypanosoma and Leishmania, are unique in playing {{a crucial role in}} glycolysis and other parts of intermediary metabolism. They sequester the majority of the glycolytic enzymes and hence are called glycosomes. Their <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzyme</b> content can vary strongly, particularly quantitatively, between different trypanosomatid species, and within each species during its life cycle. Turnover of glycosomes by autophagy of redundant ones and biogenesis of a new population of organelles play a pivotal role in the efficient adaptation of the glycosomal metabolic repertoire to the sudden, major nutritional changes encountered during the transitions in their life cycle. The overall mechanism of glycosome biogenesis {{is similar to that of}} peroxisomes in other organisms, but the homologous peroxins involved display low sequence conservation as well as variations in motifs mediating crucial protein-protein interactions in the process. The correct compartmentalisation of enzymes is essential for the regulation of the trypanosomatids' metabolism and consequently for their viability. For Trypanosoma brucei it was shown that glycosomes also play a crucial role in its life-cycle regulation: a crucial developmental control switch involves the translocation of a protein phosphatase from the cytosol into the organelles. Many glycosomal proteins are differentially phosphorylated in different life-cycle stages, possibly indicative of regulation of enzyme activities as an additional means to adapt the metabolic network to the different environmental conditions encountered.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{crystal structure}} of the enzyme glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase from the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma brucei brucei has been determined at 3. 2 Angstrom resolution from a 37 % complete data set collected using the Laue method. The crystals used in the structure determination contain {{one and a half}} tetrameric enzyme molecules in the asymmetric unit, i. e. six identical subunits. Initial phasing was carried out by the method of molecular replacement using the refined coordinates of hole glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus as a search model. The initial electron-density distribution, obtained from the molecular-replacement solution, was greatly improved by a procedure consisting of 36 cycles of iterative non-crystallographic density averaging. During the averaging procedure, the missing reflections (63 % of the data) were gradually introduced as map-inversion structure factors. At completion of the procedure, the R factor between averaged map-inversion amplitudes and observed structure-factor amplitudes was 19. 0 % for all data between 7. 0 and 3. 2 Angstrom resolution, and that between the map-inversion amplitudes and later recorded structure-factor amplitudes was 41. 9 %. After model building into the resulting averaged electron-density map, refinement by molecular-dynamics procedures with X-PLOR provided the current model, which has an R factor of 17. 6 % for 34 835 reflections between 7. 0 and 3. 2 Angstrom resolution. The refined model, comprising 2735 protein atoms plus one NAD(+) molecule and two sulfate ions per subunit, has r. ms. deviations from ideality of 0. 02 Angstrom for bond lengths and 3. 6 degrees for bond angles.

In titrations of intact cells with digitonin, a differential activation of glycolytic enzymes was observed. Enolase, pyruvate kinase and the cell-sap marker alanine aminotransferase were activated at 0. 05 mg digitonin per mg protein. The nine <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> involved in the conversion of glucose and glycerol into 3 -phosphoglycerate were activated only at digitonin concentrations between 0. 7 and 9. 8 mg/mg protein. In subcellular fractions {{the activities of the}} latter enzymes were all latent between 70 and 92 %. Latency was abolished by addition of 0. 1 % Triton X- 100 or partly by five cycles of freezing and thawing. We conclude that the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> are surrounded by a membrane, which forms a permeability barrier to intermediates and co-factors of glycolysis. The concentrations of glycolytic intermediates and of adenine nucleotides were measured under aerobic conditions {{as well as in the}} presence of 1 mM salicylhydroxamic acid, a respiratory inhibitor. Addition of salicylhydroxamic acid caused the following changes: (a) The levels of almost all glycolytic intermediates measured decreased. Glycerol- 3 -phosphate, however, increased fourfold. (b) The phosphate potential was drastically lowered from 2900 to 450 M- 1. (c) The trypanosomes became more reduced, as monitored by a change in the apparent redox state of the NADH/NAD+ courple from E'h = - 189 to E'h = - 219 mV. From the high levels of metabolite concentrations found and from comparison of the apparent mass-action ratios calculated for the separate glycolytic reactions with those for other organisms, we conclude that in bloodstream form T. brucei the glycolytic intermediates are present in the glycosomes as well as in the cytosol and that the two pools of intermediates equilibrate with each other, despite the presence of the glycosomal membrane...|$|R

As a first step, the glycosomes, microbody-like organelles of Trypanosomatidae, containing almost exclusively enzymes involved in glucose and glycerol metabolism [Opperdoes, F. R. and Borst, P.

40|$|Previous {{models of}} {{glycolysis}} in the sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei {{assumed that the}} core part of glycolysis in this unicellular parasite is tightly compartimentalized within an organelle, the glycosome, which had previously been shown to contain most of the glycolytic enzymes. The glycosomes were assumed to be largely impermeable, and exchange of metabolites between the cytosol and the glycosome {{was assumed to be}} regulated by specific transporters in the glycosomal membrane. This tight compartmentalization was considered to be essential for parasite viability. Recently, size-specific metabolite pores were discovered in the membrane of glycosomes. These channels are proposed to allow smaller metabolites to diffuse across the membrane but not larger ones. In light of this new finding, we re-analyzed the model taking into account uncertainty about the topology of the metabolic system in T.  brucei, as well as uncertainty about the values of all parameters of individual enzymatic reactions. Our analysis shows that these newly-discovered nonspecific pores are not necessarily incompatible with our current knowledge of the glycosomal metabolic system, provided that the known cytosolic activities of the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> {{play an important role in}} the regulation of glycolytic fluxes and the concentration of metabolic intermediates of the pathway...|$|R
40|$|Unlike other {{eukaryotic}} cells, trypanosomes {{possess a}} compartmentalized glycolytic pathway. The conversion of glucose into 3 -phosphoglycerate {{takes place in}} specialized peroxisomes, called glycosomes. Further conversion of this intermediate into pyruvate occurs in the cytosol. Due to this compartmentation, many regulatory mechanisms operating in other cell types cannot work in trypanosomes. This is reflected by the insensitivity of the <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> to compounds that act as activity regulators in other cell types. Several speculations have been raised about the function of compartmentation of glycolysis in trypanosomes. We calculate that even in a noncompartmentalized trypanosome the flux through glycolysis should not be limited by diffusion. Therefore, the sequestration of glycolytic enzymes in an organelle may not serve to overcome a diffusion limitation. We also search the available data for a possible relation between compartmentation {{and the distribution of}} control of the glycolytic flux among the glycolytic enzymes. Under physiological conditions, the rate of glycolytic ATP production in the bloodstream form of the parasite is possibly controlled by the oxygen tension, but not by the glucose concentration. Within the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis, we discuss evidence that glucose transport, although it does not qualify as the sole rate-limiting step, does have a high flux control coefficient.

40|$|The {{protozoan}} haemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei, {{differs from}} other eukaryotic cells {{in that it}} contains nine enzymes involved in glucose and glycerol metabolism which are associated with microbody-like organelles called glycosomes. The information available to date indicates that <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> are synthesized as polypeptides of mature size. For three of them, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase and glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, {{it has been shown}} that they are made on free polysomes in the cytosol and are subsequently transferred to the glycosome without any secondary modification. The topogenic signal responsible for import into the glycosome must, therefore, be present in the mature protein. Remarkable differences exist between the latter proteins and other glycolytic enzymes: (i) most glycosomal proteins have an apparent Mr which is 1 - 5 kDa larger than their homologous counterparts from the cytosol, or from other organisms; (ii) they have a high net positive charge. Based on the modelling of three glycosomal sequences in the respective homologous structures, it is thought that the topogenic signal may consist of a unique insertion, containing one or more basic amino acids which, together with additional positive charges elsewhere, constitute two positive hot spots approximately 4 nm apart on the surface of the protein. Such common elements, unique for the glycolytic enzymes from the Trypanosomatidae, lend themselves as excellent targets for the development of new drugs...|$|R

Previous studies on non-differentiating trypanosomes have shown that the metabolism and enzymatic contents of glycosomes in bloodstream-form and cultured procyclic cells, representative of the stage living in the insect's midgut, differ considerably. In this study, the morphology of glycosomes and their position relative to the lysosome were followed, as were the levels of some <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> and markers for other subcellular compartments, during the differentiation from bloodstream-form to procyclic trypanosomes. Our studies revealed a small tendency of glycosomes to associate with the lysosome when a population of long-slender bloodstream forms differentiated into short-stumpy forms which are pre-adapted to live in the fly. The same phenomenon was observed during the short-stumpy to procyclic transformation, but then the process was fast and many more glycosomes were associated with the dramatically enlarged degradation organelle. The observations suggested an efficient glycosome turnover involving autophagy. Changes observed in the levels of marker enzymes are consistent with the notion that, during differentiation, glycosomes with enzymatic contents specific for the old life-cycle stage are degraded and new glycosomes with different contents are synthesized, causing that the metabolic repertoire of trypanosomes is, at each stage, optimally adapted to the environmental conditions encountered.

40|$|Glycosomes are peroxisome-related organelles {{found in}} all kinetoplastid protists, {{including}} the human pathogenic species of the family Trypanosomatidae: Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. Glycosomes are unique in containing {{the majority of the}} glycolytic/gluconeogenic enzymes, but they also possess enzymes of several other important catabolic and anabolic pathways. The different metabolic processes are connected by shared cofactors and some metabolic intermediates, and their relative importance differs between the parasites or their distinct life-cycle stages, dependent on the environmental conditions encountered. By genetic or chemical means, a variety of <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> participating in different processes have been validated as drug targets. For several of these enzymes, as well as others that are likely crucial for proliferation, viability or virulence of the parasites, inhibitors have been obtained by different approaches such as compound libraries screening or design and synthesis. The efficacy and selectivity of some initially obtained inhibitors of parasite enzymes were further optimized by structure-activity relationship analysis, using available protein crystal structures. Several of the inhibitors cause growth inhibition of the clinically relevant stages of one or more parasitic trypanosomatid species and in some cases exert therapeutic effects in infected animals. The integrity of glycosomes and proper compartmentalization of at least several matrix enzymes is also crucial for the viability of the parasites. Therefore, proteins involved in the assembly of the organelles and transmembrane passage of substrates and products of glycosomal metabolism offer also promise as drug targets. Natural products with trypanocidal activity by affecting glycosomal integrity have been reported...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} how microbody enzymes enter microbodies, we {{are studying the}} genes for cytosolic and glycosomal (microbody) isoenzymes in Trypanosoma brucei. We have found three genes (A, B and C) coding for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) in a tandem array in T. brucei. Gene B codes for the cytosolic and gene C for the glycosomal isoenzyme. Genes B and C are 95 % homologous, and the predicted protein sequences share approximately 45 % amino acid homology with other eukaryote PGKs. The microbody isoenzyme differs from the cytosolic form and other PGKs in two respects: a high positive charge and a carboxy-terminal extension of 20 amino acids. Our results show that few alterations are required to redirect a protein from cytosol to microbody. From a comparison of our results with the unpublished data for three other <b>glycosomal</b> glycolytic <b>enzymes</b> we infer that the high positive charge represents the major topogenic signal for uptake of proteins into glycosomes...|$|R
40|$|In Trypanosoma brucei {{the enzyme}} glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase, {{like most other}} enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, resides in a microbody-like organelle, the glycosome. Here we report a {{detailed}} study of this enzyme, involving a determination of its kinetic properties and the cloning and sequence analysis of its gene. The gene codes for a polypeptide of 606 amino acids, with a calculated Mr of 67280. The protein predicted from the gene sequence has 54 - 58 % positional identity with its yeast and mammalian counterparts. Compared to those other glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerases the trypanosomal enzyme contains an additional 38 - 49 amino acids in its N-terminal domain, {{as well as a}} number of small insertions and deletions. The additional amino acids are responsible for the 5 -kDa-larger subunit mass of the T. brucei enzyme, as measured by gel electrophoresis. The glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase of the trypanosome has no excess of positive residues and, consequently, no high isoelectric point, in contrast to the other glycolytic enzymes that are present in the glycosome. However, similar to other glycosomal proteins analyzed so far, specific clusters of positive residues can be recognized in the primary structure. Comparison of the kinetic properties of the T. brucei glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase with those of the yeast and rabbit muscle enzymes did not reveal major differences. The three enzymes have very similar pH profiles. The affinity for the substrate fructose 6 -phosphate (Km = 0. 122 mM) and the inhibition constant for the competitive inhibitor gluconate 6 -phosphate (Ki = 0. 14 mM) are in the same range as those of the similar enzymes. The Km shows the same strong dependence on salt as the rabbit muscle enzyme, although somewhat less than the yeast glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase. The trypanocidal drug suramin inhibits the T. brucei and yeast enzymes to the same extent (Ki = 0. 29 and 0. 36 mM, respectively), but it had no effect on the rabbit muscle enzyme. Agaricic acid, a potent inhibitor of various <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> of T. brucei, has also a strong, irreversible effect on glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase, while leaving the yeast and mammalian enzymes relatively unaffected...|$|R
40|$|The current {{rapid growth}} in the number of known 3 -dimensional protein {{structures}} is producing a database of structures that is increasingly useful as a starting point for the development of new medically relevant molecules such as drugs, therapeutic proteins, and vaccines. This development is beautifully illustrated in the recent book, Protein structure: New approaches to disease and therapy (Perutz, 1992). There is a great and growing promise for the design of molecules for the treatment or prevention of a wide variety of diseases, an endeavor made possible by the insights derived from the structure and function of crucial proteins from pathogenic organisms and from man. We present here 2 illustrations of structure-based drug design. The first is the prospect of developing antitrypanosomal drugs based on crystallographic, ligand-binding, and molecular modeling studies of glycolytic <b>glycosomal</b> <b>enzymes</b> from Trypanosomatidae. These unicellular organisms are responsible for several tropical diseases, including African and American trypanosomiases, as well as various forms of leishmaniasis. Because the target enzymes are also present in the human host, this project is a pioneering study in selective design. The second illustrative case is the prospect of designing anti-cholera drugs based on detailed analysis of the structure of cholera toxin and the closely related Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin. Such potential drugs can be targeted either at inhibiting the toxin's receptor binding site or at blocking the toxin's intracellular catalytic activity. Study of the Vibrio cholerae and E. coli toxins serves at the same time as an example of a general approach to structure-based vaccine design. These toxins exhibit a remarkable ability to stimulate the mucosal immune system, and early results have suggested that this property can be maintained by engineered fusion proteins based on the native toxin structure. The challenge is thus to incorporate selected epitopes from foreign pathogens into the native framework of the toxin such that crucial features of both the epitope and the toxin are maintained. That is, the modified toxin must continue to evoke a strong mucosal immune response, and this response must be directed against an epitope conformation characteristic of the original pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Protozoan Kinetoplastida {{such as the}} {{pathogenic}} trypanosomes compartmentalize {{several important}} metabolic systems, including the glycolytic pathway, in peroxisome-like organelles designated glycosomes. Genes for three proteins involved in glycosome biogenesis of Trypanosoma brucei were identified. A preliminary analysis of these proteins, the peroxins PEX 6, PEX 10 and PEX 12, was performed. Cellular depletion of these peroxins by RNA interference affected growth of both mammalian bloodstream-form and insect-form (procyclic) trypanosomes. The bloodstream forms, which rely entirely on glycolysis for their ATP supply, were more rapidly killed. Both by immunofluorescence studies of intact procyclic T. brucei cells and subcellular fractionation experiments involving differential permeabilization of plasma and organellar membranes it was shown that RNAi-dependent knockdown of the expression {{of each of these}} peroxins resulted in the partial mis-localization of different types of <b>glycosomal</b> matrix <b>enzymes</b> to the cytoplasm: proteins with consensus motifs such as the C-terminal type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal PTS 1 or the N-terminal signal PTS 2 and a protein for which the sorting information is present in a polypeptide-internal fragment not containing an identifiable consensus sequence...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProtozoan parasites of {{the family}} Trypanosomatidae infect humans as well as {{livestock}} causing devastating diseases like sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and Leishmaniasis. These parasites compartmentalize glycolytic enzymes within unique organelles, the glycosomes. Glycosomes represent a subclass of peroxisomes and they are essential for the parasite survival. Hence, disruption of glycosome biogenesis is an attractive drug target for these Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). Peroxin 16 (PEX 16) plays {{an essential role in}} peroxisomal membrane protein targeting and de novo biogenesis of peroxisomes from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We identified trypanosomal PEX 16 based on specific sequence characteristics and demonstrate that it is an integral glycosomal membrane protein of procyclic and bloodstream form trypanosomes. RNAi mediated partial knockdown of Trypanosoma brucei PEX 16 in bloodstream form trypanosomes led to severe ATP depletion, motility defects and cell death. Microscopic and biochemical analysis revealed drastic reduction in glycosome number and mislocalization of the <b>glycosomal</b> matrix <b>enzymes</b> to the cytosol. Asymmetry of the localization of the remaining glycosomes was observed with a severe depletion in the posterior part. The results demonstrate that trypanosomal PEX 16 is essential for glycosome biogenesis and thereby, provides a potential drug target for sleeping sickness and related diseases...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} how microbody enzymes enter microbodies, we {{are studying the}} genes for <b>glycosomal</b> (microbody) <b>enzymes</b> in Trypanosoma brucei. Here we present our results for triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), which is found exclusively in the glycosome. We found a single TIM gene without introns, having one major polyadenylated transcript of 1500 nucleotides with a long untranslated tail of approximately 600 nucleotides. By a novel method, suitable for low abundance transcripts, we demonstrate that TIM mRNA contains the 35 -nucleotide leader sequence (mini-exon) also found on several other trypanosome mRNAs. The TIM gene and a DNA segment of at least 6 kbp upstream of the gene are transcribed at an equal rate in isolated nuclei, suggesting that the gene {{is part of a}} much larger transcription unit. The predicted protein is of the same size as TIMs from other organisms and shares approximately 50 % amino acid homology with other eukaryote TIMs, somewhat less with prokaryote TIMs. Trypanosome TIM is the most basic of all TIMs sequenced thus far. This is, in part, due to the presence of two clusters of positively charged residues in the molecule which may act as a signal for entry into glycosomes...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{knockout}} and knockdown {{methods were}} used to examine essentiality of pteridine reductase (PTR 1) in pterin metabolism in the African trypanosome. Attempts to generate PTR 1 null mutants in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei proved unsuccessful; despite integration of drug selectable markers at the target locus, the gene for PTR 1 was either retained at the same locus or elsewhere in the genome. However, RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in complete knockdown of endogenous protein after 48 h, followed by cell death after 4 days. This lethal phenotype was reversed by expression of enzymatically active Leishmania major PTR 1 in RNAi lines (oeRNAi) or by addition of tetrahydrobiopterin to cultures. Loss of PTR 1 was associated with gross morphological changes due to a defect in cytokinesis, resulting in cells with multiple nuclei and kinetoplasts, as well as multiple detached flagella. Electron microscopy also revealed increased numbers of glycosomes, while immunofluorescence microscopy showed increased and more diffuse staining for <b>glycosomal</b> matrix <b>enzymes,</b> indicative of mis-localisation to the cytosol. Mis-localisation was confirmed by digitonin fractionation experiments. RNAi cell lines were markedly less virulent than wild-type parasites in mice and virulence was restored in the oeRNAi line. Thus, PTR 1 may be a drug target for human African trypanosomiasis...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Glycosomes are {{specialized}} peroxisomes {{found in}} all kinetoplastid organisms. The organelles are unique in harbouring most enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. Matrix proteins, synthesized in the cytosol, cofactors and metabolites have to be transported across the membrane. Recent research on Trypanosoma brucei has provided insight into how these translocations across the membrane occur, although many details remain to be elucidated. Proteins are imported by a cascade of reactions performed by specialized proteins, called peroxins, in which a cytosolic receptor with bound matrix protein inserts itself in the membrane to deliver its cargo into the organelle and is subsequently retrieved from the glycosome to perform further rounds of import. Bulky solutes, such as cofactors and acyl-CoAs, seem to be translocated by specific transporter molecules, whereas smaller solutes such as glycolytic intermediates probably cross the membrane through pore-forming channels. The presence of such channels is in apparent contradiction with previous results that suggested a low permeability of the glycosomal membrane. We propose 3 possible, not mutually exclusive, solutions for this paradox. <b>Glycosomal</b> glycolytic <b>enzymes</b> have been validated as drug targets against trypanosomatid-borne diseases. We discuss the possible implications of the new data {{for the design of}} drugs to be delivered into glycosomes...|$|R
40|$|Glycosomes are intracellular, membrane-bound {{microbody}} organelles of trypanosomes and leishmania. Nine glycolytic enzymes are {{the major}} protein components of the glycosomes of Trypanosoma brucei long-slender bloodstream forms. Glycosomal proteins {{are believed to be}} synthesized in the cytoplasm and inserted across the glycosomal membrane posttranslationally. We have developed an in vitro protein import assay for the study of glycosomal biogenesis in T. brucei. All nine <b>glycosomal</b> glycolytic <b>enzymes</b> were detectable by immunoprecipitation and gel analysis of radiolabeled products derived from in vitro translation of total mRNA. Radiolabeled translational products were incubated with purified glycosomes isolated from bloodstream forms and digested with protease to remove proteins not imported into glycosomes. Gel analysis of reisolated glycosomes revealed that glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 1. 12) and 3 -phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (EC 2. 7. 2. 3) were apparently imported intact into the glycosome. Specificity of the protein import assay was verified by using translational products derived from cloned genes encoding T. brucei glycosomal PGK and its 95 % homologous cytosolic isozyme. Glycosomal PGK was inserted into the glycosome in vitro with a 27. 6 % efficiency, but no imported cytosolic PGK was detectable. Preliminary data suggest that certain sequences between the N terminus and residue 123 may be important for import of glycosomal PGK. Our assay, combined with the potential use of genetically altered substrate proteins, may provide the opportunity to explore the recognition systems involved in glycosome biogenesis...|$|R
