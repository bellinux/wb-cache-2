500|$|... "Love You To" [...] was {{the third}} track the Beatles {{recorded}} for Revolver, after [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>Into</b> My Life". Rodriguez comments that [...] "Love You To" [...] " [...] explicit the Indian influence implicit throughout the entire album", as songs such as [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>Into</b> My Life", together with the non-album single tracks [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] and [...] "Rain", all incorporate drone sounds or otherwise display the limited harmonic movement that typifies the genre. In a 1997 interview, Harrison said that the song's inclusion reflected the band's willingness to experiment during this period, adding: [...] "We were listening {{to all sorts of}} things, Stockhausen, avant-garde music, whatever, and most of it made its way onto our records." ...|$|E

500|$|EMI's Parlophone label {{released}} Revolver on 5 August 1966, {{one week}} before the Beatles began their final North American tour. [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] was sequenced between Lennon's song about a New York doctor who administered amphetamine doses to his wealthy patients, [...] "Doctor Robert", and [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life", which McCartney said he wrote as [...] "an ode to pot". For the North American version of Revolver, however, Capitol Records omitted [...] "Doctor Robert", together with two other Lennon-written tracks; as a result, the eleven-song US release reinforced the level of contribution from McCartney and from Harrison.|$|E
500|$|Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound is less {{impressed}} with the album, rating it a [...] "B" [...] and [...] "the black sheep of the Beatles' catalog". Although he admires the psychedelic tone, he considers that this experimentalism renders the more standard pop songs, such as [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>Into</b> My Life" [...] and [...] "Here, There and Everywhere", [...] "seemingly out of place" [...] within the collection.|publisher=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=24 June 2017}} Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham describes it as [...] "clearly brilliant" [...] but adds: [...] "There's an edge to the sound and a danger in the air … that makes listening to it an uncomfortable trip. It's easy to admire, even to be awed by, but some listeners find Revolver {{a little harder to}} love." ...|$|E
500|$|London Town (1978) {{spawned a}} US number-one single ("With a Little Luck"), and was Wings' best-selling LP since Band on the Run, making {{the top five}} in both the US and the UK. Critical {{reception}} was unfavourable, and McCartney expressed disappointment with the album. Back to the Egg (1979) featured McCartney's collaboration with a rock supergroup dubbed [...] "the Rockestra". Credited to Wings, the band included Pete Townshend, David Gilmour, Gary Brooker, John Paul Jones and John Bonham. Though certified platinum, critics panned the album. Wings completed their final concert tour in 1979, with twenty shows in the UK that included the live debut of the Beatles songs [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life", [...] "The Fool on the Hill" [...] and [...] "Let it Be".|$|E

500|$|In {{their search}} for new sounds, the band {{incorporated}} musical instruments such as the Indian tambura and tabla, and clavichord, vibraphone and tack piano into their work for the first time. The guitar sound on the album was more robust than before, {{through the use of}} new Fender amplifiers; the choice of guitars, which included Harrison using a Gibson SG as his preferred instrument; and the introduction of Fairchild 660 limiters for recording. With no expectations of being able to re-create their new music within the confines of their live shows, the Beatles increasingly used outside contributors while making the album. This included the band's first use of a horn section, on [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life", and the first time they incorporated sound effects extensively, during a party-style overdubbing session for [...] "Yellow Submarine".|$|E
500|$|Radner {{was born}} in Düsseldorf and had a brother, Bozidar, and a sister, Anna. Her father Klaus Radner {{and his wife had}} immigrated from Austria and started a trading company. They were not {{particularly}} interested in music. During long drives to Austria, Maria would sing for hours. At school she was a [...] "rather unobtrusive, popular student" [...] who enjoyed music lessons but found mathematics difficult. Her talent for singing remained unnoticed at school, but when she was 14, her parents introduced her to voice teacher Angelo Melzani, who told her, [...] "I will <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>into</b> opera." [...] As a teen she took part in the Rhenish Carnival and the Largest Fair on the Rhine (...) [...] Her father remembered her calling him excitedly after winning first prize in a beer-tent karaoke competition. She attended St. Ursula Gymnasium in Düsseldorf, finishing in 2000.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{first used}} {{drugs in the}} Beatles' Hamburg days, when they often used Preludin to {{maintain}} their energy while performing for long periods. Bob Dylan introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting [...] "very high" [...] and [...] "giggling uncontrollably". His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics [...] "another kind of mind" [...] in [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life" [...] specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally smoked a joint {{in the car on}} the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and for about a year total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.|$|E

500|$|Described by Riley as the album's [...] "most {{derivative}} cut", [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life" [...] {{was influenced}} by the Motown Sound and written by McCartney after he had seen Stevie Wonder perform at the Scotch of St James nightclub in February. The horn players on the track included members of Georgie Fame's group, the Blue Flames. To capture the desired sound, microphones were placed in the bells of the brass instruments, and the signals were heavily limited. A month later, a tape copy of these horn parts was superimposed with a slight delay, thereby doubling the presence of the brass contributions. Rodriguez terms the completed track [...] "an R shouter". Although cast {{in the form of a}} love song, McCartney described the lyric as [...] "an ode to pot, like someone else might write an ode to chocolate or a good claret". The initial version of the song, as issued on Anthology 2, featured acoustic backing and organ, and a harmonised refrain of [...] "I need your love", which was replaced by Harrison's guitar break on the more uptempo remake.|$|E
500|$|During the sessions, Emerick {{recorded}} McCartney's bass guitar amplifier via a loudspeaker, which Townsend had reconfigured {{to serve}} as a microphone, in order to give the bass more prominence than on previous Beatles releases. Although this particular technique was used only on the two songs selected for the May 1966 single, an enhanced bass sound was a feature of much of the album. Emerick also ensured a greater presence for Starr's bass drum, by inserting an item of clothing inside the structure, to dampen the sound, and then moving the microphone to just 3 inches from the drumhead and compressing the signal through a Fairchild limiter. MacDonald writes that, despite EMI Studios being technically inferior to many recording facilities in the United States, Starr's drumming on the album soon led to studios there [...] "being torn apart and put back together again", as engineers sought to replicate the innovative sounds achieved by the Beatles. The preference for close-miking instruments extended to the orchestral strings used on [...] "Eleanor Rigby", to achieve McCartney's request for a [...] "really biting" [...] sound, and the horns on [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life". This was another break from convention, and the cause for alarm among the classically trained string players.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, EWF {{picked up}} three Grammy Awards, the third for their {{rendition}} of The Beatles's [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life." [...] EWF's {{performance of the}} song was included on the soundtrack for the movie Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The film was a commercial failure, as That's The Way Of The World had been years before; however, EWF's cover version of [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life" [...] was the biggest hit from the movie's soundtrack, reaching numbers one and nine on the R and Pop singles charts, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Cheng Yu, an {{advisor to}} Cao Cao, also once {{mentioned}} that Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were [...] "capable of fighting thousands of enemies". In the main text of Zhang Fei's biography, Chen Shou wrote that Zhang Fei respected virtuous persons and detested those of vile character. Liu Bei had constantly warned Zhang Fei about his barbaric behaviour {{as he once}} told the latter, [...] "You have dealt out far too excessive punishments.

2500|$|According to Walter Everett {{the opening}} chord has an {{introductory}} dominant function because McCartney plays D in the bass: Harrison and Martin play F A C G, over the bass D, on twelve-string guitar and piano respectively, giving the chord a mixture-coloured neighbour, F; two diatonic neighbours, A and C; plus an {{anticipation of the}} tonic, G – the major subtonic as played on guitar being a borrowed chord commonly used by the Beatles, first in [...] "P.S. I Love You" [...] (see mode mixture), and later in [...] "Every Little Thing", [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life" [...] (in the latter two against a tonic pedal).|$|E

[...] His first three songs were The Beatles' [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] and [...] "Got to <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> <b>into</b> My Life"; and Frank Sinatra's [...] "Come Fly with Me". His co-presenters include ex-BBC TV newsreader Moira Stuart, sports presenter Jonny Saunders who was replaced in June 2011 by Vassos Alexander, and travel reporter Lynn Bowles. Features include The Gobsmackers (two songs selected by a listener that sound good played back to back).|$|E
