30|$|The {{validity}} {{of this study is}} affected by a methodical problem: The survey data about the motivation for choosing the FRB were collected retrospectively, which is why the respondents might have attempted to rationalise their decision ex post. For this reason the real motives might be disguised in many cases. Given that survey questions concerning the willingness to work and job search activities are considered sensitive, a social desirability bias must be taken into account. However, as FRB payment recipients are legally entitled to cease seeking employment, they can more likely be expected to reveal a lack of propensity to work.

Nevertheless, this work is particularly difficult due to the wide dynamic range of protein concentration in eukaryotic tissues. In this paper, we present a shotgun method whereby the peptides are fractionated using OFFGEL electrophoresis after iTRAQ labelling. Results We demonstrated that iTRAQ peptide labelling enhances MALDI ionisation and that the OFFGEL fractionation of the labelled peptides <b>introduces</b> <b>a</b> <b>supplementary</b> criterion (pI) useful for validation and identification of proteins. We showed that iTRAQ samples allowed lower-concentrated proteins identification in comparison with free-labelled samples.
