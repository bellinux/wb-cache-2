2500|$|Later that morning, Whitman {{rented a}} <b>hand</b> <b>truck</b> and cashed $250 (...) worth of bad checks at a bank. He {{drove to a}} {{hardware}} store, where he purchased a Universal M1 carbine, two additional ammunition magazines, and eight boxes of ammunition, telling the cashier he planned to hunt wild hogs. At a gun shop he purchased four more carbine magazines, six additional boxes of ammunition, {{and a can of}} gun cleaning solvent.

60|$|Farther along we {{came upon}} {{a group of three}} women and two {{children}} in the road, busy clearing out a labourer's cottage. They had got hold of a little <b>hand</b> <b>truck,</b> and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture. They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed.|$|E

60|$|The town {{contained}} but few {{objects of}} interest. Before {{the advent of}} railways {{it had been a}} thriving port with a considerable trade; now its streets were sleepy and its wharves deserted. Besides the Seamew the only other craft in the river was a tiny sloop, the cargo of which two men were unloading by means of a basket and pulley and a <b>hand</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E
60|$|Standing near was a <b>hand</b> <b>truck</b> {{used in the}} {{manipulation}} of small freight. It stood by a shed full of sacked wool, a consignment {{from one of the}} sheep ranches. On this truck the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool. Stooping low, Buck Patterson started for Calliope's fort, slowly pushing this loaded truck before him for protection. The posse, scattering broadly, stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him. Only once did Calliope make demonstration. He fired from a window, and some tufts of wool spurted from the marshal's trustworthy bulwark. The return shots from the posse pattered against the window frame of the fort. No loss resulted on either side.|$|E

50|$|Electric {{platform}} {{trucks are}} electric powered trucks {{with a large}} flat surface for holding objects to be transported. Some are also called warehouse utility vehicles, electric trolley carts, or powered platform truck vehicles. Electric tugs can be combined with nonpowered carts or <b>hand</b> <b>trucks</b> {{to achieve the same}} result.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>hand</b> <b>trucks</b> are {{equipped}} with stairclimber wheels, which, as the name implies, are designed {{to go up and}} down stairs. Stairclimber wheels can sometimes be problematic when trying to turn on flat ground as four wheels in a fixed position will be in contact with the ground.|$|R

5000|$|A sticky mat, {{also called}} a tacky mat or {{cleanroom}} mat, is a mat with an adhesive surface that is {{placed at the}} entrances or exits to certain workplaces to remove contaminants from the bottoms of footwear and wheeled carts such as <b>hand</b> <b>trucks.</b> [...] They are {{an example of an}} engineering control within the hierarchy of hazard controls.|$|R
50|$|While steamboats {{were used}} in some areas, as {{recently}} as the late 19th Century thousands of workers pulled barges. Until the late 19th century most coal and other minerals were mined with picks and shovels and crops were harvested and grain threshed using animal power or by hand. Heavy loads like 382 pound bales of cotton were handled on <b>hand</b> <b>trucks</b> until the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Many positives, {{both of the}} box and 'cupboard' types, can {{be divided}} into upper and lower parts to be more easily moved. The lower part then usually {{contains}} the bellows, blower and/or treadle, and perhaps a few of the largest pipes. Wheels, casters or a custom-made <b>hand</b> <b>truck</b> are other aids to mobility, which have become vastly more common in modern times.|$|E
50|$|Other {{things to}} be {{considered}} should be the load shape compared with the backrest shape, e.g., cylindrical loads should sit on curved backrests, and the environmental conditions in which the <b>hand</b> <b>truck</b> will operate. For example, on loose or uneven ground oversize wheels are a great advantage; solid or puncture-proof foam filled tires may be used where punctures could deflate pneumatic tires.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: This {{column about}} [...] "trucks and cars" [...] from Popular Mechanics in 1914 was written {{when the word}} truck did not {{necessarily}} connote a motor truck and the word car did not necessarily connote a motor car. The same topics today would most likely be talked about with the terms <b>hand</b> <b>trucks</b> and railroad cars. Those terms existed in 1914 as well, {{but they were not}} required for clarity, as they would be today.|$|R

5000|$|The WauK {{board is}} also {{designed}} for use in small spaces. The patient is secured to the board with straps. It has two wheels and a foldable footrest at one end, allowing the patient to be moved by one person, much as with a <b>hand</b> <b>truck</b> for moving cargo. It {{can also be used}} at a variety of angles, making it easier to traverse obstacles, such as tight stairwells.|$|E
50|$|Drums are {{frequently}} transported on pallets {{for ease of}} handling by a fork truck and for shipping. The drum's size, shape, and weight distribution lends itself to being moved about readily on the loading dock or factory floor with a two-wheeled <b>hand</b> <b>truck.</b> They can be turned on side and rolled. They can also be moved by hand short distances on firm surfaces by tilting and then rolling along the base, or by using a drum handler, which is designed especially for that purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Handling {{goods on}} pallets was a {{significant}} improvement over using <b>hand</b> <b>trucks</b> or carrying sacks or boxes by hand and greatly speeded up loading and unloading of trucks, rail cars and ships. [...] Pallets can be handled with pallet jacks or forklift trucks which began being used in industry in the 1930s and became widespread by the 1950s.

This eventually led to the eviction of Gleason, his wife and their two children from their home when they could not pay the rent. When he was blacklisted, he pushed a <b>hand</b> <b>truck</b> in a sugar factory during the day and he sold hot dogs on Coney Island at night.|$|E
5000|$|On the September 12 {{airing of}} SmackDown Jesse and Festus {{made their way}} to the ring dressed in moving attire {{complete}} with a <b>hand</b> <b>truck,</b> large cardboard box and moving supplies. After an attack from Kenny Dykstra the duo proceeded to package Dykstra up and roll him away. The next week they did the same thing to Ryan Braddock and later the set of Carlito's Cabana. The gimmick highlighted SmackDown's move to MyNetworkTV, complete with overalls bearing the parodic company title of [...] "MyMoving Company". After the show's move, however, they reverted to their previous gimmick.|$|E
50|$|Stairclimber wheels can {{be fitted}} to <b>hand</b> <b>trucks</b> (sack trucks) {{and as the}} name implies, are {{designed}} to aid the moving of goods up or down stairs. This type of stairclimber relies on a wheel configuration known as tri-star, three wheels set into a triangle configuration replacing the standard wheel on either side. Stairclimber wheels can sometimes be problematic when trying to turn on flat ground as four wheels in a fixed position will be {{in contact with the}} ground at all times unless a locking mechanism is built into the trolley.|$|R
50|$|In manufacturing, {{mechanization}} replaced hand {{methods of}} making goods. Prime movers are devices that convert thermal, potential or kinetic energy into mechanical work.
