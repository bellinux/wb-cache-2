5000|$|The sticky <b>inflation</b> <b>assumption</b> {{states that}} [...] "when firms set prices, {{for various reasons}} the prices respond slowly to changes in {{monetary}} policy. This leads {{the rate of inflation}} to adjust gradually over time."Additionally, {{within the context of the}} short run model there is an implication that the classical dichotomy does not hold when sticky inflation is present. This is the case when monetary policy affects real variables. Sticky inflation can be caused by expected inflation (e.g. home prices prior to the recession), wage push inflation (a negotiated raise in wages), and temporary inflation caused by taxes. Sticky inflation becomes a problem when economic output decreases while inflation increases, which is also known as stagflation. As economic output decreases and unemployment rises the standard of living falls faster when sticky inflation is present. Not only will inflation not respond to monetary policy in the short run, but monetary expansion as well as contraction can both have negative effects on the standard of living.|$|E

This paper performs time series outlier analysis on retail price inflation, which is the driving force of Wilkie 2 ̆ 7 s composite model. The data come from four developed countries: the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia. The fit of the model is significantly improved after the adjustment of outliers. The analysis also identifies exogenous events that have intervened in the inflation dynamics. An example is given to demonstrate the importance of outlier analysis on stochastic simulation.

40|$|Maintaining {{spending}} {{power in}} real terms (current) while preserving an endowment’s value {{in real terms}} (future) is the crux of intergenerational equity. Tobin’s (1974) model provides the conceptual basis on which simulations were developed to study the impact of various inflation (0 %, TIPS, CPI, HECA, and HEPI) and new giving scenarios ($ 0, $ 4 million and $ 8 million) {{on the value of}} the USD Foundation endowment as well as the value of the future payouts from the endowment. All inflation scenarios except 0 % inflation require new gifts to the endowment to maintain or grow the inflation-adjusted value of the endowment with a 6. 85 % nominal return, 4. 80 % payout and 2 % administrative fee. With $ 8, 000, 000 in annual new gifts to the endowment, the inflation-adjusted value of the endowment grows in all five inflation scenarios. With $ 4, 000, 000 in annual new gifts to the endowment, the inflation-adjusted value of the endowment grows over time in the 0 %, TIPS, and CPI inflation scenarios but declines in the higher inflation scenarios (HECA and HEPI). The level of new gifts required to provide for intergenerational equity was also determined; new giving increases the size of the payout on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Holding the sustainable payout rate constant at 4. 80 % and using HECA as the <b>inflation</b> <b>assumption</b> shows that the “break-even ” calculation is $ 4, 946, 170 in new gifts per-year. Finally, the sustainable payout rate under the assumption of zero new gifts was determined. As expected, the sustainable payout decreases with higher inflation and is lower than the current payout rate...|$|E
40|$|Pensions {{provided}} {{in the public sector}} are often indexed, while pensions in the private sector typically are not. To conduct the total compensation comparisons that ostensibly guide government pay policy, one must value annuities which differ in their degree of inflation protection. This paper conducts this exercise from the viewpoint of modem finance theory, and contrasts the results with those of a representative government, the Government of Canada. The results suggest that governments may typically understate the value of indexed pensions and overstate the value of pensions which receive incomplete inflation protection. A contributing factor is the apparent belief that standardizing actuarial assumptions is sufficient to ensure comparability, {{in spite of the fact}} that risk is ignored and that interest rate and <b>inflation</b> <b>assumptions</b> are typically not those of the market. ...|$|R

This paper allows for dynamic and long run relationships between economies with mixed I(0) and I(1) data, and recognises that a means of achieving identi-fication for such a model in a VAR framework is to restrict only the con-temporaneous relationships between some variables across the economies.

40|$|A {{population}} {{health management}} program was implemented to assess growth {{in health care}} expenditures for the disabled segment of Georgia's Medicaid population {{before and during the}} first year of a population health outcomes management program, and to compare those expenditures with projected costs based on various cost inflation trend assumptions. A retrospective, nonexperimental approach was used to analyze claims data from Georgia Medicaid claims files for all program-eligible persons for each relevant time period (intent-to-treat basis). These included all non-Medicare, noninstitutionalized Medicaid aged-blind-disabled adults older than 18 years of age. Comparisons of health care expenditures and utilization were made between base year (2003 – 2004) and performance year one (2006 – 2007), and of the difference between actual expenditures incurred in the performance year vs. projected expenditures based on various cost inflation assumptions. Demographic characteristics and clinical complexity of the population (as measured by the Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System risk score) actually increased from baseline to implementation. Actual expenditures were less than projected expenditures using any relevant medical <b>inflation</b> <b>assumption.</b> Actual expenditures were less than projected expenditures by $ 9. 82 million when using a conservative US general medical inflation rate, by $ 43. 6 million using national Medicaid cost trends, and by $ 106 million using Georgia Medicaid's own cost projections for the non-dually eligible disabled segment of Medicaid enrollees. Quadratic growth curve modeling also demonstrated a lower rate of increase in total expenditures. The rate of increase in expenditures was lower over the first year of program implementation compared with baseline. Weighted utilization rates were also lower in high-cost categories, such as inpatient days, despite increases in the risk profile of the population. Varying levels of cost avoidance could be inferred from differences between actual and projected expenditures using each of the health-related inflation assumptions.

Empirical fit is evaluated by comparing dynamic properties of theoretical impulse responses with those of empirical impulse responses estimated for the US economy. We confirm that the purely forward looking NKPC implies too little inflation and output persistence. While the <b>inflation</b> inertia <b>assumption</b> significantly improves the fit of inflation persistence, it cannot improve the fit of observed output persistence.

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{implications}} of price indexation for estimated frequency of price adjustment in sticky price models of business cycles. These models predominantly assume that non-reoptimized prices are indexed to lagged or average <b>inflation.</b> The <b>assumption</b> of price indexation adds tractability {{although it is not}} likely reflective of the price practices of firms at the micro level. Under indexation firms have less incentive to adjust their prices, which implies downward bias in the estimated frequency of price changes. To evaluate the bias, we generate data with Calvo-type models without indexation. The artificial data are then used to estimate the frequency of price changes with indexation. Considering different assumptions about the degree of price rigidity and the level of trend inflation in the data-generating model, we find that the estimated indexation bias can be substantial, ranging up to 12 quarters in some cases.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the backreaction of the quantum fluctuations {{of a very}} light (m ≲ H_today) nonminimally coupled spectator scalar field on the expansion dynamics of the Universe. The one-loop expectation value of the energy momentum tensor of these fluctuations, {{as a measure of}} the backreaction, is computed throughout the expansion history from the early inflationary universe until the onset of recent acceleration today. We show that, when the nonminimal coupling ξ to Ricci curvature is negative (ξ_c = 1 / 6 corresponding to conformal coupling), the quantum backreaction grows exponentially during inflation, such that it can grow large enough rather quickly (within a few hundred e-foldings) to survive until late time and constitute a contribution of the cosmological constant type of the right magnitude to appreciably alter the expansion dynamics. The unique feature of this model is in that, under rather generic <b>assumptions,</b> <b>inflation</b> provides natural explanation for the initial conditions needed to explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, making it a particularly attractive model of dark energy.

40|$|All {{developed}} countries have government debt, usually a sizeable proportion of output. This paper proposes that governments that cannot commit to future policy choices face a trade-off {{that explains the}} level of debt. On the one hand, the government would like to increase debt and delay taxation, so as to reduce current distortions. On the other hand, inflating current prices lowers {{the real value of}} nominal debt and so there is a motive to reduce it now. This trade-off generates a level of long-run debt that is interior and independent of initial debt, a feature missing in previous theories. The sign and size of long-run debt will depend on how the incentives to increase and decrease debt play out against each other. The critical determinant is how easy or difficult it is for households to substitute away from goods being taxed by <b>inflation.</b> Under reasonable <b>assumptions,</b> the model is successful in replicating certain U. S. facts, most importantly its debt-to-output ratio. Permanent changes in fundamentals —other than the degree of substitutability of the good being taxed by inflation— have small effects on long-run debt. This is consistent with the empirical observation that macroeconomic variables cannot alone explain cross-country differences in public debt levels. The model is extended to include stochastic government expenditure. In line with the tax-smoothing argument, the model predicts that governments increase debt when expenditure temporarily rises. However, labor taxes fluctuate significantly. Government debt, time-consistency, Markov-perfect equilibrium. ...|$|R

40|$|Monetary policy {{analysis}} concerns both {{the assumptions of}} the transmission mechanism and the direction of causality between the nominal (i. e. the money) and real economy. The traditional channel of monetary policy implementation works via the interest rate changes {{and their impact on}} the investment activity and aggregate demand. Altering the relationship between the aggregate demand and supply then impacts the aggregate price level and hence inflation. Alternatively, the Post-Keynesians postulate money as a residual. In their approach, banks credit in response to the movements in investment activities and demand for money. In this paper, the authors use the VAR (i. e. the vector autoregressive) approach applied to the “Taylor Rule“ concept to identify the mechanism and impact of the monetary policy in the small open post-transformation economy of the Czech Republic. The causality (in the Granger sense) between the interest rate and prices in the Czech Republic is then identified. The two alternative modelling approaches are tested. First, there is the standard VAR analysis with the lagged value of interest rate, inflation and economic growth as explanatory variables. This model shows one way causality (in the Granger sense) between the inflation rate and interest rate (i. e. the inflation rate is (Granger) caused by the lagged interest rate). Secondly, the lead (instead of lagged) values of the interest rate, inflation rate and real exchange rate are used. This estimate shows one way causality between the inflation rate and interest rate in the sense that interest rate is caused by the lead (i. e. the expected future) <b>inflation</b> rate.

Author of this work also shows that attempts of governments and central banks aimed at avoiding deflationary scenarios ultimately cause slower growth and elevated variance in economic activity. Due to existence of such causality, a new variable "tau" entering into CAPM model's risk premium was developed as the original model had previously not captured for impacts of monetary and government policies. In order to quantify a probability and strength of deflationary forces in developed world, three distinct approaches were utilized [...] quantitative assessment, historical comparisons, and a pure economic theory based reasoning.

40|$|Most {{dark matter}} (DM) models set the DM relic density by some {{interaction}} with Standard Model particles. Such models generally assume {{the existence of}} Standard Model particles early on, with the DM relic density a later consequence of those interactions. Perhaps a more compelling assumption is that DM {{is not part of}} the Standard Model sector and a population of DM too is generated at the end of <b>inflation.</b> This democratic <b>assumption</b> does not necessarily provide a natural value for the DM relic density, and superficially leads to too much entropy in the dark sector. We address the latter issue by the late decay of heavy particles produced at early times, associating the DM relic density with the lifetime of a long-lived state. We ask what it would take for this scenario to be compatible with observations in what we call Flooded Dark Matter (FDM) and discuss several interesting consequences. One is that DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most natural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the decaying particle. Moreover, the decay of the field with the smallest coupling and hence the longest lifetime dominates the entropy and possibly the matter content of the Universe, a principle we refer to as 'Maximum Baroqueness'. We also show that the dark sector should be colder than the ordinary sector, relaxing the free-streaming constraints on light DM. We will discuss the implications for the core-cusp problem in a follow-up paper. FDM also has interesting baryogenesis implications. One possibility is that both DM and baryon asymmetries are simultaneously diluted by a late entropy dump. Alternatively, FDM is compatible with an elegant non-thermal leptogenesis implementation in which decays of a heavy RH neutrino lead to late time reheating of the Standard Model and provide suitable conditions for creation of a lepton asymmetry.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research study is to investigate how the tax rules and regulations applicable to agriculture affect the optimality for agriculture decision making. The study examines such issues as how the cash method of accounting affects the optimal timing for economic transactions, how the opportunity to convert ordinary tax deductions into long-term capital gains affect the optimal strategy for choosing raised pigs for breeding purposes and how the alternative minimum income tax rules restrict the benefits of designated tax rules and regulations. This examination also provides insights as to what types of accounting information is needed to support the agriculture decision making process. ^ The research study uses the principles of Multiperiod Linear Programming to construct a series of decision models for this investigation. These decision models allow revenue to be earned from either a corn or hog production operation. The statistical data {{used for this study}} are provided by a thesis conducted by Neal Stanley and statistics maintained by the Agriculture Extension Services at the University of Nebraska. The various decision models are used to examine how (1) the initial state, (2) the use of expected values, (3) <b>inflation,</b> (4) the <b>assumptions</b> for computing borrowing capacity, and (5) the choice of objective functions affect the optimality for agricultural decision making. ^ The solutions for the various decision models demonstrate that the tax law introduces biases which can modify the optimality for agriculture decision making, that deferred taxes are a source of capital for conducting agriculture operations, and that the alternative minimum income tax rules restrict the benefits provided by specific tax rules. The manner in which these various tax rules affect the optimality of decision making depends upon the non-tax parameter for the decision making process. The interaction between the tax and non-tax parameters introduces interperiod dependency for the decision making process. Moreover, the tax law also introduces interdependency between decisions which would not exist except for the tax law. These findings suggest that the tax law creates a need to use mathematical tools which allow the consideration of various decisions at various points of time simultaneously. Thus, the development of multi-period linear programming may improve the relevance and reliability of accounting information. ...|$|R
40|$|The key {{question}} asked by standard monetary models used for policy analysis {{is how to}} do changes in short term interest rates affect the economy. All of the standard models imply that such changes in interest rates affect the economy by altering the conditional means of the macroeconomic aggregates and {{have no effect on}} the conditional variances of these aggregates. We argue that the data on exchange rates imply nearly the opposite: fluctuations in interest rates are associated with nearly one-for-one changes in conditional variances and nearly no changes in conditional means. In this sense standard monetary models capture essentially none {{of what is going on}} in the data. We thus argue that almost everything we say about monetary policy using these models is wrong. Standard log-linear models of monetary policy of both the New Keynesian and Neoclassical variety link nominal interest rates, through an Euler equation, to the conditional means of the log of two variables: the representative agent's marginal utility growth and inflation. (Changes in these two variables are loosely thought of as reflecting the real and nominal effects of monetary policy.) The main debate among standard modelers has been about how much interest rate changes affect each of the two variables. An important common assumption of these models is that interest rate changes have no effect on the conditional variances of marginal utilities and <b>inflation.</b> That common <b>assumption,</b> however, is grossly inconsistent with a well-established feature of the data: nominal rates of exchange between major currencies are be well-approximated by random walks. 1 Mechanically, the observation that exchange rates are approximately random walks implies that when a central bank changes its interest rate relative to that on other major currencies this change is reflected almost entirely as changes in the excess returns on its bonds over that on foreign bonds. Interpreted in a standard model with complete markets this observation implies that changes in a domestic interest rate relative to a foreign interest rate lead to one-for-one with changes in conditional variances and nearly no changes in conditional means. This observation thus implies that, at least when we are analyzing changes in domestic interest rates relative to those of foreign interest rates, standard models capture essentially nothing of what is going on in the data...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that inflation {{is generated by}} a combination of excess demand and inflationary expectations. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} present a simple combined model of wage and price inflation that incorporates these two features in a consistent manner. The model is constructed so as to pay particular attention to open economy features. The general characteristics of the model are derived from the static neoclassical theory of firms and households. To this structure we add the following dynamic adjustment assumptions: tradeable prices adjust immediately to world tradeable prices adjusted for the exchange rate, while wages and non-tradeable prices adjust to existing and anticipated excess demands in their respective markets. This procedure leads to a pair of excess demand-expectations equations in wages and non-tradeable prices. Empirically, we measure expectations about any given variable at any point in time as an optimal extrapolative function of past observations on itself. The system, as constructed, therefore contains three levels of information about the wage-price relationship: past information; information contained in the model itself; and, any additional information contained in the contemporaneous covariance of wages and non-tradeable prices. All three levels of information are used in estimating the system by a variant of Zellner’s seemingly unrelated regressions technique. In general terms the simple model appears to fit the data quite well and the theoretical properties of the system are supported by the estimates. This framework allows at least two interpretations of the long-run Phillips curve relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. The first concerns a situation in which the exchange rate is fixed. In this case, the domestic cycle of wages and non-tradeable prices has a built-in stabiliser around the trend of world tradeable prices. Of course the world price trend may itself be destabilising in some instances. Nevertheless, taking the world price trend as given we can define a long-run trade off relative to this trend. We call this the fixed-exchange-rate trade off. Attempts to exploit this trade off to lower unemployment would involve domestic inflation of non-tradeable prices at a rate in excess of the world tradeable price trend. The second concerns a situation in which the exchange rate moves over time in such a way as to preserve purchasing power parity. We call this the fixed-relative-price trade off. It could equally be called a variable-exchange-rate trade off. The data for Australia in the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s suggest that Australia faces a vertical long-run fixed-relative-price trade off but a negatively-sloped long-run fixed-exchange-rate trade off. Thus, if the authorities could maintain, with a fixed exchange rate, a long-run inflation rate for non-tradeables that is divergent from the world inflation rate for tradeables, then some long term gain in unemployment could be achieved at the expense of a higher rate of <b>inflation.</b> While this <b>assumption</b> would be untenable to most economists, the essence of this result is that the fixed exhange rate decreases the slope of the trade off over the time horizon relevant to policy-makers. ...|$|R
