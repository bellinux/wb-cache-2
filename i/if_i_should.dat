500|$|... "Lemme See" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song that}} heavily {{incorporates}} synthesizers, {{and has a}} running duration of four minutes and 15 seconds. It contains elements of hip hop music, and its production was compared {{to the one in}} Kelly Rowland's [...] "Motivation" [...] (2011). Lyrically, Usher is contemplating on what he is going to do when he [...] "gets a certain female clubgoer into his bedroom", in the line: Hey girl, I’m debating <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> take you home. During the pre-chorus, he comes to the conclusion: I decided to take my shirt off / and show my chest.|$|E
500|$|... "Castle Walls" [...] {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of 5:29 (five minutes and twenty nine seconds) {{and is a}} hip hop and electro song. The song features a Europop keyboard in its arrangement. Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club wrote that the lyrics of [...] "Castle Walls" [...] "offer similarly incisive and only occasionally self-pitying commentary on the tragedy and triumph of being young, black, rich, famous, and a repeat felon." [...] The song begins with the chorus, in which Aguilera sings, [...] "Everyone thinks that I have it all / But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (These castle walls) / <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> tumble <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> fall/ Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls? / There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls." [...] After the chorus, T.I. raps the verse [...] "See with the Phantoms and Ferraris in the driveway / But you see it came in exchange of a sane man's sanity / Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantlepiece / Just switch your camera lenses, {{you will see the}} agony" [...] over a [...] "warbling" [...] electronic background and hip hop beats. Towards the song's conclusion, there is a [...] "sad" [...] string arrangement and an electronica-influenced [...] "triumphantly striding beat." [...] An editor from HipHopDX compared [...] "Castle Walls" [...] to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] by Eminem featuring Rihanna, which was also produced by da Kid.|$|E

500|$|The seven-track live {{record was}} {{recorded}} {{in front of a}} room full of people in New York City in the autumn of 1984. It has been rumored that the crowd noise was added in a studio rather than recorded on stage. Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer, asked Live Undead producer/engineer Bill Metoyer, who had worked on the album in Los Angeles. Metoyer responded: [...] "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> tell you ! Isn't that one of those great industry secrets? Let's just say that when you're doing a live record, you want live sound — even if perhaps the microphones didn't pick up the audience properly." ...|$|E
500|$|Iñárritu {{has made}} a special point of {{emphasizing}} the importance of historical issues of ethnicity approached in the film and reflected in the mixed ethnic background of Hugh Glass's son portrayed in the film (portrayed as half Pawnee by Glass's wife) as relating to his own life and his identification with ethnic concerns. Iñárritu has referred to having encountered constant xenophobia and stated that: [...] "These constant and relentless xenophobic (comments) have been widely spread by the media without shame, embraced and cheered by leaders and communities around the U.S. The foundation {{of all this is}} so outrageous that it can easily be minimized as an SNL sketch, a mere entertainment, a joke ... I debated with myself, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> bring up this uncomfortable subject tonight but in light of the constant and relentless xenophobic comments that have been expressed recently against my Mexican fellows, it is inevitable." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{protests from}} crewmen, {{who wanted the}} remains hosed over the deck, Callaghan insisted that the young Japanese airman had done his job {{to the best of}} his ability, with honor, and {{deserved}} a military funeral. Stephen Cromwell, a corpsman at the time, later recalled, [...] "I was able to recover his body and I called up to the bridge to ask <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> throw it overboard ... Captain Callaghan said, ‘No, when we secure, take it down to the sick bay, and we'll have a burial for him tomorrow.’" [...] Ivan Dexter, another crew member, gave his account of events to Herb Fahr, recalling that {{the top half of the}} Japanese pilot's body was scattered over the deck, while the bottom half fell with the rest of the plane into the sea. What remained of the body was brought to sick bay for examination, and various Missouri crew took souvenirs from the clothing, including the helmet, scarf, and jacket. Following examination, the remains were placed in a canvas bag with dummy shell casings to weigh it down.|$|E

500|$|In {{late summer}} {{he was invited}} by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling's family. She clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged {{to make it clear}} to her that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzymała [...] "My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores", and {{responding}} to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was [...] "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed." [...] He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September, and another in Edinburgh, at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October. In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam Łyszczyński, he wrote out his last will and testament—"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> drop dead somewhere", he wrote to Grzymała.|$|E
500|$|Live Undead is {{the first}} live album by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was {{released}} through Metal Blade Records and recorded in New York City {{in front of a}} room of people. It has been questioned by both critics and authors that the audience sound {{may or may not be}} faked. However, in 1984, WBAB Fingers Metal Shop, a radio station, held a contest to meet and hang out with Slayer during a live recording. The album was recorded at Tiki Recording Studios in Glen Cove, NY in front of around a dozen people. The album was originally intended to be recorded in front of a live audience, but things went wrong. Nevertheless, when asked if they were fake, producer Bill Metoyer said, [...] "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> tell you." [...] The album begins with an extended introduction of [...] "Black Magic", followed by a small speech. The remaining tracks include both those of 1983's Show No Mercy and 1984's Haunting the Chapel. Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the album two and a half out of five stars, and noted that it [...] "isn't really necessary except for the hardest of hardcore fans.|$|E
500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted. Collins stated that she [...] "had {{never heard of}} that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was {{mentioned}} to me, and I asked my editor <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'." [...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was [...] "not a rip off of Battle Royale, but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes.|$|E

500|$|Four {{years later}} Frederick was in action again, this {{time during the}} Franco-Prussian War of 1870, {{in which he was}} once more paired with Blumenthal and {{commanded}} the III Army, consisting of troops from the southern German states. He was praised for his leadership after defeating the French at the battles of Wissembourg and Wörth, and met with further successes at the Battle of Sedan and during the Siege of Paris. Frederick's humane treatment of his country's foes earned him their respect and the plaudits of neutral observers. After the Battle of Wörth, a London journalist witnessed the Crown Prince's many visits to wounded Prussian soldiers and lauded his deeds, extolling the love and respect the soldiers held for Frederick. Following his victory, Frederick had remarked to two Paris journalists, [...] "I do not like war gentlemen. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> reign I would never make it." [...] One French journalist remarked that [...] "the Crown Prince has left countless traits of kindness and humanity in the land that he fought against." [...] For his behaviour and accomplishments, The Times wrote a tribute to Frederick in July 1871, stating that [...] "the Prince has won as much honour for his gentleness as for his prowess in the war".|$|E
500|$|Confronted by a Puritan {{friend with}} rumours about his [...] "ungodly life", Dudley defended himself in 1576: I {{stand on the}} top of the hill, where ... the {{smallest}} slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel them as I have been and shall be most heartily sorry for them. With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He explained to her that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his [...] "utter overthrow": You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> marry I am sure never to have [...] favour". Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished. The affair continued and in 1574 [...] Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.|$|E
