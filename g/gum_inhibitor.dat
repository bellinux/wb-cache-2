40|$|GCMS {{study of}} Anogessus leocarpus gum (AL gum) {{indicated}} {{the presence of}} sucrose (10. 03 %), phthalic acid (2. 53 %), n-hexadecanoic acid (11. 73 %), oleic acid (30. 49 %), pentacenequinone (4. 41 %) and 2, 3 - diphenylnaphthoquinone (21. 43 %). The gum {{was found to be}} a good adsorption inhibitor for the corrosion of mild steel in HCl solution. The adsorption of the inhibitor on mild steel surface is exothermic, spontaneous, Langmuir type and supports the mechanism of charged transfer from the inhibitor’s molecule to the charged metal surface. FTIR study of the AL gum and the corrosion product of mild steel (in the presence of AL <b>gum</b> as an <b>inhibitor)</b> indicated the presence of interaction between the inhibitor and the metal surface (some shifts in frequencies of IR adsorption), some functional groups were used for the adsorption of the inhibitor onto the metal surface (missing functional groups) and others for the formation of Fe-inhibitor complex (new functional groups formed). The inhibition of mild steel corrosion is proposed to occur through synergistic combination of the constituents of the inhibitor, which facilitates the formation of multi-molecular layer of adsorption and the formation of inhibitor-metal complex, which protected the metal from further corrosion attack...|$|R
40|$|The {{biguanide}} metformin (dimethylbiguanide) is an oral antihyperglycaemic agent {{widely used}} {{in the management of}} non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Considerable renewal of interest in this drug has been observed in recent years. Metformin can be determined in biological fluids by various methods, mainly using high performance liquid chromatography, which allows pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers and diabetic patients. Metformin disposition is apparently unaffected by the presence of diabetes and only slightly affected by the use of different oral formulations. Metformin has an absolute oral bioavailability of 40 to 60 %, and gastrointestinal absorption is apparently complete within 6 hours of ingestion. An inverse relationship was observed between the dose ingested and the relative absorption with therapeutic doses ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 g, suggesting the involvement of an active, saturable absorption process. Metformin is rapidly distributed following absorption and does not bind to plasma proteins. No metabolites or conjugates of metformin have been identified. The absence of liver metabolism clearly differentiates the pharmacokinetics of metformin from that of other biguanides, such as phenformin. Metformin undergoes renal excretion and has a mean plasma elimination half-life after oral administration of between 4. 0 and 8. 7 hours. This elimination is prolonged in patients with renal impairment and correlates with creatinine clearance. There are only scarce data on the relationship between plasma metformin concentrations and metabolic effects. Therapeutic levels may be 0. 5 to 1. 0 mg/L in the fasting state and 1 to 2 mg/L after a meal, but monitoring has little clinical value except when lactic acidosis is suspected or present. Indeed, when lactic acidosis occurs in metformin-treated patients, early determination of the metformin plasma concentration appears to be the best criterion for assessing the involvement of the drug in this acute condition. After confirmation of the diagnosis, treatment should rapidly involve forced diuresis or haemodialysis, both of which favour rapid elimination of the drug. Although serious, lactic acidosis due to metformin is rare and may be minimised by strict adherence to prescribing guidelines and contraindications, particularly the presence of renal failure. Finally, only very few drug interactions have been described with metformin in healthy volunteers. Plasma levels may be reduced by guar <b>gum</b> and alpha-glucosidase <b>inhibitors</b> and increased by cimetidine, but no data are yet available in the diabetic population. Peer reviewe...|$|R
30|$|Corrosion {{is as old}} as {{the earth}} itself known to people as rust; {{corrosion}} is an undesirable phenomenon which destroys the luster and beauty of the metal and lessens their life. Corrosion is the destruction and deterioration of metals as a result of reaction with environment (Fontana and Greene 1987). It is a major problem that must be confronted for safety, environmental and economic reasons in various chemical, mechanical, metallurgical, biochemical, and medical engineering applications, and more specifically in the design of a much more varied number of mechanical parts which equally vary in size, functionality, and useful lifespan (Desai 2015). One of the most challenging and difficult tasks is to provide the protection of metals from corrosion. Controlling these detritions of metals and alloys is a costly course of action, and industries pay out enormous amounts to manage this crisis. The controlling expense of corrosion in the developed countries such as the USA and European Union is about 3 – 5 % of their gross national product (Bhaskaran et al. 2005).The use of corrosion inhibitors is the most reasonable and realistic way to protect metals from corrosion. Corrosion inhibitors decrease the rate of corrosion when added into the surrounding or solution of metals. They are either synthetic or natural. However, the attractiveness and use of synthetic compounds (Guendouz et al. 2013; Belfilali et al. 2012; Moreira et al. 2014; Ajmal et al. 1994; Lagrenee et al. 2002; El-Maksoud 2004; Elachouri et al. 1996; Kilmartin et al. 2002; Nishimura 1993; Kabanda and Ebenso 2012; Kabanda et al. 2012 a; Kabanda et al. 2012 b) as a corrosion inhibitor is losing ground because of their noxious and hazardous effects on mankind. Therefore, necessities occur to build up a different category of corrosion inhibitors with low poisonous effect, environment friendly and effective efficiency. This new general approach, called green chemistry, was declared which aims for the reduction and replacement of hazardous materials {{in order to protect the}} environment and people. Plants have been used by human beings for their basic needs and seem to be a promising source of cheap and harmless corrosion inhibitors. The oldest uses of plants were reported as corrosion inhibitor of Chelidonium majus (celandine) and other plants in 1930 s (Raja and Sethuraman 2008). After this discovery, natural products drag the attention of scientists around the world for the research on plant extracts for corrosion inhibition. Among others, considered substances are gums, animal proteins, herbs, and even fruit peals (Africa 2008; Al-Otaibi et al. 2014; Oguzie 2006; Abdel-Gaber et al. 2009; Oguzie 2007; Kliškić et al. 2000; Benabdellah et al. 2006; Abiola et al. 2007; Raja and Sethuraman 2009; El-Etre et al. 2005). Gums have been found to be good corrosion inhibitors due to their functional group; they form complexes with metal ions and on the metal surfaces. Most gums have -COOH functional groups, which can increase the contribution of electron or charge transfer and hence facilitate inhibition through adsorption. Literature on the use of <b>gums</b> as corrosion <b>inhibitors</b> is very little (Eddy et al. 2013; Abdallah 2004; Umoren et al. 2008; Ameh et al. 2012). Guar gum drags special attention because of its safe use and high molecular size. The gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS) spectra of the gum show the presence of heteroatoms. Gum metal complexes occupy a large surface area, thereby blanketing the surface and shielding the metal from corrosive agents present in the solution. The presence of arbinogalactan, sucrose, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glucoprotein confirms the presence of compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen atoms there, which are the active centers of adsorption (Gardner and Eikerts 1983; Bumgartner et al. 1983; Shah and Walters 1984; Peter et al. 2015).|$|R
