40|$|In recent years, {{the already}} {{idealized}} practice of families sitting down together {{to eat a}} <b>homemade</b> <b>meal</b> and enjoy each other's company has been bolstered by academic research that suggests family meals are good for children. In response to these findings, several organizations have launched campaigns promoting family meals. In this dissertation, I compare the ways family meals are framed by the organizations that promote them to how parents frame them by conducting a qualitative content analysis of ten campaign websites and interviews with 46 parents. The sample of campaigns represents commercial and nonprofit organizations, and the sample of parents varies by income and marital status, allowing me to determine whether frames used by {{a certain type of}} organization are likely to resonate with certain demographics. My findings suggest that while organizational framing of family meals is sometimes similar to way parents frame them, there are some important disjunctions that are likely to decrease the potential effectiveness of the campaigns. In general, campaigns frame family meals more in terms of conversation and what happens around the table, while parents frame them more in terms of food and labor. When campaign frames do match parents' frames, they align more closely with higher-income and married parents, particularly in the case of commercial organizations, while nonprofit campaigns align more closely with lower-income and single parents. This project contributes to the literatures on framing, social marketing, and consumption by using frame analysis to gauge the potential effectiveness of the promotion of a set of everyday consumption practices. It provides insight into how parents think about and perform the tasks involved in creating family meals within an organizational context and the creation of cultural discourse about them. A practical application is using this information to improve the promotion of family meals, particularly for lower-income and single parents...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} meaning of {{convenience}} food for UK mothers, investigating the relationship between mothers and their families’ food. The study examines the role of convenience food within the food strategies of contemporary UK families, and aims to elicit consumption meanings in the broader social context of family relationships with food, their rituals, routines and conventions. The findings reveal convenience has multiple meanings for UK women, and that convenience food has been incorporated into reinterpreted versions of <b>homemade</b> and ‘proper’ <b>meals.</b> A hierarchy of acceptable convenience food is presented by the mothers, who tackle complex and conflicting family routines by introducing convenience solutions. Rules of eating have evolved, yet remain essentially controlled by the mother in terms of nutrition. While the traditional model of ‘proper’ food remains aspirational, contemporary family lifestyles require that convenience food {{become part of the}} equation...|$|R

Some tenants resented her stinginess and complained that {{she refused to}} give them their mail or money; others praised her for small acts of kindness or for her generous <b>homemade</b> <b>meals.</b> Her motives for killing tenants were financial, with police estimates of her ill-gotten income totaling more than $5,000 per month. The murders begun shortly after Puente began renting out space in the home at 1426 F Street. In April 1982, 61-year-old friend and business partner Ruth Monroe began living with Puente in her upstairs apartment, but soon died from an overdose of codeine and acetaminophen. Puente told police that the woman was very depressed because her husband was terminally ill. They believed her and ruled the incident as a suicide.|$|E

The field played a vital role as the main air logistics center and staging area; as the base expanded, it eventually merged with the nearby Fort Richardson. With the influx of military personnel, the Spring Creek Lodge quickly became the go-to destination. The lodge was famous for its cozy atmosphere with smells of <b>homemade</b> bread and <b>meals</b> served by the Haik sisters.

5000|$|Childhood {{obesity in}} the United States is growing rapidly, {{but can be}} {{controlled}} if nutrition courses become a mandatory curriculum in grade schools, [...] "screen time" [...] is limited to {{only a few hours}} a day, and parents are educated on how to cook nutritionally. There is an excessive amount of American children who do not have proper nutritional knowledge. In recent years, courses such as home Economics have been slowly eliminated as they are always among the top to be cut out when sufficient funds are not available. “Screen time” has also been directly linked to obesity. Food intake is taking place in excess during this hobby while limiting children’s activity levels. Childhood obesity largely stems from what a child is given to eat by their parents. There has been a drastic change in the last thirty years from children receiving home cooked meals to children consuming highly processed and fast foods on a regular basis. Parents are no longer cooking <b>homemade</b> <b>meals</b> for their children and it is thought to be due to their lack of cooking knowledge. Having the knowledge of basic fruits and vegetables is a crucial tool for children to possess when it comes time for them to choose a healthy snack or meal on their own. Studies have shown that educating both the parents and the children of America is crucial when it comes to controlling this epidemic.|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{approached}} {{the issue of}} the motivations for choice of meal solutions. This is, however, a matter of undeniable importance when individuals select, purchase, prepare and consume foods. This study resorted to the means-end chain theory and laddering interviews to conduct an analysis of the motives behind the choice of meal solutions of 50 Dutch subjects. The analysis yielded hierarchical value maps for <b>homemade</b> <b>meals,</b> ready meals, take-out and eating out (as general meal solutions), and for frozen pizza and chilled hotpot (as specific ready meals). Results show that the replacement of <b>homemade</b> <b>meals</b> by ready meals is, to a great extent, dependent on how subjects trade-off perceived sensory and health-related benefits with convenience features. Meal context, a highly positive evaluation of homemade cooking and some moral-based criticism towards saving time and energy in food preparation may nevertheless play a considerable role in meal solutions¿ choice...|$|E

40|$|Ultra-processed {{foods are}} ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat {{products}} created to replace traditional <b>homemade</b> <b>meals</b> and dishes due to convenience and accessibility. Because of their low-fiber and high-fat and sugar composition, these foodstuffs could induce {{a negative impact}} on health. They are partially responsible for obesity and chronic non-transmissible diseases; additionally, they could impact in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. The rationale is that the nutritional composition of ultra-processed foodstuffs can induce gut dysbiosis, promoting a pro-inflammatory response and consequently, a “leaky gut”. These factors have been associated with increased risk of autoimmunity in genetically predisposed children. In addition, food emulsifiers, commonly used in ultra-processed products could modify the gut microbiota and intestinal permeability, which could increase the risk of autoimmunity. In contrast, unprocessed and minimally processed food-based diets have shown the capacity to promote gut microbiota eubiosis, anti-inflammatory response, and epithelial integrity, through bacterial butyrate production. Thus, to decrease the susceptibility to autoimmunity, genetically predisposed children should avoid ultra-processed food products and encourage the consumption of fresh and minimally processed foods...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{publishes the}} results of a survey conducted on 806 subjects to study factors contributing to increased household waste and to investigate public awareness and opinion on treatment options. The objective is to estimate the Number of Waste bags disposed per household and find factors corresponding to that increase. These factors consist of any possible demographic characteristic involving: nationality, household income, property type, number of family members per household, number of maids if any, number of employed family members, number of vehicles per household, highest educational level attained per family guardian, number of family members below the age of twenty one, etc. In addition, the survey investigates behavioral aspects that are expected to also contribute to increased solid household waste; such as, dining using home deliveries versus <b>homemade</b> <b>meals,</b> and number of grocery shopping trips per week. Furthermore, the survey explores the public awareness on environmental concerns that are linked to increased household waste, and public opinion on tariff associated with waste recycling.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} effect of recent {{widowhood}} on weight, dietary intake, and habits. Methods: Participants included 58 recently widowed elderly subjects and 58 married subjects who were matched on age, sex, and race. Weight change from base-line and following widowhood, dietary intake, eating behavior, depression, and cog-nitive and physical functioning were assessed in a clinic interview. Results: Mean weight loss and the prevalence of weight loss were significantly higher among wid-owed participants. They ate more meals alone, more commercial meals per week, and fewer snacks and <b>homemade</b> <b>meals.</b> They also enjoyed their eating less. A significant difference between cases and controls was evident after adjusting for all the variables. Higher cognitive functioning score, younger age, and better appetite were protective against weight loss. Discussion: Widowed people {{were found to be}} at increased risk for weight loss. This may well be due to decreased appetite and enjoyment of their meals. Besides being an extremely painful life event (Vachon, 1976), the loss of a spouse entails higher morbidity (Parkes, 1964 a, 1964 b) and mor-tality (Helsing, Moyers, & George, 1981).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: {{endoscopic}} gastrostomy (PEG) patients usually present protein-energy malnutrition, {{but little}} is known about selenium deficiency. We aimed to assess serum selenium evolution when patients underwent PEG, after 4 and 12 weeks. We also evaluated the evolution of albumin, transferrin and Body Mass Index and the influence {{of the nature of the}} underlying disease. METHODS: a blood sample was obtained before PEG (T 0), after 4 (T 1) and 12 (T 3) weeks. Selenium was assayed using GFAAS (Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy). The PEG patients were fed through <b>homemade</b> <b>meals.</b> Patients were studied as a whole and divided into two groups: head and neck cancer (HNC) and neurological dysphagia (ND). RESULTS: we assessed 146 patients (89 males), between 21 - 95 years old: HNC- 56; ND- 90. Normal values of selenium in 79 % (n= 115); low albumin in 77, low transferrin in 94, low values for both serum proteins in 66. Low BMI in 78. Selenium has slow evolution, with most patients still displaying normal Selenium at T 3 (82 %). Serum protein levels increase from T 0 to T 3, most patients reaching normal values. The nature of the underlying disease is associated with serum proteins but not with selenium. CONCLUSIONS: low serum selenium is uncommon when PEG is performed, after 4 and 12 weeks of enteral feeding and cannot be related with serum proteins levels or dysphagia cause. Enteral nutrition using customized homemade kitchen meals is satisfactory to prevent or correct Selenium deficiency in the majority of PEG patients. "info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Patients that {{underwent}} Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) {{present with}} protein-energy malnutrition. Trace elements are required in small quantities and Chromium (Cr) displays {{a major role}} in the metabolism. OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate Cr levels and its relationship with serum proteins, BMI and underlying diseases during the first 3 months of PEG feeding. METHODS Prospective observational study during 3 -months, when PEG was performed (T 0), after 4 (T 1), and 12 weeks (T 3). Initial evaluation included: age, gender, underlying disease, NRS- 2002, BMI, serum albumin, transferrin and Cr concentration. At T 1 and T 3 a blood sample was collected for Cr, albumin and transferrin. A Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy was used to assess Cr. According with the underlying disease, patients were divided into two groups: head and neck cancer (HNC) and neurological dysphagia (ND). All patients were fed with <b>homemade</b> <b>meals.</b> RESULTS A one hundred and twenty-nine patients (80 males), 26 - 95 years old were studied: HNC- 52; ND- 77. The observed data included low mean values of BMI from 71 patients; low Cr- 8, low albumin- 70, low transferrin- 85 and 57 with both proteins low. Albumin was associated with survival time (P = 0. 024) and there was a significant correlation between albumin and Cr (r= 0. 217, P = 0. 012). A good evolution of Cr and proteins values was observed, with no low Cr levels at T 3. CONCLUSION Low serum Cr is rare in PEG-patients, with no relationship to other studied parameters. For the minority of patients displaying low Cr before gastrostomy, homemade PEG meals seem to be effective...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} - Patients undergoing endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) present with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) but little are known about zinc status. Our {{aim was to}} evaluate serum zinc, its relationship with serum proteins and {{with the nature of}} the underlying disorder, during the first 3 months of PEG feeding. Methods and study design - Prospective observational study during a 3 -month period after gastrostomy. Data were collected at initial PEG procedure (T 0), after 4 (T 1) and 12 weeks (T 3). Initial evaluation included: age, gender, a disorder causing dysphagia, Neurological Dysphagia (ND) or Head and Neck Cancer (HNC), NRS- 2002, BMI, albumin, transferrin, zinc. At T 1 and T 3, a blood sample was collected for zinc, albumin, transferrin. Serum zinc evaluation was performed with ICP-AES - Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy. Patients were fed with <b>homemade</b> <b>meals.</b> Results - A total of 146 patients (89 males), 21 - 95 years were studied: HNC- 56, ND- 90 and low BMI in 78. Initial low zinc in 122; low albumin in 77, low transferrin in 94; low values for both proteins in 66. Regarding the serum protein evolution, their levels increase T 0 -T 3, most patients reaching normal values. zinc has a slower evolution, most patients still displaying low zinc at T 3. Significant differences between the 3 moments for zinc (p= 0. 011), albumin (p< 0. 0001) and transferrin (p= 0. 014). Conclusion - PEG patients are prone to PEM and zinc deficiency. Most patients present decreased zinc, suggesting that zinc deficiency is common in PEG candidates and is not corrected during 3 months of enteral feeding. Zinc deficiency should be expected and teams taking care of PEG patients should use zinc supplementation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate cooking practices and cooking knowledge in a rural environment, as well as learn how the kitchen environment may reflect and/or shape an individual‘s process when creating a meal. Qualitative methods were implemented allowing for the data to be triangulated. The research methods used included a semi-structured interview, participant questionnaire, and videotaping dinner time meal preparations by the primary meal preparer on two separate occasions. Emergent themes {{about the role of the}} rural food environment began to develop surrounding how respondents procure food. The rural Vermonter relied on using home gardens, farmers‘ markets, and community supported agriculture to procure food. Another theme that emerged was the role of the primary meal preparer, or the ―nutritional gatekeeper. ‖ The nutritional gatekeeper was a huge component in controlling family meals and portion sizes inside, and outside the home, and the ingredients used in <b>homemade</b> <b>meals.</b> All rural respondents had some degree of cooking skills that began at a young age. Their skills were honed over time by necessity and/or curiosity. Rural respondents had general nutrition knowledge that was evident by their definition of a healthy meal, and procuring the freshest ingredients. The kitchen space was less of an influential factor when creating a meal than initially anticipated, but was the processing center where procured food items were crafted into a meal. The theme surrounding the environment and local foods strengthens the 21 st century‘s shift of what consumers are demanding from the Nation‘s food system. Understanding how nutritional gatekeepers choose to prepare meals, and the influence of their food environment on the meal thought process, may make the domestic home a platform to disseminate healthful cooking practices. This study concluded an ongoing ethnographic study investigating peoples cooking practices, and cooking knowledge in an urban (Boston metropolis), suburban (Burlington, VT), and rural (Franklin and Lamoille County, VT) environments as an implication towards health...|$|E

On its way {{the most interesting}} objects are Petrlaška caves, lakes Smilovska, Native library and museum, a traditional village architecture - timbered buildings (ethno house "Bekov," for example) {{as well as the}} village records and crosses "meals". The path is marked with labels bridle way (green circle with a white dot in the middle) and green signposts with the horse and rider and number 2. Navigating is easy, using the map alone. In 2006 were marked more tens of kilometres bridle ways, biking and hiking trails, and paths for field vehicles are traced and drawn in maps. Organisation "Natura Balkanika" in 2010 made a new, detailed map of the area, tourist guide and a card with GPS coordinates, allowing the movement of tourists in the field more facilitated under conditions of lack of road tourist signs. It was made 20 tourist maps of most famous places. In the new map 2 tourist paths are traced: "Milky Way", which talks about the traditional way of production of dairy products from old meadows and pastures of the mountain Stara planina, to workshops for cheese and yoghurt museum in Trn municipality and "Treasure Hunt", which allows you to experience the cultural heritage of the area, traditional crafts, treasure of the spiritual heritage, music and visual arts, starting at Stara planina waterfalls, canyons and cliffs, through caves, monasteries and talented local artists - musicians, painters and so on. In the region Zabrdje, which is the largest karst field in Serbia, there are numerous caves, bays and depressions, which make the region attractive for educational tourism. The most important is a group of caves of unique system that was built by the underground river Odorovacka River. Visit of the cave and rest next to her with the traditional "white breakfast" is the first longer stay on this path.
