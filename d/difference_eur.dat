40|$|Background Patients {{suffering}} from inoperable chronic critical leg ischaemia (NR-CCLI) face amputation of the leg. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) {{has been proposed}} as a helpful treatment in addition to standard conservative treatment. Objectives To find evidence for an improvement on limb salvage, pain relief, and the clinical situation using SCS compared to conservative treatment alone. Search methods For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2013) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12). Selection criteria Controlled studies comparing the addition of SCS with any form of conservative treatment to conservative treatment alone in patients with NR-CCLI. Data collection and analysis Both authors independently assessed {{the quality of the}} studies and extracted data. Main results Six studies comprising nearly 450 patients were included. In general the quality of the studies was good. No study was blinded due to the type of intervention. Limb salvage after 12 months was significantly higher in the SCS group (risk ratio (RR) 0. 71, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 56 to 0. 90; risk difference (RD) - 0. 11, 95 % CI - 0. 20 to - 0. 02). Significant pain relief occurred in both treatment groups, but was more prominent in the SCS group where the patients required significantly less analgesics. In the SCS group, significantly more patients reached Fontaine stage II than in the conservative group (RR 4. 9, 95 % CI 2. 0 to 11. 9; RD 0. 33, 95 % CI 0. 19 to 0. 47). Overall, no significantly different effect on ulcer healing was observed with the two treatments. Complications of SCS treatment consisted of implantation problems (9 %, 95 % CI 4 to 15 %) and changes in stimulation requiring re-intervention (15 %, 95 % CI 10 to 20 %). Infections of the lead or pulse generator pocket occurred less frequently (3 %, 95 % CI 0 to 6 %). Overall risk of complications with additional SCS treatment was 17 % (95 % CI 12 to 22 %), indicating a number needed to harm of 6 (95 % CI 5 to 8). Average overall costs (one study) at two years were EUR 36, 500 (SCS group) and EUR 28, 600 (conservative group). The <b>difference</b> (<b>EUR</b> 7900) was significant (P < 0. 009). Authors' conclusions There is evidence to favour SCS over standard conservative treatment alone to improve limb salvage and clinical situations in patients with NR-CCLI. The benefits of SCS must be considered against the possible harm of relatively mild complications and the cost...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a probabilistic model for shale gas development economic evaluation {{by considering the}} <b>differences</b> in well <b>EUR</b> and natural gas productivity due to variable geological/reservoir characteristics across a basin. The Horn River shale gas play in western Canada is used as an example to demonstrate the differences in economic outcomes under various financial terms for the same shale gas play.|$|R
40|$|Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has radically {{affected}} {{the way of}} accessing information and performing research in academic libraries. With the adoption of ICT, end-users’ requirements (EURs) have increased and changed. Thus, the main concern of academic libraries has shifted to address and accommodate these requirements. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify EURs of the AIUL in Syria. Mixed methods approach, using questionnaires and interview, is adopted to collect data from different end-users’ groups; 228 of undergraduate students (USs), and 30 of academic staff (AS) participated in this study to understand their requirements of the AIUL. Furthermore, 8 academic librarians were involved in obtaining further understanding. Findings showed that EURs were high in terms of providing supportive IRs, experts, high-quality services and personal services. There was a <b>difference</b> on the <b>EURs</b> regarding their groups...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: to {{investigate}} the prevalence of intermittent claudication (IC) in an unselected population of nearly 20 000 individuals between 40 and 69 years of age. Design: epidemiologic investigation of residents in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway. Material and Methods: between 1995 and 1997, all residents 20 {{years of age or}} older in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway, were invited to attend the HUNT Study. A total of 19 748 participants between 40 and 69 years of age responded to questions related to the symptoms of intermittent claudication. We estimated the prevalence of IC based on these questions. Results: the age-adjusted prevalence of intermittent claudication in the total population was 1. 1 % for men and 1. 2 % for women. We found an increase in the prevalence of IC by age, however, no sex differences were observed. Conclusion: the prevalence of intermittent claudication increased gradually by age. However, in contrast to previous reports, there was no <b>difference</b> by sex. <b>Eur</b> J Vasc Endovasc Surg 25, 209 – 212 (2003...|$|R
