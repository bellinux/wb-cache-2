To put it differently, Autists have an individual culture that's often very different from their environment.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in recent}} years, {{there has been}} {{controversy}} over even consensual sexual interactions between students and teachers, especially within the last decade. Like many, Gallop asserts that the relationships between a teacher and a student <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> that of a parent and a child. (Gallop, 1997) However, it is this parallel that many say is the reason teacher-pupil sexual contact and relations are immoral because they are too closely akin to incest, and similar long-term damages can result.|$|E

Erika is very friendly, cute, and kind, she <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> a princess. After she is crowned princess at the 'Princess Contest', she is kidnapped by two cloaked men (later revealed to be humanoids) and {{it is up to}} Kilala and her newfound companions to retrieve her. Soon after Kilala and Rei's adventure in Snow White's world, the duo find Erica, but she's behaving quite abnormally and even tries to steal the tiara of the seventh princess because the men hypnotized Erica to steal the tiara for them. In volume 2, it is revealed that she is not the seventh princess.|$|E

25|$|The second {{effect of}} {{weightlessness}} {{takes place in}} human fluids. The body {{is made up of}} 60% water, much of it intra-vascular and inter-cellular. Within a few moments of entering a microgravity environment, fluid is immediately re-distributed to the upper body resulting in bulging neck veins, puffy face and sinus and nasal congestion which can last throughout the duration of the trip and <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> the symptoms of the common cold. In space the autonomic reactions of the body to maintain blood pressure are not required and fluid is distributed more widely around the whole body. This results in a decrease in plasma volume of around 20%. These fluid shifts initiate a cascade of adaptive systemic effects that can be dangerous upon return to earth. Orthostatic intolerance results in astronauts returning to Earth after extended space missions being unable to stand unassisted for more than 10 minutes at a time without fainting. This {{is due in part to}} changes in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and the loss of plasma volume. Although this effect becomes worse the longer the time spent in space, as yet all individuals have returned to normal within at most a few weeks of landing.|$|E

500|$|Clocking in at {{over two}} hours in length and {{containing}} 34 tracks, The Astonishing was planned as an immersive experience that would be best enjoyed as a full album {{as opposed to a}} collection of singles. The album plays out similarly to a film, with Loudwire observing, [...] "It’s an enormous amount of music to absorb in one sitting, but when you think about it, most movies are around {{two hours in}} length, and The Astonishing <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> a movie in the way it delivers the storyline." [...] Certain songs, such as [...] "A Savior in the Square" [...] and [...] "Our New World", have reoccurring themes, while others stand more on their own in order to move the plot along.|$|E

[...] The Torchwood writers conceived John as a classical nemesis for Captain Jack, with Chibnall commenting, [...] "In seeing John you see the way Jack could have gone, and probably did, for a little while." [...] James Marsters further discussed ways in which John is a doppelgänger or foil to Captain Jack: both are pansexual time travellers, with their key difference being that John never reformed. The character exaggerates many of Jack's qualities, for example displaying zoophilic attraction to non-humanoids such as poodles, in addition to men and women. John and Jack's intentional similarities extend to their penchant for period war clothing: ...|$|E

500|$|Rachel, {{along with}} Kurt, {{plans to attend}} a {{performing}} arts school in New York City after graduation. School counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) suggests they consider The New York Academy of Dramatic Arts (NYADA), a highly desirable school. The two attend an Ohio [...] "mixer" [...] for potential applicants, {{only to discover that}} their competition <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> them, and quite talented. Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical, since she believes herself to be a shoo-in for the lead role, Maria, and she needs the experience for her NYADA application. However, Mercedes also auditions for Maria, and the directors, unable to decide {{between the two of them}} even after head-to-head callbacks, decide to double-cast the role, giving Rachel and Mercedes each a week of the two-week run. Mercedes, believing she did better in the callbacks, refuses to accept the double-casting and withdraws from the show, leaving Rachel to be Maria. She and Finn decide to have sex in the episode [...] "The First Time". In the episode [...] "Mash Off", Rachel abruptly withdraws from the race for senior class president in favor of Kurt after she realizes he might not get into NYADA with her if he doesn't win. She goes even further in the next episode, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", when she stuffs an election ballot box in Kurt's favor to keep him from losing. He loses anyway, and she confesses: she is suspended from school for a week and forbidden to compete in Sectionals with New Directions, though the glee club wins without her. At the end of the episode [...] "Yes/No", Finn asks her to marry him, and after hesitating for several days, she accepts. Their parents find out in [...] "Heart", and hope to discourage the pair, but their plans backfire and the wedding date is moved up to May. Even that date seems too distant, so Rachel and Finn later decide to marry after Regionals in [...] "On My Way".|$|E

2500|$|Black {{phosphorus}} is the thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus at {{room temperature}} and pressure, with a heat of formation of -39.3 kJ/mol (relative to white phosphorus which {{is defined as the}} standard state).
