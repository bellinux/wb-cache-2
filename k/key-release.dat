30|$|The most {{apparent}} application of BCSs is biometric-dependent <b>key-release</b> within conventional cryptosystems, replacing insecure password- or PIN-based <b>key-release</b> [8]. Eliminating this weak link within cryptosystems, biometric-dependent <b>key-release</b> results in substantial security benefits making cryptographic systems {{more suitable for}} high security applications.|$|E
30|$|Several {{concepts}} of BCSs {{can be applied}} as both, key-generation and key-binding scheme [15, 16]. Hybrid approaches which make use of more basic concepts [17] have been proposed, too. Furthermore, schemes which declare different goals such as enhancing the security of an existing secret [18, 19] have been introduced. In contrast to BCSs based on key-binding or key-generation, <b>key-release</b> schemes represent a loose coupling of biometric authentication and <b>key-release</b> [8]. In case of successful biometric authentication a <b>key-release</b> mechanism is initiated, i.e., a cryptographic key is released. The loose coupling of biometric and cryptographic systems allows to exchange both components easily. However, a great drawback emerges, since the separate plain storage of biometric templates and keys offers more vulnerabilities to conduct attacks. <b>Key-release</b> schemes do not meet requirements of biometric template protection and, thus, are hardly appropriate for high security applications and not usually considered a BCS. Another way to classify BCSs {{is to focus on}} how these systems deal with biometric variance. While some schemes apply error correction codes [15, 16], others introduce adjustable filter functions and correlation [20] or quantization [21, 22].|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} {{response}} facilitation in choice reaction tasks achieved by priming the (previously perceived) effect is based on stimulus-response associations rather than on response-effect associations. The reduced key-press response time is not accounted for by earlier established couplings between the key-press movement and its subsequent effect, but instead results from couplings between this effect and the contingent <b>key-release</b> movement. This <b>key-release</b> movement is an intrinsic part of the entire performed response action in each trial of a reaction-time task, and always spontaneously follows the key-press movement. Eliminating the <b>key-release</b> movement from the task leads to {{the disappearance of the}} response facilitation, which raises the question whether response-effect associations actually play a role in studies that use the effect-priming paradigm. Together the three experiments presented in the paper cast serious doubts on the claim that action-effect couplings are acquired and utilized by the cognitive system in the service of action selection, and that the priming paradigm by itself can provide convincing evidence for this claim. As a corollary, we question whether the related two-step model for the ideomotor principle holds a satisfying explanation for how anticipation of future states guides action planning. The results presented here may have profound implications for priming studies in other disciplines of psychology as well. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{couple of}} {{studies showed that}} {{auditory}} processing of sounds presented concurrently with one’s own actions is attenuated. Because in these studies actions were key-presses, {{it was hypothesized that}} attenuation might be caused by robust key-press-effect associations formed by long-term interactions with everyday devices. Key-pressing may be special because most everyday devices are designed to comply with the perceived affordance that a key/button should be pressed to trigger an effect. Therefore, key-presses would attenuate auditory processing, but <b>key-releases</b> would not. In the present experiment, participants marked time intervals by pressing or releasing a key. Independently, a random sequence of tones was presented. Tones coinciding with a key-press or –release elicited similarly attenuated Tb, vertex N 1, and P 2 ERPs, suggesting that coincidence-related auditory attenuation is not brought about by special key-press-effect associations. Whereas Tb and P 2 attenuations were pure amplitude modulations, vertex N 1 was attenuated (partly) by an overlapping coincidence-related ERP...|$|R
40|$|Biogenic amines have {{widespread}} {{effects on}} numerous behaviors, but their natural functions are often unclear. We investigated {{the role of}} octopamine (OA), the invertebrate analogue of noradrenaline, on initiation and maintenance of aggression in male crickets of different social status. The <b>key-releasing</b> stimulus for aggression is antennal fencing between males, a behavior occurring naturally on initial contact. We show that mechanical antennal stimulation (AS) alone is sufficient to initiate an aggressive response (mandible threat display). The efficacy of AS was augmented in winners of a previous fight, but unaffected in losers. The efficacy of AS was not, however, influenced by OA receptor (OAR) agonists or antagonists, regardless of social status. Additional experiments indicate that the efficacy of AS is also not influenced by dopamine (DA) or serotonin (5 HT). In addition to initiating an aggressive response, prior AS enhanced aggression exhibited in subsequent fights, whereby AS with a male antenna was now necessary, indicating a role for male contact pheromones. This priming effect of male-AS on subsequent aggression was dependent on OA since it was blocked by OAR-antagonists, and enhanced by OAR-agonists. Together our data reveal that neither OA, DA nor 5 HT are required for initiating aggression in crickets, nor do these amines influence {{the efficacy of the}} natural releasing stimulus to initiate aggression. OA’s natural function is restricted to promoting escalation and maintenance of aggression once initiated, and this can be invoked by numerous experiences, including prior contact with a male antenna as shown here...|$|R
30|$|Form a privacy {{perspective}} most concerns {{against the}} common use of biometrics {{arise from the}} storage and misuse of biometric data. Biometric cryptosystems and cancelable biometrics represent emerging technologies of biometric template protection addressing these concerns and improving public confidence and acceptance of biometrics. In addition, biometric cryptosystems provide mechanisms for biometric-dependent <b>key-release.</b> In the last years {{a significant amount of}} approaches to both technologies have been published. A comprehensive survey of biometric cryptosystems and cancelable biometrics is presented. State-of-the-art approaches are reviewed based on which an in-depth discussion and an outlook to future prospects are given.|$|E
40|$|The {{intentional}} {{binding effect}} {{refers to a}} subjective compression over a temporal interval between the start point initialized by a voluntary action and the endpoint signaled by an external sensory (visual or audio) feedback. The present study aimed to {{explore the influence of}} tactile sensory feedback on this binding effect by comparing voluntary key-press actions with voluntary <b>key-release</b> actions. In experiment 1, each participant was instructed to report the perceived interval (in ms) between an action and the subsequent visual sensory feedback. In this task, either the action (key-press or <b>key-release)</b> was voluntarily performed by the participant or a kinematically identical movement was passively applied to the left index finger of the participant. In experiment 2, we explored whether the difference in the perception of time was affected by the direction of action. In experiment 3, we developed an apparatus in which two parallel laser beams were generated by a laser emission unit and detected by a laser receiver unit; this allowed the movement of the left index finger to be detected without it touching a keyboard (i. e., without any tactile sensory feedback). Convergent results from all of the experiments showed that the temporal binding effect was only observed when the action was both voluntary and involved physical contact with the key, suggesting that the combination of intention and tactile sensory feedback, as a form of top-down processing, likely distracted attention from temporal events and caused the different binding effects...|$|E
30|$|A sound {{synthesis}} algorithm for the harpsichord {{has been developed}} by applying the principles of digital waveguide modeling. A modification to the loss filter of the string model is introduced that allows more flexible control of decay rates of partials than is possible with a one-pole digital filter, which is a usual choice for the loss filter. A version of the commuted waveguide synthesis approach is used, where each tone is generated with a parallel combination of the string model and a second-order resonator that are excited with a common excitation signal. The second-order resonator, previously proposed for this purpose, approximately simulates the beating effect appearing in many harpsichord tones. The characteristic <b>key-release</b> thump terminating harpsichord tones is reproduced by triggering a sample that has been extracted from a recording. A digital filter model for the soundboard has been designed based on recorded bridge impulse responses of the harpsichord. The output of the string models is injected in the soundboard filter that imitates the reverberant nature of the soundbox and, particularly, the ringing of the short parts of the strings behind the bridge.|$|E
