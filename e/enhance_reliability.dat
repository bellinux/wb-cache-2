5000|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) {{had several}} {{improvements}} to <b>enhance</b> <b>reliability</b> and power. This explains {{phrases such as}} [...] "Main engines throttling up to 104 percent." [...] This did not mean the engines were being run over a safe limit. The 100 percent figure was the original specified power level. During the lengthy development program, Rocketdyne determined the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104 percent of the originally specified thrust. NASA could have rescaled the output number, saying in essence 104 percent is now 100 percent. To clarify this would have required revising much previous documentation and software, so the 104 percent number was retained. SSME upgrades were denoted as [...] "block numbers", such as block I, block II, and block IIA. The upgrades improved engine reliability, maintainability and performance. The 109% thrust level was finally reached in flight hardware with the Block II engines in 2001.
