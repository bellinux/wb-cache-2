5000|$|Abreu's first {{landmark}} {{contribution to}} the radiography of soft tissues (until then not much utilized as a diagnostic radiographical method, due to the low definition of images) was to develop an x-ray densitometry method, by comparing the degree of white density of biological tissues to water's and to other highly dense references, such as bones, and to point out its value <b>for</b> <b>radiodiagnosis.</b> In 1921 he first published his pioneering work on the radiological interpretation of pulmonary injuries in pleuropulmonary tuberculosis, titled [...] "Le Radiodiagnostic dans la Tuberculose Pleuro-Pulmonaire". This and his method of pulmonary densitometry gave him an invitation to join the prestigious Académie de Médicine de Paris.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the hospital started in 1927 and in that same year, the hospital {{was able to take}} care of 30 people. An operating room, a pharmacy and a washhouse were added in 1928. In 1932, a room <b>for</b> <b>radiodiagnosis</b> was added. During World War II, in 1941, the hospital was extended with another hall that could fit 30 patients, as well as a delivery room. A maternity department was added in 1952 and in 1957, an internal medicine department was added. Finally, the hospital was extended with a pediatrics department. After these works, however, renovations and more specialised medical departments were needed in the hospital.|$|E
40|$|Pyrophosphate arthropathy (PPA) is {{a disease}} that arises due to the {{formation}} and deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals within the articular cartilage and thereby develops into immune inflammation. Its diagnosis requires the detection of characteristic calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the synovial fluid from the affected joint, {{as well as the}} signs of cartilage calcification or chondrocalcinosis visible on conventional X-ray films. The paper considers reasons why it is difficult to visualize chondrocalcinosis by knee joint radiography and compares the importance of three techniques <b>for</b> the <b>radiodiagnosis</b> of chondrocalcinosis as one of the important criteria for diagnosing PPA...|$|R
40|$|A twenty-year-old second gravida {{presented}} {{to the department of}} <b>radiodiagnosis</b> <b>for</b> routine obstetric ultrasound examination. Ultrasonography revealed a live fetus of 17 weeks with absent falx, fused thalami, monoventricle, proboscis, and cyclopia. Fetal MRI was performed and the findings were confirmed. Even though ultrasonography is diagnostic in the detection of fetal anomalies, MRI plays a vital role due to its multiplanar capability and excellent soft tissue resolution. The importance of presenting this classical case of alobar holoprosencephaly is to sensitize the clinicians and radiologists to the imaging manifestations of holoprosencephaly and to stress the importance of early diagnosis. If diagnosed in utero at an early stage of pregnancy, termination can be performed and maternal psychological trauma of bearing a deformed fetus can be avoided...|$|R
40|$|The Harvard-MIT Research Program in Short-lived Radiopharmaceuticals was {{established}} in 1977 to foster interaction among groups working in radiopharmaceutical chemistry at Harvard Medical School, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts General Hospital. To this was added a group at The Childrens Hospital. From these collaborations and building upon the special strengths of the participating individuals, laboratories and institutions, {{it was hoped that}} original approaches would be found for the design of new, clinically useful, radiolabeled compounds. The original thrust of this proposal included: (a) examination of the coordination chemistry of technetium as a basis for rational radiopharmaceutical design, (b) development of an ultrashort-lived radionuclide generator for the diagnosis of congenital heart disease in newborns, (c) synthesis of receptor-site-directed halopharmaceuticals, (d) improved facile labeling of complex molecules with positron-emitting radionuclides. The authors` 1986 proposal was oriented toward organs and disease, emphasizing radiolabeled agents that delineate specific functions and the distribution of receptors in brain, heart, and tumors. In 1989, they further refined their purposes and focused on two major aims: (a) synthesis and utilization of neutral technetium and rhenium complexes of high specific activity, and (b) development of new approaches to the radiolabeling of proteins, peptides, immunoglobulins, and their fragments. In 1992, the authors amended this proposal to concentrate their efforts on biologically active peptides and proteins <b>for</b> targeted <b>radiodiagnosis</b> and therapy...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{quest for}} {{accurate}} diagnosis of lung pathology {{has been there}} all through the history of medicine. The pathologist {{is the person who}} makes the final diagnosis, but submission of the lesion to the pathologist involves procedures, both invasive and noninvasive like Open Lung Biopsy (OLB), Percutaneous Transthoracic Needle Biopsy (PTNB) and Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC). Percutaneous nonoperative procedures in the chest were performed even before the advent of imaging. Leyden performed the first transthoracic needle lung biopsy in 1882 to confirm pulmonary infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a hospital-based observational study of CT-guided interventional procedures in patients with thoracic lesions diagnosed by imaging methods like chest radiograph, CT or MRI scans. These patients were referred to the Department of <b>Radiodiagnosis</b> <b>for</b> CT-guided thoracic interventions from the Chest Medicine Department and other clinical departments of our hospital (The Oxford Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre). The duration of the study was for a period of 18 months from November 2015 to May 2017. RESULTS Yield of CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of thoracic lesions in this study was 28. 57...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{specificity}} of mammography and ultrasonography separately and in combination for detection of breast masses (ultrasonography-mammography correlation); To study the investigations to evaluate various breast masses; To describe suitable indications, advantages and limitations of each technique compared with other available modalities; To study the mimics of breast masses; To have histopathology follow-up and retrospective evaluation with imaging findings to improve diagnostic skills in series of 166 patients complaining of breast mass. Material : The pro spective clinical study {{was carried out in}} the department of <b>Radiodiagnosis</b> <b>for</b> a period of 2 year extending from De cember 2010 to December 2012 infemale patients complaining of breast mass. Well informed written consent was ob tained from them. Histopathology follow up was obtained from either biopsy or post operative tissue. USG machine: Philips HD 11 XE USG of the breasts and axillary region done in supine position in presence of female attendant; Mammography machine: Allengers machine with Agfa special mammography cassettes. Cranio caudal and Medio- Lateral Oblique views are taken in the presence of female attendant. MRI: PHILIPS 1. 5 T machine; CT: SIEMENS duel slice CT machine. Results: Ultrasonography and mammography was done in most of the cases were sufficient to diag nose the lesion in most of the cases especially in benign breast masses. MRI and CT scan was used in special cases to know the extent of the lesions, in mimics of breast masses, bony extensions, primary muscular and bony lesions. Total 166 patients complaining of breast mass in one or both breasts were examined and evaluated with USG and mammog raphy. The lesions were confirmed on histopathology (FNAC/biopsy). Out of 30 diagnosed malignancies two lesions were missed on mammography and four lesions were missed on ultrasonography. One of them was missed on both. For malignancies specificity of mammography is 93. 3 % and that of ultrasonography is 86. 67 %. Combining both the mo dalities specificity is near 97 %. Out of total 92 abnormal breasts 12 were missed on USG and 20 were missed on mammography. Combining both the modalities only 2 lesions were missed and were diagnosed on histopathology alone. Overall specificity for USG in breast masses is 86. 9 % and for mammography it is 78. 6 %. Combining both the modali ties the specificity is 97. 6 %. The “ p ” value is obtained which is highly significant for combination of ultrasonography and mammography in comparison with any individual modality (p = 0. 0059 & p = 0. 0001 respectively). Conclusion : Our study confirms the higher combined sensitivity rate for ultrasonography and mammography for detection of breast masses including malignancies. USG is useful in cystic lesions, ectasias, infections, pregnancy-lactation, and dense breast evaluation and for image guidance, whereas mammography is useful in detecting microcalcifications, spiculated masses for early detection of malignancies and for stereotactic biopsies. To suggest single modality, ultrasonography is better in younger population and BIRAD 1, 2 & 3 lesions. Whereas, mammography is better in older population and BIRAD 4 & 5 lesions. However, sono-mammographic correlation is best in both. </p...|$|R
