40|$|Four {{views on}} Dutch {{clusters}} This study captures four theoretical views on clusters and identifies several clusters by analysing detailed input-output tables, innovation surveys and data on business locations. Most clusters concern supply-demand clusters related to <b>intermediate</b> <b>supplies,</b> and regional concentrations of industries. Some supply-demand clusters are moderately concentrated in specific regions. Knowledge exchange through research partnerships hardly occur. However smaller companies, but also enterprises in chemicals and (electronic) machinery, often participate in information networks. Knowledge exchange with universities, research institutes and business {{seems to be}} less important. The prominent role of intermediate relations may induce potential market failures caused by exclusive but tying vertical relations. Knowledge exchange by regional There is a mass of theoretical and empirical analysis –and thus literature – on clusters because clustering is often seen {{as an opportunity to}} improve productivity growth and higher economic welfare (see e. g. Porter, 1988, and Roelandt et al. 1999 a). However, in literature there is no general agreement on the definition of a cluster, and most investigators investigate (a) cluster(s...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{string of}} "new {{economic}} geography" (NEG) models has set {{focus on the}} impacts of trade liberalisation on the intra-national distribution of economic activity. What the existing contributions {{have in common is}} a basic two-sector assumption (agriculture/manufacturing) and a resulting focus {{on the question of whether}} liberalisation leads to a greater concentration of aggregate manufacturing activity. Reconsidering these models from a multi-sectoral perspective, the aim is to allow for sectoral differences in the spatial adjustments to liberalisation. This introduces a conceptual nexus between comparative advantage (CA) -type sectoral recomposition effects of trade and NEG-type spatial adjustments. In the analysis of Mexican manufacturing location 1993 - 2003, incipient empirical evidence is found in favour of the hypothesis that sectors characterised by a revealed comparative advantage and/or cross-border <b>intermediate</b> <b>supplies</b> grow faster in regions with good foreign market access, whereas import competing ones gain in relative terms in regions with higher "natural protection" from poor market access. The relevancy of the proposed NEG/CA framework concerns both efficiency and equity objectives of trade adjustment policies, and opens a new perspective on the long-run effects of trade on spatial inequality.

40|$|In this thesis, I cover three {{relevant}} {{topics in}} macroeconomics: {{the effects of}} trade liberalization, the effect of institutions and the determinants of credibility on macroeconomic policies. The first essay revisits the empirical work {{on the effects of}} trade liberalization and analyzes how it affects growth through two distinct channels: through better access to <b>intermediate</b> <b>supplies</b> and through tougher foreign competition. In particular, both effects are significant: while the first boosts growth the second one hinders it. Moreover, the effect of the first channel outweighs the effect of the second one. The second essay is an empirical analysis showing that weaker institutions increase transaction costs, particularly the costs incurred by a firm when dealing with suppliers of intermediate goods. In particular, It is showed that industries with a more complex intermediate structure suffer a relatively larger loss of productivity in countries with poorer institutions. The third essay revisits the theoretical determinants of governments' credibility in regard to outstanding debt. Governments default not because they want to, but because they cannot avoid it. Under this and other assumptions, some standard results need no longer hold. For instance, appointing a conservative policymaker or denominating public debt in foreign currency may reduce credibility. by Roberto Alejandro Neut. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The relationship- specific investment which sustains cooperation also allows the host country firms to commit to a FDI pre- empting strategy through manipulation of the price of <b>intermediates</b> <b>supplied</b> to the foreign firm. It is found that depending on the presence of economies of scale in the upstream industry and the cost advantage of the multinational, the LCR can either induce cooperation and increase host country profits, or reduce the incentives to cooperate and induce FDI.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs spending cuts for defense intensify, the Marine Corps {{must try to}} maximize its readiness with a reduced budget. Replenishment supplies and parts stocked at the U. S. Marine Corps <b>intermediate</b> <b>supply</b> level are currently stocked according to historical usage data and Combat Essentaliity-Critically Codes (CECs). However, this system may not result in maximum readiness. Items with the same CEC may differ in {{the degree to which}} they contribute to combat readiness, and historical demand is not necessarily an indicator of item importance. This thesis presents a model which demonstrates a theory for allocating funds for supplies and parts at the intermediate level subject to a budget constraint, based upon weighted essentiality values for inventory items. Analysis of the model shows that, given a budget reduction, a proportionate allocation policy is the optimal policy to pursue after steady state consumption is reached. The model analysis will also provide a basis for further research into readiness-oriented stockage. [URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R
50|$|The term Lehman Wave {{refers to}} an economy-wide {{fluctuation}} in production and economic activity, with a wavelength of between 12 and 18 months, driven by a sudden major disruption of the economic system. The Lehman Wave is a damped, wave-like fluctuation around equilibrium. The amplitude of the Lehman Wave is larger for a business that is further away from its end market than for a business that is closer to its end market, which difference is caused by cumulative de-stocking of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>supply</b> chain. This term Lehman Wave has first been used by Dutch researchers in 2009 who gave that name to the economic wave that started in September 2008. They argue that the latter was caused by global de-stocking after the financial panic following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. The Lehman Wave can have strong effects on the sales volume and therefore on the profitability of companies that are located upstream in the supply chain.|$|R
40|$|Plant {{respiratory}} burst oxidase homologs (Rboh) are homologs of {{the human}} neutrophil pathogen-related gp 91 phox. Antisense technology was employed to ascertain the biological function of Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) Rboh. Lines with diminished Rboh activity showed a reduced level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the leaf, implying a role for Rboh in establishing the cellular redox milieu. Surprisingly, the antisense plants acquired a highly branched phenotype, switched from indeterminate to determinate growth habit, and had fasciated reproductive organs. Wound-induced systemic expression of proteinase inhibitor II was compromised in the antisense lines, indicating that ROS <b>intermediates</b> <b>supplied</b> by Rboh are required for this wound response. Extending these observations by transcriptome analysis revealed ectopic leaf expression of homeotic MADS box genes that are normally expressed only in reproductive organs. In addition, both Rboh-dependent and -independent wound-induced gene induction was detected as well as transcript changes related to redox maintenance. The results provide novel insights into how the steady state cellular level of ROS is controlled and portrays the role of Rboh as a signal transducer of stress and developmental responses...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Customer Wait Time (CWT) measures all supply chain processes, {{from the time}} a customer places an order until the item is delivered. The Marine Corps <b>intermediate</b> <b>supply</b> activity, the Supply Management Unit (SMU), has the primary task of {{reducing the amount of}} time it takes for the operating forces to receive supplies by stocking items close to the warfighter. Such forward positioning of repair parts shields the operating forces from delays found at the wholesale inventory level, thereby increasing the material readiness of the operating forces. Intuitively, decreasing CWT increases operational availability (Ao), but the degree and magnitude of this relationship has yet to be quantified. This lack of understanding pertaining to the relationship between Ao and CWT has led to arbitrary stock policies that do not account for the cost and benefit they provide. This project centers on monetizing the relationship between these variables through simulation modeling, and provides a tool whereby stock determination can be made based on desired end states.

50|$|Drivers {{for this}} type of {{electric}} load are power HF-generators that in many cases contain a transformer for high voltage generation. They resemble the control gear used to operate compact fluorescent lamps or cold cathode fluorescent lamps. The operation mode and the topologies of circuits to operate DBD lamps with continuous sine or square waves are similar to those standard drivers. In these cases, the energy that is stored in the DBD's capacitance {{does not have to be}} recovered to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>supply</b> after each ignition. Instead, it stays within the circuit (oscillates between the DBD's capacitance and at least one inductive component of the circuit) and only the real power, that is consumed by the lamp, has to be provided by the power supply. Differently, drivers for pulsed operation suffer from rather low power factor and in many cases must fully recover the DBD's energy. Since pulsed operation of DBD lamps can lead to increased lamp efficiency, international research led to suiting circuit concepts. Basic topologies are resonant flyback and resonant half bridge. A flexible circuit, that combines the two topologies is given in and and may be used to adaptively drive DBDs with varying capacitance.|$|R

The plastidic C 3 → C 2 metabolism and/or plastidic mevalonate pathway of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings changes from maximal activity at the leaf base (containing developing chloroplasts with incomplete thylakoid stacking but a considerable rate of photosynthetic CO 2 -fixation) almost to ineffectivity at the leaf tip (containing mature chloroplasts with maximal photosynthetic activity).
