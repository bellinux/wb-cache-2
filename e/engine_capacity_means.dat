5000|$|The GTO {{was based}} on the mid-engine, rear wheel drive 308 GTB (which has a 3.0 litre V8 engine). The [...] "288" [...] refers to the GTO's 2.8 litre V8 engine as it used a de-bored (by 1 mm) V8 with twin IHI turbochargers, intercoolers, and Weber-Marelli fuel injection. The 2855 cc <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> was {{dictated}} by the FIA's requirement for a Turbocharged <b>engine's</b> <b>capacity</b> to be multiplied by 1.4.
