Although complete bidirectional conduc-tion block is usually achieved, the recurrence of AF is due to recovered conducting isthmus tissue through which activation wavefronts pass. We evaluated a simple and efficient electrophysiological strategy, which pinpoints the ablation target. Methods and results Twenty-five patients (19 men), mean age 61 + 6, with recurrent AFl required a repeat ablation, 250 + 160 days after a successful RF CTI procedure. Transverse CTI conduction was monitored during AFl or coronary sinus (CS) pacing by a 24 -pole mapping catheter positioned in the right atrium (RA), with the distal poles in the CS, proximal poles on the lateral RA, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>poles</b> on the CTI.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the Earth’s {{rotational}} motion in terms of the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) of the new paradigm that is recommended by the IAU 2000 resolutions to transform between the celestial and terrestrial reference systems. This paper presents {{the first part of the}} study whose purpose is to establish the dynamical equations of the rotation of a rigid Earth as a function of these new parameters. Starting from Euler dynamical equations for a rigid Earth, and using expressions for the components of the instantaneous rotation vector as functions of the celestial coordinates X, Y of the Celestial <b>intermediate</b> <b>pole</b> (CIP) and of the Earth rotation angle (ERA), the equations of Earth rotation were obtained explicitly in terms of those parameters. Taking into account the order of magnitude of the terms of these equations, we obtain the most appropriate form of the equations for a practical integration. We then investigated the possible methods of integration for providing semi-analytical solutions for the X and Y variables in the axially symmetric case. We also perform a number of tests regarding the efficiency of these methods, based on the IAU 2000 precession-nutation. We extended this approach to a deformable Earth, based on integration constants compliant with the new P 03 precession model. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The IAU WG on {{precession}} and {{the ecliptic}} has recommended {{the adoption of}} the P 03 models of Capitaine et al. (2003). We discuss methods for generating the rotation matrices that transform celestial to terrestrial coordinates, taking into account frame bias (B), P 03 precession (P), P 03 -adjusted IAU 2000 A nutation (N) and Earth rotation. The NPB portion can refer either to the equinox or the celestial intermediate origin (CIO), requiring either the Greenwich sidereal time (GST) or the Earth rotation angle (ERA) as the measure of Earth rotation. The equinox based NPB transformation can be formed using various sequences of rotations, while the CIO based transformation can be formed using series for theX,Y coordinates of the celestial <b>intermediate</b> <b>pole</b> (CIP) and for the CIO locator s; also, either matrix can be computing using series for the x, y, z components of the “rotation vector”. Common to both methods is the CIP, which forms the bottom row of the transformation matrix. In the case of the CIO based transformation, the CIO is the top row of the NPB matrix, whereas in the equinox based case it enters via the GST formulation {{in the form of the}} equation of the origins (EO). The EO is the difference between ERA and GST and equivalently the distance between the CIO and equinox. The choice of method is dictated by considerations of internal consistency, flexibility and ease of use; the different ways agree at the level of a few microarcseconds over several centuries, and consume similar computing resources. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new precession-nutation {{model for}} the Celestial <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Pole</b> (CIP) {{was adopted by the}} IAU in 2000 (Resolution B 1. 6). The model, {{designated}} IAU 2000 A, includes a nutation series for a non-rigid Earth and corrections for the precession rates in longitude and obliquity. The model also specifies numerical values for the pole osets at J 2000. 0 between the mean equatorial frame and the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS). In this paper, we discuss precession models consistent with IAU 2000 A precession-nutation (i. e. MHB 2000, provided by Mathews et al. 2002) and we provide a range of expressions that implement them. The final precession model, designated P 03, is a possible replacement for the precession com-ponent of IAU 2000 A, oering improved dynamical consistency and a better basis for future improvement. As a preliminary step, we present our expressions for the currently used precession quantities A; A; zA, in agreement with the MHB corrections to the precession rates, that appear in the IERS Conventions 2000. We then discuss a more sophisticated method for improving the precession model of the equator in order that it be compliant with the IAU 2000 A model. In contrast to the first method, which is based on corrections to the t terms of the developments for the precession quantities in longitude and obliquity, this method also uses corrections to their higher degree terms. It is essential that this be used in conjunction with an improved {{model for the}} ecliptic precession, which is expected, given the known discrepancies in the IAU 1976 expressions, to contribute in a significant way to these higher degree terms. With this aim in view, we have developed new expressions for the motion of the ecliptic with respect to the fixed ecliptic using the developments from Simon et al. (1994) and Williams (1994) and wit...|$|E

Trees from stakes were <b>intermediate</b> between <b>poles</b> and cuttings in their growth and development. After 3  years, maximum lateral root extension was about 0.8, 1.7, and 2.6  m for trees grown from cuttings, stakes, and poles, respectively. This indicated that large differences in spacing {{would be required to}} achieve similar levels of contact between roots of neighbouring trees established from the different PMs over the same period of time. Survival of trees from cuttings was < 100  % whereas all trees from stakes and poles survived. The proportion of biomass allocated to roots decreased with age for trees from the three PMs. Among six different clones from cuttings, there was a 4.4 -fold variation in TRM and a 3.4 -fold variation in TRL. Hybrid poplar clones Kawa and Geyles produced the greatest amount of above- and below-ground biomass. This study indicates that there are poplar clones that root more readily and produce greater root mass in the first year than Veronese; they should be considered for greater commercial production than occurs presently.|$|R

40|$|Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is a space-geodetic {{technique}} that is uniquely capable of direct {{observation of the}} angle of the Earth's rotation about the Celestial <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Pole</b> (CIP) axis, namely UT 1. The daily estimates of the difference between UT 1 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) provided by the 1 -h long VLBI Intensive sessions are essential in providing timely UT 1 estimates for satellite navigation systems and orbit determination. In order to produce timely UT 1 estimates, efforts have been made to completely automate the analysis of VLBI Intensive sessions. This involves the automatic processing of X- and S-band group delays. These data contain an unknown number of integer ambiguities in the observed group delays. They are introduced as a side-effect of the bandwidth synthesis technique, which is used to combine correlator results from the narrow channels that span the individual bands. In an automated analysis with the c 5 ++ software the standard approach in resolving the ambiguities is to perform a simplified parameter estimation using a least-squares adjustment (L 2 -norm minimisation). We implement L 1 -norm as an alternative estimation method in c 5 ++. The implemented method is used to automatically estimate the ambiguities in VLBI Intensive sessions on the Kokee–Wettzell baseline. The results are compared to an analysis set-up where the ambiguity estimation is computed using the L 2 -norm. For both methods three different weighting strategies for the ambiguity estimation are assessed. The results show that the L 1 -norm is better at automatically resolving the ambiguities than the L 2 -norm. The use of the L 1 -norm leads to a significantly higher number of good quality UT 1 -UTC estimates with each of the three weighting strategies. The {{increase in the number of}} sessions is approximately 5 % for each weighting strategy. This is accompanied by smaller post-fit residuals in the final UT 1 -UTC estimation step...|$|E

This allows to in-vestigate in a unified way both conformal and chiral anomalies. The analysis is performed in parallel to the Standard Model, for comparison. We investigate, in particular, massive deformations of the N = 1 theory and the spectral densities of the anomaly form factors which are extracted from the components of this correlator.

The palaeomagnetic record provides the most direct evidence for the tempo of transitional field behaviour yet obtained for the M-B transition. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of tephra layers bracketing the M-B transition provides high-accuracy age constraints and indicates a mean sediment accumulation rate of about 0. 2 mm yr– 1 during the transition. Two relative palaeointensity (RPI) minima {{are present in the}} M-B transition.

Thus, the entry into the Brunhes Normal Chron as represented by the palaeomagnetic directions and VGPs developed in a time interval comparable to the duration of an average human life, which is an order of magnitude more rapid than suggested by current models. The reported investigation therefore provides high-resolution integrated palaeomagnetic and radioisotopic data that document the fine details of the anatomy and tempo of the M-B transition in Central Italy that in turn are crucial for a better understanding of Earth’s magnetic field, and for the development of more sophisticated models that are able to describe its global structure and behaviour...|$|R
