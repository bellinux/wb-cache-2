In {{order to avoid}} the large incoherent scattering from the <b>hydrogen,</b> <b>deuterated</b> samples of doped YPO 4 :Ce-Eu were used for diffraction measurements. The presence of water molecules in the triangular and hexagonal pores in the hexagonal structure was established by detailed simulation of the diffraction pattern and Rietveld refinement of the experimental data. It was observed that the presence of water leads specifically to suppression of the intensity of a peak around Q = 1. 04 Å- 1 while the intensity of peaks around Q= 1. 83 Å- 1 is enhanced in the neutron diffraction pattern. We estimate the number of water molecules as 2. 36 (6) per formula units at 300 K and the sizes of the hexagonal and triangular pores as 7. 2 (1) Å and 4. 5 (1) Å, respectively. With increase in temperature, the water content in both the pores decreases above 450 K and vanishes around 600 K.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{is potentially}} a useful technique {{for the analysis}} of thioethers and thiols because of the characteristic set of bands which appears in the C-S stretching region. A review of previous studies on Raman band intensity measurements is presented in which the experimental difficulties and influencing factors are given. An experimental system has been developed around a Coderg PHO Raman spectrometer for the measurement of absolute Raman band intensities. This includes the novel use of a Pockels cell for the accurate determination of depolarisation ratios. Carbon tetrachloride has been assessed as a suitable internal standard for use with this system. Raman band intensities are given for five thioethers and two thiols. Several bands are identified as being characteristic of sulphur-containing hydrocarbons. Analysis of bands in the C-S stretching region is accomplished by considering the intensity contributions provided by individual groups in the molecule, resulting in a successful prediction of the C-S stretching band intensities for t-butane thiol. In addition, temperature studies have been conducted for ethyl methyl sulphide in order to attempt calculation of the energy barrier between the two conformations. A computer programme has been developed for the theoretical calculation of Raman band frequencies and intensities. Molecular parameters have been derived for dimethyl sulphide, including an ab initio force field. Tests for transferabilityof these data to ethyl methyl <b>sulphide</b> and <b>deuterated</b> dimethyl <b>sulphide</b> have produced encouraging results. A study of infra-red intensities of thioethers has been carried out. This is an extension of some previous work in which the necessity to resolve individual bands is eliminated.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an alternative approach}} to modeling economic growth by constructing a biosphere-energy-technology (BET) model that incorporates energy, technology and entropy as distinct factors that generate transitional competitive equilibria. Technological progress under BET models assumptions is limited by recognized and available energy sources/carriers, named general purpose energy sources (GPESs), and that the recognition of such sources affect choices in technological development. This thesis represents a first attempt at incorporating the biosphere, which can experience catastrophic bifurcations, into a model of economic growth. The BET model, which puts strict conditions {{on the idea that}} no innovative society need accept Malthusian diminishing returns, predicts that energy and technology are both required for sustained growth given some temporal relationship between them. The main findings from the BET model are that pervasive technology shocks lead to large increases in consumption, but that technology alone will not sustain economic growth; and, that energy shocks cause permanent labour resource movements from the consumption sector to the energy knowledge sector. Energy shocks in the BET model result in an increase in consumption and utility; however, the effect of a particular energy source that gives rise to the energy shock depends on various parameters that embody institutional factors and policy. Using hydrogen as a GPES candidate that can give rise to an energy shock, the effects of <b>deuterated</b> molecular <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>deuterated</b> methane on the kinetic rate constants for selected stratospheric radical reactions, including the rate of ozone destruction, were examined computationally.

However, the kinetic isotope effect results for methane oxidation reactions imply that decreases in polar stratospheric clouds formation and decreased solid HCl are possible with a tethered hydrogen economy resulting in less ozone destruction. In sum, monodeuterated molecular hydrogen and methane may not contribute to appreciable stratospheric ozone loss and may even have a net positive effect...|$|R

However, to date, there is no effective synthetic method reported for deuterated tocotrienols.

Mainly the deuterium is introduced by use of labelled formaldehyde and <b>deuterated</b> <b>hydrogen</b> chloride under Lewis acid catalysis.

Upper flux limits were derived for sixteen other rotational and ro-vibrational HD lines in the wavelength range 2. 5 to 38 um.

Accounting for non-LTE HD level populations in a partially dissociated gas, our best estimate for the total warm HD column density is N(HD) =(2. 0 +- 0. 75) 10 ^ 16 cm^- 2. The warm molecular hydrogen column density is (2. 21 +- 0. 24) 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2, so that the relative abundance is [HD]/[H_ 2]=(9. 0 +- 3. 5) 10 ^- 6.

The four tunnel splittings of methyl librational ground states of the protonated complex required by the structure are determined at a temperature T= 4. 2 K up to pressures P= 4. 7 kbars by high resolution neutron spectroscopy. The tunnel mode at 20. 6 microeV at ambient pressure shifts smoothly to 12. 2 microeV at P= 3. 4 kbars. This is attributed to an increase {{of the strength of}} the rotational potential proportional to r(- 5. 6). The three other tunnel peaks show no or weak shifts only. The increasing interaction with diminishing intermolecular distances is assumed to be compensated by a charge transfer between the constituents of deltae/e approximately 0. 02 kbar(- 1).

Simultaneous observations of two rotational lines of methanol together with HDO in the same spectrum allow us to determine the average gas temperature within the telescope beam to be 69 +/- 10 K.

Available IR, UV and radio measurements lead to a water production rate of (2. 1 +/- 0. 5) x 10 (exp 29) /s {{at the time of}} our HDO observations. The resulting D/H ratio in cometary water is thus (29 +/- 10) x 10 (exp - 5) in good agreement with the values of (30. 8 (sub - 5. 3, sup + 3. 8) (Balsiger et al. 1995) and (31. 6 +/- 3. 4) x 10 (exp - 5) (Eberhardt et al. 1995) determined in comet P/Halley from in situ ion mass spectra.
