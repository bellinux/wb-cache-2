2500|$|In 1961, a Danish {{ophthalmologist}} named Mette Warburg reported about a Danish {{family that}} showed seven cases of a hereditary degenerative disease throughout seven generations. The first {{member of the}} family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child's examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except that his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating. The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass. [...] Five months later, his left eye was removed due to suspicion of retinoblastoma, a cancerous tumor on the retina. A histologic examination showed a hemorrhagic necrotic mass in the posterior chamber, surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) <b>glial</b> <b>tissue.</b> The diagnosis included a pseudotumor of the retina, hyperplasia of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment epithelium, hypoplasia and necrosis of the inner layer of the retina, cataract, and phthisis bulbi. This means his eye was removed because the physician suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that led to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells already began to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed deafness later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined to be low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were caused by this disease as well. She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, Gordon Norrie (1855–1941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accelerated proton beam {{irradiation}} {{has been}} used for several years to treat intraocular tumors. The pathophysiology of proton-beam-induced retinopathy and neuropathy has not been characterized to date. The present study investigates the early effects of irradiation with an accelerated proton beam on the optic nerve of the rabbit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The optic nerve head of Albino New Zealand rabbits (n = 14) was irradiated with a narrow beam of accelerated protons using the total dose of 60 and 43 Gy, respectively. This dose was split up into 4 equal sessions taking place on 4 consecutive days. Ophthalmoscopic examination was performed regularly, and the rabbits were sacrificed at 1, 3 and 8 months after irradiation. The eyes were enucleated and processed for light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Despite the absence of ophthalmoscopically detectable optic neuropathy in all 14 rabbits irrespective of the dose of irradiation, light and electron microscopy of the optic nerve showed a glial and fibrotic perivascular scar made up predominantly of altered astrocytes. This scar formation was seen as early as 1 month after irradiation and was at times accompanied by infiltration with inflammatory cells perivascularly both outside and within the optic nerve. In contrast to the astrocytes, oligodendrocytes did not show degenerative cellular alterations. During the 8 -month follow-up, no signs of vascular occlusion were found. CONCLUSIONS: The observed lesions in the <b>glial</b> <b>tissues</b> with consecutive fibrosis appear to stem from a direct effect of irradiation. This may represent the initial mechanism of early subclinical irradiation-induced damage to the optic nerve before vascular occlusions may occur at a later stage, which may lead to more severe damage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of scanning laser topography (SLT) and scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) {{on the rim of}} the optic nerve head and its surrounding area and thereby to evaluate whether these imaging technologies are influenced by other factors beyond the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Materials and Methodology: A total of 154 eyes from 5 different groups were examined: young healthy subjects (YNorm), old healthy subjects (ONorm), patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), patients with open-angle glaucoma and early glaucomatous damage (OAGE) and patients with open-angle glaucoma and advanced glaucomatous damage (OAGA). SLT and SLP measurements were taken. Four concentric circles were superimposed on each of the images: the first one measuring at the rim of the optic nerve head (1. 0 ONHD), the next measuring at 1. 25 optic nerve head diameters (ONHD), at 1. 5 ONHD and at 1. 75 ONHD. The aligned images were analyzed using GDx/NFA software. Results: Both methods showed peaks of RNFL thickness in the superior and inferior segments of the ONH. The maximum thickness, registered by the SLT device was at the ONH rim where the SLP device tended to measure the lowest values. SLT measurements at the ONH were influenced by other tissues besides the RNFL like blood vessels and <b>glial</b> <b>tissues.</b> SLT and SLP were most strongly correlated at distances of 1. 25 and 1. 5 ONHD. Conclusions: While both imaging technologies are valuable tools in detecting glaucoma, measurements at the ONH rim should be interpreted critically since both methods might provide misleading results.

50|$|In most patients, {{optic disc}} drusen are an {{incidental}} finding. It {{is important to}} differentiate them from other conditions that present with optic disc elevation, especially papilledema, which could imply raised intracranial pressure or tumors. True papilledema may present with exudates or cotton-wool spots, unlike ODD. The optic disc margins are characteristically irregular in ODD but not blurred {{as there is no}} swelling of the retinal nerve fibers. Spontaneous venous pulsations are present in about 80 percent of patients with ODD, but absent in cases of true disc edema. Other causes of disc elevation clinicians must exclude may be: hyaloid traction, epipapillary <b>glial</b> <b>tissue,</b> myelinated nerve fibres, scleral infiltration, vitreopapillary traction and high hyperopia. Disorders associated with disc elevation include: Alagille syndrome, Down syndrome, Kenny-Caffey syndrome, Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and linear nevus sebaceous syndrome.|$|E
50|$|A gelastic seizure is {{typically}} {{caused by a}} hypothalamic hamartoma, or a brain tumor. A hypothalamic hamartoma {{is defined as a}} benign mass of <b>glial</b> <b>tissue</b> on or near the hypothalamus. The size of the hamartoma can vary from one centimeter to larger than three centimeters. They can cause several different types of seizures including a Gelastic Seizure. These structures can be detected with different imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A computed tomography scan of an individual with a hypothalamic hamartoma would reveal an suprasellar mass with the same density as brain tissue. Images of these masses are not enhanced with the use of contrast. However, although a computed tomography scan may be useful in diagnosing the cause of a seizure, {{in the case of a}} hypothalamic hamartoma, magnetic resonance imaging is the tool of choice due to the cerebrospinal fluid which defines these masses. Photon emission computed tomography may also be used. This involves the use of a radiotracer which is taken up by the ictal region of the brain which {{is typically}} where the tumor lies. Gelastic seizures have been observed after taking a birth control pill (Maxim (R)).|$|E

40|$|The {{absence of}} fiber {{regrowth}} in the injured mammalian CNS {{is influenced by}} several different factors and mechanisms. Besides the nonconducive properties of the <b>glial</b> scar <b>tissue</b> that forms around the lesion site, individual molecules present in CNS myelin and expressed by oligodendrocytes, such as NI- 35 /NI- 250, bNI- 220, and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), have been isolated and shown to inhibit axonal growth. Here, we report an additional neurite growth-inhibitory activity purified from bovine spinal cord myelin that {{is not related to}} bNI- 220 or MAG. This activity can be ascribed to the presence of two chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), brevican and the brain-specific versican V 2 splice variant.

40|$|Reduction of <b>glial</b> scar <b>tissue</b> around {{central nervous}} system {{implants}} is necessary for improved efficacy in chronic applications. Design of materials that possess tunable properties inspired by native biological tissue and elucidation of pertinent cellular interactions with these materials was the motivation for this study. Since nanoscale carbon fibers possess the fundamental dimensional similarities to biological tissue and have attractive material properties needed for neural biomaterial implants, this present study explored cytocompatibility of these materials as well as modifications to traditionally used silicon. On silicon materials, results indicated that nanoscale surface features reduced astrocyte functions, and {{could be used to}} guide neurite extension from PC 12 cells. Similarly, it was determined that astrocyte functions (key cells in <b>glial</b> scar <b>tissue</b> formation) were reduced on smaller diameter carbon fibers (125 nm or less) while PC 12 neurite extension was enhanced on smaller diameter carbon fibers (100 nm or less). Further studies implicated laminin adsorption as a key mechanism in enhancing astrocyte adhesion to larger diameter fibers {{and at the same time}} encouraging neurite extension on smaller diameter fibers. Polycarbonate urethane (PCU) was then used as a matrix material for the smaller diameter carbon fibers (100 and 60 nm). These composites proved very versatile since electrical and mechanical properties as well as cell functions and directionality could be influenced by changing bulk and surface composition and features of these matrices. When these composites were modified to be smooth at the micronscale and only rough at the nanoscale, P 19 cells actually submerged philopodia, extensions, or whole cells bodies beneath the PCU in order to interact with the carbon nanofibers. These carbon nanofiber composites that have been formulated are a promising material to coat neural probes and thereby enhance functionality at the tissue interface. This improved chronic tissue interaction has the potential to reduce invasive intervention surgeries and provide sustained benefits from neural implants in patients with pathologies such as Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease. ...|$|R

Case presentation A 45 -year-old man complained of blurred vision, and ophthalmoscopy revealed a retinal detachment and retinoschisis extending from an optic disc pit through the macula in his left eye. He was diagnosed with optic disc pit maculopathy, and vitrectomy was performed. A posterior vitreous detachment was created, <b>glial</b> <b>tissue</b> at the optic pit was removed, and octafluoropropane (C 3 F 8) was injected as a gas tamponade. The retinal detachment and retinoschisis disappeared after six months, and vision improved to 20 / 20 without any visual field defects (Goldmann perimetry). A cataractous lens was extracted 2 years after the vitrectomy, and vision has remained 20 / 20 for 10 years without any recurrence.

50|$|The pons in the {{brainstem}} is {{a specific}} region that consists of myelinated axons much like the spinal cord.The thalamus and hypothalamus of the diencephalon also consist of neuron and <b>glial</b> cell <b>tissue</b> with the hypophysis (pituitary gland) and pineal gland (which is glandular tissue) attached at the bottom; tumors of the pituitary and pineal gland are often benign.The medulla oblongata is {{at the start of}} the spinal cord and is composed mainly of neuron tissue enveloped in Schwann cells and meninges tissue. The spinal cord is made up of bundles of these axons. Glial cells such as Schwann cells in the periphery or, within the cord itself, oligodendrocytes, wrap themselves around the axon, thus promoting faster transmission of electrical signals and also providing for general maintenance of the environment surrounding the cord, in part by shuttling different compounds around in response to injury or other stimulus.|$|R
