He was closely involved in several projects to strengthen the EMS, to improve economic policy convergence and the position of the ECU. The other main objective for Padoa-Schioppa was the strengthening of DG II's analytical capacity, especially its model-building capacity and its links with the academic world.

A total of 47 MEE samples were aspirated from 36 patients during insertion of a tympanostomy tube performed particularly for OME. The duration of effusion in all patients was ≥ 2 months. DNA was extracted from MEE samples, and PCR was initially done with DNA extracts by using the universal primers RW 01 and DG 74, which flank an ∼ 370 -bp fragment found in the 16 S rRNA gene of all bacterial species.

40|$|The observation, {{recording}} and appraisal of an individual’s vital signs, namely temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2), are key {{components in the}} assessment of their health and wellbeing. Measurements provide valuable diagnostic data, facilitating clinical diagnosis, management and monitoring. Respiratory rate sensing is perhaps the most under-utilised of all the vital signs, being routinely assessed by observation or estimated algorithmically from respiratory-induced beat-to-beat variation in heart rate. Moreover there is an unmet need for wearable devices that can measure all or most of the vital signs. This project therefore aims to a) develop a device that can measure respiratory rate and b) develop a wearable device that can measure all or most of the vital signs. An accelerometer-based clavicular respiratory motion sensor was developed and compared with a similar thoracic motion sensor and reference using exhalatory flow. Pilot study results established that the clavicle sensor accurately tracked the reference in monitoring respiratory rate and outperformed the thoracic device. An Ear-worn Patient Monitoring System (EPMS) was also developed, providing a discrete telemonitoring device capable of rapidly measuring tympanic temperature, heart rate, SpO 2 and activity level. The results of a comparative pilot study against reference instruments revealed that heart rate matched the reference for accuracy, while temperature under read (< 1 °C) and SpO 2 was inconsistent with poor correlation.

Such integrated systems provide {{the only way for}} an efficient orientation of the upcoming airborne digital line scanning sensors. Nevertheless, the use of GPS/inertial systems in combination with classical analogue aerial cameras is advantageous, too. To investigate the performance of direct orientation measurements in photogrammetric environments extensive flight tests were done at the Institute for Photogrammetry (ifp) in 1998 and 2000 using two commercially available integrated GPS/inertial systems (Applanix POS/AV 510 <b>DG,</b> IGI AEROcontrol <b>IId)</b> in combination with standard analogue aerial cameras (Z/I Imaging RMK-Top 15). To compare the quality of the two systems the tests were flown over the same test area under similar flight conditions. Within these tests, traditional aerial triangulation (AT) provides independent data for the orientation parameters. Comparing the indirectly determined orientation parameters from AT to the values from GPS/inertial data processing first estimations {{on the quality of the}} directly measured orientation parameters are possible.

Ozone {{produced by a}} dielectric barrier plasma discharge was isolated and measured quantitatively by using absorption spectroscopy. Significant kinetic enhance-ment by O 3 was observed by comparing flame stabilization locations with and without O 3 production. Experiments at atmospheric pressures showed an 8 % enhancement in the flame propagation speed for 1260 ppm of O 3 addition to the O 2 /N 2 oxidizer. Numerical simulations showed that the O 3 decomposition and reaction with H early in the pre-heat zone of the flame produced O and OH, respectively, from which the O reacted rapidly with C 3 H 8 and produced additional OH. The subsequent reaction of OH with the fuel and fuel fragments, such as CH 2 O, provided chemical heat release at lower temperatures to enhance the flame propagation speed. It was shown that the kinetic effect on flame propagation enhancement by O 3 reaching the pre-heat zone of the flame for early oxidation of fuel was much greater than that by the ther-mal effect from the energy contained within O 3. For non-premixed laminar lifted flames, the kinetic enhancement by O 3 also induced changes to the hydrodynamics {{at the flame front}} which provided addi-tional enhancement of the flame propagation speed.

Methods. Rheumatologists from 27 cities and towns of Russia (a total of 30 centers) participated in the cross-sectional epidemiological study. The study included all patients with valid rheumatoid arthritis, who had consecutively turned to a polyclinic rheumatologist or who had been treated at hospital for 3 months.

40|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{advancement in}} power electronics converters throughout {{the past few}} decades is leading to an increasing interest in the integration of Direct-Current (DC) systems to the existing AC ones on the generation, Low Voltage DC (LVDC), Medium Voltage DC (MVDC), and High Voltage DC (HVDC) levels. The utilization of DC systems offer many benefits over their AC counterparts such as the significant reduction in power losses and costs as well as the minimization of reactive current component. Nevertheless, DC systems still face many challenges among which protection is the most salient. This dissertation investigates and addresses the protection challenges posed by DC faults’ behaviour in five DC systems. On the generation level, it explores the nature of various faults and partial shading conditions in utility-scale Photovoltaic (PV) arrays. The unique PV modules’ voltage behaviour during faults and partial shading conditions is scrutinized to identify distinctive characteristics. These voltage features are utilized to propose a new time-domain voltage-based protection scheme. The proposed scheme’s underlying concepts are analytically proved for generic PV modules, validated using detailed time-domain model of PV panels, and verified experimentally using polycrystalline-silicon panels. On the LVDC level, the dissertation examines the behaviour of low- and high-resistance faults. The analysis are founded upon a detailed time-domain simulation of a meshed LVDC microgrid. The failure of conventional protection methods in the presence of even small amounts of fault resistance are demonstrated. An effective method is proposed to detect such faults by using the resonance frequency generated from passive oscillators installed on the line terminals. The protection of MVDC microgrids is a major challenge as very high fault current magnitudes are attained within a couple of milliseconds. This dissertation reveals unique fault-launched Travelling wave (TW) waveform and polarity properties. These properties are exploited to propose an adequate time-domain TW-based protection scheme that detects, classifies, and locates DC faults in a timely manner. The impediments to reliable protection of hybrid AC/DC microgrids are twofold: (i) the very low AC fault current magnitudes in the AC-side due to the current control capability of inverter-based Distributed Generation (<b>DG)</b> s, and (<b>ii)</b> the very high DC fault current magnitudes attained within few milliseconds in the DC-side due to the uncontrollable discharge of the converters’ DC link capacitors. A unified discriminant function TW-based protection scheme is proposed for hybrid AC/DC microgrids to detect, classify, and locate both AC and DC faults. DC faults in HVDC grids can cause severe damage to the converter stations and large loss of infeed within few milliseconds. Ensuring selectivity and sensitivity of the protection system within a short time window is a major challenge. This dissertation analyze the frequency spectra of the TWs initiated by faults on HVDC grids. Using the spectral content and polarity of the current TWs, a novel frequency-domain TW-based scheme is proposed to detect and locate faults within the required timeframe...|$|R
