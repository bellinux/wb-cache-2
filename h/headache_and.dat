5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E

5|$|In April 1957, his wife's health {{deteriorated}} {{and she was}} hospitalised. Although seriously ill, she recovered {{sufficiently to}} be moved home. On 4 May 1957, while preparing for his wife's homecoming, Kippenberger complained of a <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> then collapsed. Taken to hospital in a coma, he died the next day of a cerebral haemorrhage. He was buried on 7 May at Karori Cemetery in Wellington with full military honours. Ruth Kippenberger watched the funeral procession of her husband from her hospital window; she died ten years later.|$|E
5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as would any abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E
5|$|Meningitis is {{an acute}} {{inflammation}} of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The most common symptoms are fever, <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> neck stiffness. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may {{be accompanied by a}} characteristic rash.|$|E

40|$|Headache pain impacts {{most of the}} {{population}} {{at some point in}} life, at an enormous cost to day-to-day functioning. Determination of the variables that are associated with prevalence <b>and</b> severity of <b>headaches</b> has been inconsistent. One area that deserves more attention is the relationship between <b>headaches</b> <b>and</b> sleep. For instance, several sleep parameters may precipitate or exacerbate headaches, but previous research often used inconsistent and limited assessments of both <b>headaches</b> <b>and</b> sleep, making results difficult to interpret and compare. The current study seeks to extend previous research by using more comprehensive and empirically validated assessment techniques to study the relationship between sleep <b>and</b> <b>headaches</b> in a healthy sample. Greater self-reported sleep quality is related to lower <b>headache</b> frequency <b>and</b> severity, and lower self-reported sleep quality is characteristic of individuals having migraine-type headaches. Greater sleep efficiency is related to lower <b>headache</b> severity <b>and</b> shorter <b>headache</b> duration. Greater sleep onset latency is related to longer <b>headache</b> duration <b>and</b> greater <b>headache</b> severity. Greater number of nighttime awakenings is related to greater <b>headache</b> severity <b>and</b> is characteristic of individuals having a diagnosable headache disorder (either tension-type or migraine-type). Stress appeared to be a partial mediator between self-reported sleep quality <b>and</b> <b>headache</b> severity. Further experimental studies may clarify causality between sleep <b>and</b> <b>headache...</b>|$|R

Nickell died shortly thereafter at Harborview Medical Center, where treatment had failed to revive him.

5|$|Streptococcal pharyngitis, {{also known}} as strep throat, is an {{infection}} {{of the back of}} the throat including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red tonsils, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. A <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever. Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.|$|E

5|$|The CSF {{sample is}} also {{examined}} for xanthochromia—the yellow appearance of centrifugated fluid.

Xanthochromia remains a reliable ways to detect SAH several days after the onset of headache. An interval of at least 12hours between {{the onset of the}} <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> lumbar puncture is required, as it takes several hours for the hemoglobin from the red blood cells to be metabolized into bilirubin.|$|E
5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least , muscle pain, malaise, <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> prostration. As the digestive tract is commonly involved, nausea and vomiting and backache often occur. The prodrome, or preeruptive stage, usually lasts 2–4 days. By days 12–15 the first visible lesions—small reddish spots called enanthem—appear on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, and throat, and temperature falls to near normal. These lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture, releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva.|$|E

In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, <b>headache,</b> <b>and</b> muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E
5|$|While bubbles {{can form}} {{anywhere}} in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain ("the bends") accounts for about 60% to 70% of all altitude DCS cases, with the shoulder being the most common site. Neurological symptoms are present in 10% to 15% of DCS cases with <b>headache</b> <b>and</b> visual disturbances being the most common symptom. Skin manifestations are present in about 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS ("the chokes") is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre-breathing protocols. The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types.|$|E
