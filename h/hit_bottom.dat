25|$|Senior {{officers}} in the Russian Navy offered a variety of explanations for the accident. Four days after Kursk sank, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief and Fleet Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov stated the accident had been caused by a serious collision. Klebanov said the submarine may have hit an old World War II mine. He also said {{that almost all of}} the sailors had died before the vessel <b>hit</b> <b>bottom.</b>|$|E
25|$|World War II nearly {{proved to}} be the end of Lebanon Valley College. In the Fall of 1942, LVC's first wartime {{registration}} showed only 357 students enrolled. As the second semester began in 1943, there were only 282 students: 145 women and 137 men, the first time that women outnumbered men. 1943 Fall enrollment dropped again to only 199 students, 62 of which were on limited deferment, waiting to be called to active duty. This prompted one of the first capital campaigns to help the ailing college. The campaign to raise $550,000 received 91% support from current students. The money was to go toward an endowment and a real gymnasium, which bore the name of the president who initiated the campaign—Lynch Memorial. Right before the war ended, LVC enrollment <b>hit</b> <b>bottom</b> at 192 students. In 1946, however, enrollment ballooned to 683 students, more than 300 of which were ex-servicemen.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy had}} <b>hit</b> <b>bottom</b> in March 1933 {{and then started}} to expand. Economic {{indicators}} show the economy reached nadir {{in the first days}} of March, then began a steady, sharp upward recovery. Thus the Federal Reserve Index of Industrial Production sank to its lowest point of 52.8 in July 1932 (with 1935–39 = 100) and was practically unchanged at 54.3 in March 1933; however by July 1933, it reached 85.5, a dramatic rebound of 57% in four months. Recovery was steady and strong until 1937. Except for employment, the economy by 1937 surpassed the levels of the late 1920s. The Recession of 1937 was a temporary downturn. Private sector employment, especially in manufacturing, recovered {{to the level of the}} 1920s but failed to advance further until the war. The U.S. population was 124,840,471 in 1932 and 128,824,829 in 1937, an increase of 3,984,468. The ratio of these numbers, times the number of jobs in 1932, means there was a need for 938,000 more 1937 jobs to maintain the same employment level.|$|E

25|$|After 1984, the {{franchise}} {{would only have}} one more winning season in Minnesota, in 1985-86. Seemingly, {{the franchise}} <b>hit</b> <b>bottom</b> in 1987-88, when it won only 19 games, still the second-fewest wins in franchise history. However, the Norris Division was so weak that year (only the Red Wings finished with a winning record) that the North Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs were fighting it out for the last playoff spot from the division {{on the last day}} of the season despite having the two worst records in the league. In those days, the four top teams in each division made the playoffs, regardless of record. A loss to the Calgary Flames not only kept the North Stars out of the playoffs, but assured them of the worst record in the league. While the late 1980s saw the franchise draft what would turn out to be their greatest player – forward Mike Modano – chronic attendance problems spurred the owners to threaten to move the club to the San Francisco Bay Area, against the league's wishes.|$|E

She admitted that the performances have become [...] "painfully stilted" [...] and called the script [...] "a jumble of nothing punctuated by barely-trying death traps". She went on to say, [...] "It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just to up the body count" [...] and closed her review with, [...] "No matter how much money The Final Chapter makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over".|$|E

2500|$|The {{baseball}} program, partly {{hampered by}} being the northernmost school in the heavily warm-weather SEC, has historically achieved only modest success at best.

2500|$|Although the Qing dynasty {{established}} by the Manchus had quickly seized Beijing in 1644, hostile regimes still existed {{in other parts of}} China, and it would take the Qing a few decades to take control of all of China. During this period, especially in the 1640s and 1650s, people died of starvation and disease, which resulted in a decline in population. In 1661, facing attacks by overseas Ming loyalist forces, the Qing government adopted a policy of clearing the shore line, which ordered all people residing along the coast of Zhejiang to the border with Vietnam to move [...] inland and guards were positioned on the coast to prevent anyone from living there. Thus, until 1685 few people engaged in coastal and foreign trade. During these decades, although grain harvests improved, few participated in the market because the economy had contracted and local prices <b>hit</b> <b>bottom.</b> Tang Chen, a retired Chinese scholar and failed merchant described a dismal picture of the market economy of the preceding decades in his writing in the early 1690s.|$|E
