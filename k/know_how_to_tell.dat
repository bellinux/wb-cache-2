500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Olivia called the single an [...] "empowering women's song" [...] for inspiring women to leave unfulfilling relationships. She said she wrote it: [...] "for {{all the people who}} don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the other person to 'bounce' [...] ". An article in Vibe magazine noted lyrics, like: [...] "I can't take this shit no more / Picture frame broken daddy 'cause I can't trust you / I'm ridin' high now / So nigga fuck you", as creating an impression of Olivia as a [...] "potty-mouth". NMEs John Mulvey commented that Olivia's [...] "ruthlessness rather than her vocabulary" [...] was the standout, especially in the lyric: [...] "Shoulda known what you missed at home / Now you're all alone with no-one to bone". Mulvey joked that the amount of censorship on the radio edit made Olivia sound [...] "avant-garde".|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} her {{daughter}} Leopoldina of typhoid fever on 7 February 1871 devastated the small Imperial Family. PedroII decided {{on a trip to}} Europe that same year to [...] "cheer up" [...] his wife among other reasons (as stated in his own words) and to pay a visit to Leopoldina's four small boys, who had lived in Coburg with their parents since the late 1860s. The Imperial couple would travel abroad again during 1876 and 1887. Teresa Cristina preferred her ordinary life in Brazil, [...] "dedicating herself to her family, religious devotions, and charitable works." [...] In fact, visiting her native land only served to resurrect painful memories. Her family had been dethroned in 1861 and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had been annexed to what would later become the unified Kingdom of Italy. Everyone she had known from her youth was gone. As she wrote in 1872: [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what was the impression I had upon seeing again, after 28 years, my fatherland and not to find anyone for whom I cared." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} interview, {{he was asked}} if his perfect idea of {{encounter}} was the same as described in the track, one in which your partner is screaming to you, [...] "Give it to me, baby, give it to me, motherfucker" [...] and having attracted the attention of the cops due to the violent noises you are making with your partner outside while [...] "trying to get in". To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex". When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses [...] "Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] due to his 2010 drug bust, he replied [...] "To take that line out would dilute my art", since the recording [...] "needs a sense of danger. When I was a kid, pop could be dangerous but still massive. Michael Jackson would grab his crotch. Prince would rock assless chaps".|$|E
5000|$|Alain Locke {{writes in}} a review: [...] "when will the Negro novelist of maturity, who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story convincingly—which is Miss Hurston's cradle gift, {{come to grips}} with motive fiction and social {{document}} fiction?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “He {{had come}} there, {{where he was}} not known, in a native prau, and had managed, with his sedate manner and the exactly right kind of yarn he <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>to</b> the natives, to ingratiate himself with the chief man.|$|R
60|$|May came at last, {{and with}} it a burst of {{sunshine}} which cheered even poor Polly's much-enduring heart. Fanny came walking in upon her one day, looking as if she brought tidings of such great joy that she hardly <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them.|$|R
2500|$|Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) {{said she}} was [...] "disgusted" [...] by the {{comments}} [...] "and deeply disappointed in Representative Harris personally,” adding [...] "clearly shows {{that she does not}} deserve to be a representative." [...] Two of Harris’ primary opponents denounced her statements, Republican Will McBride (an attorney and son of a pastor) stated “I’m a Christian, and I’m a Republican, and I don’t share her views. There are people of other faiths and backgrounds of outstanding integrity who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth.” Real estate developer Peter Monroe, another GOP primary opponent, called on her to quit the race and resign from Congress. He called her suggestion that non-Christian voters are ignorant of morality when voting as “contemptible, arrogant and wicked.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Debruge of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "From a creative standpoint, {{this is the}} studio's least exciting feature yet - hardly its worst, execution-wise, but entirely lacking in the risk-taking spirit that has spawned such successful franchises as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and Dragon." [...] Sara Stewart of the New York Post gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "It's refreshing to see a nonwhite lead, and the husky-voiced pop singer is likable as a brave-hearted kid searching for her mother. But man, is {{there a lot of}} Rihanna in this movie: She also provides what seems like the entirety of the film's soundtrack, making it feel like a vanity project (is 'vanimation' a thing?)." [...] Barbara VanDenburgh of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "For all its energy, razzle-dazzle and whiz-bang technology, it doesn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a simple story or cobble together three-dimensional characters, and that's a problem not even the best of 3-D glasses can fix." [...] Susan Wloszczyna of RogerEbert.com gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "I kept thinking about Lilo & Stitch while watching Home, a decidedly disappointing effort based on the popular kid-lit book The True Meaning of Smekday from the already embattled folks at DreamWorks Animation." ...|$|E
60|$|Columbine gazed wide-eyed and {{helpless}} {{at the young}} man. She did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him what {{all the difference in}} the world really was.|$|E
60|$|Macky. He hath {{abundance}} of wit, and understands {{most of the}} modern languages well; <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story <b>to</b> the best advantage; but has an affected manner of conversation; is thin, splenetic, and tawny complexioned, turned of 60 years old.--Swift. He had been a Papist.|$|R
50|$|When the {{management}} {{attempts to make}} a managerial diagnosis, {{it is important that}} the people whose work is being diagnosed be properly prepared to enter thediscussion. For this purpose, it is very helpful if everyone <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the QC story. Telling the story properly requires seven steps.|$|R
50|$|Mitch tells Cam {{that they}} can't accept Claire's offer {{because it will}} be weird to have his sister's kid.

6000|$|... "Because,--I hardly <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his story. There {{have been}} things about Oswald {{which made it}} almost {{necessary}} that Mr. Finn should explain himself to me." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it right, but I saw {{her soul}} {{brighten}} and leap up, and get free and fly {{away in the}} grateful look.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poff, {{my little}} son," [...] she said, [...] "I'm so sorry I hardly <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you. Poff, I'm sorry. I {{have to tell}} you--and it's utterly beastly." ...|$|E
50|$|As a professional, {{she brings}} to the table an ability to see the big picture, connect the dots, and drill down to the details. She can distill the essence from a vast pool of data, extract the facts from the hype. She also <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story with both style and substance.|$|R
6000|$|Alas! {{when the}} gates were reached, James hardly <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{him that the}} Queen had gone that morning to Paris with her mother.

60|$|Looking down he saw {{flapping}} strongly, wheeling {{between the}} gaunt quaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben J's son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and eightpence too much. Hhhhm. It's the droll way {{he comes out}} with the things. <b>Knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story too.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Shelby {{was very}} unhappy {{because of what}} he had done. He knew his wife would be very unhappy too, and he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|Now that {{opportunity}} {{was given to}} him, the Vicar did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his message. [...] "Perhaps {{it would have been}} better that Janet should have come to you." ...|$|E

50|$|After the War, {{he managed}} to escape being blacklisted as a {{forbidden}} author by the Communist government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The regime chose to consider his works as those of a realistic, critical author, а precursor of Socialist Realism who, although not having correctly seized {{the true nature of}} the Bourgeois state, <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> about the working life and individual revolt of exploited peasants.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Mark Deming {{wrote of the}} album [...] "While in many respects Alvin is still best {{described}} as a songwriter who sings, he <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story, and he's picked some great ones for this album." [...] Dan MacIntosh of PopMatters wrote [...] "Downsides are difficult to find with this new work, because Alvin performs each and every track with an obvious appreciation for the artists who wrote them." ...|$|R
60|$|Billina had a {{right to}} feel important; for she alone shared the Nome King's secret and <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the objects that were transformations from those that had never been alive. She was very sure that her guesses would be correct, but before she began to make them she was curious to behold all the magnificence of this {{underground}} palace, which was {{perhaps one of the most}} splendid and beautiful places in any fairyland.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, {{it is so}} terrible! I {{have only}} just seen it in the newspaper, and have thought it best to run over and let you know." ...|$|E

6000|$|Margaret hardly <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her {{thoughts}} and feelings, {{and yet she}} wished <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them. She had resolved that she would <b>tell</b> the whole <b>to</b> Mrs Mackenzie, having convinced herself {{that she could not}} carry out her plan of leaving Cavendish Square without some explanation of the kind. She did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make her speech with propriety, so she jumped at the difficulty boldly. [...] "The truth is, Mrs Mackenzie, that he has no more idea of marrying me than he has of marrying you." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{these things}} {{happened}} {{several years ago}} {{at a place called}} Novastoshnah, or North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and away in the Bering Sea. Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the tale when he was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I took him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him {{for a couple of days}} till he was fit to fly back to St. Paul's again. Limmershin is a very quaint little bird, but he <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know.</b> <b>How's</b> one <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> But I {{say that}} the thing is done now and there's an end of it," [...] said the {{masculine}} creature as bluntly as his innate solemnity permitted.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you," [...] she began. [...] "It {{all seems}} so dreadful." [...] She paused, {{but he had}} the lawyer's gift of silence--of {{sympathetic}} silence. [...] "I want to get a divorce from my husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid it}} won't. If I {{ask him to}} stay, he'll think I'm jealous, and I wouldn't insult him by such an idea. He doesn't see that I want him, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him without words." ...|$|E

40|$|Kevin Brophy {{shows us}} his skills as an {{entertainer}} in "Explorations in Creative Writing". He has read widely {{and has a}} diverse collection of tales <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> from the mundane to the fantastic. The story, anecdote and fragment {{are all part of}} his performance. We shift between a reading of Kafka’s ‘Metamorphosis’, to the ‘agenda of the couch’ and even to writers’ accounts of visits to analysts (Lacan’s consulting rooms — shabby!). Like the best entertainers, Brophy <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a good story. His writing has an admirable lightness of touch, alternately reflective and playful, and conveys a sense of the vitality of its subject matter...|$|R
5000|$|Toth {{was known}} for his {{exhaustive}} study of other artists and his outspoken analysis of comics art past and present. For example, in a 2001 interview he criticized the trend of fully painted comics, saying [...] "It could be comics if those who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> paint also <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story! Who knew what pacing was, and didn't just jam a lot of pretty pictures together into a page, pages, and call it a story, continuity! It ain't!" [...] Toth lamented what he saw as a lack of awareness on the part of younger artists of their predecessors, as well as a feeling that the innocent fun of comics' past was being lost in the pursuit of pointless nihilism and mature content.|$|R
5000|$|The memoir was {{received}} warmly by the press. Publishers Weekly described the book [...] " [...] a more candid, engaging and warmly knowledgeable {{survey of the}} past 40 years of American publishing cannot be imagined." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "The recollection of his adventures in the book trade is a joy to read not only because Korda <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a good story but also because he never forgets {{that it is not}} in the nature of book publishers 'to harbor negative thoughts,' because 'the lifeblood of publishing is enthusiasm, after all, not caution.' Kirkus Reviews called it, [...] "more entertaining than lunch with a power editor at the Four Seasons Grill--full of delicious gossip plus a lesson or two in book publishing.|$|R
