40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} liquidity risk {{on the performance of}} equity hedge <b>fund</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Similarly to Avramov, Kosowski, Naik, and Teo (2007), (2011), we observe that, before accounting for the effect of liquidity risk, hedge <b>fund</b> <b>portfolios</b> that incorporate predictability in managerial skills generate superior performance. This outperformance disappears or weakens substantially for most emerging markets, event-driven, and long/short hedge <b>fund</b> <b>portfolios</b> once we account for liquidity risk. Moreover, we show that the equity market-neutral and long/short hedge fund portfolios' "alphas” also entail rents for their service as liquidity providers.

2500|$|One fraud {{uncovered}} by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November 2009 [...] may be directly credited to Sarbanes-Oxley. The fraud, which spanned nearly 20 years and involved over $24 million, was committed by Value Line (...) against its mutual fund shareholders. The fraud was first {{reported to the}} SEC in 2004 by the then Value Line <b>Fund</b> (...) <b>portfolio</b> manager and Chief Quantitative Strategist, Mr. John (Jack) R. Dempsey of Easton, Connecticut, who was required to sign a Code of Business Ethics as part of SOX. Restitution totaling $34 million {{was placed in a}} fair fund and returned to the affected Value Line mutual fund investors. [...] The Commission ordered Value Line to pay a total of $43,705,765 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalty, and ordered Buttner, CEO and Henigson, COO to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and $250,000, respectively. The Commission further imposed officer and director bars and broker-dealer, investment adviser, and investment company associational bars (“Associational Bars”) against Buttner and Henigson.

40|$|We use an {{expected}} utility framework {{to integrate the}} liquidation risk of hedge <b>funds</b> into <b>portfolio</b> allocation problems. The introduction of realistic investment constraints complicates {{the determination of the}} optimal solution, which is solved using a genetic algorithm that mimics the mechanism of natural evolution. We analyse the impact of the liquidation risk, of the investment constraints and of the agent's degree of risk aversion on the optimal allocation and on the optimal certainty equivalent of hedge <b>fund</b> <b>portfolios.</b> We observe, in particular, that the portfolio weights and their performance are significantly affected by liquidation risk. Finally, tight portfolio constraints can only provide limited protection against liquidation risk. This approach is of special interest to fund of hedge fund managers who wish to include the hedge fund liquidation risk in their portfolio optimization scheme.
