"A large {{circular}} {{piece of}} clear Plexiglass was rigged {{to the camera}} dolly {{directly in front of}} the camera lens with a bullet fixed to the middle of the circular sheet of Plexi. A small electric motor was used on the outer edge, out of frame to rotate the Plexi and of course the bullet. And by then simply <b>dollying</b> the camera with the entire rig down the room gave us the shot of what looked like the camera flying along directly behind the bullet travelling through the air toward the target....By carefully 'lighting out' the reflections on the Plexi, the shot was accomplished.|$|E
50|$|Cinematography can {{not only}} depict a moving subject but can use a camera, which {{represents}} the audience's viewpoint or perspective, that moves {{during the course of}} filming. This movement plays a considerable role in the emotional language of film images and the audience's emotional reaction to the action. Techniques range from the most basic movements of panning (horizontal shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like turning your head side-to-side) and tilting (vertical shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like tipping your head back to look at the sky or down to look at the ground) to <b>dollying</b> (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it closer or farther from the subject), tracking (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it to the left or right), craning (moving the camera in a vertical position; being able to lift it off the ground as well as swing it side-to-side from a fixed base position), and combinations of the above. Early cinematographers often faced problems that were not common to other graphic artists because of the element of motion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{scene in}} Beauty and the Beast {{during which the}} song is heard is the moment when Belle and the Beasts true {{feelings}} for each other are finally established. Set in the ballroom of the Beasts castle, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is performed by the character Mrs. Potts, an enchanted teapot, midway through the film as she explains the feeling of love to her young teacup son Chip, referring to the emotion as [...] "a tale as old as time". According to Armen Karaoghlanian of Interiors, [...] "Belle familiarizes the Beast with the waltz and as soon he feels comfortable, he gracefully moves her across the floor". Afterwards, the song continues to play instrumentally as Belle and the Beast retire to the balcony for a romantic candlelit dinner. Believed to be the [...] "centerpiece that brings Beauty and her Beast together," [...] the sequence offers an insight into both characters psyches. From the Beasts perspective, it is the moment he realizes {{that he wants to}} confess his true feelings for Belle to her and [...] "decides he wants to tell Belle he is in love with her." [...] Meanwhile, Belle begins {{to fall in love with}} her captor. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Jennie Punter reviewed it as the scene in which [...] "romance finally blossoms." [...] Film critic Ellison Estefan, writing for Estefan Films, believes that the sequence is responsible for [...] "adding another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other." [...] Explaining the songs role in the film, director Kirk Wise described the scene as [...] "the culmination of their relationship," [...] while producer Don Hahn pegged it as [...] "the bonding moment of the film when the two main characters finally get together." [...] The scene had long been envisioned as having a more live-action feel to it than the rest of the film, an idea that originated from story artists Brenda Chapman and Roger Allers, who were the first to suggest that the ballroom be built using computers. As the films executive producer, former Head of Disneys film division Jeffrey Katzenberg recalled that he began working on Beauty and the Beast deciding what its [...] "wowie" [...] moment would be, defining this as [...] "the moment in the movie where you see whats on the screen and go, Wow-IEE"; this ultimately became the films ballroom sequence. According to Hahn, the scene was conceived out of the filmmakers desire to manipulate the camera in order to [...] "sweep" [...] the audience away. Allers and Chapman conceived the ballroom in order to provide the characters with an area in which they could linger, and were surprised by the amount of artistic freedom with which they were provided by the animators, who agreed to adjust to the changes in perspective that would result from the moving camera. While Allers decided to raise the camera in order to view the dancing couple from the overhead chandelier, Chapman decided to rotate the camera around Belles skirt as the couple danced past it. In their dance together, Belle and the Beast move toward the camera, as we pan up and into the 3D chandelier. In the next shot, the camera slowly drops from the ceiling as we once again move alongside the 3D chandelier. This adds depth to the scene, as the chandelier is placed at the forefront of the image and Belle and the Beast are in the distance. This shot continues as we move down below and gracefully move around them. The Beast then sways Belle around and near the camera, once again providing us with an illusion that a camera is following these characters around in an actual ballroom. In a wide shot of Belle and the Beast dancing, the camera begins <b>dollying</b> back as Mrs. Potts and Chip appear in the frame. These beautiful compositions and camera movements show us how space functions within an animated feature film. Armen Karaoghlanian of Interiors ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dollies</b> fleet {{management}} {{is an issue}} specific to the airport ground support equipment industry. <b>Dollies</b> are not inexpensive consumable equipment like a hand trolley. <b>Dollies</b> are numerous (thousands) in a large airport apron. An airport usually {{has more than one}} <b>dolly</b> fleet operator, using <b>dollies</b> not greatly different in appearance, and each operator is using many types of <b>dollies</b> simultaneously. Apron is a large area that using direct eyesight to find an item is not easy. <b>Dolly</b> in operation needs frequent detachment and re-attachment from the tug and other <b>dollies.</b> It is not access controlled (it does not need a car key be used, like an automobile). It is not always supervised by the same driver (any tractor can come to pick up any <b>dolly</b> and tug them away, sometimes erroneously). As a result of all above factors, <b>dollies</b> do get lost/misplaced on an apron, or at least <b>dollies</b> {{fleet management}} is an ongoing burden for ground support equipment operator. Major airports are starting to attach battery power active RFID tags to <b>Dollies</b> to facilitate their fleet management. The active RFID tags can be detected at up to 100m away in open space from the fixed RFID reader antenna, which can be mounted at the aircraft loading bridges. The RFID tag report the <b>dolly's</b> facility number as well as the [...] "battery weak" [...] and [...] "strong collision" [...] status, making management of the RFID tags (and thus the associated <b>dolly)</b> easier.|$|R
