5000|$|The {{selection}} of test backing {{is significant because}} in flexible armor, the body tissue of a wearer plays an integral part in absorbing the high energy impact of ballistic and stab events. However the human torso has a very complex mechanical behavior. Away from the rib cage and spine, the soft tissue behavior is soft and compliant.

5000|$|Human {{behavior}} is experienced throughout an individual’s entire lifetime. It includes {{the way they}} act based on different factors such as genetics, social norms, core faith, and attitude. Behavior is impacted by certain traits each individual has. The traits vary {{from person to person}} and can produce different actions or behavior from each person. Social norms also <b>impact</b> <b>behavior.</b> Due to the inherently conformist nature of human society in general, humans are pressured into following certain rules and displaying certain behaviors in society, which conditions the way people behave. Different behaviors are deemed to be either acceptable or unacceptable in different societies and cultures. Core faith can be perceived through the religion and philosophy of that individual. It shapes the way a person thinks and this in turn results in different human behaviors. Attitude can be defined as [...] "the degree to which the person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation of the behavior in question." [...] One's attitude is essentially a reflection of the behavior he or she will portray in specific situations. Thus, human {{behavior is}} greatly influenced by the attitudes we use on a daily basis.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{social roles}} (e.g. employee) have been {{identified}} as a potential sources of personality change. Researchers have found strong correspondences between the demands of a social role and one's personality profile. If the role requires that the person enacting it be conscientious, her standing on this trait {{is more likely to be}} high. Conversely, once he leaves that role and or takes on another which entails less conscientiousness, he will manifest a lower level standing on that trait. Longitudinal research demonstrates that people's personality trajectories can often be explained by the social roles they espoused and relinquished throughout their life stages. Thus social roles are often studied as fundamental predictors of personality. The goals associated with them elicit the appropriation of certain personality profiles by the people enacting them. For example, employees judged effective by their peers and superiors are often described as conscientious as well. [...] Personality also changes through life stages. This may be due to physiological changes associated with development but also experiences that <b>impact</b> <b>behavior.</b> Adolescence and young adulthood have been found to be prime periods of personality changes, especially in the domains of extraversion and agreeableness. It has long been believed that personality development is shaped by life experiences that intensify the propensities that led individuals to those experiences in the first place, which is known as the corresponsive principle.|$|E

The extirpation of the motor or the sensory zone would expose us to the risk of grave functional disturbances and to technical difficulties. It would be more advantageous to practice the excision of a strip of cortex behind and on both sides of the motor zone creating thus a kind of ditch in the temporal lobe.|$|E
40|$|Investigation of the {{behavior}} of an automobile seat subjected to an impact load is important to improve safety. The following three subjects on the design of the seat frame are described. First, {{in order to understand the}} fundamental <b>impact</b> <b>behavior</b> of a seat frame, the characteristics of <b>impact</b> <b>behavior</b> were studied through experiments carried out under various impact conditions. Second, using an explicit finite element method, a structural analysis method for the simulation of <b>impact</b> <b>behavior</b> was investigated. This analysis method was shown to be useful by comparing its results with the experimental results. Finally, the influence of design parameters of the seat frame on <b>impact</b> <b>behavior</b> was investigated. There has been a growing demand that the structure of the seat should be designed rationally by evaluating correctly the influence of design parameters upon such characteristics as strengh and flexibility. The authors proposed a statistical optimization method that consists of two steps : effectivity analysis and mathematical programming. In this paper, the effectivity analysis was applied to the seat frame, and the applicability of the effectivity analysis was confirmed by comparing with the experimental results. 本論文では，自動車用シートのフレームが車両衝突時に示す挙動のシミュレーション法を検討すると共に，提案している影響度の解析手法を適用する事により，フレーム構成部材の衝突挙動に対する影響度を明らかにした...|$|E

The <b>impact</b> <b>behavior</b> of the agglomerates at different moisture contents and impact energies are analyzed through post-impact parameters and coupled to their microscopic and macroscopic properties. While increasing the impact energy breaks more inter-particle bonds and intensifies damage and fragmentation, increasing the moisture content is found to provide the agglomerates with higher deformability and resistance against breakage. It is shown that the interplay of the two latter parameters together with the agglomerate structural strength creates various impact scenarios, which are classified into different regimes and addressed with a regime map...|$|E
40|$|In {{field studies}} documenting the {{behavioral}} impact of social norms, there often exists a ?spurious correlation? dilemma with exogenous variables (Manski 1993; Young 2015).

Previous research in this context, focusing on norm maintenance, has documented widespread compliance (Raterman et al. 2014). However, because hat removal upon entering any building is customary in Western culture (Storey 2008), behaviors observed in the MSC may not reflect the MSC?s norm.

40|$|Abstract. There are {{challenges}} of using composite laminates {{in the marine}} engineering, i. e., composites are frequently suffering {{from the effects of}} impaction including wave impaction, ship or other objects hitting, missiles or bullets hitting and other especially conditions. It is significant to understand the <b>impact</b> <b>behaviors</b> of laminates, in this research, the impact responses of typical laminates are investigated numerically. The delamination responses among the plies and fibre and/or matrix damage responses within the plies are simulated to understand the impaction behaviours of laminates under impaction conditions. The impact damage of composite laminates in the form of intra- and/or inter-laminar cracking is modelled by using stress-based criteria for damage initiation, and fracture mechanics technique is used to capture its evolution. Interface cohesive elements are inserted between plies with appropriate mixed-mode damage laws to predict the delamination. A group of graphite fibre/epoxy laminates with impact energies of 5, 10, 15 and 20 J, respectively, are simulated with a full scale FE model and a simplified FE model respectively. Through comparing the simulation results with each other, we find out that the <b>impact</b> <b>behaviors</b> obtained in the simplified FE model is comparable to experiments with a short computing time, but the simplified model cannot represent the properties of laminate after impact. 1...|$|R

Directed Incremental Symbolic Execution (DiSE) is an intraprocedural technique for characterizing {{the impact of}} software changes on program behaviors. DiSE first estimates {{the impact of the}} changes on the source code using program slicing techniques, and then uses the impact sets to guide symbolic execution to generate path conditions that characterize <b>impacted</b> program <b>behaviors.</b> DiSE, however, cannot reason about the flow of impact between methods and will fail to generate path conditions for certain <b>impacted</b> program <b>behaviors.</b> In this work, we present iDiSE, an extension to DiSE that performs an interprocedural analysis. iDiSE combines static and dynamic calling context information to efficiently generate <b>impacted</b> program <b>behaviors</b> across calling contexts. Information about <b>impacted</b> program <b>behaviors</b> is useful for testing, verification, and debugging of evolving programs.
