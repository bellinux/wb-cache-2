Ganguly felt that <b>every</b> <b>young</b> player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at {{the receiving end of}} an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E

But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end?

500|$|Posin {{considered}} {{numerous other}} actors {{for the lead}} role of Dean before he decided to cast Jamie Bell. Auditions for the role spanned over a year, and Posin said that he met [...] "probably <b>every</b> <b>young</b> actor in Hollywood between a certain age". For the role of Crystal, Posin sought a beautiful but fragile actress. He chose Camilla Belle after she auditioned, and according to him, [...] "She just was the character". Posin wanted an actor similar to Ralph Fiennes to play Michael, but was surprised when Fiennes himself agreed {{to be in the}} film. Justin Chatwin, a Billy Wilder fan, was drawn to the script after hearing that Posin had trained with Wilder. Ben Kingsley and Robin Williams were set to star in the film at different points in pre-production.|$|E

500|$|Fauré wrote {{these three}} [...] "songs without words" [...] while still {{a student at}} the École Niedermeyer, in about 1863. They were not {{published}} until 1880, but they then became some of his most popular works. Copland considered them immature pieces, which [...] "should be relegated to the indiscretions <b>every</b> <b>young</b> composer commits." [...] Later critics have taken a less severe view; Morrison describes the Romances as [...] "an affectionate and very Gallic tribute to Mendelssohn's urbanity, agitation and ease." [...] The commentator Keith Anderson writes that although they were a popular French counterpart to Mendelssohn's Songs without Words, Fauré's own voice is already recognisable. Instead of placing the slowest piece {{in the middle of the}} set and ending with the lively A minor piece, Fauré, already with musical views of his own, switches the expected order, and the set ends pianissimo, fading to nothing.|$|E
500|$|Bill Bowes, who {{received}} coaching by Hirst {{and went on}} to play for England, described him as [...] "the finest coach in the world". Len Hutton, another who was coached by Hirst, wrote [...] "I shall always think of George Hirst as the ideal coach. He was a 'natural' one, the guide, the philosopher, and friend of <b>every</b> <b>young</b> fellow who has had a trial under him". Part of Hirst's success at Eton came from his personality and ability to extract the best from people. Bowes noted how his enthusiasm inspired young players, and his humour and kindness led boys to worship him. He could pass on technical knowledge {{in a way that was}} easy to comprehend, backed up with anecdotes to illustrate his point. Bowes described how [...] "he had a rare skill in noting and demonstrating your faults and no less skill in illustrating the remedies".|$|E
500|$|During {{his second}} season in Vienna, Mahler {{acquired}} a spacious modern apartment on the Auenbruggerstrasse and built a summer villa on land he had acquired next to his new composing studio at Maiernigg. In November 1901, he met Alma Schindler, the stepdaughter of painter Carl Moll, at a social gathering that included the theatre director Max Burckhard. Alma was not initially keen to meet Mahler, on account of [...] "the scandals about him and <b>every</b> <b>young</b> woman who aspired to sing in opera." [...] The two engaged in a lively disagreement about a ballet by Alexander von Zemlinsky (Alma was one of Zemlinsky's pupils), but agreed to meet at the Hofoper the following day. This meeting led to a rapid courtship; Mahler and Alma were married at a private ceremony on 9 March 1902. Alma was by then pregnant with her first child, a daughter Maria Anna, who was born on 3 November 1902. A second daughter, Anna, was born in 1904.|$|E

500|$|Having {{represented}} Wales at schoolboy level, Keenor {{was invited}} to attend a trial at Cardiff City by his former school teacher Riden, who had spotted Keenor playing local amateur football for Cardiff based side Roath Wednesday. Keenor later stated that he [...] "did not think twice about it" [...] and impressed enough during a trial match to be offered an amateur contract with the club {{at the age of}} 17. The Cardiff City amateur side competed in the Western Football League at the time and Keenor appeared several times in the division. A defeat to Camerton during a Western League fixture would leave a lasting effect on Keenor after an over-confident Cardiff side suffered an upset, losing 3–1 in a match they were widely expected to win. Keenor often spoke of using the defeat as motivation in later stages of his career, remarking [...] "In subsequent seasons I always thought of that game when {{we were supposed to be}} on a [...] "good thing". It has a moral which I pass on to <b>every</b> <b>young</b> footballer".|$|E
500|$|In 1966, Lansbury took on {{the title}} role of Mame Dennis in the musical Mame, Jerry Herman's musical {{adaptation}} of the novel Auntie Mame. The director's first choice for the role had been Rosalind Russell, who played Mame in the non-musical film adaptation Auntie Mame, but she had declined. Lansbury actively sought the role {{in the hope that}} it would mark a change in her career. When she was chosen, it came as a surprise to theatre critics, who believed that it would go to a better-known actress; Lansbury was forty-one years old, and it was her first starring role. Mame Dennis was a glamorous character, with over twenty costume changes throughout the play, and Lansbury's role involved ten songs and dance routines which she trained extensively for. First appearing in Philadelphia and then Boston, Mame opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in May 1966. Auntie Mame was already popular among the gay community, and Mame gained Lansbury a cult gay following, something that she later attributed to the fact that Mame Dennis was [...] "every gay person's idea of glamour... Everything about Mame coincided with <b>every</b> <b>young</b> man's idea of beauty and glory and it was lovely." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dumas's {{business}} and those like it were criticized {{by a number}} of people who sought to reform the red light district. Reverend William Biederwolf condemned Butte as [...] "the lowest sinkhole of vice in the west," [...] and that he saw [...] "enough legitimate vice in Butte to damn the souls of <b>every</b> <b>young</b> man and young woman in it." [...] Biederwolf held revival services for residents which attracted [...] "rounders, gamblers and habitués of the red light district". However, the local business benefited and even depended on the support of the sex workers at the Dumas and other establishments like it. The prostitutes would buy their dresses at local clothiers, frequent the city's dry cleaners and would patronize Chinese herbalists, looking for birth control potions and venereal disease remedies. To ensure that their operations were unhampered, the girls at the Dumas would pay the city's police and governance five dollar [...] "fines". Instead of the closing or relocating the red light district, the mayor and police of Butte ordered that the women wear longer skirts and high-necked blouses and that they [...] "refrain from any indecent exposures." [...] After these ordinances were put in place, the Butte Miner reported that [...] "nothing was seen in the district except long dresses and long faces. What the women say about the matter is not fit for publication." [...] By 1910 the people were petitioning Mayor Charles Nevin to shut down the district; with the district contributing two thousand dollars to the city's coffers every month, the efforts eventually died.|$|E

500|$|Clair {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest mothers in television history by several media publications. Time dubbed Clair [...] "America's favorite TV mom".

Hayley Krischer of Salon agreed that Clair is [...] "everyone’s favorite" [...] and [...] "undoubtedly the best TV mom", despite being [...] "too calm, too gorgeous, too successful" [...] to be realistic. The Daily Beast wrote, [...] "Clair Huxtable was not only the perfect mom, but also a great role model as someone who never sacrificed either her career as a high-power lawyer or her family life." [...] Praising the character for transcending both racial and generational barriers, Patrice Evans of Jezebel described Clair as [...] "the perfect professional mom". The author went on to claim that while other famous television mothers such as June Cleaver, Carol Brady and Edith Bunker have gradually suffered a loss in [...] "potency" [...] over time, Clair instead remains a relevant maternal figure every television mother created since can only aspire to be like. As a [...] "family-balancing professional African American woman", Clair has had a profound influence on The Cosby Shows viewers. According to Susan Douglas, author of The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women, Clair was [...] "the first African American mother on television ... with whom white women identified and wanted to emulate." [...] US Weekly recognized Clair as [...] "one of TV's first working mothers", while NewNowNext's Brian Juergens credits the character with making the 1980s a [...] "boom time for great sitcom moms" [...] by [...] "breaking the mold in an essential way".
