40|$|Objective—High-density {{lipoprotein}} (HDL) cholesterol correlates inversely {{with the}} risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The precise antiatherogenic mechanisms of HDL subspecies are not thoroughly elucidated. We studied the relationship between carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and HDL subspecies distribution in Finnish families with low HDL cholesterol and premature CHD. Methods and Results—Altogether, 148 members of Finnish low-HDL families and 133 healthy control subjects participated in our study. HDL particle size was significantly smaller in affected <b>family</b> <b>members</b> (HDL 10 th Finnish age-sex specific percentile) compared with unaffected <b>family</b> <b>members</b> and control subjects (9. 10. 04 nm versus 9. 50. 05 nm, P 0. 0001, versus 9. 80. 03 nm, P 0. 0001 [meanSE]). Large HDL 2 b and HDL 2 a particles as well as pre-HDL concentration were significantly decreased among the affected <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> <b>Mean</b> IMT was significantly higher in the affected <b>family</b> <b>members</b> than in the control subjects (0. 850. 01 mm versus 0. 790. 01 mm; P 0. 0001). Age, HDL 2 b, systolic blood pressure, and pre-HDL were significant independent determinants of mean IMT. Conclusions—The decreased levels of HDL 2 b and pre-HDL reflect the potentially efflux-deficient HDL subspecies profile in the affected low-HDL <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Decreased HDL particle size caused by the decrease of plasma concentration of HDL 2 b and decreased pre-HDL levels correlate with increased IMT.

40|$|Aims and objectives: This study {{aimed to}} compare family {{functioning}} {{and perceptions of}} support from nurses among Danish and Australian adult oncology patients and <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Background: <b>Family</b> can have a strong influence {{on the health of}} individuals, providing support during a health crisis such as cancer. However, family functioning and supportive care from nurses may vary across cultures and settings. Design and methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional comparative design with patients and <b>family</b> <b>members</b> from Denmark and Australia. Participants were asked to fill in translated versions of the Iceland-Expressive Family Functioning Questionnaire (ICE-EFFQ) and Iceland-Expressive Family Perceived Support Questionnaire (ICE-FPSQ). Results: In total, 232 participants were recruited. The Danish cohort consisted of 56 patients and 54 <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> The Australian cohort consisted of 83 patients and 39 <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> <b>Mean</b> age was 59 years. No {{significant differences were found between}} Danish and Australian families. However, compared to patients, <b>family</b> <b>members</b> reported significantly lower overall family functioning, expressive emotions and communication, as well as less emotional support from nurses. Conclusions: Family functioning was comparable between Denmark and Australia. <b>Family</b> <b>members</b> reported less emotional support than patients. Nurses need to consider the patient and the family as a unit with complex needs that require monitoring and attention during oncology treatment. Implications for practice: <b>Families</b> supporting a <b>member</b> with cancer have significant and often unmet needs.

The significance of sudden death in heritable cardiac disorders with delayed expression is incompletely understood. Additional insights come from a four-decade experience of seven generations of a family of German origin with autosomal dominant (chromosome 1 p 1 - 1 q 1) cardiac conduction and myocardial disease. Methods and Results. A total of 38 <b>family</b> <b>members</b> (20 males; 18 females) were identified with sudden death. Twenty-eight <b>family</b> <b>members</b> (<b>mean</b> age 48 ± 8 years) from earlier generations had no pacemaker at the time of sudden death. In this group, 15 subjects were asymptomatic prior to sudden death. Ten <b>family</b> <b>members</b> with sudden death, from later generations, had chronically implanted pacemakers for high grade atrioventricular block. This group was older (mean age 57 ± 2 years), with decreased functional status (New York Heart Association class II to IV), enlarged left atria, dilated left ventricles with reduced systolic function and documented ventricular fibrillation in three <b>members.</b> Twenty-eight <b>family</b> <b>members</b> with sudden death were descendants of sib lineages 2 or 6; 21 <b>family</b> <b>members</b> with sudden death were offspring of a parent who also suffered sudden death.

Research indicates that by the mid-twenty-first century the number of elderly people will increase to 370 million. The constantly growing number of older people means that care of this group of patients acquires a new meaning, especially because {{most of them will}} wish to remain under the care of the family. This fact entails the need to involve <b>family</b> <b>members</b> to assist in the care of an elderly person in the home and beyond. Family potential understood as the ability to care for the old and sick has systematically decreased in recent years in Poland. The tendency of Poles to travel abroad for work purposes, especially for women, is one of the highest in the OECD.

Objectives The aim {{of the study was to}} illuminate close family members’ experience of having an older next of kin becoming in need of public home help, their participation in the needs assessment procedure and the decisions about their next of kins’ public home help. Participants The sample was 27 close <b>family</b> <b>members</b> (<b>mean</b> age 63, range 42 – 93 years) chosen by their older needs-assessed next of kin. Methods An interview using a thematic interview guide formed an everyday dialogue jointly constructed by the interviewer and the interviewee. Thereafter an interpretative content analysis was conducted on the transcribed interviews. Results One overarching category was illuminated: “Feeling disconfirmed or confirmed in the needs assessment, when feeling pressed by the responsibility and struggling to balance the needs of the family. ” Four principal categories with sub-categories were derived: (1) Experiencing existential ruminations and the need to help. (2) Help giving and receiving as a difficult balance between needs. (3) Feeling overlooked or acknowledged as having an influence on the needs assessment. (4) Hopes about the home help being fulfilled or dashed.

Individuals with aphasia and speech-language pathologists have identified peer support as an important component of adjusting to post-stroke changes and learning to live successfully with aphasia. Peer-led aphasia support groups can provide greater, long-term access to peer support and social communication opportunities for people with aphasia and their families. However, {{more research is needed to}} facilitate their development and sustainability in local communities. Aims: The primary aim of this study was to identify the core components of a successful peer-led aphasia support group from the perspective of people with aphasia and their <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> A second aim of the study was to explore the information and support needs of peer leaders in starting and running a group. Methods & Procedures: The qualitative research approach of focused ethnography was used to understand and interpret the functioning of peer-led aphasia support groups in the community. Twenty-six people, who were attending a peer-led aphasia support group, participated in the study. Participants comprised 19 people with aphasia (mean age 64. 8 +/- 12. 9) and seven <b>family</b> <b>members</b> (<b>mean</b> age 58. 3 +/- 9. 0), including three peer leaders. Data were collected from the following sources: participant observation; focus group discussion; individual interview; and written artefacts. Thematic analysis of the focus group and interview transcripts was conducted, while field notes and written artefacts were used in triangulation of the identified themes. Outcomes & Results: The findings indicate that a number of themes are important for the successful functioning of a peer-led aphasia support group, including friendship, informality, a supportive communication environment, providing support and practical considerations for the timing and location of meetings. Factors that facilitated peer leaders to start and run groups included informational support, practical support, attracting new members, time and organisation, and particular personal qualities. Conclusions: The findings confirm the positive and empowering nature of peer-led aphasia support groups that provide opportunities for developing genuine friendships and authentic communicative interactions in a supportive environment.

40|$|During the {{relatively}} short-duration Space Shuffle missions, a psychological support {{program for the}} astronauts has not been required. Such missions primarily require providing occasional communication with <b>family</b> <b>members</b> by <b>means</b> of audio, video or e-mail, and some diversions such as CD players. During the NASA-Mir Program, conducted from March 1995 through June 1998, mission duration increased to 4 - 6 months. As {{a result of these}} changes it was necessary for NASA to establish an operational Human Behavior and Performance Group (HBPG) to develop and implement a comprehensive program of psychological support. The Mir experience provided the opportunity to develop and implement a psychological support program for long-duration space missions. Many factors influence the support program, including individual preferences, mission duration, and environmental factors such as habitable and personal areas. Lessons learned from the Mir experience are being applied to improve the ISS psychological support program plan. This presentation will address which includes various preflight, in-flight, and post-flight support activities and tools that NASA's HBPG will provide to astronauts and their families for ISS missions...|$|R
40|$|Daily life {{close to}} death {{involves}} physical, psychological, and social strain, exposing patients and their <b>family</b> <b>members</b> to major transitions affecting relational patterns and identity. For the individual <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> this often <b>means</b> sharing life with a changing person in a changing relationship, disrupting both individual identity and family identity. Our aim was to deepen the understanding of individual experiences {{that are important in}} constructing family identity {{close to death}} at home. We performed a secondary analysis of qualitative data collected through 40 interviews with persons with life-threatening illness and the <b>family</b> <b>members</b> who shared everyday life with them. The analysis resulted in interpretive descriptions which provided three patterns important for creating family identity, which we here call “we-ness” close to death. The patterns were: being an existential person, being an extension of the other, and being together in existential loneliness. Together, these three patterns seemed to play a part in the construction of family identity; we-ness, close to death. One important finding was the tension between the search for togetherness in “we-ness” while dealing with an existential loneliness, which seemed to capture an essential aspect of being a family of which one member is dying.   </p...|$|R
40|$|Intelligence {{levels and}} {{intelligence}} profiles were investigated in 52 {{members of a}} large family with the fragile X syndrome. The mental abilities were evaluated by the three Wechsler intelligence tests (WAIS, WISC-R, and WPPSI). Chromosomal and psychological data were then compared. In 22 non-retarded fra(X) negative <b>family</b> <b>members,</b> a <b>mean</b> IQ of 102 was found (males 97, females 106). Eleven non-retarded carrier females had IQs between 70 and 110 (mean 86. 8), which is 20 points below the mean of normal women (alpha = 0. 01). One non-retarded male with 6 % fra(X) positive cells had an IQ of 98. His intelligence profile closely resembled the profile in the non-retarded female carriers. The highest IQ {{in the group of}} retarded males was 31. The mentally retarded females scored IQs between 26 and 41. In male and female patients verbal intelligence substantially exceeded performance abilities. There was a considerable gap between the highest IQ in the group of retarded females and the lowest IQ in the group of non-retarded carriers (41 and 71 respectively) and a considerable overlap was found between the IQ levels of the non-retarded carriers and normal women...|$|R
40|$|Activation of {{extracellular}} signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1 / 2, {{which plays}} {{a critical role}} in diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation, is known to be mediated by the canonical Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) kinase cascade. Alternative MEK-independent signaling pathways for Erk 1 / 2 activation in mammalian cells are not known. During our studies of human primary Schwann cell response to long-term infection of Mycobacterium leprae, the causative organism of leprosy, we identified that intracellular M. leprae activated Erk 1 / 2 directly by lymphoid cell kinase (p 56 Lck), a Src <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> by <b>means</b> of a PKCε-dependent and MEK-independent signaling pathway. Activation of this signaling induced nuclear accumulation of cyclin D 1, G 1 /S-phase progression, and continuous proliferation, but without transformation. Thus, our data reveal a previously unknown signaling mechanism of glial cell proliferation, which might play a role in dedifferentiation as well as nerve regeneration and degeneration. Our findings may also provide a potential mechanism by which an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen like M. leprae subverts nervous system signaling to propagate its cellular niche for colonization and long-term bacterial survival...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} instrumental sacred music and sacred music with vocals on the spiritual well-being of bereaved relatives. METHOD This is a randomized clinical trial carried out with <b>family</b> <b>members</b> bereaving the death of loved ones to cancer. Participants were allocated into three groups: Group 1 (control), Group 2 (experimental using sacred music with vocals) or Group 3 (experimental using instrumental sacred music). Spiritual well-being was assessed through the Spiritual Well-Being Scale. RESULTS Sixty-nine (69) <b>family</b> <b>members</b> participated. <b>Mean</b> scores {{before and after the}} intervention indicated high levels of spiritual well-being (106. 4 and 105. 5 in Group 1; 103. 2 and 105. 2 in Group 2; 107. 4 and 108. 7 in Group 3) and religious well-being (57. 9 and 56. 9 in Group 1; 56. 3 and 56. 4 in Group 2; 57. 4 and 58. 1 in Group 3), and moderate levels of existential well-being (48. 5 and 48. 6 in Group 1; 46. 9 and 48. 9 in Group 2; 49. 9 and 50. 7 in Group 3), with the exception of Group 3 which presented a high level of existential well-being after the intervention. CONCLUSION The results show that there were no statistically significant differences in the spiritual well-being scores between the experimental groups and the control group. We evidence the need for further studies that use music therapy as a Nursing intervention for bereaved families. Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials: RBR- 2 wtwjz...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe took {{advantage}} of the genetic isolate of Finns to characterize a common long QT syndrome (LQTS) mutation, and to estimate the prevalence of LQTS. BACKGROUNDThe LQTS is caused by mutations in different ion channel genes, which vary in their molecular nature from family to family. METHODSThe potassium channel gene KCNQ 1 was sequenced in two unrelated Finnish patients with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), followed by genotyping of 114 LQTS probands and their available <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> The functional properties of the mutation were studied using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. RESULTSWe identified a novel missense mutation (G 589 D or KCNQ 1 -Fin) in the C-terminus of the KCNQ 1 subunit. The voltage threshold of activation for the KCNQ 1 -Fin channel was markedly increased compared to the wild-type channel. This mutation was present in homozygous form in two siblings with JLNS, and in heterozygous form in 34 of 114 probands with Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS) and 282 <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> The <b>mean</b> (± SD) rate-corrected QT intervals of the heterozygous subjects (n = 316) and noncarriers (n = 423) were 460 ± 40 ms and 410 ± 20 ms (p < 0. 001), respectively. CONCLUSIONSA single missense mutation of the KCNQ 1 gene accounts for 30 % of Finnish cases with LQTS, and it may be associated with both the RWS and JLNS phenotypes of the syndrome. The relative enrichment of this mutation most likely represents a founder gene effect. These circumstances provide an excellent opportunity to examine how genetic and nongenetic factors modify the LQTS phenotype...|$|R
5000|$|The {{channel is}} the {{method by which}} the {{communication}} travels from the source or sender to the receiver. There {{are two types of}} channels, personal and non-personal. Personal channels of communication are direct and target individual groups. Personal communication channels are connected with two or more persons who communicate directly with each other face-to-face, person-to-person through telephone, email or fax. Social channels also fall under the category of personal communications. Friends, neighbors, associates, co-workers, or <b>family</b> <b>members</b> are all <b>means</b> of social channels. [...] Carrying a message without interpersonal contact between sender and receiver is known as non-personal channels of communication. Mass media or mass communications are examples of non-personal channels, since the message is sent to many individuals at one time. Non-personal channels of communication are made up out of two main types, the first being print. Print media includes newspapers, magazines, direct mail, and billboards. The second type is broadcast; broadcast media includes radio and television.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This study {{examined}} the prevalence {{of the use of}} different complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) strategies, families’ attitudes and belief systems about the use of these strategies, and the economic burden of these strategies placed on family income in families of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Method: A questionnaire survey concerning the use of CAM in children with ASD was administered to parents in the five different geographic locations in Turkey. Results: Of the 172 respondents, 56 % had used at least one CAM therapy. The most frequently used CAM intervention was spiritual healing. Among the most reported reasons for seeking CAM were dissatisfaction with conventional interventions and a search for ways to enhance the effectiveness of conventional treatments. The most frequently reported source of recommendation for CAM was advice from <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> The <b>mean</b> economic burden of the CAM methods was a total of 4, 005 Turkish lira ($ 2, 670) in the sample using CAM. The CAM usage rate was lower in parents who suspected genetic/congenital factors for the development of ASD. Conclusion: This study observed the importance of socioeconomic and cultural factors as well as parents’ beliefs about the etiology of ASD in treatment decisions about CAM.
