5|$|In order, therefore, to {{establish}} an important point of theory, {{and at the same}} time to prevent American chessplayers from being misled and deceived by the superficial analysis of incompetent British chess editors, whose object in condemning the Steinitz Gambit has obviously been mainly to depreciate the originality of its illustrious inventor, whom they invariably try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self-conceit, <b>I</b> <b>submit</b> the following variations which at any rate possess the undeniable merit of exposing the hollow analytical twaddle continually published in the two London journals above named.|$|E
25|$|But <b>I</b> <b>submit</b> that it {{has been}} caring more for lasting British honour and {{substantial}} British interests, to protect friendly and helpful people, and to return the confidence of the great trading population of the Southern Provinces, with which it is our chief purpose to cultivate more intimate, social and commercial relations.|$|E

You are the cream. But <b>I</b> <b>submit</b> that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge. And as long as you validate that and abide it, you are, by your grandfathers' standards, cowards.|$|E

25|$|My heart...is {{to agree}} on all {{subjects}} with Charles Fox: but your opinions have been terribly at variance. New occurrences and change of circumstances will, I hope, bring us together again—but still I am anti-Gallican: I ask not, what sort of Government prevail, but under none, can <b>I</b> <b>submit</b> patiently to the strange assumption of power over independent nations, daily making by France. Here {{is the root of}} my present opinions: I am sure, it is the growth of good Whig soil.|$|E
25|$|His Holiness Sree Narayana Guru, {{the spiritual}} leader of the Thiyyas is {{reported}} to have disapproved of the present methods of Satyagraha at Vaikom. He suggests that volunteers should advance along barricaded roads and scale the barricades. They should enter temples and sit with others to dine. Now the action proposed is not Satyagraha. For scaling barricades is open violence. If you may scale barricades, why not break open temple doors and even pierce temple walls? How are the volunteers pierce through a row of policemen except by using force?. If the Thiyyas are strong and willing to die in sufficient numbers, they can gain their point. All <b>I</b> <b>submit</b> is that they will have gained it by some thing the reverse of Satyagraha. And then too, they would not have converted the orthodox to their views, but would have imposed it on them by force.|$|E
500|$|Geneva reconsidered its {{expulsion}} of Calvin. Church attendance had dwindled {{and the political}} climate had changed; as Bern and Geneva quarrelled over land, their alliance frayed. When Cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto {{wrote a letter to}} the city council inviting Geneva to return to the Catholic faith, the council searched for an ecclesiastical authority to respond to him. At first Pierre Viret was consulted, but when he refused, the council asked Calvin. He agreed and his Responsio ad Sadoletum (Letter to Sadoleto) strongly defended Geneva's position concerning reforms in the church. On 21 September 1540 the council commissioned one of its members, Ami Perrin, to find a way to recall Calvin. An embassy reached Calvin while he was at a colloquy, a conference to settle religious disputes, in Worms. His reaction to the suggestion was one of horror in which he wrote, [...] "Rather would <b>I</b> <b>submit</b> to death a hundred times than to that cross on which I had to perish daily a thousand times over." ...|$|E

Lewis, speaking for the party at a press scrum that day: [...] "The information we do have, showed a situation of criminal acts and criminal conspiracy in Quebec. But, there is no information that there was unintended, or apprehended, or planned insurrection, which alone, would justify invoking the War Measures Act." [...] Douglas voiced similar criticism: [...] "The government, <b>I</b> <b>submit,</b> is using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut." ...|$|E
