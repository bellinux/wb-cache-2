5|$|In the 14th century, {{diplomatic}} contact continued {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols, until the Ilkhanate dissolved in the 1330s, and {{the ravages of}} the Black Death in Europe caused contact with the East to be severed.

5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over <b>daughters</b> <b>in</b> India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons.

One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E
