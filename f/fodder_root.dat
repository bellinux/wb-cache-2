This honor came unexpectedly, and he could not withdraw himself at once from his profession, but began by degrees to resign his practice, and continued his favorite occupation, the improvement of agriculture, with the view of establishing an experimental farm. He paid great attention to the culture of herbage <b>fodder,</b> <b>root</b> crops, and especially potatoes; which latter root he most vehemently defended against its numerous adversaries and assailants.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{high level}} of {{contamination}} due to waste accumulation and forest fires. The fires have made it a giant dump for the inhabitants from the nearby colonies. National Park Tepeyac, has served in recent years as a dump of gravel for underground works. There is currently a government authorization to deposit 60,000 cubic meters of trash in the park.The director of the Mexican Institute of Renewable Natural Resources, Enrique Beltran, stated that the waste deposited in [...] "Parque del Tepeyac" [...] constitutes a source of infection for inhabitants of the nearby area. The infections are originated because of the precipitations that have caused black waters to disseminate and contaminate neighbor colonies. There are other sources of pollution like solid waste (garbage) in different areas of the park. The green area suffers from removal and destruction of natural resources such as the collection of snails, insects, bird hunting, quarrying, <b>fodder,</b> <b>roots</b> and damage to its vegetation due to excessive logging and lack of flora and fauna care.|$|R
50|$|The Year Without a Summer - 1816 - {{struck the}} Eifel hard, {{bringing}} famine, floods and weather damage along with it. Snow was still {{lying on the}} ground into June. Hay was only harvested in September, and the grain only ripened in October. That same month came frost, and by early November, snow was falling once again. The next year, 1817, the Eifel dwellers suffered under the lingering effects of the foregoing yearâ€™s disastrous and unusual weather patterns. Common foodstuffs were not so common, and cost much more than usual. People were so hungry that they were eating livestock <b>fodder</b> and <b>roots.</b> The Prussian government helped ease the crisis by making available two million Thaler, and ensuring the poor their daily bread by buying up great quantities of grain from East Prussia.|$|R
50|$|Paulownia tomentosa {{can survive}} {{wildfire}} because the roots can regenerate new, very fast-growing stems. It is tolerant of pollution {{and it is}} not fussy about soil type. For this reason it functions ecologically as a pioneer plant. Its nitrogen-rich leaves provide good <b>fodder</b> and its <b>roots</b> prevent soil erosion. Eventually, Paulownia is succeeded by taller trees that shade it. It cannot thrive in the shade of other trees. It is able to grow from small cracks in pavements and walls.|$|R

The Arthashastra also reveals that the Mauryas designated specific forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers, for skins.|$|R
40|$|Fodder tree/shrub legumes {{have the}} {{potential}} for alleviating some of the feed shortages and nutritional deficiencies experienced in the dry season on smallholder farms. Zambia has a wide range of naturally occurring tree/shrub species that can be used as fodder for ruminants. Over the years a number of trees have been selected for their agronomic qualities and are currently being used in arable farming systems to promote soil fertility and erosion control. There is a need to evaluate them for use as fodder for ruminants in the dry season. Because of their high content of protein, minerals and vitamins and availability in the dry season, fodder tree/shrub legumes have the capacity to complement the feeding of crop-residues and natural pastures. Tree/shrub legumes also have other advantages in that they are available on-farm and can also be used as a source of food, timber and medicines at village level. Being deep <b>rooted,</b> <b>fodder</b> trees are rarely affected by seasonal climatic changes. The main limitation to their use as a feed resource for ruminants is the high tannin content which may have detrimental effects on the performance of animals. A number of techniques including, wilting, sun-drying, treatment with chemicals and ammoniation have been developed to minimize their adverse effects. Controlled intake through stall feeding or mixing of tree/shrub fodder with basal diets could also be used to mitigate their toxic effects. Research is currently under way to establish rumen microbes that have capacity to detoxify tannins. To promote increased use of fodder trees on smallholder farms, farmers must be provided with information on the good quality fodder trees and the approaches to effectively utilise them. They should also be encouraged to start planting fodder trees in their food crop farming systems or establishing fodder gardens on fallow lands...|$|R
40|$|Dry spells {{during the}} summer period {{affecting}} water uptake and plant growth in central Europe may occur more frequently in the future due to climate change. Improving the ability of crops to take up water from deeper soil layers is a potential strategy to secure water supply. The objective {{of this paper is}} to report on the effect of different preceding <b>fodder</b> crops on <b>root</b> growth and water uptake of spring wheat from the subsoil. Water extraction and root length density during grain filling of spring wheat were observed between anthesis and maturity in six different soil depths (0 - 15, 15 - 45, 45 - 60, 60 - 75, 75 - 90 and 90 - 105 cm) and with four different preceding crops: 1 year of fescue (Fes 1 Y), 2 years of chicory (Chi 2 Y), 2 years of lucerne (Luc 2 Y) and 3 years of chicory (Chi 3 Y). While there was no difference in total water extraction by wheat in the four crop sequences, water extraction from the deepest layer (90 - 105 cm) was significantly higher after 2 years of lucerne (Luc 2 Y). This was consistent with the root length densities measured in the 90 - 105 layer, which were 82, 89 and 112 % higher in Luc 2 Y as compared to Fes 1 Y, Chi 2 Y and Chi 3 Y, respectively. Results suggest that lucerne as preceding crop supports deeper rooting and higher rooting density of following spring wheat enhancing access to water in deeper soil layers in response to prolonged dry spells. Effects facilitating root penetration like improved soil structure and higher nitrogen availability after lucerne are discussed. We conclude that suitable crop rotations with lucerne might be a cost-effective adaptation measure to overcome drought stress. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
