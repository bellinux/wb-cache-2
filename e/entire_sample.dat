5|$|Looking {{ahead to}} the movies of February 2014, Chris Kirk and Kim Thompson at Slate argued that February's movies were {{statistically}} the worst of any month. Their evidence was the average RT ratings for all movies for each month between 2000 and 2013. February's averaged 45%, three points lower than January and September and four below August. February also had the worst month in the <b>entire</b> <b>sample</b> period, with the 2001 releases from that month coming in at 31%; 2010 and 2012 tied for the best February at 54%.|$|E

25|$|If {{a system}} {{undergoes}} certain phase transformations while being heated, such as melting and vaporization, {{it may be}} observed that {{the temperature of the}} system does not change until the <b>entire</b> <b>sample</b> has completed the transformation. The energy introduced into the system while the temperature did not change is called a latent energy, or latent heat, in contrast to sensible heat, which is associated with temperature change.|$|E
50|$|In some relays, a {{short history}} of the <b>entire</b> <b>sampled</b> data is kept for oscillographic records. The event {{recording}} would include some means for the user to see the timing of key logic decisions, relay I/O (input/output) changes, and see, in an oscillographic fashion, at least the fundamental component of the incoming analogue parameters.|$|R
30|$|At each site, in situ monthly {{sampling}} of dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature measurements were done using a Hanna hand-held pH meter (Hanna Instrument: HI 8014 -UK).

25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in the Republic of Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a detailed picture. The {{respondents were asked to}} rate the relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll showed that 26% of the <b>entire</b> <b>sample,</b> which included all ethnic groups, claimed the two identities were the same or very similar, whereas 47% claimed they were different or entirely different.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{generate}} random samples from a binomial distribution {{is to use}} an inversion algorithm. To do so, one must calculate the probability that P(X=k) for all values k from 0 through n. (These probabilities should sum to a value close to one, in order to encompass the <b>entire</b> <b>sample</b> space.) Then by using a pseudorandom number generator {{to generate}} samples uniformly between 0 and 1, one can transform the calculated samples U into discrete numbers by using the probabilities calculated in step one.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the above}} {{correlation}} functions have been defined {{in the context of}} equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, it is possible to define correlation functions for systems away from equilibrium. Examining the general definition of , it is clear that one can define the random variables used in these correlation functions, such as atomic positions and spins, away from equilibrium. As such, their scalar product is well-defined away from equilibrium. The operation which is no longer well-defined away from equilibrium is the average over the equilibrium ensemble. This averaging process for non-equilibrium system is typically replaced by averaging the scalar product across the <b>entire</b> <b>sample.</b> This is typical in scattering experiments and computer simulations, and is often used to measure the radial distribution functions of glasses.|$|E
30|$|Nitrate has maximum {{concentrations}} for example, 13.1, 12.25 and 14.58  mg/L occurring within deeper zones. The average NO 3 concentration measured for the <b>entire</b> <b>sampling</b> profiles is 7.43  mg/L. Nitrate concentration for {{leached soil}} solution was hence fairly stable with increasing depth. Unsaturated zone water and water groundwater concentrations of NO 3 (39 and 60.5  mg/l) were higher in nitrate content {{compared to that}} of leached soil (4.95 – 12.09  mg/L).|$|R
30|$|The constituent’s calcium, magnesium, {{sodium and}} {{potassium}} are considered generally to be major cations typically present in leachate. In leachates, these are sourced usually from {{the degradation of}} organic materials and the dissolution of inorganic wastes such as concrete, plaster and tiles. Sodium and potassium are both present at considerably high concentrations in the <b>entire</b> <b>samples</b> of this investigation. The sodium and potassium are not affected significant by microbiological activities within the landfill site.|$|R
40|$|Most {{information}} in electronic databases is measured with error and bias, {{so that even}} though the <b>entire</b> <b>sampling</b> frame appears to be available, database queries are still forms of statistical estimation. Assuming that data can be verified exactly for a random sample of database records, weshowhowverification information can be combined with the contents of the database to yield estimates that are better than estimates based on the verification sample or the original uncorrected data alone...|$|R
25|$|A {{representative}} {{study done}} from 2001 to 2002 in Australia found that 1.8% of sexually active people (2.2% men, 1.3% women but no significant sex difference) {{had engaged in}} BDSM activity in the previous year. Of the <b>entire</b> <b>sample,</b> 1.8% men and 1.3% women {{had been involved in}} BDSM. BDSM activity was significantly more likely among bisexuals and homosexuals of both sexes. But among men in general, there was no relationship effect of age, education, language spoken at home, or relationship status. Among women, in this study, activity was most common for those between 16 and 19 years of age and least likely for females over 50 years. Activity was also significantly more likely for women who had a regular partner they did not live with, but was not significantly related with speaking a language other than English or education.|$|E
25|$|An {{update on}} the above study; it employs the same methodology, has a larger sample (20,055 {{respondent}}s), and a broader respondent age range (16–69). The study found that 96.5% of the <b>entire</b> <b>sample</b> (or 96.8% {{of the men and}} 96.3% of the women) identified as heterosexual, a drop from the 2003 findings (97.5%). Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female population, a non-significant difference between the sexes. Bisexuals accounted for 1.3% of the male population and 2.2% of the female population. Women were significantly {{more likely than men to}} identify as bisexual, and less likely to report exclusively other-sex or same-sex attraction and experience. Similarly, more women reported same-sex experience and same-sex attraction. Nine percent of men and 19% of women had some history of same-sex attraction or experience. More women identified as lesbian or bisexual than in 2001–02. Homosexual/gay identity was more common among men with university education and living in cities, and much less common among men with blue-collar jobs. Both male and female bisexuality were more common among respondents under the age of 20. Male bisexuality was also overrepresented among men in their sixties.|$|E
25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a somewhat detailed {{picture of the}} perception of identity inside the country. The {{participants were asked to}} rate the relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll shows that 26% of the <b>entire</b> <b>sample,</b> which includes all ethnic groups, claim the two identities are the same or very similar, whereas 47% claim they are different or entirely different. The results vary significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar, and 44% different or very different. Among the senior respondents (aged over 60), the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. One of the largest deviation from the country average was among the residents of capital Chișinău, for whom the figures were 42% and 44%. The poll also shows that, compared to the national average (25%), {{people are more likely to}} perceive the two identities as the same or very similar if they are young (33%), are native speakers of Romanian (30%), have higher education (36%) or reside in urban areas (30%), especially in the capital city (42%).|$|E
30|$|Generally, higher {{concentrations}} of the ions occurred in soils sampled at greater depths. Concentrations of major ions analysed in leached soil solution {{obtained from the}} <b>entire</b> <b>sampling</b> points were comparatively lower but higher in groundwater and unsaturated zone water. This is indicative of some degree of mobility of the ions towards groundwater, an indication that shallow wells mostly common to the Abloradjei community could be at risk of pollution from leachate and other soil surface activities.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the loss {{function}} could also significantly affect {{the training of}} CNN-based face verification systems and lead to poor performance while it might be biased to the data distribution. For instance, softmax loss, which was not specifically designed for complicated samples, would neglect the faces with occlusion by enlarging the conditional probability of the <b>entire</b> <b>samples.</b> To address this issue, numerous loss functions and different constraints on the traditional loss functions have been presented [9, 12 – 14].|$|R

2500|$|Any {{attempt at}} ancestral {{reconstruction}} {{begins with a}} phylogeny. [...] In general, a phylogeny is a tree-based hypothesis about {{the order in which}} populations (referred to as taxa) are related by descent from common ancestors. [...] Observed taxa are represented by the tips or terminal nodes of the tree that are progressively connected by branches to their common ancestors, which are represented by the branching points of the tree that are usually referred to as the ancestral or internal nodes. [...] Eventually, all lineages converge to the most recent common ancestor of the <b>entire</b> <b>sample</b> of taxa. [...] In the context of ancestral reconstruction, a phylogeny is often treated {{as though it were a}} known quantity (with Bayesian approaches being an important exception). [...] Because there can be an enormous number of phylogenies that are nearly equally effective at explaining the data, reducing the subset of phylogenies supported by the data to a single representative, or point estimate, can be a convenient and sometimes necessary simplifying assumption.|$|E
2500|$|Permuted-block {{randomization}} or blocked randomization: a [...] "block size" [...] and [...] "allocation ratio" [...] (number {{of subjects}} in one group versus the other group) are specified, and subjects are allocated randomly within each block. For example, a block size of 6 and an allocation ratio of 2:1 {{would lead to}} random assignment of 4 subjects to one group and 2 to the other.

Another disadvantage is that [...] "proper" [...] analysis of data from permuted-block-randomized RCTs requires stratification by blocks.|$|E
2500|$|Sociological {{research}} into pornography and LDS individuals has included one BYU study that showed of 192 male BYU students ages 18–27, 100% {{of the sample}} considered viewing pornography [...] "unacceptable". However, 35% reported having used pornography in the past 12 months, with 9.2% of the <b>entire</b> <b>sample</b> reporting viewing pornography {{at least once in}} the last month. No data was collected on female students. A nationwide study of paid porn subscriptions showed that the predominantly LDS state of Utah had the highest subscription rate of any state. The state's LDS governor Gary Herbert officially declared pornography to be a public health crisis in Utah in 2016. In 2017 the church school BYU released a study using data gathered online from nearly 700 unmarried English-speaking adults on the effects of religiosity on perceptions of porn addictiveness and relationship anxiety. The results showed that seeing oneself as addicted to pornography generated far more anxiety- and shame-related negative outcomes individually and in romantic relationships than any negative effects of consuming sexually explicit material. Additionally, more religious individuals were more likely to consider themselves addicted to porn regardless of their comparative usage rate.|$|E
