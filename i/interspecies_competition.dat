2500|$|<b>Interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> {{exists between}} {{harvester}} ant populations, presenting challenges to successful foraging. One {{example of this}} is the competition for access to seed resources between the Novomessor cockerelli and Pogonomyrmex barbatus species of harvester ants. Novomessor cockerelli ants engage in interference competition against Pogonomyrmex barbatus colonies by [...] "plugging" [...] entrances to the nest with sand and small rocks. This delays activity of P. barbatus for one to three hours, shifting the onset of foraging until later in the day when the temperature is substantially higher. This reduces productivity in two ways; firstly, the ants are delayed and consequently have less time to forage; secondly, high soil temperatures prematurely drive harvest ants back into their nests, shortening the range of possible foraging. Research indicated that the affected P. barbatus populations did not take efforts to compensate for the interference in their activities, such as by inducing higher rates of foraging. As such, nest plugging by rival species impedes the overall productivity of worker ants in the species Pogonomyrmex barbatus.|$|E

5000|$|The progenetic {{life cycle}} choice is {{dependent}} upon opportunities for transmission {{and the risk of}} dead-end transmission. The worm can use cues from the amphipod caused by the presence of the predatory definitive host to interrupt its growth cycle in wait to be eaten. However, under low amounts of stress cues from the amphipod, the worm responds by adopting the progenetic lifecycle (Lagrue & Poulin, 2007).Another factor involved in the choice of progenesis is the <b>competition</b> with other <b>interspecies</b> and intraspecies <b>competition.</b> In the case of <b>interspecies</b> coinfection, <b>competition</b> with Microphallus sp.

The primary song is sung only by the males and usually only during the breeding season. The males become quite vocal during the breeding season, with the song frequency reaching its height prior to mating and then decreasing after copulation.

50|$|Given {{that the}} {{persistence}} of the species is of little concern there are no conservation efforts tailored specifically for it, however there is significant decline of other species in the ecosystems which the white-browed babbler inhabits. Many of these studies suggest that remnant vegetation is integral to the health of these ecosystems, and that their removal can cause higher levels of competition in an area. This leads to <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> for remnant vegetation and the species that rely on them decline in number. Others suggest that the generalist style of feeding is best suited to these degraded landscapes, and therefore the white-browed babbler is least susceptible to degraded conditions.|$|E

40|$|The MacArthur and Wilson island {{biogeography}} theory relates {{species diversity}} on islands {{as the result}} of equilibrium between extinctions and colonization events which rates depend on island size and isolation. Although island size and isolation can be considered static on ecological timescales (< 100 years) they are not static on longer time scales. Since the last million years sea levels fluctuate with a period of ca. 120 kyr between - 120 m and up to + 10 m MSL (Mean Sea Level). Due to these sea level changes islands have changed in size and ultimately may have drowned or emerged. The rate and degree of their drowning depends on island morphometry and the shape of the sea level change curve. We explore the effects of global sea level cycles on the configuration of archipelagos and volcanic islands of Macaronesia. The results indicate that the islands changed shape considerably during the last 120 kyr. Notably the period between 80 kyr and 15 kyr ago sea levels were at least 80 m lower than present and several islands now isolated were merged or were much larger than present. Recent shrinking of islands due to the sea level rise since the last glacial maximum period (20 kyr BP) led to more than 50 % reductions in island size, significant loss of coastal habitat and a significant increase in isolation by the increase of distances between islands and island and continents. Island size reduction must have induced pressures especially on terrestrial insular ecosystems, inducing upward migrations and <b>interspecies</b> <b>competitions,</b> and probable extinctions. The splitting of merged islands must have led to separations of populations leading to gene flow losses for some biota. Present day islands are not representative for the mean island configurations during the last Myr but rather represent an anomaly. Islands at present are smallest and most isolated and this configuration makes the insular biota even more vulnerable to human impact...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} assessed {{losses in}} methane production {{as a result}} of raising digester salt concentrations to marine values, and of increasing the feedstock sulphate concentration. Acclimatisation of inoculum from a municipal wastewater biosolids digester was begun by raising the concentration of chloride salts (Na, Mg, Ca and K) to 6 – 9 g L? 1, as initial experiments showed higher concentrations caused severe inhibition. After stable operation for four retention times salt content in the reactors and the feed was increased by 1 g L? 1 every 14 days, up to 31. 1 g L? 1. The digesters were fed daily in semi-continuous mode and monitored for performance and stability criteria including specific methane production (SMP). SMP was 6 – 7 % less than in controls using the same feedstock without saline addition. After steady-state conditions were achieved at high chloride salinity, magnesium chloride was partially replaced by magnesium sulphate to give a range of sulphate concentrations. Higher sulphate concentrations caused initial instability, indicated by volatile fatty acid accumulation.

50|$|He formed his {{hypothesis}} through {{observations in}} Queensland, Australia. Along with Jack Greening Tracey and Larry Johnson Webb, he mapped trees in two rainforests and observed that smaller seedlings tended {{to occur in}} single-species clumps. Smaller seedlings also exhibited greater mortality, especially when their nearest neighbor was an individual {{of the same species}}. This pattern lessened with growth and age until seedlings exhibited similar pattern diversity to adults. To reinforce these observations, Connell ran an experiment showing that adult trees have a deleterious effect on smaller trees of the same species. In another experiment, Connell found that pre-germination predation was greater on seeds near adults of the same species than those near adults of others. Through these observations, Connell suggests that each tree species has host-specific enemies that attack it and any of its offspring which are close to the parent. This emphasizes the importance of the role of predation in preventing trees from forming single-species groves, which is probably the only way in which one species of tree could exclude others by <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kleptoparasitism is {{sometimes}} recorded within the species. Occasionally, the smaller species may steal a fish {{away from the}} Steller's, especially if it is distracted by aggression from conspecifics, and both juvenile and adult Steller's may lose fish to the smaller species even face-to-face, especially a less assertive bird, such as immature Steller's. One video shows a golden eagle engaging an immature Steller's in a conflict and ultimately displacing it after maintaining a superior grip despite its smaller size. In other cases, the Steller's have been photographed coming away with the prey after using its superior size to dominate, usually by bearing down its mass and large bill over the smaller eagles. In other cases, though, the three eagle species have been observed to feed in close proximity and seem to be outwardly indifferent to each other's presence. In inland areas, where golden, bald and white-tailed eagles compete over food sources which are not as abundant as these fish and, more importantly, compete for nesting ranges, aggressive <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> can be more common. White-tailed eagles and golden eagles have even killed one another in Scotland, in cases of competition for abutting nesting ranges. As in many sea and fish eagles, Steller's sea eagle may attempt to steal (and occasionally succeed in procuring) fish from osprey (Pandion haliaetus) where they coexist. In one case, a cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus), the largest living accipitrid, was observed to be pursued in flight and kleptoparasitized by a Steller's sea eagle.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} other insects, both intraspecies and <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> occurs in M. scutellatus over resources. Hughes and Hughes {{performed}} experiments to test the results of asymmetric contests of M. scutellatus and M. notatus, the eastern pine sawyer. They found that in M. scutellatus, females laid eggs that were fertilized by the male with whom they were currently sharing a pair-bond with, and the certainty of paternity decreases once the pair-bond is over. Consequently, females are the most valuable resource that males compete over. As for the females, {{the majority of their}} inter- and intraspecies competition was over oviposition holes. Female M. scutellatus individuals often spend over 20 minutes using their mandibles to chew oviposition holes in the bark of trees, which makes a very loud noise and incurs substantial risk of detection by predators. Therefore, it is greatly advantageous for females to steal holes chewed by other females to save time and risk. The study found that both within and between species, contests between larger resource holders and smaller challengers usually do not escalate and the resource holder retains their territory, but contests between smaller resource holders and larger challengers are more likely to escalate to fighting with the pro- and mesolegs and biting of the legs and antennae. This is likely because Monochamus species have large, strong mandibles which are capable of biting off limbs or antennae, and escalated competitions are usually not worth the risk. M. scutellatus displays resource-defence polygyny, a mating system in which males defend necessary resources that females require for reproduction. Resources in this case refer to the quality of tree trunk that the male has won; females prefer basal trunk regions with a large diameter. Females then choose mates mainly {{on the basis of their}} resources, but when resources are equal, Hughes and Hughes observed that they choose larger males preferentially. Although it has not been proven that large body size is inherited by offspring, it still may be an indicator of fitness and quality.|$|E

The site of origin, on the other hand, had a consistent effect in determining biomass, with a general pattern of northern sites accumulating more biomass than southern sites.

40|$|Investigation of {{microbial}} interspecies interactions {{is essential}} for elucidating the function and stability of microbial ecosystems. However, community-based analyses including molecular-fingerprinting methods have limitations for precise understanding of interspecies interactions. Construction of model microbial consortia consisting of defined-mixed cultures of isolated microorganisms is an excellent method for research on interspecies interactions. In this study, a model microbial consortium consisting of microorganisms that convert acetate into methane directly (Methanosaeta thermophila) and syntrophically (Thermoacetogenium phaeum and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus) was constructed {{and the effects of}} elevated CO 2 concentrations on intermicrobial competition were investigated. Analyses on the community dynamics by quantitative RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization targeting their 16 S rRNAs revealed that high concentrations of CO 2 have suppressive effects on the syntrophic microorganisms, but not on the aceticlastic methanogen. The pathways were further characterized by determining the Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG) of the metabolic reactions conducted by each microorganism under different CO 2 concentrations. The ΔG value of the acetate oxidation reaction (T. phaeum) under high CO 2 conditions became significantly higher than - 20 kJ per mol of acetate, which is the borderline level for sustaining microbial growth. These results suggest that high concentrations of CO 2 undermine energy acquisition of T. phaeum, resulting in dominance of the aceticlastic methanogen.

LAI estimates for minimally managed or natural forest stands can be particularly difficult to develop as a result of <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition,</b> age and spatial distribution. Satellite-based LAI estimates hold promise for retrospective analyses, but we must continue to rely on numerical models for alternative management analysis. Our objective for this study is to calculate and validate LAI estimates generated from the USDA Environmental Policy Impact Climate (EPIC) model (a widely used, field-scale, biogeochemical model) on four forest complexes spanning three physiographic provinces in Virginia and North Carolina.

There has been a change from wild to domestic herbivore dominance with heavily grazed savannas and an increase of woody vegetation, which often show signs of low species richness. This study investigates the effects that different land uses have on mammal communities in northern Botswana and compares the results with previous studies from the mentioned study area and an additional area in southern Botswana. Mammals, wild and domestic, from the size of tree squirrel and larger and ostriches were recorded along 11 predetermined transects in four land use types; Communal Grazing Areas, Fenced Ranches, Wildlife Management Areas and National Parks. This study indicates that decline in species richness in an area can many times be connected to an increase in human presence. The limited number of wild species observations in the unprotected areas is an indication of how the human population and high densities of domestic animals are influencing the wildlife in those areas. The herbivores are shown to have a very evident impact on the vegetation. In this study woody vegetation of all heights are positively correlated to the areas holding large herds of domestic livestock. Land use types are shown to be the most influential environmental variables in both study areas, independent of season or patterns of precipitation.

40|$|Marine organisms {{at every}} trophic level are {{increasingly}} {{under pressure from}} anthropogenic activities. Conservation of coastal areas is affected by climate and sea level fluctuations, over fishing, pollution and development. Their synergistic and cumulative effects means there is an urgent need to monitor species throughout the generic marine food chain. Designating conservation status can mitigate some of these pressures, {{but in order to}} effectively manage these areas, baseline data is needed. Research has revealed a resident population of Harbour Porpoises Phocoena phocoena in and around the Swansea Bay and Gower area. However, little was known about its status or habitat preference. Using megafauna as bio-indicators of ocean health is well established and while small cetacean abundance surveys have been undertaken around the UK, none have covered these coastal waters. Elsewhere, population numbers have declined sharply and in some areas, wholesale changes in distributional patterns have been documented. Coastal pressures have resulted in habitat degradation, noise, nutrient and chemical pollution and recent observations reveal Bottlenose Dolphin Tursiops truncatus predation. Suggested reasons for this behaviour are infanticide (<b>interspecies</b> eradication) or <b>competition</b> for scarce food resources. In 2006 Carmarthen Bay in Swansea was awarded Special Area of Conservation (SAC) status but its management under the Habitats and Species Directive (Council Directive (92 / 43 /EEC) demands knowledge of habitat use within a species’ range. Successful conservation relies upon the quality of information at the manager’s disposal and it is imperative that population dynamics, critical areas and habitat preferences be identified. Using a combination of vessel and land-based transects, together with focal behavioural studies, Harbour Porpoises were monitored over a three-year period. Further analysis of tidal state, currents, bathymetry and food sources resulted in the identification of critical foraging, nursery and transient habitats. Seasonal distributions were documented and some small-scale on-shore / off-shore movement identified. The management challenge lies in the trans-boundary and mobile nature of cetacea and it is argued that an ecosystem management strategy should be adopted...|$|R
40|$|Despite its {{relatively}} low incidence, Listeria monocyto genes {{is an important}} food borne pathogen due to the seriousness of symptoms in susceptible population groups. Listeria spp. are ubiquitous and are difficult to eradicate from the smallgoods environment. The pathogen is destroyed during heat treatment, however post-processing contamination can occur. Because L. monocyto genes can grow at 4 °C on vacuum- and/or modified atmosphere packed (VP, MAP) smallgoods that typically have a shelf life of six to eight weeks, dangerous growth of the organism can occur {{in the absence of}} control measures. Several international listeriosis outbreaks involving smallgoods attest to this. This thesis investigated the incidence of Listeria spp. in Australian smallgoods, and the influence of <b>interspecies</b> bacterial <b>competition</b> on growth of L. monocytogenes. The first part of this study comprised a survey of 100 smallgoods products to investigate the incidence of L. monocyto genes in Australian processed meats. Although no endogenous L. monocyto genes strains were isolated during this study, other Listeria spp. were occasionally found. This encouraging finding suggests that the increasing application of HACCP and GMP by Australian smallgoods producers has decreased the incidence of L. monocyto genes in processed meats. A substantial part of this thesis investigated the potential control of L. monocyto genes by competition with endogenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The study included exploring the basis of the "Jameson Effect", a phenomenon that occurs when bacteria are grown in mixed cultures and inhibition of growth of all species is observed when one species reaches stationary phase, (i. e. 'maximum population density', MPD, or 'maximum carrying capacity', MCC of the environment). The "Jameson Effect" may be caused by a number of factors including; for example, bacteriocins, organic acids and nutrient depletion. This study explores the role of non-specific factors (i. e. pH and nutrient depletion) in the "Jameson Effect" and, by inference, the importance of species- specific interactions. Endogenous LAB for use in competition studies were isolated from commercial sliced ham and identified. These strains, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Leuconostoc carnosum, are commonly found on VP/MAP processed meats. Another substantial aspect of the thesis was to determine whether nutrient depletion, pH or excreted soluble metabolites could explain the "Jameson Effect" for inhibition of L. monocytogenes (Scott A). The results of the study suggests that competition among bacteria for nutrients is a major factor leading to the "Jameson Effect" and that there is little need to invoke production of species- specific inhibitors to explain the effect. Initial experiments to investigate the nature of the "Jameson Effect" were conducted in simple broth systems. These studies found that low pH and the presence of bacterial metabolites in the broth medium did not reduce MPD in the presence of adequate nutrients. This suggested that the "Jameson Effect" observed in broth systems could simply be symptomatic of nutrient depletion. In support of this conclusion, consistent results were obtained in MAP ham studies undertaken to validate results of the broth studies under realistic commercial conditions. Thus, it was concluded that the role of lactic acid bacteria (which dominate VP/MAP processed meats) should not be underestimated when attempting to understand and control the risk of L. monocyto genes in refrigerated, VP/MAP processed meats...|$|R

Paper 1 analyzes the dynamics in cooking fuel choices among Ghanaian households over the period 2005 and 2013 and further investigate the main forces driving households’ choice of cooking fuel. Evidence from this paper reveals a significant transition from fuelwood use towards LPG over the period. Results also reveal factors such as price, reliability in supply of LPG, income and other household attributes as significant factors influencing households’ choice of a given energy type for cooking. Paper 2 investigates the long and short run demand drivers of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in Ghana and presents a 10 -year forecast of future trends in demand. Results identify income, price and urbanization as the main drivers of demand. Projections from three scenarios suggest that demand for LPG will reach a minimum of 5. 9 million metric tons by the year 2022. Paper 3 examines the causal dynamics among energy use, real GDP and CO₂ emissions in the presence of regime shifts in six emerging African economies. Results confirm the presence of regime shift effects in the long run inter-linkages among energy use, real GDP and CO₂ emissions in the countries considered. This suggests that structural shifts have both economic and environmental effects. Paper 4 develops a stage-structured bioeconomic model to analyze the effects of <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> between roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and fallow deer (Dama dama) on net present value of harvesting, and the associated harvesting strategies. Our analysis shows that unilateral <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> of the fallow deer on the roe deer reduces the marginal benefit of holding an additional individual of both species. Our numerical calculations suggest <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> has a small impact on total net present value, compared to the impact on roe deer population density. Results are also sensitive to assumptions made about trophy prices and discount rate. Inclusion of trophy benefits implies reduced harvest of both young males and females. For the fallow deer, pulse harvesting is optimal, whereas {{this is not the case}} for roe deer. Paper 5 presents an analysis of the hunting lease market in Sweden. The determinants of hunting lease prices are analyzed using spatial and non-spatial hedonic price models. From the hedonic model, the associated hunting values are also derived. Results from the paper suggest the presence of spatial spillovers in lease prices. It also indicate factors such as proximity to urban centers, income, size of the hunting field, and congestion cost as key drivers of hunting lease prices. Further, the results indicate high hunting values for moose and fallow deer...|$|E
40|$|Whoever exists {{belongs to}} a species, which did not become extinct, has a (geno-) type, which should be well adjusted, and lives in a habitat which has been {{sustainable}} for a long time. To capture the first aspect we allow for <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> and analyze the conditions for species survival. The second aspect refers to success in intraspecies competition of (geno-) types as in evolutionary biology and game theory. Survival in inter- and intraspecies competition together with sustainability define ecological stability, a concept which we illustrate by an example of solitary and social grazers who compete for food supply and who are endangered by the same predators. Although our approach is inspired by empirical evidence, no systematic attempt is made to apply it to some specific ecology...|$|E
40|$|International audiencec As a {{ubiquitous}} environmental organism and {{an important}} human pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa readily adapts and responds {{to a wide range}} of conditions and habitats. The intricate regulatory networks that link quorum sensing and other global regulators allow P. aeruginosa to coordinate its gene expression and cell signaling in response to different growth conditions and stressors. Upon nutrient transitions and starvation, as well as other environmental stresses, the stringent response is activated, mediated by the signal (p) ppGpp. P. aeruginosa produces a family of molecules called HAQ (4 -hydroxy- 2 -alkylquino-lines), some of which exhibit antibacterial and quorum-sensing signaling functions and regulate virulence genes. In this study, we report that (p) ppGpp negatively regulates HAQ biosynthesis: in a (p) ppGpp-null (⌬SR) mutant, HHQ (4 -hydroxyl- 2 -hep-tylquinoline) and PQS (3, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -heptylquinoline) levels are increased due to upregulated pqsA and pqsR expression and reduced repression by the rhl system. We also found that (p) ppGpp is required for full expression of both rhl and las AHL (acyl-homoserine lactone) quorum-sensing systems, since the ⌬SR mutant has reduced rhlI, rhlR, lasI, and lasR expression, butanoyl-homoserine lactone (C 4 -HSL) and 3 -oxo-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone (3 -oxo-C 12 -HSL) levels, and rhamnolipid and elastase production. Furthermore, (p) ppGpp significantly modulates the AHL and PQS quorum-sensing hierarchy, as the las system no longer has a dominant effect on HAQ biosynthesis when the stringent response is inactivated. P seudomonas aeruginosa is ubiquitous in the natural environment but is also an important opportunistic pathogen capable of causing severe human infections. This includes wound infections, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and chronic airway infections in individuals with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. In order to survive in this wide range of habitats, from the soil to the human lung, P. aeruginosa must be capable of adapting to stress-inducing and changing environments. Key to its success are the large number of regulators encoded in its genome and an intricate regulatory network that allows P. aeruginosa to coordinate its gene expression and cell signaling in response to environmental conditions (1). The stringent response is a conserved regulatory mechanism mediated by the alarmone (p) ppGpp (penta-and tetra-phos-phorylated guanosine) that coordinates physiological adaptations to nutrient transitions and starvation (e. g., amino acid and carbon) and other environmental stresses. In Gram-negative bacteria, (p) ppGpp is synthesized by RelA (a ribosome-dependent synthetase) and SpoT (a bifunctional synthetase and hydrolase). (p) ppGpp primarily modulates gene transcription with widespread physiologic effects, including downregulation of the trans-lational machinery, cell replication, modulation of metabolic processes, and induction of mechanisms required for stress survival (2, 3). To date, studies of the stringent response in P. aeruginosa have reported a role in virulence (4, 5), resistance to UV radiation (6), and regulation of oxidative defenses (7) and Usp universal stress proteins (8). We recently demonstrated that the stringent response mediates antibiotic tolerance in nutrient-starved and biofilm P. aerugi-nosa (9). This led us to discover that the (p) ppGpp-null (⌬SR) mutant, in which relA and spoT are inactivated, accumulates high levels of HHQ (4 -hydroxy- 2 -heptylquinoline) and PQS (3, 4 -di-hydroxy- 2 -heptylquinoline, or pseudomonas quinolone signal), which are two HAQ (4 -hydroxy- 2 -alkylquinoline) molecules. Interestingly, the ⌬SR mutant is highly sensitive to killing by multiple classes of antibiotics, and abolishing HAQ biosynthesis restores antibiotic tolerance (9), suggesting that proper regulation of HAQ biosynthesis is key to the bacteria's survival under antibiotic stress. HAQs are a family of secondary metabolites sharing a common quinoline ring. These molecules have diverse biological properties and have been implicated in <b>interspecies</b> interactions and <b>competition</b> (10 – 12), iron chelation (13, 14), colony morphology (15), biofilm formation (16), and virulence (17 – 19). PQS is the best-characterized HAQ molecule, which functions as the third quorum sensing signal in P. aeruginosa cell-cell communication (20, 21). When bound to its cognate transcriptional regulator PqsR (also called MvfR), PQS controls the expression of nearly 200 genes involved in virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial defenses (17, 22 – 24). HHQ, the precursor to PQS, can also bind to and activate PqsR, although with much lower affinity than PQS (25, 26). HQNO (4 -hydroxy- 2 -heptylquinoline-N-oxide), has potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria (10, 20, 27). These three molecules constitute the dominant HAQ molecules pr...|$|R
40|$|Summary {{objective}} To {{determine the}} relationship between human lymphatic filariasis, caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, and falciparum malaria, which are co-endemic throughout West Africa. methods We used geographical information systems and spatial statistics to examine the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis in relation to malaria prevalence, mosquito species distributions, vegetation and climate. results A negative spatial association between W. bancrofti and falciparum malaria prevalence exists. <b>Interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> between parasites, seasonality, differences in the distribution and vector competence of Anopheles vectors, agricultural practices and insecticide resistance may be factors driving current (and potentially future) spatial distributions. conclusion Further investigating these factors will become crucial as large-scale lymphatic filariasis and malaria control programmes are implemented in West Africa that may influence the epidemiology of both diseases...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{biodiversity}} - {{ecosystem function}} {{studies have been}} limited to looking at diversity and ecosystem function; the interaction of biodiversity with density and productivity is not so well studied. Similar processes creating positive or negative density effects may also be {{at the base of}} biodiversity effects on productivity. Monocultures of three species of rocky shore macroalgae, Corallina officinalis, Mastocarpus stellatus and Fucus serratus and polycultures of all three species were incubated in seawater mesocosms on the shore at Wembury Point, Devon, UK. The density by mass was manipulated across these treatments in a replacement design. The oxygen concentration of each mesocosm was measured pre- and post-incubation and the change in oxygen concentration per gram of algae per minute (AO 2) was used as a proxy for primary production. High variation in the values of AO 2 was encountered due to diel variation in primary production in macroalgae and natural variation in PAR levels across replications. Despite this variation, a negative relationship was found between density and productivity across monocultures and polycultures due to intra- and <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> for 1 light. Polycultures underyielded in comparison with the most productive monocultures, suggesting a negative effect of inter-species competition that reduced the yield of the most productive species in polycultures. No interaction was found between density and diversity despite competition for light reducing productivity at high levels of density and diversity. Partitioning the effects of intraand <b>interspecies</b> <b>competition</b> was not possible in this study due to the replacement design and the use of AO 2 as the measure of primary production. This study therefore showed the limitations of using replacement designs, field mesocosms and real-time measures of primary production in short temi studies. Nevertheless, this study did clarify the relationships of density, diversity and an ecosystem function, primary production, in different species and mixtures of rocky shore macroalgae.
