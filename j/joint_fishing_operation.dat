40|$|In {{accordance}} with the BASIS program, expeditionary research on the upper epipelagic layers (0 – 50 m) of the western Bering Sea {{was carried out by}} scientists aboard the RV TINRO in autumn 2002 – 2003 and summer 2003. The methods of our investigations are reported by Temnykh et al. (2002). Here, we use trawl catch data from the TINRO surveys to describe the species composition of upper epipelagic fish communities during the period of salmon migrations in the western Bering Sea. In addition, we analyze the results of <b>joint</b> trawl <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> by Russian, Japanese, and U. S. vessels in autumn 2002, and discuss a number of methodological problems revealed by our findings. In autumn, the number of fish species composing upper epipelagic communities was the same in 2002 and 2003 (48 species; 23 – 28 families; Table 1). However, the qualitative composition of species in these years was slightly different. The coefficient of Serensen-Chekanovsky, which is often used for comparing the qualitative composition of fauna (Kafanov and Kudryashov 2000), was 0. 79. In summer 2003, the composition of upper epipelagic communities consisted of 52 species of fish and other nekton. This composition was only slightly different than i...|$|R

This change got accelerated mainly in the mechanised era of the marine fishery sector. Although with the declaration of the EEZ, an area of 2 million sq. km. came into existence in 1977, {{there has never been}} a commercial deepsea fishing worth mentioning. However deepwater trawling conducted by two Mexican trawlers (24 m OAL) imported from the USA in 1972 has paved the way for a humble beginning in the deepsea <b>fishing</b> <b>operations.</b> Gradually by 1982 - 83 about 11 0 chartered and <b>joint</b> venture deepsea <b>fishing</b> vessels began <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> and almost without exception, they exploited mostly the inshore grounds upto 50 m and rarely upto 100 m.

40|$|Abstract—Fisheries {{management}} {{all around}} the world is hampered by the lack, or poor quality, of critical data on fish resources and <b>fishing</b> <b>operations.</b> The main reasons for the chronic inability to collect good quality data during <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> is the culture of secrecy common among fishers and the lack of modern data gathering technology onboard most fishing vessels. In response, OLRAC-SPS, a South African company, developed fisheries data-logging software (eLog in short) and named it Olrac. The Olrac eLog solution is capable of collecting, analysing, plotting, mapping, reporting, tracing and transmitting all data related to <b>fishing</b> <b>operations.</b> Olrac can be used by skippers, fleet/company managers, offshore mariculture farmers, scientists, observers, compliance inspectors and fisheries management authorities. The authors believe that using eLog onboard fishing vessels has the potential to revolutionise the entire process of data collection and reporting during <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> and, if properly deployed and utilised, could transform the entire commercial fleet to a provider of good quality data and forever change the way fish resources are managed. In addition it will make it possible to trace catches back to the actual individual <b>fishing</b> <b>operation,</b> to improve <b>fishing</b> efficiency and to dramatically improve control of <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> and enforcement of fishing regulations.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that these blooms have had a considerableimpact on <b>fishing</b> <b>operations,</b> as this region {{is one of the}} most heavily exploited Mediterranean fishinggrounds. In order to gain a better understanding of the possible economic losses for the Italian NA fishingindustry due to jellyfish impacts, we conducted a survey of fishermen in the city of Chioggia, whichis the main fishing port for the NA basin. The study focused on fishermen’s perceptions about jellyfishblooms in the NA Sea and also investigated whether and how blooms compromised <b>fishing</b> <b>operations.</b> Survey results confirm that blooms have negatively affected <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> in the last few decades. We estimate that economic losses due to reduction in fish catches could amount to as much as D 8. 2 million per year for the Italian NA trawling fleet. Other costs on this fleet include additional fuel costs dueto displacement of <b>fishing</b> <b>operations,</b> which could represent an increase in costs of over D 460, 000 peryear. Moreover, during a jellyfish bloom episode it can happen that time has to be spent by fishermento repair nets damaged by jellyfish caught in them, leading to an estimated cost for the trawling fleetand small scale fisheries of over 89, 000 man-hours per year. This study not only confirms that jellyfishblooms have a considerable impact on <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> but also shows how costly blooms can be forthe NA fisheries...|$|R
