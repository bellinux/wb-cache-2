5|$|In November 2009 Cameron {{and others}} {{distributed}} free copies of an altered version of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species {{on college campuses}} in the United States. The book consisted of Darwin's text with chapters of the book removed, and with an added introduction by Ray Comfort reiterating common creationist assertions about Darwin and evolution. The book was criticized by scientists and Darwin biographers who criticized the omission of key chapters of the book, and who stated that its introduction contains misinformation about Darwin, and long-refuted creationist arguments about the science of evolution, such as the linking of Nazi racial theories to Darwinist ideas. Comfort later said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted {{in order to make}} the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, but that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and <b>glossary</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms.</b> The National Center for Science Education arranged a campaign to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction and a banana bookmark at colleges across the U.S., a reference to Comfort's presentation of the banana as an argument for the existence of God.|$|E

2500|$|The Red Cross Book (as it is unofficially known, for {{the large}} red St George's Cross on its cover) was an A-4-sized {{pamphlet}} sold in Japanese theaters during the release of The End of Evangelion. The book was written by Gainax and various production staff of the Evangelion TV series and films, with an interview with Tsurumaki, a listing of voice actors and brief essays written by them on their respective characters, short biographical sketches, commentary on the TV series and production of the films, a [...] "Notes" [...] section covering {{the setting of the}} films, and a <b>glossary</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> used in the series, manga, and the two films. The Red Cross Book was left out in the Manga Entertainment release due to copyright issues. However, it was translated by fans of the series.|$|E
2500|$|Ciotloş reproached Crime la Elsinore {{for lack}} of subtlety, in the {{presence}} of a [...] "not exactly indispensable" [...] <b>glossary</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> which was published with the book. Although he acknowledges that the writing is [...] "amusing", he also contends that it is [...] "impossible to extend sociologically or connect to some reality", being isolated [...] "in its own world", and displaying [...] "compositional precariousness." [...] He concludes: [...] "A book perfect in its own way, but far from perfection in ours." [...] A similar overview is provided by Burţa-Cernat, who contends that, in taking sides and explaining his intentions, the author adopts [...] "the manner of an untalented journalist", with [...] "see-through" [...] results. She also believes that Gârbea's chief comedic resource is [...] "the cheap anecdote with a trite climax", which she compares with those published by the communist-era magazine Urzica. Additionally, Burţa-Cernat comments on the irony of Cosma's reliance on intertextuality, which she finds similar to Gârbea's own work for the stage. Critic Andrei Terian noted that he disliked almost all the book, because of its author's tendency to humiliate his characters [...] "before us readers are in the least familiarized with them." ...|$|E
