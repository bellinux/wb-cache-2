Males can carry up to 100 eggs on their backs at once. Males care for their eggs by making sure the eggs get enough oxygen and {{protection}} from predators. Since the eggs are so large they can not stay submerged underwater and use diffusion to absorb oxygen available in the water. The males must remain at the air-water interface so that the eggs are provided with enough oxygen, this behavior is called air brooding. Brood pumping and brood stroking are another behaviour males do to increase the water flow over the eggs for better oxygen access. Even though males care for the eggs they will still discard them depending on the egg pad size, age of the male and the presence of females. It has also been found that Males with small egg pads have a temperature dependent <b>discard</b> <b>rate</b> because cooler temperatures mark the end of breeding season so at cool temperature {{they are less likely to}} discard a small egg pad compared to warmer temperatures.|$|E

From late 1995 to early 1999 EDCP observers collected discard data from 235 fishing trips by 25 trawl vessels that voluntarily participated in the program. Besides these observer data, vessels in the program kept enhanced logbooks that recorded retained and discarded catch. These logbooks had data from 866 trips by 44 vessels, including most of the trips with observers. Provided logbook data are acceptably accurate, collecting discard data using logbooks could be a cost-effective supplement to an observer program for measuring <b>discard</b> <b>rates</b> and total <b>discards.</b> Comparisons of tow-by-tow logbook discards with the corresponding observer discards indicated substantial inaccuracies in the logbook information.

Estimating <b>discard</b> <b>rates</b> from length frequency distributions (LFDs) in commercial catches may complement information from observer trips. The accuracy of estimates depends greatly on careful investigation of the discard variability. Here, the impact of three essential factors was quantified for beam-trawl fisheries in the southern North Sea: (i) market prices, (ii) landings per trip (LPT) limitations, and (iii) selectivity of the commercial fishing gear. Observed <b>discard</b> <b>rates</b> for cod, plaice, sole, and whiting were compared with estimates based on length frequency data, taking account of the variability attributable to LPT limitations and market price. Observed discard estimates of cod and whiting differed significantly from LFD-derived estimates because of highgrading.

5000|$|Cape horse {{mackerel}} is a bycatch {{species in the}} offshore demersal trawl, which operates mainly off {{the waters of the}} Western Cape at depths of 110m and deeper. The offshore demersal trawl fishery operates using trawl nets which are dragged behind the boat along the ocean floor at depths from 110 - 800 m. Cape {{horse mackerel}} caught in the midwater trawl fishery are considered to be more sustainable than those caught in the offshore trawl fishery (see Cape horse mackerel assessment for midwater trawl). This fishery primarily targets deepwater hake (Merluccius paradoxus) on soft, sandy bottoms, as well as commercially valuable bycatch species such as kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monkfish (Lophius vomerinus). Although trawling is a highly unselective fishing method, offshore fishing grounds are not generally very biodiverse (i.e. they are only inhabited by a few species) and the <b>discard</b> <b>rate</b> for this fishery is estimated to be 10% of the total catch. However, this fishing method is likely to have significant impacts on bottom habitats and concerns are expressed around the number of seabird mortalities caused during trawling (estimated at 8000 per year). The hake component of the offshore demersal trawl fishery has been certified by the Marine Stewardship Council since 2004, and the current management system for this fishery employs a number of ecosystem-based management measures which address issues such as bycatch, closed areas and benthic habitat impacts. The Cape horse mackerel is managed in terms of a maximum precautionary catch Limit (MPCL). The MPCL has been maintained at 44 000 tonnes in recent years and accommodates both mid-water-directed and bycatch in the hake-directed demersal trawl sector. Juvenile horse mackerel are occasionally targeted on the West Coast where a 5 000 tonnes precautionary catch limit is enforced (the whole small pelagic sector is closed if the limit is exceeded). Despite the absence of direct evidence of ecosystem change, a potential for ecosystem impact exists, as this is an important small pelagic species, and fills a similar ecosystem niche to other small pelagic species such as sardine and anchovy.|$|E

40|$|The Portuguese {{fishery in}} Portugal waters landed its {{greatest}} catches {{in the mid}} 1960 s, and landings have remained lower but steady since then. Purse seines, targeting sardines (Sardina pilchardus), had the highest catches of all fisheries from 1950 - 1999. Fish and cephalopod trawls, crustacean trawls, and multi-gear vessels form the remaining fleets. During the 1990 s, both the catch and value of most target species decreased slightly (except for octopus), due to decreasing fleet sizes in all fisheries. Official Portuguese catch statistics are compatible with ICES landing figures since the late 1980 s. Prior to this period, Portuguese catch statistics are approximately 18 % lower.

Data were collected from the USA mixed species otter trawl fisheries of the Georges Bank-Southern New England region, sampled during 1989 – 92. General linear models for main effects have related <b>discard</b> <b>rates,</b> total catch, and indices of species richness, diversity and evenness to temporal, spatial and operational variables associated with the fishing process (year, month, statistical reporting area, primary species sought, cod-end mesh size, vessel size, tow duration, total catch, total discards and depth). <b>Discarding</b> <b>rates</b> (proportion of the catch discarded) varied significantly both for individual species and for aggregated species by year, area, month, and target species. The effects of cod-end mesh size were variable, and confounded with year-class strength, particularly in the case of yellowtail flounder. Fisheries regulated by minimum fish and mesh sizes (e. g. for flounders and large gadoids) generally exhibited higher average <b>discard</b> <b>rates</b> and more variation than fisheries directed to species without such restrictions (e. g. for small pelagics, skates and others). The species composition and diversity of catches were significant functions of area, year, target species and month, as well as mesh size and tow duration. Year effects were more important for explaining variation in <b>discard</b> <b>rates</b> than total (multispecies) catches. This result is probably because large, partially-recruited year-classes differentially attract effort from other species targets, but most of the fleet landings are composed of mixed catches of species at moderate abundance levels.

40|$|Abstract—A {{fundamental}} {{challenge of}} supporting mutable data replication in a Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{system is to}} efficiently maintain consistency. This paper presents a framework for balanced consistency maintenance (BCoM) in structured P 2 P systems with heterogeneous node capabilities and various workload patterns. Replica nodes of each object are organized into a tree structure for disseminating updates, and a sliding window update protocol is developed for consistency maintenance. We present an analytical model to optimize the window size according to the dynamic network conditions, workload patterns and resource limits. In this way, BCoM balances the consistency strictness, object availability for updates, and update propagation performance for various application requirements. On top of the dissemination tree, two enhancements are proposed: (1) a fast recovery scheme to strengthen the robustness against node and link failures, and (2) a node migration policy to remove and prevent bottlenecks allowing more efficient update delivery. Simulations are conducted using P 2 PSim to evaluate BCoM in comparison to SCOPE [1]. The experimental results demonstrate that BCoM outperforms SCOPE with lower discard rates. BCoM achieves a <b>discard</b> <b>rate</b> as low as 5 % in most cases while SCOPE has almost 100 % <b>discard</b> <b>rate.</b> Index Terms—Peer-to-Peer, consistency, protocol design, simulations. ...|$|E

The results indicate that highgrading occurs in the Icelandic cod fishery for both long-line and net vessels.

Inadequate {{monitoring and reporting}} of <b>discard</b> <b>rates</b> impedes regulatory measures which are in place to allow red snapper populations to reach a healthy, sustainable level. This study documented the relationship between morphometric measurements and otolith analysis of red snapper caught from a recreational headboat fishing exclusively in the GOM?s EEZ of the upper Texas coast. The collected data of this research show that of the 594 red snapper caught within the sample group, 76 % of the fish were discarded; analysis of the lengths of these discarded fish show that 15. 5 % were of regulation size (16 inches) or larger, clear evidence that high-grading is occurring. The effort for {{the total amount of}} red snapper caught by each individual angler within the sample group was measured to determine on average, approximately two red snapper were caught per person, per hour. The size distribution ranged from 16 to 32 inches with a mean total length of 21. 32 inches for retained fish while discarded fish ranged from 5. 5 to 22. 5 inches with a mean of 14. 23. Weight distribution ranged from 1. 5 to 18. 5 pounds with a mean of 5. 81 pounds for retained fish and 0. 20 to 6 pounds with a mean of 1. 57 pounds for discarded fish. Age distribution ranged from 3 to 14 years of age; red snapper can live over 50 years, however relatively none (2. 42 %) older than 10 years were present in the sample, demonstrating a highly truncated population. Because fecundancy increases with age in females, longevity extends reproduction potential for red snapper. Management of reef fishes, and red snapper in particular, are difficult due to variances in growth rates and habitat use, complex population structure, and increasing reproduction levels with maturity. Recommendations for management include implementing an educational outreach program, reducing effort and <b>discard</b> <b>rates,</b> lowing rates of exploitation, and creating a marine reserve. Future research should address the entire Texas coast population of for-hire vessels (charter and headboats) to obtain data on <b>discard</b> <b>rates</b> and age distribution of red snapper...|$|R
40|$|A growing push to {{implement}} catch share fishery programs is based {{partly on the}} recognition that they may provide stronger incentives for ecological stewardship than conventional fisheries management. Using data on population status, quota compliance, discard rates, use of habitat-damaging gear, and landings for 15 catch share programs in North America, I tested the hypothesis that catch share systems lead to improved ecological stewardship and status of exploited populations. Impacts of catch share programs were measured through comparisons of fisheries with catch shares to fisheries without catch shares or by comparing fisheries before and after catch shares were implemented. The average levels of most indicators were unaffected by catch share implementation: only <b>discard</b> <b>rate,</b> which declined significantly in catch share fisheries, showed a significant response. However, catch share fisheries were distinguished by markedly reduced interannual variability in all indicators, being statistically significant for exploitation rate, landings, <b>discard</b> <b>rate,</b> and the ratio of catch to catch quotas. These impacts of catch shares were common between nations and ocean basins and were independent {{of the number of}} years that catch share programs had been in place.

The overall <b>discard</b> <b>rate</b> in terms of catch numbers ranged from 15 % for the Cyclades to 49 % for the Algarve, with the high <b>discard</b> <b>rate</b> for the latter due largely to small pelagic fishes. Discards in the four areas consisted mainly of Trisopterus luscus (Basque country), Scomber japonicus (Algarve), Torpedo torpedo (Cadiz) and Sardina pilchardus (all three areas), and Diplodus annularis in the Cyclades. Strong seasonal variation in discarding was found, reflecting differences in metiers and the versatility of trammel nets as a gear. Discarding, both in terms of numbers of species and individuals decreased with increasing inner panel mesh size. The main reasons for discarding were: (1) species of no or low commercial value (e. g. Scomber japonicus; Torpedo torpedo), (2) commercial species that were damaged or spoiled (e. g. Merluccius merluccius), (3) undersized commercial species (e. g. Lophius piscatorius), and (4) species of commercial value but not caught in sufficient quantities to warrant sale (e. g. Sardina pilchardus). A decrease in soak time together with the appropriate choice of mesh sizes could contribute to a reduction in discarding and to improved sustainability and use of scarce resources in the small-scale, inshore multi-species fisheries of southern Europe.

40|$|Since Clendon has mainly {{addressed}} the linguistic data, I will restrict my {{comments to the}} archaeological {{and other kinds of}} evidence for Late Pleistocene social and demographic changes of relevance to the model. The likely emptying of large parts of central Australia finds some support in the large number of sites with stratigraphic breaks, depositional hiatuses, or very low <b>discard</b> <b>rates</b> during the Last Glacial Maximum (Hiscock 1988; O 2 ̆ 7 Connor, Veth, and Hubbard 1993). Whether these sequences represent a hiatus or just low-density occupation is debatable, with no sign of final resolution of the issue in sight...|$|R
40|$|Quality of Service (QOS) of a {{congested}} network can {{be evaluated}} by some key {{factors such as}} packets <b>discarding</b> <b>rate,</b> queueing delay and the throughput of a bottleneck buffer. A network designer needs to predict these parameters in order to dimension a network properly. This thesis developed a solver for predicting the stability of a TCP network when servers implement Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes. The solver analyzes two AQM schemes. One is Random Early Detection (RED) {{and the other is}} Dynamic Random Early Detection (DRED). We verify the analysis of the solver through the simulation of a small network with multiple bottlenecks carrying a large number of TCP connections...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} archaeological sediments is an {{important}} source of information on how humans lived at a site. Attributes of human site use such as frequency of visits and duration of stay can be explored by measuring changes in phosphorus (determined using X-ray fluorescence) and carbon concentrations in sediments and magnetic susceptibility of sediments in combination with analysis of other sediment attributes, stone artefacts and faunal remains. This study concludes that increases in phosphorus and carbon concentrations and the <b>discard</b> <b>rate</b> of stone artefacts at Marillana A rockshelter in the inland Pilbara, Western Australia, indicate an increase in the frequency of site use with no change in the function of the site. This is interpreted as representative of an increase in regional population density...|$|E
40|$|The new Common Fisheries Policy aims {{to reduce}} the <b>discard</b> <b>rate</b> in Europe, and {{one way in which}} it seeks to achieve this goal is by making it {{compulsory}} to land all species subject to catch limits, and some of species managed by minimum catch size. The characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea raise serious concerns over the viability, efficacy and consequences of these measures, and {{the purpose of this study}} is therefore to analyse these with a view to improving discard management in this region. The Port of Santa Pola was chosen as a reference fishing port in the Spanish Mediterranean for quantitative analysis, comparing all the species caught with those proposed by the CFP. Additionally, a qualitative SWOT analysis was performed, incorporating the views of fishermen, administrators, NGOs, scientists and entrepreneurs on the regulation. The daily <b>discard</b> <b>rate</b> during the period analysed was 11. 7 t (All Species) and 1. 8 t (Regulated Species), with annual discards totalling 2623 t (47. 3 %) (All Species) and 421 t (7. 6 %) (Regulated Species). The regulation was found to have more weaknesses and threats (72. 6 %) than strengths and opportunities (27. 4 %). The governing system should take into consideration the contextualisation of discard management according to the specific characteristics of each métier; coordination between stakeholders; and caution about the ecological cost of landing discards. The high logistical, surveillance, monitoring and ecological costs produce a negative outcome despite the objective pursued, the willingness of the fishing industry to reduce discards and the profitable use of the resource by its proposed end users. This may lead to the measure proving unviable in the Mediterranean Sea and its ensuing failure to reduce discards. The alternatives proposed in this paper may help to improve the management of discards and create more sustainable and profitable fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Introducing {{adaptive}} online {{data compression}} at network-internal nodes is considered for alleviating traffic congestion on the network. In this paper, {{we assume that}} advanced relay nodes, which possess both a relay function (network resource) and a processing function (computational and storage resources), are placed inside the network, and we propose an adaptive online lossless packet compression scheme utilized at these nodes. This scheme selectively compresses a packet according to its waiting time in the queue during congestion. Through preliminary investigation using actual traffic datasets, we investigate the compression ratio and processing time of packet-by-packet compression in actual network environments. Then, by means of computer simulations, we show that the proposed scheme reduces the packet delay time and <b>discard</b> <b>rate</b> and investigate factors necessary in achieving efficient packet relay...|$|E
40|$|Since 2003 a joint UWTV survey {{has been}} carried out by the Marine Institute (Ireland) and AFBI (Northern Ireland).

The world average was 5.7 pounds for every pound of shrimp. Trawl nets in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, {{have been identified as}} sources of mortality for species of finfish and cetaceans. Bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea, and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions. Worldwide, shrimp trawl fisheries generate about 2% of the world's catch of fish in weight, but result in more than one third of the global bycatch total.|$|R
40|$|Discards {{refer to}} that part of the catch {{returned}} to the sea during fishing operations. This study assesses the consequences, causes, and potential solutions to the discard problem using the example of North Sea fisheries. Fishermen's immediate objectives during fishing operations and the low confidence in projected gains from discard reduction measures have promoted use of unselective trawls while the poor enforcement of the quota system has exacerbated discard quantities. It is concluded that a reduction in <b>discard</b> <b>rates</b> is required for a long-term solution to the ecological and economic costs of discarding and the development of fishing opportunity incentives can promote the use of more selective fishing techniques.
