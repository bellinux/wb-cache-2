25|$|During WWII, all of {{the major}} {{manufacturers}} of coin-operated games turned to the manufacture of equipment for the war effort. Some companies, like Williams, bought old games from operators and refurbished them, adding new artwork with a patriotic theme. At the end of the war, a <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> looked for amusement in bars and malt shops, and pinball saw another golden age. Improvements such as the tilt mechanism and free games (known as replays) appeared.|$|E
25|$|Robert Bork's America {{is a land}} {{in which}} women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at {{segregated}} lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and {{the doors of the}} Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy... President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> No justice would be better than this injustice.|$|E

500|$|While Bushnell’s {{name is not}} {{generally}} well-known, he is often credited with revolutionizing naval warfare from below. Bushnell’s Turtle created a military vantage point unseen prior to the Revolutionary War—a view from under the war-stricken waters. As historian Alex Roland argues, Bushnell’s legacy as an inventor was also burnished by American writers and historians who in the early nineteenth-century lionized Bushnell and his submarine. To a new postwar <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans,</b> he seemed “the ingenious patriot who invented the submarine that terrified the British.” [...] Bushnell {{joined the ranks of}} American inventors of the era such as Eli Whitney and Robert Fulton. [...] These men served as national heroes to Americans who advocated for technological advances and idolized the men making them. “Whether the motives were military pride or scientific nationalism,” Roland contends, “it was important to Americans in the first half century after the Revolution to look upon Bushnell’s submarine as an American original.|$|E
500|$|By 1850 {{and with}} the {{publication}} of Hurry-Graphs, Willis was becoming a forgotten celebrity. In August 1853, future President James A. Garfield discussed Willis's declining popularity in his diary: [...] "Willis {{is said to be a}} [...] man, although an unrivaled poet. How strange that such men should go to ruin, when they might soar perpetually in the heaven of heavens". After Willis's death, obituaries reported that he had outlived his fame. One remarked, [...] "the man who withdraws from the whirling currents of active life is speedily forgotten". This obituary also stated that Americans [...] "will ever remember and cherish Nathaniel P. Willis as one worthy to stand with Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving". In 1946, the centennial issue of Town & Country reported that Willis [...] "led a <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> through a gate where weeds gave way to horticulture". More modern scholars have dismissed Willis's work as [...] "sentimental prattle" [...] or refer to him only as an obstacle in the progress of his sister as well as Harriet Jacobs. As biographer Thomas N. Baker wrote, Willis is today only referred to as a footnote in relation to other authors.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{made his}} first post-illness public {{appearance}} on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors. Though additionally ill from an attack of kidney stones and {{against the advice of}} some associates, Kennedy insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, [...] "It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing– nothing– is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight." [...] He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, [...] "this November, the torch will be passed again to a new <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> So, with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on." [...] The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience, as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.|$|E

[...] Quayle was not a seasoned politician, however, and made a number of embarrassing statements. The Dukakis team attacked Quayle's credentials, saying he was [...] "dangerously inexperienced to be first-in-line to the presidency." ...|$|E

With geographic and cultural roots in the Mississippi Delta, Foote's life and writing paralleled the radical shift from the agrarian planter system of the Old South to the Civil Rights era of the New South. Foote was little known {{to the general public}} until his appearance in Ken Burns's PBS documentary The Civil War in 1990, where he introduced a <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> to a war that he believed was [...] "central to all our lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the war, Sevareid {{continued}} to work for CBS. He began his own program, Eric Sevareid and the News, June 27, 1942, on CBS. It ran 8:55-9 p.m. (Eastern Time) on Saturdays and Sundays. In 1946 he reported on {{the founding of the}} UN and then penned Not So Wild a Dream. The book, whose title comes from part of the closing passage of Norman Corwin's radio play [...] "On a Note of Triumph", appeared in eleven printings and became one of the primary sources on the lives of the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> who had lived through the Great Depression, only to confront the horrors of World War II. In the 1976 edition of the book, Sevareid wrote, [...] "It was a lucky stroke of timing to have been born and lived as an American in this last generation. It was good fortune to be a journalist in Washington, now the single news headquarters in the world since ancient Rome. But we are not Rome; the world is too big, too varied." ...|$|E

Clinton and Gore spent the day at Ygnacio Valley High School, as part of the drive to connect California public schools to the Internet. In a speech given at YVH, Clinton stated that he was excited to see that his {{challenge}} the previous September to [...] "Californians to connect at least 20 percent of your schools to the Information Superhighway {{by the end of this}} school year" [...] was met. Clinton also described this event as part of a time of [...] "absolutely astonishing transformation; a moment of great possibility. All of you know that the information and technology explosion will offer to you and to the young people of the future more opportunities and challenges than any <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> has ever seen." [...] In a prepared statement, Gore added that NetDay was part of one of the major goals of the Clinton administration, which was [...] "to give every child in America access to high quality educational technology by the dawn of the new century." [...] Gore also stated that the administration planned [...] "to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2000." [...] On April 28, 1998, Gore honored numerous volunteers who had been involved with NetDay and [...] "who helped connect students to the Internet in 700 of the poorest schools in the country" [...] via [...] "an interactive online session with children across the country." ...|$|E

The crisis of the national history of the American community, the war between Union and Secession, was essentially a crisis between {{the great state of}} the new age and the local feeling of an earlier period. But Union triumphed. Americans live now in a generation that has almost forgotten that there once seemed a possibility that the map of North America might be broken up at last into as many communities as the map of Europe. Except by foreign travel, the present <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> can have no idea of the net of vexations and limitations in which Europeans are living at the present time because of their political disunion.|$|E
