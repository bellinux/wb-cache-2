O presente projeto teve por objetivo o desenvolvimento de uma {{interface}} adaptativa (IA), de modo a atender essa necessidade presente, estimulando os alunos ao estudo e facilitando o processo de ensino aprendizagem. O espaço virtual desenvolvido neste caso foi um site. Foram construídas três abas destinadas a três grupos de usuário: Básico (Ensino Fundamental), Médio (Ensino Médio) e Avançado (Ensino Superior). Todas as abas da IA tratam do tema "proliferação celular", no entanto, foram utilizados recursos e linguagem adaptados a cada nível. Para avaliação do recurso, o site foi aplicado para estudantes do ensino fundamental de escolas adventistas (4 classes - 117 alunos), do ensino médio do Colégio COTUCA (4 classes - 131 alunos) e do ensino superior para o curso de Ciências Biológicas da Unicamp (2 classes - 95 alunos). Todos os grupos foram divididos randomicamente em: experimental (recebe a aula com a IA) e controle (aula convencional sobre o mesmo assunto). Vale ressaltar que os estudantes do grupo controle também tiveram aula com a IA, após a avaliação da mesma. Antes da aplicação da IA, os estudantes responderam a um pré-teste para verificar os conhecimentos prévios e analisar a homogeneidade entre as turmas. Após a aplicação da aula com e sem a interface, todos os estudantes responderam a um pós-teste e construíram um mapa conceitual. Além destes instrumentos, as avaliações formais da disciplina também foram utilizadas para verificar a eficácia da IA. Entrevistas foram realizadas com os estudantes e uma carta avaliativa solicitada aos professores. Aplicando ANOVA (one way) aos resultados dos pré-testes, foi possível verificar que não houve diferença significativa entre as turmas do ensino médio (p= 0. 49), do ensino fundamental (p= 0. 92) e do ensino superior (p= 0. 09). Quando comparados os pós-testes, percebeu-se diferença significativa entre os grupos controle e experimental de todos os níveis (p. Three tabs {{were built}} for three user groups: Basic (Elementary School), Medium (High School) and Advanced (College). All AI tabs {{had the same}} subject, cell proliferation. However, adapted resources and language were used for each model. For evaluation of the resource developed, the site was used with elementary school students from Adventist Schools (4 classes - 117 students), high school students from COTUCA school (4 classes - 131 students) and Higher Education students of the Biological Sciences course from Unicamp (2 classes - 95 students). All groups were randomly divided into experimental (receiving class with AI) and control groups (conventional lecture of the same subject). It is important to stress that students {{in the control group}} also had class with the AI, but only after the evaluation. Before the implementation of the AI, students answered a pre-test to verify the previous knowledge and examine whether there were differences between the groups. After applying the lesson, with and without the interface, all students answered a post-test and built a conceptual map. In addition to these instruments, formal evaluations of the course were also used to verify the effectiveness of the AI. Interviews were conducted with students and an <b>evaluation</b> <b>letter</b> was requested to the teachers. Applying ANOVA (one way) to the results of the pre-tests, we found that {{there was no significant difference}} between the high school (p = 0. 49), the basic education (p = 0. 92) and the college groups (p = 0. 09). Comparing the post-test results, we noticed a significant difference between the control and experimental groups at all levels (p < 0. 05), demonstrating that students who had classes with the interface did get better grades. When evaluating the conceptual maps, we found that maps from the control groups had a higher degree of generality, ie, are less specific and contain less concepts in comparison with the experimental groups maps. There was also a smaller amount of connective propositions on the maps from the control groups, reducing the number of inter-linkages in the structure. The evaluation letters by the teachers showed approval and interest to apply the AI in other opportunities. Thus, we conclude that this suggestion of innovating the classes and the methodology currently applied, using the AI, besides of encouraging the students to study in a more active and participative way, it motivated the teachers, and therefore facilitated the teaching-learning process in both directions...|$|E

40|$|Transcription begins] Saturday night 12 / 9 / 44 My darling, Although it is 10 p. m. and I {{am ready}} to go to bed since I’m very tired and sleepy, I can’t seem to get to sleep without writing you a letter. It seems I haven’t given you my nightly kiss through mail! The Landham Act {{appropriated}} more funds to the county gov’t Cleve. Bd. of Educ. to set up a nursery school at 2936 Mayfield Rd. That is, the state of Ohio refused to give this private nursery at the above address a license. It recommended that Landham Act give county (since it is Cleve. Hts. —it has to be county) full charge of this nursery. So, Fed’l bought out this private person operating this nursery without a license and “we” took over. Just about this time True Sister[s] # 30 discovered a 7, 000 surplus in their treasury and voted to invest it in a welfare organization, and therefore, decided that this nursery on Mayfield should be their project. However, they cannot do anything except ask us to use their trained volunteers and offer their services and money to us. Federal, state and county takes care of everything until after the war, when this nursery will be turned over to be run by True Sisters. Therefore, our nursery is called True Sister[s] Day Care Center. All nurseries after the war will be taken over by other organizations, unless Cleveland (by taxes) can afford to keep them up or raise the fees! This, I’m sure, is not too clear a picture, but it should give you some idea of how my job came about. Well, Mrs. Bennett had given me such a beautiful monthly <b>evaluation</b> <b>letter</b> that they asked me to be head teacher, director, {{or whatever you want to}} call it. I am now the youngest head teacher on the payroll! 160. 00 every 4 wks. plus 5 raise every 6 mos. So I took the job knowing I was getting a tremendous project, but not quite realizing how tremendous. The house was absolutely, positively the dirtiest, filthiest place I have ever been in. The people living there moved out a day after we took over. They used to live on the second floor and run a disgusting, ill-equipped nursery on the first floor. You can imagine how dirty it is if the place had to be fumigated, and then there was so damm [sic] much trash in the attic, the Fed’l didn’t even think it could be cleaned, so the attic was merely bolted! The basement, with the help of two men, 4 colored girls, we finally got cleaned out! I had to wash and sterilize all the toys and equipment, supervise the going over of the lights, gas, furnace, telephone, plumbing, etc. Had to order food and equipment and had to supervise all the housecleaning and keep track of all the bills and the time sheet[s]. Well, honey, I’ve been working 9 and 10 hrs. a day. You can see it is really a job! Monday morning we open up with merely 4 children. We will have no more than 10 children for the next 2 or 3 weeks since there is alot [sic] of work to be down [sic]. They are scraping and sanding the floors so that linoleum can be put from corner to corner on the first floor. Enclosed is a diagram of the house and what the rooms shall be used for as far as we can see now. The quota of children for this nursery is 35. Although it is considered a large house, it is not a large nursery school except for the yard. That’s tremendous. Mike, the handy man for the Cleve. Bd. will tend my furnace and do my odd jobs. He’s a wonderful person, very accomodating [sic] and deserves every penny he makes. He makes 1. 25 an hr. and lunch. My cook, Mrs. Kramer, is German, and still believes the Germans are not as bad as the Japs. However, I don’t plan to keep her long as she hates to work and is always making coffee and eating all the food herself. However, cooks are hard to get, so I’ll hang on until another one shows up. She makes 70 cents an hr. and lunch. My housekeeper, Mrs. Holley, a colored woman, who is deaf, is a gem! She’s a hard worker, and I know it so I’m willing to be very accommodating to her. She makes 60 cents an hr. plus lunch. Monday, she can chose [sic] one of the colored girls who have been coming in as her ass’t housekeeper! The colored girls who came into work are, as a whole, pretty good workers, but darn, if they don’t try to get everything they can out of you and always act meek and bow before you. However, remember, I’m dealing with quite a low-type colored girl! Miss Ingram, my ass’t, who is a student at Reserve, is from Alabama, 24 yrs. old, but she’s been up north for quite awhile. So far, she seems very, very nice, but doesn’t know a whole lot about nursery technique. Next week, a Mrs. Hornung, aged 40, former kingergarten [sic] teacher will start to work. She’s suppose[d] to know her stuff! The hardest part of my job so far is learning how to manage all this help, start a nursery school from scratch, and keep those dammnable [sic] books! Today, I was suppose[d] to get a ½ day off, but couldn’t do it. I merely ran down and got my hair set and took some books back to the library. Then I went right back to the nursery. When I got home, 6 : 30, I had planned to eat, wrap a package to mail to you, and write letters, but I had so much bookkeeping to do that I only wrapped a package for you, did my bookkeeping and now, I’m writing this letter to you. Honey, I’m really worn out! Heard from Helen Curley today and also from Melnikoff. Nothing real new. I’ll put their letters in an envelope and mail them to you for three cents after I answer them. Have you been receiving all the other letters I sent you from friends? I wrapped you a package (it can’t be over 5 lbs.) and I’ll try and mail it Monday. I enclosed another roll of film (127), some stationary [sic], soap, tuna fish, prunes and nuts. That’s all we had around the house, and I haven’t had the time to shop to send you anything else. All the stuff is wrapped in the front page of the Cleve P. D. and you’ll find something about the 9 th Army in every paper! Oh yes, I also sent you some Marlin razor blades. Mort’s letters must have been tied up in the Xmas mailing. We finally got two letters from him. Last one was dated 12 / 6 and he is still here and having fun with USC gals! He’s lucky and I hope his luck holds! I just weighed myself. You might be interested to know that I’ve been off the diet about 3 to 4 weeks now and my weight is 125 lbs. tonight, and it hasn’t seemed to go over 128 lbs. in ages! Everyone is angry with me that I don’t call and visit with them, but honestly, sweetheart, I just can’t seem to find the time. The thing that “galls” me is when some of my mothers’ friends say to me, “Take is [sic] easy, the war will soon be over and your husband will soon be home. ” And when I asked Mrs. Hecht to do some volunteer work at the nursery, she said, “I’m doing enough for the war effort running my home without a maid. ” Nuts+++++++++++!!!!!! Personally, I don’t even feel I’m doing enough for the war effort!! If I had more time I’d like to do lots more things! The above is the one thing I hold against both yours and my family. And that is the hardest adjustment I’ve had to make to both families now—they don’t really understand the seriousness of this war and how a person must do their part! We are so complacent in this country. Now your family just cries because they have one son overseas, and yet, rarely if ever do anything to make the war end sooner. But that’s the way it goes—in Am. we haven’t felt the war as yet—only a few handful [sic] of families have! My darling, I love you so much. Tonight I don’t feel I could go on if I knew you weren’t somewhere [sic] so that at least I could pour out my heart to you. Honey, if you did not exist, I couldn’t either. Your [sic] everything I have—and more!! No matter what I do I feel you at my side discouraging or encouraging me on an enterprise. I adore you, my beloved! Sometimes our love seems so mighty that I think we two could catch the world on our hands and tell them, love thy neighbor and you shall be mighty, too! Love is the most wonderful thing in the world—and love of me for you and you for me is heaven itself! I’m thinking of you every hour, every minute, every second of the day and night! Edith Midnite—just ready to get into bed—was talking to Mom and Dad 2 ̆ 6 wasting time—an old Speert trait! So I’ll get up early tomorrow to get things [done]. [Transcription ends...|$|E
50|$|On 13 June 2013, the U.S. Army {{formally}} cancelled the Individual Carbine competition. The Army said {{none of the}} carbines evaluated during testing met {{the minimum}} scoring requirement needed to continue to {{the next phase of}} the <b>evaluation.</b> <b>Letters</b> were sent to gunmakers involved to inform them that no future contract awards would be made for the soldier evaluation phase. PEO Soldier reported that no competitor demonstrated a significant improvement in weapon reliability to justify buying a new carbine. Weapons tested also had low reliability performance using M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds (EPR). Ultimately, the Army decided not to pursue a new carbine because of consideration of operational requirements in the context of available small arms technology, the constrained fiscal environment, and the capability of their current carbines. One reliability requirement that was not reached by the vendors was firing 3,592 mean rounds without malfunctioning. In 1990, the M4 was required to fire 600 mean rounds between stoppages, while the current M4A1 fires 1,691 mean rounds between stoppages using M855A1 ammunition. PEO Soldier said that the new carbine had to be a superior improvement, not a small improvement. The Army has not released how close the competitors came to reaching the mean rounds between stoppages requirement, or how they performed compared to the M4A1.

Northwestern found no basis for the complaint. [...] Transgender professors Lynn Conway and Deirdre McCloskey filed a complaint against Bailey with Illinois state regulators, alleging that he practiced psychology without a license by providing brief case <b>evaluation</b> <b>letters</b> suggesting candidacy for sex reassignment surgery; however, the department did not pursue those allegations, as he did not accept remuneration for the services and therefore did not violate the law. [...] At least two women who said they were subjects in his book filed a complaint with Northwestern alleging that Bailey committed scientific misconduct by not informing them that they were to be the subjects of research used in the writing of his book. Northwestern did investigate this allegation. [...] Although the findings of that investigation were not released, Northwestern's Vice President for Research, C. Bradley Moore, said, [...] "The allegations of scientific misconduct made against Professor J. Michael Bailey do not fall under the federal definition of scientific misconduct." [...] and that the university [...] "has established a protocol to help ensure that Professor Bailey's research activities involving human subjects are conducted in accordance with the expectations of the University, the regulations and guidelines established by the federal government and with generally accepted research standards." [...] Bailey says that he did nothing wrong and that the attacks on him were motivated by the desire to suppress discussion of the book's ideas about transsexualism, especially autogynephilia. Alice Dreger, a bioethicist, published an account of the controversy in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. According to Dreger, the allegations of misconduct could accurately be described as [...] "harassment", and an [...] "anti-Bailey campaign". Dreger wrote that of the four women who complained to Northwestern, two acknowledged that they were aware they would be included in Bailey's book in their letter to the university. The other two were not described in the book. Dreger also reported that while there was no definitive evidence to refute the allegation of sexual misconduct, datestamps on e-mails between Bailey and his ex-wife indicated that he was at her home looking after their two children at the time the misconduct was said to have occurred. The journal published in the same issue 23 commentaries regarding multiple aspects of the controversy, including criticism of Dreger's analysis.|$|R

[...] PEO Soldier said that the new carbine had to be a superior improvement, not a small improvement. [...] The Army has not released how close the competitors came to reaching the mean rounds between stoppages requirement, or how they performed compared to the M4A1. [...] That information is seen as proprietary, and may be up to the manufacturers to release data. [...] Analysis has not yet been done to determine if any exact event cause per vendor led to performance failures.|$|R
5000|$|Burns' {{academic}} {{family moved}} frequently. Among places they called home were Saint-Véran, France; Newark, Delaware; and Ann Arbor {{where his father}} taught at the University of Michigan. Burns' mother {{was found to have}} breast cancer when he was three and she died when he was 11, a circumstance that he said helped shape his career; he credited his father-in-law, a psychologist, with a significant insight: [...] "He told me that my whole work was an attempt to make people long gone come back alive." [...] Well-read as a child, he absorbed the family encyclopedia, preferring history to fiction. Upon receiving an 8 mm film movie camera for his 17th birthday, he shot a documentary about an Ann Arbor factory. He graduated from Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor in 1971. Turning down reduced tuition at the University of Michigan, he attended Hampshire College, an alternative school in Amherst, Massachusetts, where students are graded through narrative <b>evaluations</b> rather than <b>letter</b> grades and where students create self-directed academic concentrations instead of choosing a traditional major. He worked in a record store to pay his tuition.|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence to show}} that exposure to nature positively affects health and well-being of individuals in society. This paper is based on the evaluation of Eet Nature Feed Your Senses (LNFYS), an English project to encourage people with disabilities, from areas of high social deprivation, and older people to access and enjoy the natural environment through sensory-rich farm visits. The evidence of positive health and well-being impacts from the project is assessed, and the wider implications for policy and practice are discussed. Qualitative data from 38 follow-up interviews conducted with group leaders one to six months after a visit; testimonies and quotes from visit <b>evaluation</b> forms and <b>letters</b> and comments received by host fanners; and a focus group with 10 group leaders were analysed. The results revealed that enhanced mental well-being and social inclusion were consistently reported as a benefit of the farm visit. Participants particularly referred to the calming impact of the farm environment; an increase in self-esteem and independence; improvements in memory function and reminiscence ability; and increased communication. The paper concludes that whilst there is a clear benefit and demand for such on-farm experiences, in order to secure future funding evidence of their economic impacts and longitudinal follow-up studies of benefits are required...|$|R
40|$|Even quite recent {{critical}} <b>evaluations</b> of the <b>letters</b> Pope {{published in}} his own lifetime have continued to remain obstinately rooted, whether consciously or not, in the moral indignation experienced by Pope's Victorian editors on their discovery {{that he had not}} only surreptitiously engineered the publication of a selection of his letters but also had mis¬ directed a number of letters, conflated or spliced or even fabricated others. This thesis holds that the response of moral indignation is not only generally misleading and unproductive but unfair. It arises from three areas of shortsightedness. There is, first, the failure firmly to place Pope's letters in the humanist tradition of the published 'familiar' letter dating from Cicero, through Pliny and Seneca, up to the letters of the Renaissance humanists, Erasmus and Petrarch. Second, there is the failure to appreciate sufficiently the revival of interest in the familiar letter whic'h, in seventeenth and eighteenthcentury Britain, precipitated a great number of diverse experiments in the letter form. And, third, Pope's own motives in publishing a selection of his letters have either been described too cynically, as compounded in the idea that vanity alone drove him to this step, or the letters them¬ selves have not been seen, as Pope undoubtedly meant them to be, in the context of his other published work. This thesis will seek to redress the balance or, at least, to pave the way towards a more balanced appraisal of the literary achievement the published letters represent by focusing on these three largely neglected areas...|$|R
40|$|This section {{presents}} abstracts {{of three}} studies on how consumer choices can {{be influenced by}} the name letter effect of brands without decision makers being aware of this influence. The first paper examined whether making brand names similar to consumers' names increases the likelihood that consumers will choose the brand. One prediction is that people will prefer and be more likely to choose products or services whose names prominently feature the letters in their own first or last names. The results showed that subjects' preference rankings and <b>evaluations</b> of name <b>letter</b> matching brands were higher than those of non-name letter matching brands. The second paper tested the possibility of using subliminal priming to activate a concept that a persuasive communicator could take advantage of. To examine the idea, two experiments were presented. In the first experiment, participants' level of thirst were manipulated and then subliminally presented them with either thirst-related words or control words. While the manipulations had no effect on participants' self-reported, conscious ratings of thirst, there was a significant interactive effect of the two factors on how much of the drink provided in the taste test was consumed. In a second, follow up experiment, thirsty participants were subliminally presented with either thirst-related words or control words after which they viewed advertisements for two new sports beverages. In conclusion, the research demonstrates that under certain conditions, subliminal printing techniques can enhance persuasion. The third paper hypothesized that the lack of correlations between implicit and explicit evaluations is due to measurement error...|$|R
40|$|Presenter Abstract: The {{proportion}} of adults with a postsecondary credential is not {{keeping pace with}} national needs, and the U. S. is falling behind other industrialized countries in this respect. In Massachusetts, recent research estimates that 68 % {{of jobs in the}} state will require postsecondary education by 2018 although currently only 53. 4 % of working‐age adults hold degrees. The Vision Project, a new statewide initiative in Massachusetts, articulates the most important contributions of public higher education to the Commonwealth and holds public higher education accountable for a high level of achievement in this work. The overarching goals of The Vision Project are for the state to produce the besteducated citizenry and workforce in the nation and to be a national leader in research that drives economic development. In this interactive session, participants will review and discuss the charge of the Vision Project’s Working Group on Graduation and Student Success Rates which includes recommending graduation and student success goals, reviewing campus goals and plans, and prioritizing statewide policies and practices. Presenter Abstract: The Commission on Institutions of Higher Education (New England Association of Schools and Colleges), which accredits institutions in New England, has implemented a number of efforts to bring more emphasis and evidence in addressing student success. These efforts include revisions of the Standards for Accreditation, workshops supporting a focus on student success as part of periodic reviews, “Data First” and “Student Success” forms completed and referenced a part of these reviews, evaluator training addressing evidence of student success within on‐site <b>evaluations,</b> and commission <b>letters</b> that target these matters. These efforts respond to external pressures primarily at the federal level, and internal pressures within institution in New England to focus on student success. This session will enable participants to review and discuss the potential of these initiatives...|$|R

The problem {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between the method of composition and the quality of writing. The study also examined the interrelationship among word processing experience, method of composition, and quality of business writing. The purpose of the study was to produce research results to assist business communication teachers, budget administrators, and business writers. The results will assist them in determining the extent to which they will integrate computer-related composition activities into their business communication courses and offices. The study, which was conducted during fall semester, 1987, at the University of North Texas, used a posttest-only control group design, with a pretest to equate groups. It included 104 students enrolled in the introductory business communication course. Half of the students composed a business letter by hand and half did so using WordPerfect word processing software. The students' letters were then graded using a <b>letter</b> <b>evaluation</b> form containing 17 business writing quality categories. T-Tests were conducted to determine if significant differences existed at the. 05 level in the 17 quality categories when: (1) handwritten letters were compared to those composed using word processing; (2) letters composed by students using word processing with previous word processing experience were compared to letters composed by students using word processing with no previous word processing experience; (3) letters composed by students using word processing with previous word processing experience were compared to handwritten letters; and (4) letters composed by students using word processing with no previous word processing experience were compared to handwritten letters. Overall, significant differences did not exist in the quality of letters composed by hand when compared to those composed using word processing. Very few differences existed between the quality of letters composed by students using word processing with previous word processing experience and students using word processing with no previous word processing experience. This was also the case when the quality of letters composed by students using word processing with and without previous word processing experience were compared to handwritten letters...|$|R

The study was designed (1) to determine the types of errors found in Nepali government and non-government letters and to compare between the 1975 and 1980 samples, and (2) to identify frequently used Nepali letter styles and formats. The sample consisted of 242 letters collected in 1975 and 204 letters collected in 1980. All letters were assessed by the same evaluator by using a Nepali <b>Letter</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Instrument, which was validated by a jury of judges. The reliability of the instrument was tested by evaluating the same 20 letters at two different time intervals. Twenty-four separate error categories classified as content, language, and mechanics were identified. Statistical comparisons were made assessing errors in each of 24 separate error categories between the 1975 and 1980 samples. Errors occurring in correspondence from different types of organizations were also compared. Eleven null hypotheses were tested by using Chi-square statistics and Fisher's Exact Test. Descriptive data concerning letter styles, formats, and stationery sizes were also evaluated. Based on the findings of the study, the following conclusions were made: (1) The quality of Nepali letters written in 1980 was approximately the same as the quality of those written in 1975. Of the 24 error categories compared, spelling and margin usages in 1980 improved, punctuation usages deteriorated, and the other 21 categories remained the same. (2) Within various type of organizations, letter writers in 1980 made about the same number of errors in their out-going letters as in 1975. Over 85 percent of the error categories remained unchanged. Fewer margin and spacing errors occurred. Punctuation usages deteriorated. Strikeovers and handwritten corrections occurred less frequently in letters from some types of organizations, but deteriorated in letters from other types of organizations. (3) When usage was compared between organizations, error categories differed in more categories than when it was compared within organizations. Some types of errors occurred more frequently in selected organizations. Letter writers from governmental agencies made more errors in their letter writing than writers from other organizations. Letter writers from semi-government corporations committed the next most frequent number of errors. (4) The ten most frequently occurring errors found in Nepali letters collected in 1975 and 1980 were margin errors, spelling errors, very long sentences, strikeovers, inappropriate words, stereotyped language, too many connectives, errors crossed out, and incorrect word-divisions. (5) Compared to content errors, language errors and mechanical errors occurred more frequently. (6) The typical and most frequently used letter style was the simplified style with salutation and complimentary closing omitted. This style also placed the writer's identification either {{in the middle of the}} paper or on the right hand side. Governmental agencies were the largest users of the Simplified letter style. (7) Salutations and complimentary closings were used by writers from banks, other non-profit organizations, and private businesses. The trend in 1980 was toward using salutations and complimentary closings. (8) Letter placement and margins suggested by Nepali typewriting textbooks were not followed by a majority of the Nepali letter writers. Left and right margins were too small and bottom margins were too wide. (9) The sizes of the stationery were widely diversified. The letter placement appeared awkward because of variations in paper size. Recommendations of this study, if implemented, should strengthen training programs for office personnel in Nepal...|$|R
40|$|This work {{arose from}} 20 years’ {{involvement}} with an Industry Training Advisory Board in Tasmania, Australia. The board’s primary {{role was to}} provide advice to the appropriate authorities on the provision of vocational education and training to the agricultural sector and rural industries in Tasmania and Australia. The Kangan Report in 1973 was the catalyst {{for the development of}} vocational training in Australia. This research examined how state and federal governments have implemented the vocational education and training agenda and embraced the development of skills training and its delivery, particularly as it relates to rural communities and rural industries. It seeks to undertake a critical analysis of vocational education and training (VET) policy, processes and development in relation to Australian rural communities and their rural and related industries in order to ascertain how they can best influence VET policy settings and implementation for the future. This was based on an assumption that Australian rural industries and rural communities have had little influence during the past 25 years on the development on VET policy, except where policy issues have been of national significance and then policy makers have sought guidance from this constituency. Critically it seeks to establish the key criteria to enable policy, processes and implementation to occur that benefit rural communities and industries and considers potential policy settings to reflect effective input. The first part of Chapter 2 provides an overview of the development of agriculture and rural communities in Australia from 1788 to 2000. This is followed by a section which consider the development of VET policy in Australia from 1945 to 2004, with particular reference to federal and state government reports and enquiries. It reflects on how these reports influenced the implementation of VET and the skills agenda in a rural context. It also reflects on the issue of competition in education funding, the debate between academic and technical, and the ongoing issue of old versus new industries and how this then impacts on rural communities and rural industries with particular reference to their implementation in a Tasmanian context. Chapter 3 is {{a review of the literature}} which has identified a number of themes relevant to the delivery of vocational education and training. These themes discuss the importance of leadership, advocacy, boundary crossers, adult learning and social capital, together with the political context, which may provide opportunities for a community to influence educational delivery. The research was based on qualitative methodology and a case study approach. The research uses document analysis and an interview process to collect data which was analysed for themes. Three case studies were identified as the result of the document analysis. Documents analysed consisted of a set of primary documents, particularly the Tasmanian Rural Industry Training Board (TRITB) minutes, which included advice, papers and ministerial pronouncements from state and federal governments, and <b>letters,</b> <b>evaluations</b> and input from various state and federal organisations. The cases were selected to provide an opportunity to consider different contexts in which vocational education and training was delivered. The three case studies considered in this research are the introduction of “a new taxation system and the goods and services tax” in 2000; the development, implementation and introduction of the national rural traineeship in 1994, and the direction by Australia’s education and training minister in 1996 that the “time serving apprenticeship system” was to be replaced by a nationally imposed vocational training regime founded on competency based outcomes. The document analysis identified key personnel who were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. To limit bias, those selected represented all the various groups who were involved in the case studies, as identified in the document analysis. The key finding from this research relates to the issue of boundary crossers; the research finds that both organisations and individuals can act as boundary crossers. The board represented a collection of individuals who were able to influence VET policy by developing collaboration and partnerships across defined boundaries. It also indicates that effective boundary crossers—whether organisations or individuals—need to have influential skills, particularly in leadership and advocacy. This allowed information and ideas to be facilitated across two domains. Importantly the research shows that organisations and institutions as well as individuals had an important role to play in advancing the VET agenda. In turn this assisted in raising the social capital in rural communities and related industries. Other implications from this research for VET policy development are how this approach may be of interest to central policy makers and local agencies who interact with the centre, how delivery to thin markets should be addressed, particularly with the new technologies, and the importance of community involvement in creating community leadership to advance the cause of rural communities and industries...|$|R
