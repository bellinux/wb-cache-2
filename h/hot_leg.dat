40|$|During {{operation}} in the sea the reactor natural circulation behaviors are affected by ship rolling motion. The development of an analysis code and the natural circulation behaviors of a reactor simulator under rolling motion are described in this paper. In the case of rolling motion, the primary coolant flow rates in the <b>hot</b> <b>legs</b> and heating channels oscillated periodically, and the amplitude of flow rate oscillation was {{in direct proportion to}} rolling amplitude, but in inverse proportion to rolling period. The total mass flow rate also oscillated with half the rolling period, and the average total mass flow rate was less than that in steady state. In the natural circulation under a rolling motion, the flow rate oscillations in the <b>hot</b> <b>legs</b> were controlled by the tangential force; however, the mass flow rate oscillations in the total natural circulation and the heating channels were a result of the combined action of the change of inclination angle, flow resistance, and the extra force arising from the rolling motion. The extra tangential force brought about intense flow rate oscillations in the <b>hot</b> <b>legs,</b> which resulted in increasing total flow resistance; however the extra centrifugal force played a role in increasing thermal driving head...|$|R

40|$|The {{engineering}} design, {{performance analysis}} and safety assessment of Generation IV heavy liquid metal cooled nuclear reactors calls for advanced and qualified numerical tools. These tools {{need to be}} qualified before used in decision making process. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes provide detailed means for thermal-hydraulics analysis of pool-type nuclear reactors. This paper describes modeling of a forced to natural flow experiment in TALL- 3 D experimental facility using a commercial CFD code Star-CCM+. TALL- 3 D facility is 7 meters high LBE loop with two parallel <b>hot</b> <b>legs</b> and a cold leg. One of the <b>hot</b> <b>legs</b> accommodates the 3 D test section, a cylindrical pool where the multi-dimensional flow conditions vary between thermal mixing and stratification depending on the mass flow rate {{and the power of}} the heater surrounding the pool. The pool outlet temperature which affects the natural convection flow rates in the system is governed by the flow structure in the pool. Therefore, in order to predict the dynamics of the TALL- 3 D facility it is crucial to resolve the flow inside the 3 D test section. Specifically designed measurement instrumentation set-up provides steady state and transient data for calibration and validation of numerical models. The validity of the CFD model is assessed by comparing the computational results to experimental results. QC 20150427 </p...|$|R

50|$|Like the OPR-1000 and {{preceding}} C-E designs, the APR-1400 has two {{reactor coolant}} loops. In each loop, heated primary coolant leaves the {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) through one <b>hot</b> <b>leg,</b> passing through one steam generator (SG), returning to the reactor vessel through two cold legs, each equipped with a reactor coolant pump (RCP). In loop 2, there is one pressurizer (PZR) on the <b>hot</b> <b>leg,</b> where a steam bubble is maintained during operation. The loops are arranged symmetrically, so the hot legs are diametrically opposed on the RPV's circumference. Because the SGs are elevated relative to the RPV, natural convection will circulate reactor coolant {{in the event of}} RCP malfunction. The PZR is equipped with a pilot-operated relief valve which not only protects against Reactor Coolant System over-pressure, it also allows manual depressurization {{in the case of a}} total loss of feedwater.|$|E

5000|$|Leg as in “hot leg” {{refers to}} one of {{multiple}} hot conductors in an electrical system. The most common residential and small commercial service in Canada and the U.S., single split-phase, 240 V, features a neutral and two <b>hot</b> <b>legs,</b> 240 V to each other, and 120 V each to the neutral. The most common three-phase system will have three “hot” legs, 208 V {{to each other and}} 120 V each to the neutral. An older, but still widely used high-leg delta system uses three phases with 240 volts phase-to-phase for motor loads, and 120 volts for lighting loads by use of a center-tapped transformer; two of the phases are 120 volts to neutral. The third phase, the “high leg” of the system (also referred to as the [...] "wild leg"), has 208 V to neutral and is not usually used for single-phase connections, so is distinctively colored. For larger commercial installations, 277/480 V or 347/600 V three phase is common.|$|R

40|$|For certain {{values of}} fluid {{velocity}} of two phases, a wave forms covering {{as well as}} blocking the area of cross-section of the closed conduit of two phase flow. This phenomenon is called Flooding. The best example {{is the case of}} leakage in the essential cooling circuit of the reactor.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to provide a}} status of the {{progress}} that was made towards Design Certification of System 80 +{trademark} during the US government`s 1996 fiscal year. The System 80 + Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) is a 3931 MW (1350 MWe) Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). The design covers an essentially complete plant. It is based on EPRI ALWR Utility Requirements Document (URD) improvements to the Standardized System 80 Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) in operation at Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3. The NSSS is a traditional two-loop arrangement with two steam generators, two <b>hot</b> <b>legs</b> and four cold legs, each with a reactor coolant pump. The System 80 + standard design houses the NSSS in a spherical steel containment vessel which is enclosed in a concrete shield building, thus providing the safety advantages of a dual barrier to radioactivity release. Other major features include an all-digital, human-factors-engineered control room, an alternate electrical AC power source, an In-Containment Refueling Water Storage Tank (IRWST), and plant arrangements providing complete separation of redundant trains in safety systems...|$|R

40|$|A control-oriented {{dynamics}} simulator for a Generation IV Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) demonstrator (DEMO) {{has been}} developed aimed at providing a flexible, simple and fastrunning tool allowing to perform design-basis transient and stability analyses, and to lay the foundations {{for the study of}} the system control strategy. For such purposes, a model representing a compromise between accuracy and straightforwardness has been necessarily sought, and in this view an object-oriented approach based on the Modelica language has been adopted. The reactor primary and secondary systems have been implemented by assembling both component models already available in a specific thermal-hydraulic library, and ad hoc developed nuclear component models suitably modified according to the specific DEMO configuration. The resulting overall plant simulator, incorporating also the balance of plant, consists in the following essential parts: core, integrated steam generator/primary pump block, cold and <b>hot</b> <b>legs,</b> primary coolant cold pool, turbine, heat sink, secondary coolant pump. Afterwards, the reactor response to typical transient initiators has been investigated: feedwater mass flow rate and temperature enhancement, turbine admission valve coefficient variation, increase of primary coolant mass flow rate, and transient of overpower have been simulated; results have been compared with the outcomes of analogous analyses performed by employing a lumped-parameter DEMO plant model...|$|R
40|$|Podoconiosis is {{a chronic}} non-infectious disease {{resulting}} in below-knee {{swelling of the}} legs in bare-footed people living in red clay soil areas. It is an important and yet neglected problem in tropical Africa, central and south America, and north India. Podoconiosis can be prevented by consistently wearing shoes and washing feet. We aimed to assess {{the burden of the}} disease, to characterize features of the disease, and to describe foot hygiene and shoe wearing practice of patients in west Ethiopia. First, we did a survey of the 26 rural villages. We identified 1, 935 podoconiosis patients, giving a prevalence of 2. 8 %. Podoconiosis was twice as prevalent in females as males. Second, we did a more detailed study among 335 patients in six randomly selected villages. We found that the majority of patients were farmers, uneducated, and poor. The disease developed before the fourth decade of life and the majority of patients became bed-ridden because of frequent attacks of red, <b>hot</b> <b>legs</b> and swollen and painful groin. Shoe wearing was limited mainly due to lack of money. We conclude that podoconiosis imposes a huge burden in west Ethiopia, and recommend that interventions be developed to prevent, treat and control the disease...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{development}} and qualification of a nodalization for modeling of the PSB-VVER integral test facility (ITF) by RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 code and prediction of its {{primary and secondary}} systems behaviors at steady state and transient conditions. The PSB-VVER is a full-height, 1 / 300 volume and power scale representation of a VVER- 1000 NPP. A RELAP 5 nodalization has been developed for PSBVVER modeling and a nodalization qualification process has been applied for the developed nodalization at steady state and transient levels and a qualified nodalization has been proposed for modeling of the PSB ITF. The 11 % small-break loss-of-coolant-accident (SBLOCA), i. e. rupture {{of one of the}} hydroaccumulators (HA) injection lines in the upper plenum (UP) region of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) below the <b>hot</b> <b>legs</b> (HL), inlets has been considered for nodalization qualification process. The influence of the different steam generator (SG) nodalizations on the RELAP 5 results and on the nodalization qualification process has been examined. The “steady state” qualification level includes checking the correctness of the initial and boundary conditions and geometrical fidelity. In the “transient” qualification level, the time dependent results of the code calculation are compared with the experimental time trends from both the qualitative and quantitative point of view. For quantitative assessment of the results, a Fast Fourier Transform Based Method (FFTBM) has been used. The FFTBM was used to establish a range in which the steam generators nodalizations can vary...|$|R
