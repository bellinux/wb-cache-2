40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{a concept}} and {{proposal for the}} formation of ‘community based adaptation committees’ (CBACs) at the micro-level, and it explains how such local committees would act with respect to the existing organisation of disaster management in Bangladesh. It examines how the CBACs would be sustained locally without colliding with the present system of government. The main objective of this is to identify how the CBACs could act independently as per local demands, without any conflict with the existing system, in order to ensure sustainable adaptation in future. To achieve these objectives the author conducted interviews with key informants at both local and national levels, and also conducted eight participatory rapid appraisal sessions <b>at</b> eight coastal <b>communities.</b> The author finds that severe corruption is impeding the existing system of relief and rehabilitation <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>levels.</b> The paper emphasises that the government of Bangladesh urgently needs to formulate a national adaptation policy, and that within that policy the concept of CBACs <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level</b> should be prioritised. This would provide the government with guidelines for the use, <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level,</b> of adaptation funds from developed countries in order to reduce future vulnerability in Bangladesh.

40|$|Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{has been}} {{evolving}} from a sectoral policy of farm commodity support into an integrated policy for rural development and environmental enhancement. Rural development policy is {{closely linked to}} two concepts: diversity (multifunctionality) and sustainability as achieving optimal diversity <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level</b> is a key in the rural development problem. In this paper rural development <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level</b> {{and the impact of}} support redistribution, resulting from recent CAP reforms, are analyzed in the framework of privately provided public goods.

40|$|There are {{structures}} <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>levels</b> (district {{and village}} levels) in Botswana, which produce information for development purposes. Mostly this information {{end up in}} village development plans and district development plans. This information is however not captured by libraries and stored for future use. The information from these structures is usually by way of word of mouth because not all of our people can read and write. Again {{not all of these}} structures record their proceedings, which can later be stored for future use. But at these structures a lot of important information is discussed which feed into the development process of the country. This presents a challenge for librarians working <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level.</b> For instance how can they capture this information within their libraries? Our public libraries stores material mostly which is foreign and which cannot be accessed by the people within the rural communities. What this means is that libraries <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level</b> has simply locked out communities. In order for communities to come closer to libraries there is need to repackage information from the information structures outlined above. This might include the use of audiovisual techniques to capture information from these community structures. This paper discusses these information structures and the challenges facing librarians...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{approaches}} {{the problem of}} the development mechanism of international migration <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level.</b> Some empirical observations cumulated during several researches,at origin and destination area, regarding Romanian migration to Spain constitute the starting points. Appealing to the distinction introduced by Mark Granovetter in 1976 between weak and strongties, we find that, if initially migration develops almost exclusively based on social relations that could be assimilated to strong ties,there is a moment in the process of development when the departures on the base of weak ties, with important consequences on the migrant’s situation at destination, increase. The paper tries to clarify, preponderantly invoking theoretical arguments,in what measure the departures based on weak ties between migrant and non migrant are normal in the process of international migration development <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level.</b> The study concludes that, because of cumulative effects, migration evolution to a phase when the departure is possible based on weak ties is explainable. Two mechanisms mainly contribute to this result: enhancement of incentives to migrate (because of quantitative and qualitative information increase; visibility of migration effects in the origin area;changes of relative deprivation <b>at</b> <b>community</b> <b>level)</b> and migration costs and risk lowering, with the consequence of reduction of effective support that a non-migrant needs from one migrant in order to migrate...|$|R
