2500|$|Bekele's eight year [...]africa {{journey was}} not without a trial.

For instance, on April 24, 2014, during the International ICT Girls day, the AUC blocked Bekele from speaking at an ITU event that was held on the AUC premises in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, due to a dispute over the [...]africa. Bekele has been challenging the AUC, who allegedly disavowed the first endorsement they gave her organization DotConnectAfrica in 2009 to apply at ICANN for the [...]africa gTLD, to subsequently request for the same directly from ICANN, at the ICANN 42 International meeting held in Dakar Senegal from 23–28 October 2011. AUC requested from ICANN to include all similar name strings [...] ".africa", [...] ".afrique" [...] and [...] ".afriqia", {{in the list of}} [...] "reserved names", to afford special legislative protection to the AUC to own these strings so as to make it unavailable to anyone, through a method of bypassing the formal application process of the ICANN's new generic top level domains (gTLDs). [...] Bekele strongly opposed to the AUC's request to reserve the names saying the request was against the ICANN gTLD rule book, thus reserving the name will disqualify all competition to enable the AUC to separately negotiate the delegation of these name strings under a separate process outside the aegis of the official ICANN new gTLD programme. Bekele came victorious on this battle at ICANN Dakar, as it became known later that ICANN could not reserve the names for the AU, however ICANN did recommend to the AUC to use Government Advisory Committee to raise concerns that an applicant is seen as potentially sensitive or problematic, or to provide direct advice to the Board, so as to change the outcome of the gTLD. which AUC implemented the advice during the GAC objection period, to the detriment of DCA's application. [...] In addition, failing to secure the reserve names, the AUC then directly endorsed another firm from SouthAfrica to apply to ICANN, who was also supported by its own AU Dotafrica Task Force. [...] According to the public part of their application, the South African company submitted a [...] "non-community" [...] application to ICANN naming AUC as a “co-applicant” and giving the [...]africa registry and intellectual property rights to the AUC in a separate contract Bekele's organization then challenged the ICANN application process for the competition, through the official channels of ICANN, as well as challenged the AUC's RFP process that gave a direct endorsement for the SouthAfrican company by requesting full disclosure of the process with the AU leadership and ICANN <b>Governmental</b> <b>Committee,</b> in the interest of accountability and transparency to the global public at large ...|$|E
60|$|Besides the Committee of Public Safety {{there was}} another chief <b>governmental</b> <b>committee,</b> that of General Security. Its {{functions}} were mainly connected with the police, the arrests, and the prisons, but in all serious affairs the two Committees deliberated in common. There were also fourteen other groups of various size, taken from the Convention; they applied themselves with admirable zeal, and usually not with more zeal than skill, to schemes of public instruction, of finance, of legislation, of the administration of justice, {{and a host of}} other civil reforms, of all of which Napoleon Bonaparte was by and by to reap the credit. These bodies completed the civil revolution, which the Constituent and the Legislative Assemblies had left so mischievously incomplete that, as soon as ever the Convention had assembled, it was besieged by a host of petitioners praying them to explain and to pursue the abolition of the old feudal rights. Everything had still been left uncertain in men's minds, even upon that greatest of all the revolutionary questions. The feudal division of the committee of general legislation had in this eleventh hour to decide innumerable issues, from those of the widest practical importance, down to the prayer of a remote commune to be relieved from the charge of maintaining a certain mortuary lamp which had been a matter of seignorial obligation. The work done by the radical jurisconsults was never undone. It was the great and durable reward of the struggle. And we have to remember that these industrious and efficient bodies, as well as all other public bodies and functionaries whatever, were placed by the definite revolutionary constitution of 1793 under the direct orders of the Committee of Public Safety.|$|E
