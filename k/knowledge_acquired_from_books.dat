60|$|During his lieutenancy, {{and after}} he had perfected himself in the {{knowledge}} and duties of a practical sailor, he was compelled {{by the state of}} his health to remain in England for a considerable length of time. Of this he industriously availed himself to the acquirement of substantial knowledge from books; and during his whole life afterwards, he considered those as his happiest hours, which, without any neglect of official or professional duty, he could devote to reading. He preferred, indeed he almost confined himself to, history, political economy, voyages and travels, natural history, and latterly agricultural works; in short, to such books as contain specific facts or practical principles capable of specific application. His active life, and the particular objects of immediate utility, some one of which he had always in his view, precluded a taste for works of pure speculation and abstract science, though he highly honoured those who were eminent in these respects, and considered them as the benefactors of mankind, no less than those who afterwards discovered the mode of applying their principles, or who realised them in practice. Works of amusement, as novels, plays, etc., did not appear even to amuse him; and the only poetical composition of which I have ever heard him speak, was a manuscript poem written by one of my friends, which I read to his lady in his presence. To my surprise he afterwards spoke of this with warm interest; but it was evident to me that it was not so much the poetic merit of the composition that had interested him, as the truth and psychological insight with which it represented the practicability of reforming the most hardened minds, and the various accidents which may awaken the most brutalised person to a recognition of his nobler being. I will add one remark of his own <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquired</b> <b>from</b> <b>books,</b> which appears to me both just and valuable. The prejudice against such knowledge, he said, and the custom of opposing it to that which is learnt by practice, originated in those times when books were almost confined to theology, and to logical and metaphysical subtleties; but that at present there is scarcely any practical knowledge which is not to be found in books. The press is the means by which intelligent men now converse with each other, and persons of all classes and all pursuits convey each the contribution of his individual experience. It was, therefore, he said, as absurd to hold book-knowledge at present in contempt, as it would be for a man to avail himself only of his own eyes and ears, and to aim at nothing which could not be performed exclusively by his own arms. The use and necessity of personal experience consisted in the power of choosing and applying what had been read, and of discriminating by the light of analogy the practicable from the impracticable, and probability from mere plausibility. Without a judgment matured and steadied by actual experience, a man would read to little or perhaps to bad purpose; but yet that experience, which in exclusion of all other knowledge has been derived from one man's life, is in the present day scarcely worthy of the name--at least for those who are to act in the higher and wider spheres of duty. An ignorant general, he said, inspired him with terror; for if he were too proud to take advice he would ruin himself by his own blunders, and if he--were not, by adopting the worst that was offered. A great genius may indeed form an exception, but we do not lay down rules in expectation of wonders. A similar remark I remember to have heard from a gallant officer, who to eminence in professional science and the gallantry of a tried soldier, adds all the accomplishments of a sound scholar and the powers of a man of genius.|$|E

40|$|One or many? If you are {{thinking}} about applying the SINGLETON pattern, {{this is a question}} you need to ask yourself properly. It is also the question that many developers and development gurus should ask themselves when they think about how many pattern sources they base their design pattern knowledge on. Software developers, particularly those working with objects, increasingly claim some familiarity with patterns. But when you look more closely you discover that even in many of the expert cases it is no more than familiarity: it is rarely intimacy. Pattern expertise is often claimed based solely on <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquired</b> <b>from</b> the <b>book</b> entitled Design Patterns [Gamma+ 1995]. This is like claiming knowledge of C++ based solely on one's knowledge of Kernighan and Ritchie's classic (New Testament) C Programming Language [Kernighan+ 1988].

40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to assess}} and compare the {{perception}} of clinical faculty toward bedside teaching (BST) for undergraduate medical students and the barriers encountered by them. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was carried out among clinical faculty of three tertiary care hospitals attached to a medical college in Mangalore. A total of 94 clinical faculties, excluding the post-graduates, were approached by using convenient sampling. A semi structured questionnaire was distributed to the participants of this study. The response to the perceptions and barriers of BST was captured using five-point Likert scale. Results: The age of the study participants ranged from 27 to 60 years (mean age of 38 ± 8. 85 years). Most of the study participants strongly agreed that BST {{is an essential part}} of clinical medicine, which improves communication skills, practical skills by providing trigger scenarios to stimulate learning. They disagreed toward classroom teaching being equal to BST in imparting knowledge and students being capable of <b>acquiring</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>from</b> clinical <b>books</b> without BST. There was a significant difference in perception score of barriers toward BST among medical and surgical faculty in relation to bigger group size and increase the workload being deterring factors for effective BST. Conclusion: BST is still valued by the clinical fraternity as an efficient teaching tool for the medical students even in this era of simulation based training...|$|R

In this paper, we argue that the occurrence of the NIH syndrome depends on the source of external knowledge {{and the success of}} the firm that aims at adapting external knowledge. In line with social identity theory, we hypothesize that internal resistance is most likely to occur if <b>knowledge</b> is <b>acquired</b> <b>from</b> similar organizations. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that the NIH syndrome occurs when <b>knowledge</b> is <b>acquired</b> <b>from</b> competitors but not if <b>knowledge</b> is <b>acquired</b> <b>from</b> suppliers, customers or universities. Further, we show that successful companies are most likely to experience the NIH syndrome (if <b>knowledge</b> is <b>acquired</b> <b>from</b> competitors). This is in line with our hypothesis that firm success increases the extent to which employees identify themselves with their company resulting in stronger in-group favoritism and a superior tendency to reject externally generated knowledge.
