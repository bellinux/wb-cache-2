5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} {{relatives}} of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at the Regulators. They obtained an indictment against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who <b>had</b> <b>stood</b> by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E

The demolition of Lawford's Gate at {{the eastern end of}} Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an uninterrupted route into the bustling heart of Bristol.|$|E

It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011 an {{assessment}} of the Greyfriars site began to identify where the monastery <b>had</b> <b>stood,</b> and which land might be available for excavation. A desk-based assessment was conducted to determine the archaeological viability of the site, followed by a survey in August 2011 using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The GPR results were inconclusive; no clear building remains could be identified owing to a layer of disturbed ground and demolition debris just below the surface. The survey was useful in finding modern utilities crossing the site, such as pipes and cables.|$|E

5|$|In postwar Poland, the {{government}} bought {{most of the}} land where the camp <b>had</b> <b>stood,</b> and built a large stone memorial there between 1959 and 1962.

In the same year the first German trials were held regarding war crimes committed at Treblinka by former SS members. After the end of communism in Poland in 1989, the number of visitors coming to Treblinka from abroad increased. An exhibition centre at the camp opened in 2006.

The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed.
