5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were <b>Democratic</b> <b>nominee,</b> Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E
5|$|Despite the loss, Weaver still {{believed}} the Populist cause would triumph.

In 1900, Weaver attended a convention of fusionist Populists in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the party having split {{on the issue of}} cooperation with the Democrats. The fusionists backed Bryan, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>nominee,</b> but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, Weaver was elected to office for the last time as the mayor of his hometown, Colfax, Iowa.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Breathitt {{was one of}} several proposed candidates to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate, but the General Assembly deadlocked over the appointment and the seat went unfilled until the Assembly's next term. In the next gubernatorial election in 1832, Breathitt was the <b>Democratic</b> <b>nominee</b> for governor. Again, Breathitt won, but James Turner Morehead, the Whig candidate for lieutenant governor, defeated Breathitt's running mate. Initially, Breathitt enjoyed popularity for his public condemnation of John C. Calhoun's doctrine of nullification, but he did not fare well in state politics because the Whigs controlled the legislature. He died in office of tuberculosis on February 21, 1834.|$|E
