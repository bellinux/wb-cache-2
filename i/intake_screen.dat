50|$|The annual {{sediment}} load into the Cachi reservoir estimated at 0.81 million tons, which amounts to 1% storage {{volume of the}} reservoir, had been assessed {{at the planning stage}} to be distributed at 54% as thalweg deposits (flushed through low level sluice provided {{in the body of the}} dam), 21% getting deposited on the terraces, 18% flowing out through the spillway by gate operation and power intake through turbines and 7% trapped as bed load in the reservoir. This process is witnessed in two distinct parts of the reservoir - the upper part and the lower part - the upper part gets filled with sand and coarse sediments and the lower part, which is the deep river channel, gets deposited with fine sediment on its terraces which needs to be flushed by reservoir operation (a high concentration of sediments was noted near the power intake). However, for seven years after the project was commissioned, the reservoir was not desilted, which resulted in trapping of 82% of the sediment inflow into the reservoir and which moved towards the body of the dam and interfered with diversion of flow through the power intake in the body of the dam for power generation. The dam is provided with one scouring sluice at the bottom in the main river channel adjacent to the <b>intake</b> <b>screen</b> of the power intake that draws water for power generation. To keep the reservoir in a serviceable condition to derive planned power benefits, it became obligatory to drain the reservoir to its lowest level (though it caused an inevitable economic loss in power generation during the filling stage every year) and flush the deposited sediments downstream so that the intake does not get choked and allows sediment flow into the turbines. The first flushing operation was carried out in three well defined stages in 1973 and thereafter repeated every year till 1990. The downstream impact on the river regime as a result of the silt flushed from the reservoir was also studied when a peak concentration of 400 grams/litre were noted in the form of turbid water not only on the flood plains but also where the river merged with the Atlantic Sea. It was expected that these deposits would be flushed during the flood season. However, as a result of the silt flushing, some detrimental effect on the biota was noted by local people of the area in the downstream reaches of the river below the dam.|$|E

Robinson generating station on Galveston Bay, Texas {{with that of}} a 3 -m otter trawl hauled in the intake waters and evaluated a means of predicting size selectivity of the <b>intake</b> <b>screens.</b> We did this for brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus), white shrimp (Penaeus setiferus), gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), sand seatrout (Cynoscion arenarius), and Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). The trawl generally caught smaller individuals than the <b>intake</b> <b>screens,</b> with the relative frequency of catch by size gradually increasing to a peak at an indeterminate length of a species, then decreasing as its length increased. Conversely, the relative frequency of collection at the <b>intake</b> <b>screens</b> increased abruptly at a predictable threshold length. Above this threshold, catches decreased gradually, presumably because larger individuals were both less abundant and less susceptible to capture than smaller ones. Based on our results, we concluded that <b>intake</b> <b>screens</b> are a practical means of sampling fish populations and provide data that are as useful as trawl data for most fishery analysis...|$|R

40|$|Domestic {{wells in}} North America and {{elsewhere}} are typically constructed at relatively shallow depths {{and with the}} sand or gravel pack extending far above the <b>intake</b> <b>screen</b> of the well (shallow well seal). The source areas of these domestic wells {{and the effect of}} an extended gravel pack on the source area are typically unknown, and few resources exist for estimating these. In this article, we use detailed, high-resolution ground water model-ing to estimate the capture zone (source area) of a typical domestic well located in an alluvial aquifer. Results {{for a wide range of}} aquifer and gravel pack hydraulic conductivities are compared to a simple analytical model. Cor-rection factors for the analytical model are computed based on statistical regression of the numerical results against the analytical model. This tool can be applied to estimate the source area of a domestic well for a wide range of conditions. We show that an extended gravel pack above the well screen may contribute significantly to the overall inflow to a domestic well, especially in less permeable aquifers, where that contribution may range from 20 % to 50 % and that an extended gravel pack may lead to a significantly elongated capture zone, in some instances, nearly doubling the length of the capture zone. Extending the gravel pack much above the <b>intake</b> <b>screen</b> therefore significantly increases the vulnerability of the water source...|$|E

40|$|Construction of the Auburn Dam {{was halted}} in 1975 when a seismic fault was discovered. The site languished {{for the next}} several decades and the site was even {{overtopped}} by a major flood. The flood partially destroyed the 300 foot-high coffer dam, sending hundreds of thousands of tons of debris and earth into the river below. Over the following decades, the Placer County Water Agency continued to use a temporary replacement diversion to perform the function of a permanent diversion that was destroyed by the construction of the dam. To facilitate implementation of a new permanent diversion, whitewater boating and fish passage elements were included in the design. The new diversion was the first to implement a new (and patented) “Chute Screen” which provides a self-cleaning fish screen located in the invert of a man-made “rapid”.

40|$|Abstract Background Although several {{previous}} {{projects have}} attempted {{to address the issue}} of child obesity through school-based interventions, the overall effectiveness of school-based programs on health-related outcomes in youth has been poor. Thus, it has been suggested that multi-level interventions that aim to influence healthy lifestyle behaviors at the community, school and family levels may prove more successful in the prevention of childhood obesity. Methods/Design This paper describes the rationale, design, and implementation of a community-, school-, and family-based intervention aimed at modifying key behaviors (physical activity, screen time (Internet, television, video games), and nutrition) related to childhood obesity among third through fifth graders in two mid-western cities. The intervention involves a randomized study of 10 schools (5 intervention and 5 control schools). The intervention is being conducted during the duration of the academic year – approximately 9 months – and includes baseline and post-intervention measurements of physical activity, dietary <b>intake,</b> <b>screen</b> time and body composition. Discussion We hope this report will be useful to researchers, public health professionals, and school administrators and health professionals (nurses and physical/health educators) seeking to develop similar prevention programs. It is obvious that more collaborative, inter-disciplinary, multi-level work is needed before a proven, effective intervention package to modify behaviors related to childhood obesity can be generally recommended. It is our hope that SWITCH is a step in that direction. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00685555 </p...|$|E

Data were obtained from a 2014 national intervention program against obesity in Chinese children and adolescents aged 6 – 17 years. Height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were measured. Information of SSB consumption, socioeconomic status, dietary <b>intake,</b> <b>screen</b> time, and physical activity were self-reported. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association of SSB consumption with obesity and hypertension. A total of 66. 6 % of the 53, 151 participants reported consuming SSB. The per capita and per consumer SSB intake were 2. 84 ± 5. 26 servings/week and 4. 26 ± 5. 96 servings/week, respectively. Boys, older children, and adolescents, and individuals with long screen time or high physical activity or low parental education level were more likely to consume SSB. Participants who were high SSB consumers had a higher odds ratio (1. 133, 95 % CI: 1. 054 – 1. 217) than non-consumers for having abdominal obesity after adjustment for age, sex, residence, socioeconomic status, diet, screen time, and physical activity. However, SSB consumption was not associated with general obesity or hypertension in children and adolescents. In conclusion, {{more than half of the}} children and adolescents in China consumed SSB, which was independently related to a high risk of abdominal obesity.

Self-reported sociodemographic, medical and smoking-related data were obtained to determine pre-eligibility for a full <b>intake</b> <b>screen</b> prior to trial participation. Compared to non-African American, African American teen applicants were older (16. 4 +/- 1. 7 years versus 15. 6 +/- 1. 6; p = 0. 015), had lower Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores (5. 3 +/- 2. 3 versus 6. 1 +/- 1. 8; p = 0. 018, ANOVA controlling for age) and smoked fewer cigarettes on the weekend (27 +/- 16 versus 38 +/- 17; p = 0. 001). African American teens reported similar duration of smoking (3. 3 +/- 1. 4 versus 3. 1 +/- 1. 5 years) and time elapsed between first cigarette ever smoked and daily smoking (0. 7 +/- 0. 9 versus 0. 6 +/- 0. 7 years). African American and non-African American teens had similar motivation to quit scores and frequency of reported health problems (e. g., asthma, psychiatric conditions). These data suggest that cessation treatment programs designed for African American youth should include lower Fagerstrom-defined levels, and possibly other criteria for tobacco dependence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is a significant}} problem for military veterans. There is an international imperative to improve access to effective treatments, but {{more research is needed}} to ascertain the extent to which treatments found to be efficacious in research settings translate to successful national implementation efforts. METHOD: This study reports the clinical outcomes for the first 100 clients treated following the implementation of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) across a national community-based veterans' mental health service that commenced in May 2012. The implementation included training and ongoing clinical supervision, leadership support, and updates to the service's data collection and intake system to support the delivery of CPT. The service implemented an <b>intake</b> <b>screen</b> (the Primary Care PTSD) that was used to allocate clients who screened positive for PTSD to CPT-trained therapists. An outcome measure for PTSD (the PTSD Checklist) was incorporated into the services' computerized records system. Clients who received CPT were assessed pretreatment and posttreatment. RESULTS: Statistically significant and clinically large improvements were found for self-reported PTSD (effect size = 1. 01, P <. 001). In addition, the study obtained high levels of treatment fidelity in the delivery of the CPT treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There is relatively little published research supporting the effectiveness of evidence-based PTSD treatments following national implementation efforts. This is the first study to systematically report CPT treatment outcomes from a national implementation effort, using service-based outcome monitoring data. Results indicate that when administered as part of routine clinical practice, CPT achieves large clinically significant improvements for PTSD comparable with those found in randomized controlled trials.

25|$|Because Black Eagle Dam is an {{overflow}} dam, it {{is common}} for debris to jam against the dam or obstruct the penstock intakes. Driftwood and logs are the most common forms of debris, but unusual objects such as boat docks, bowling balls, canoes, hot tubs, and small wooden and steel sheds and buildings also sometimes become lodged against the dam. Removing hollow items can be dangerous, because the water pressure against them can cause them to implode. In addition to large amounts of driftwood, about 100 animal carcasses (cattle, deer, dogs, and various small animals) become lodged against the dam or the penstock <b>intake</b> <b>screens</b> each year.

40|$|The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation District diverts up to 1400 cfs {{into its}} main canal {{system on the}} lower Yellowstone River in Northeastern Montana. In late 2010, {{as part of a}} pallid {{sturgeon}} recovery program, the USBR and USACE began construction of a new state-of-the-art screened canal head works structure. After over 100 years of unscreened operations, the new fish screened facility was opened in spring 2012. The head works will be integrated into a major river gradient fish passage facility being proposed for construction soon. When completed, the new passage and protection facilities will reduce fish entrainment and open an additional 165 miles of river habitat for the endangered and native fishes. The new headwork facility’s fish protection system consists of twelve, 6. 5 -foot diameter and 25 feet long cylindrical fish protection screens. Each screen is designed to seal over the intake’s submerged sluice gates spaced along the 350 -foot long riverbank facility. An integrated and flush-mounted track system was built into the vertical concrete walls to raise the screens in the non-irrigation season for protection from the significant ice and flood flows common on the river. When the 71 -mile long irrigation canal is operational, each screen is lowered into position and an automatic brush cleaning system is used to keep the 1. 75 mm wedge wire slots from clogging. The new intake facility was physically modeled at the USBR Hydraulics Lab along with several river fish passage options. The on-river screen design keeps the fish and debris in the river as opposed to traditional off-river screen designs with fish bypass facilities. The cylindrical design also reduced the facility footprint and allows diversions to occur over the river’s wide-ranging water surface fluctuations. This presentation will focus on the design, construction, and hydraulics of the <b>intake</b> <b>screen</b> facility, as well as the initial season’s operational experiences...|$|E
40|$|Background: Childhood {{obesity is}} {{becoming}} an epidemic in North America {{and around the world}} (Deckelbaum & Williams, 2001). Obesity is second only to smoking for contributing to total morality, and it is estimated that $ 117 billion will bel spent annualy for health care costs related to this problem (Fitzgibbon & Stolley, 2004). A study in 2001 approximated that 22 million children were overweight worldwide, with numbers in the United States doubling over the past three decades. Research Question: Activity level in the overweight pediatric population has been frequently studied as evidenced by the numerous results the leterature review revealed. A search for articles about parental perception of general health, weight status, dietary <b>intake,</b> <b>screen</b> viewing and inactivity also returned a large number of hits. However, our search did not lead to any reports of parental perception of their overweight child's activity level. This made us wonder: are parents aware of how much physical activity their children receive? Is there a difference between the parental awareness of normal weight children versus overweight children? Methods: A descriptive correlational study was conducted by drawing a convenience sample of 64 children ages six to 12 years and their parents/guardians. The participants are parishioners at a church in Canton, MI. Each dyad was asked questions about activity level and {{the amount of time spent}} doing certain activities. The responses were compared between the parent/guardian and their child, as well as between parents/guardians of normal weight and overweight children. Results: No difference was revealed between parent/guardian and child reports on minutes spent playing with physical activity, which is a general measure. Minutes reported watching television, playing computer and video games, and doing homework were significantly different when the parent/guardian's answers were compared with the child's. Parents/guardians who rated their child as very active were accurate at reporting their child's activity level; according to pedometer results, their children are very active. Parents/guardians who rated their children in other categories were not accurate about their child's activity level and therefore have a different perception of their child's activity level. No statistical relationship was found between the difference in the amount of minutes that the parent/guardian reported and the amount of minutes that the child reported compared with the child's BMI. Conclusion: The data collected through this study and the participation of the children and their parents/guardians shows that there is a need for and an intrest in more research to be conducted about childhood obesity and physical activity of children. This growing health problem requires more attention of pediatric health care providers and parents/guardians alike...|$|E

40|$|Different design {{criteria}} for successful flushing of hydropower headworks have been evaluated. Main {{focus has been}} on handling of floating debris for small hydropower plant in Norway, as well as sediment handling for run of the river-projects in sediment-carrying rivers. As a new way of cleaning intake screens clogged by debris, the concept of backflushing has been investigated. The <b>intake</b> <b>screen,</b> called trash rack, is then cleaned by a reveresed water flow over a short period of time, and the clogged material flushed out thorugh a flushing pipe. A physical test tank was developed to evaluate parameters for a successful flushing of trash racks with different degrees of clogging. A test device was developed to evaluate adhesion, i. e. the level of friction between clogged material and the trash rack. The required gross water velocity over a trash rack during flushing for detaching of the clogged material was found to be in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 2 m/s, with a typical value of 0. 12 m/s. The clogged material tend to resist a maximum limit of pressure difference over the trash rack before it detaches. Results are showing a pressure difference resistance in the range of 0. 05 - 0. 10 meterWater Column (mWC). The pressure difference prove hard to obtain as parts of the trashrack is cleaned. Hence, a flushing gate should be opened at a high rate to obtain the best flushing efficiency. A field trip to Nepal has been conducted to gain experience in sediment handling, and to work with physical models at HydroLab Pvt Ltd in Kathmandu. Observed intake solutions have been evaluated both against existing theory and results from a physical model study. It has been documented through a model test series that the flushing ability of an undersluice gate is limited to only a few meters upstream of the flushing gate. The limit for flushing by bed transport has been tested in a model, and compared to theory for evaluating initial movement of the sediment bed. Experiments are supporting that Shield s theory of critical shear stress can be used to predict the occurrence of bed movement. Design and operation of settling basins have been investigated, together with the appurtenant different strategies for flushing. The possibility of applying the concept of backflushing of trash racks for headworks arrangements including sediment settling basins have been evaluated. For projects where the trash rack can be located upstream of the settling basin, the combination seems feasible, as parts of the water storage in the settling basin could be used for the backflushing. However, the trash rack should be placed downstream of the settling basins for most Himalayan headworks arrangements, which makes backflushing impossible...|$|E

The results show that in each year {{the structure of the}} fish community in the shallows of the estuary underwent similar cyclical changes. These changes were largely attributable to a sequential immigration and emigration of different species, particularly estuarine-dependent marine species, and were not driven directly by variations in water temperature, salinity or freshwater discharge from the river.
