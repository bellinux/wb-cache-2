25|$|The {{principle}} of silver/silver chloride sensors operation is {{the conversion of}} ion current at the surface of human tissues to <b>electron</b> <b>current</b> to be delivered through the lead wire to the instrument to read. An {{important part of the}} operation is electrolyte gel which is applied between the electrode and tissues. The gel contains free chloride ions such that the charge can be carried through the electrolyte, therefore the electrolyte can be considered as conductive for ion current as the human tissues. When the ion current exists, the silver atoms in the electrode oxidize and discharge cations to the electrolyte and the electrons carry charge through the lead wire. At the same time, the chloride ions which are anions in the electrolyte travel toward the electrode and they are reduced as they bond with silver of the electrode resulting in silver chloride and free electrons to deliver to the lead wire. The reaction allows current to pass from electrolyte to electrode and the <b>electron</b> <b>current</b> passes through the lead wire for the instrument to read.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back {{many of the}} downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the <b>electron</b> <b>current</b> flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.|$|E

40|$|The Plasma Interaction Experiments 1 and 2 (PIX 1 and 2) were {{designed}} as first steps toward understanding interactions between high-voltage solar arrays {{and the surrounding}} plasma. The PIX 2 consisted of an approximately 2000 -sq cm array divided into four equal segments. Each of the segments could be biased independently and the current measured separately. In addition to the solar array segments, PIX 2 had a hot-wire-filament electron emitter and a spherical Langmuir probe. The emitter was operated when the array segments were biased positively bove 125 V. Thermal electrons from the emitter aided in balancing the <b>electron</b> <b>currents</b> collected by the array. Laboratory and flight results of PIX 2 are presented. At high positive voltages on the solar array segments, the flight currents were approximately {{an order of magnitude}} larger than the ground test currents.

40|$|Abstract — A high {{performance}} soft x-ray appearance potential spectroscopy (SXAPS) {{system has been}} designed and built. Non-derivative spectra (without using a lock-in-amplifier) are measured at a few µA incident <b>electron</b> <b>currents</b> on samples. This is about 1 / 1000 of typical <b>electron</b> <b>currents</b> for SXAPS measurements. A new analytical method to obtain local density of empty states is developed. SXAPS Cr 2 p spectra of a Cr(110) surface have been measured by the system and density of empty states is deduced by using the method.
