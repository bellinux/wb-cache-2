5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at the time <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> {{candidate}} to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.

The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
