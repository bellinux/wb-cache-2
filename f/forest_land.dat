5|$|As US131 {{passes through}} the {{outskirts}} of Plainwell, it curves to the northeast through a commercial area centered around the interchange with M-89. North of this area US131 crosses the Kalamazoo River and runs past the US131 Raceway Park, a dragstrip close to the M-222 interchange near Martin. The freeway continues north through mixed farm and <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> to the residential areas that abut it in Wayland. Further north the highway crosses into Kent County and {{the southern end of}} the Grand Rapids metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} northward, US31 intersects {{the western end}} of M-20 in New Era in Oceana County. The landscape in this area is dominated by <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> as the trunkline crosses the Hart-Montague Trail State Park, a linear state park that follows a bike trail in the area. North of the trail crossing, US31 has a business spur for Hart that runs east into that town; north of this interchange, the freeway crosses the Pentwater River near the community of Pentwater which also has its own business loop.|$|E

5|$|As the {{trunkline}} heads {{away from}} Bay City, it runs {{parallel to the}} Lake State Railway again. M-13 intersects {{the northern end of}} its connector route before Huron Road crosses the Kawkawlin River. The highway runs through the community of the same name {{on the north side of}} the river. M-13 and Huron Road continue north across mixed agricultural and <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> as they pass through the communities of Linwood and Pinconning.

5|$|In 1989, annual {{timber harvest}} revenue on federal <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> {{nationwide}} peaked at $1.5 billion. Following that year, {{the impact of}} overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact timber sales on the O lands. In 1994, the federal Northwest Forest Plan was implemented. Designed to guide forest management of federal lands while protecting old-growth forest habitat for endangered species such as the Northern spotted owl, the plan restricted the land available for timber harvest. By 1998, revenue on federal forest lands fell {{to a third of}} the peak 1989 revenue, with areas in the Northwest particularly hard-hit.|$|E
5|$|In Mt. Pleasant, M-20 runs {{near the}} campus of Central Michigan University {{crossing}} the Chippewa River, and the trunkline joins Bus. US127 along the Mission Street business area to Pickard Road. The highway turns east on Pickard and passes under the US127 freeway near the Soaring Eagle Casino. From Mt.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, and began to clear <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the slopes of mountains. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly of Cushitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.|$|E

The highway follows Cypress Street to a drawbridge over the Manistee River and then Cleveland Street {{on the northern}} side. As the trunkline rounds the northern shore of Manistee Lake, it passes the SS City of Milwaukee, a car ferry preserved as a museum. From there, the highway runs northeasterly, intersecting {{the western end of}} M-55 (Caberfae Highway). Next to the Little River Casino, the highway intersects the southern end of M-22 (Orchard Highway), and the LMCT separates from US31.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the {{community}} of Hale the road enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake. The trunkline takes a turn to the east as it passes along the Au Sable River.

At the intersection with River Road, M-65 turns north to cross the Au Sable, and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda. The M-65 bridge over the Au Sable is just downstream of the Five Channels Dam, crossing high above the water below. The highway turns northwesterly through <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> to cross into Alcona County. North of the county line, the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes.

On {{the north side of}} the village, M-66 crosses the Thornapple River and continues north through mixed rural <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> and farm fields. Near Woodland, M-66 joins M-43 and the two run to the northeast and along the Barry–Eaton county line. M-43/M-66 meets M-50 at a four-way intersection southwest of Lake Odessa near Woodbury, and M-43 turns east leaving M-66 in favor of a concurrency with M-50. M-66 crosses a rail line of CSX Transportation and the county line on State Road. It meets I-96 in a rural southern part of the Ionia County south of Ionia. On the south edge of town, the highway passes the county airport and curves to the northeast becoming Dexter Street. While entering downtown Ionia, the trunkline crosses the Grand River and the abandoned mainline of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad near the county fairgrounds. M-66 turns west along M-21 (Lincoln Avenue) for two blocks before turning back to the north along State Street. The trunkline runs through the northern part of the county and meets M-44's eastern terminus near Woodard Lake.|$|E
5|$|Modern human {{settlement}} {{of what is}} now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the last glacial period, either in the Neolithic period around 8000 BC, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter gatherers in the late stone age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced dimpled pottery and iron tools. These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes.

An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.
