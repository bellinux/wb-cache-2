A periodontal needle {{attached to a}} plastic syringe is moved by a microprobe. Syringe is filled with a glass etch. A drop of hexane and vacuum pump oil is placed on microcircuit die and hexane is allowed to evaporate leaving a thin film of oil.

40|$|This {{viewgraph}} presentation {{reviews the}} solder reflow failures in electronic components that occur during manual soldering. It discusses {{the specifics of}} manual-soldering-induced failures in plastic devices with internal solder joints. The failure analysis turned up that molten solder had squeezed up to the die surface along the die molding compound interface, and the dice were not protected with <b>glassivation</b> allowing solder to short gate and source to the drain contact. The failure analysis concluded that the parts failed due to overheating during manual soldering...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{failure of}} a vintage memory device {{presented}} a unique challenge to failure analysts. Normally device layouts, fabrication parameters and other technical information were available to assist the analyst in the analysis. However, this device was out of production {{for many years and}} the manufacturer was no longer in business, so the information was not available. To further complicate this analysis, the package leads were all but removed making additional electrical testing difficult. Under these conditions, new and innovative methods were used to analyze the failure. The external visual exam, radiography, PIND, and leak testing were performed with nominal results. Since electrical testing was precluded by the short lead lengths, the device was delidded to expose the internal structures for microscopic examination. No failure mechanism was identified. The available electrical data suggested an ESD or low level EOS type mechanism which left no visible surface damage. Due to parallel electrical paths, electrical probing on the chip failed to locate the failure site. Two non-destructive Scanning Electron Microscopy techniques, CIVA (Charge Induced Voltage Alteration) and EBIC (Electron Beam Induced Current), and a liquid crystal decoration technique which detects localized heating were employed to aid in the analysis. CIVA and EBIC isolated two faults in the input circuitry, and the liquid crystal technique further localized two hot spots in regions on two input gates. Removal of the <b>glassivation</b> and metallization revealed multiple failure sites located in the gate oxide of two input transistors suggesting machine (testing) induced damage...|$|E
40|$|Flip chip {{technology}} {{is being used}} increasingly {{as a method of}} interconnecting a die to a substrate. There are reliability concerns associated with the technique such as pre-existing voids in the solder joints or non-wet of the solder to the bond pads. Defects in the interconnections can also occur during use of the device or during life simulation tests such as thermal cycling. For reliability determination a nondestructive method is needed to examine the solder joints in the “as assembled ” units {{as well as in the}} “post stress ” condition. Acoustic micro imaging has been used as a nondestructive method to evaluate flip chip attach with promising results. Acoustic microscopes utilize high frequency ultrasound to examine the internal features in materials and components. The instrument used in this study was a C-SAM (C-Mode Scanning Acoustic Microscope) operating in the reflection mode at frequencies of 100 to 180 MHz. A previous paper presented analyses done on flip chip test samples These samples contained known induced defects at the chip/bump and bump/substrate interfaces. Using these samples the optimum techniques for inspection of the flip chip attach were developed. This information was used as baseline for the work presented in this paper. This presentation describes the analyses on a set of samples which showed failures after thermal cycling. The failures according to destructive physical analysis were thought to be cracks in the solder joints. However, a one to one correlation could not be seen between acoustic data and initial destructive physical analysis. With further investigation unexpected laminar cracks were discovered under the bond pad and in the surrounding <b>glassivation</b> layers on the silicon die. These were difficult to see in the cross sections unless specifically looked for by referring to the acoustic analysis. The data presented in this paper shows the acoustic images of flip chip samples before and after thermal cycling and describe the acoustic signatures of the defect types along with the supporting correlative analysis...|$|E
