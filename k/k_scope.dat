Measurements at 1. 6 K and 700 Oe in the zero-field-cooled condition, and at 30 Oe after field cooling, indicated that reflectivity close to the first Bragg reflection of the multilayer was significantly dependent on the neutron spin. This effect was interpreted as due to Josephson type vortices at and around the silicon layers...|$|E

Funded by the Wellcome Trust, the purpose of UK 10 K was two-fold: to investigate how low-frequency and rare genetic variants contribute to human disease, and to provide an enduring data resource for future research into human genetics. In this paper, we discuss the challenge of reconciling data-sharing principles with the practicalities of delivering a sequencing project of UK 10 <b>K's</b> <b>scope</b> and magnitude.

Specifically, we focus in depth on the three key issues that emerge in the data pipeline: study recruitment, data release and data access...|$|R

The aim of this research was to study the relationship between the coverage of pregnant women visit <b>K</b> 4 and <b>scope</b> of aid delivery by health providers with Maternal Mortality Rate. In this study uses secondary data from Nganjuk District Offi ce of Healthy Indonesia indicator data and minimum service standards. Research data were take at Nganjuk District Offi ce in March 2009. The research results obtained from the years 2003  2008 a negative correlation in 2003 (r =  0. 483 (*)) and 2007 (r =  0. 445 (*)) which means a connection between the high coverage of pregnant women visit K 4 a decrease in MMR.

30|$|However, these self-adaptive systems {{focus on}} {{specific}} {{goals and objectives}} in comparison to SCOPE. For example, TIRAMOLA focuses on auto-scaling NoSQL databases, while Cumulus only emphasis on minimizing transactions. Similarly, K 8 -Scalar is a tool to evaluate different self-adaptive approaches to auto-scale NoSQL cluster. In <b>SCOPE,</b> <b>K</b> 8 -Scalar {{can be used to}} determine the appropriate threshold value for the auto scale (e.g., when to scale up, scale out, etc). In addition, these systems operate in a single cloud environment and thus they do not sufficiently consolidate the heterogeneity of the underlying complex federated cloud storage setup. In contrast, SCOPE makes dynamic data management decisions across federated clouds and in principle also supports different scaling abilities (e.g., scale up, scale down, scale out, scale in, etc), which are not implied by the above-mentioned systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} of the surface soil layer around different orientation walls was investigated horizontally along several construction-soil micro-gradients in Beijing, China. On a diurnal scale, similar fluctuating trends in T- 0 and T- 50 ({{temperature of}} surface soil layer, 0 and 0. 5 m from the building baseline) adjacent to the external walls of buildings with the same orientation usually appeared under similar micrometeorological conditions. The difference between T- 0 and T- 50 (Delta T 0 - 50) can be considered {{an indicator of the}} intensity of the horizontal heat effects: higher Delta T 0 - 50 values correspond to greater intensities. The values of Delta T 0 - 50 for south-, north-, east-and west-facing sides of buildings were highest on sunny days in summer and exhibited values of 6. 61 K, 1. 64 K, 5. 93 K and 2. 76 <b>K,</b> respectively. The <b>scope</b> of horizontal heat impacts (S-h) changed on a diurnal scale between zero and the maximum, which fluctuated with the micrometeorological conditions. The maximum values of S-h were 0. 30, 0. 15, 0. 20 and 0. 20 m for south-, north-, east-, and west-facing walls. The Delta T 0 - 50 was related to solar radiation, horizontal heat flux, relative humidity, wind speed, soil moisture differences and air temperature; the relative importance of these factors was 36. 22 %, 31. 80 %, 19. 19 %, 2. 67 %, 3. 68 % and 6. 44 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|<b>K.</b> Gödel. Its <b>scope</b> {{and focus}} have changed {{continuously}} {{over the past}} seven decades. The first computers ran numerical software for defense applications. In the 70 ’s, the advent of mainframe computers broadened the scope to include commercial applications. In parallel, large-scale circuit integration allowed exponential increases in computing power (Moore’s law). In the 80 ’s, the convergence between information technologies and telecommunications opened the way for the Internet, the Web and the Information Society. In the 90 ’s, another very important, but less visible, revolution started with the dissemination of embedded systems technologies. More than 95 % of the chips produced today are for embedded applications. These are electronic components integrating software and hardware jointly and specifically designed to provide given functionalities, which are often critical. They are hidden in devices, appliances and equipment of any kind: mobile phones, cameras, home appliances, cars, aircraft, trains, medical devices etc. In 2008, the average person used about 230 embedded chips every day: 80 chips in home appliances, 40 chips at work, 70 chips in cars, 40 chips in portable devices. In the near future, another anticipated, important landmark will be the advent of the Internet of Things {{as the result of the}} convergence between embedded technologies and the Internet. The idea is to use internet technologies to integrate services provided by hundreds of billions of embedded systems. This will require an upgrade of the internet infrastructure to make it more secure, safer and reactive. Current features for exchanging multimedia documents will be extended t...|$|R
