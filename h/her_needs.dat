Her self-assurance becomes {{a major part of}} her personality. Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him {{at the end of her}} previous autobiography that they would never be separated again. Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating <b>her</b> <b>needs</b> to her child's.|$|E

25|$|At age 21 Holliday {{earned a}} degree in {{dentistry}} from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery. He set up practice in Atlanta, Georgia, but he was soon diagnosed with tuberculosis, the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15, having acquired it while tending to <b>her</b> <b>needs</b> while she was still in the contagious phase of the illness. Hoping the climate in the American Southwest would ease his symptoms, he moved to that region and became a gambler, a reputable profession in Arizona in that day. Over the next few years, he reportedly had several confrontations. While in Texas, he saved Wyatt Earp's life and they became friends. In 1880, he joined Earp in Las Vegas, New Mexico and then rode with him to Prescott, Arizona, and then Tombstone. In Tombstone, local members of the outlaw Cochise County Cowboys gang repeatedly threatened him and spread rumors that he had robbed a stage. On October 26, 1881, Holliday was deputized by Tombstone city marshal Virgil Earp. The lawmen attempted to disarm five members of the Cowboys, which resulted in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.|$|E
500|$|The anarcho-communist Joseph Déjacque was {{the first}} person to {{describe}} himself as [...] "libertarian". Unlike Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, he argued that, [...] "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or <b>her</b> <b>needs,</b> whatever may be their nature." [...] In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book, The Ego and Its Own, which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism. French anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution included Anselme Bellegarrigue, Ernest Coeurderoy, Joseph Déjacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon.|$|E

Madonna explained, [...] "Often in my songwriting, I take things people say to me and turn them around, and put it in the first person. So it's actually something that was said to me."

[...] An individualist rather than anarchist communist, Proudhon said that [...] "communism...is the very denial of society in its foundation..."

2500|$|Elisabeth {{emphasised}} her extreme slenderness {{through the}} practice of [...] "tight-lacing". During the peak period of 1859–60, which coincided with Franz-Joseph's political and military defeats in Italy, her sexual withdrawal from her husband after three pregnancies in rapid succession, and her losing battle with her mother-in-law for dominance in rearing her children, she reduced her waist to 16inches in circumference. Corsets of the time were split-busk types, fastening up the front with hooks and eyes, but Elisabeth had more rigid, solid-front ones made in Paris out of leather, [...] "like those of Parisian courtesans", probably to hold up under the stress of such strenuous lacing, [...] "a proceeding which sometimes took quite an hour". The fact that [...] "she only wore them for a few weeks" [...] may indicate that even leather proved inadequate for <b>her</b> <b>needs.</b> Elisabeth's defiant flaunting of this exaggerated dimension angered her mother-in-law, who expected her to be pregnant continuously.|$|E

Other than {{her lack of}} clothing, save a Fused Shadow fragment (powerful magical relics of her race) as a mask, Midna bears elements of her {{original form}}. While in her imp form, Midna frequently speaks in sinister and sarcastic ways, often acting uninterested in the events of Hyrule and/or Link's plight unless they suit <b>her</b> <b>needs.</b> Her bright orange hair is her main method of physical control while she is in imp form and will often use it to deal physical damage or control Link while {{he is in his}} wolf form.
