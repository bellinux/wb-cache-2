The album was released on 29 September, later than first announced, and was Syco's first release in the fourth quarter. Johnston made an appearance at the city-centre Woolworths store in his home town of Carlisle to celebrate the album launch on 1 October, and spoke to reporters for the local paper The Cumberland News, saying [...] "I am really grateful to my local supporters and it is great to take part <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> signing here in Carlisle."

[...] The Torchwood writers conceived John as a classical nemesis for Captain Jack, with Chibnall commenting, [...] "In seeing John you see the way Jack could have gone, and probably did, for a little while." [...] James Marsters further discussed ways in which John is a doppelgänger or foil to Captain Jack: both are pansexual time travellers, with their key difference being that John never reformed. The character exaggerates many of Jack's qualities, for example displaying zoophilic attraction to non-humanoids such as poodles, in addition to men and women. John and Jack's intentional similarities extend to their penchant for period war clothing: ...|$|E
500|$|Evidence of the {{overlapping}} subject matter between the shows, {{as well as}} the conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied. Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock. Fey said, [...] "it's just bad luck for me that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television. I was joking that this would be the best pilot ever aired on Trio. And then Trio got canceled." [...] Fey wound up [...] "beating" [...] Sorkin when Studio 60 was canceled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Though 30 Rocks first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60, Studio 60 was more expensive to produce.|$|E
500|$|The Game {{is often}} {{credited}} as {{a driving force}} in bringing the West Coast hip hop scene back to recognition. Before its release, he expressed his desire to have high opening week sales, saying, [...] "I want to sell a million albums <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> week. And if I only sell one album the following week, I'm good." [...] He also admitted feeling nervous {{about not being able}} to live up to the industry expectations, saying, [...] "Yeah, I've got some butterflies. I'm worried about my first-week numbers, and I'm worried about living up to the hype." [...] The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 586,000 copies in the first week. The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album double Platinum on March 23, 2005, and it was the tenth best-selling record of the year. The album has since sold over 2.5 million units in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{spotted by}} Geoff Cook, Durham's coach, Onions made his second XI debut {{for the club}} {{at the age of}} 18. He was offered a {{contract}} with the club and opted to become a professional cricketer rather than take a sports science choice at university, which was his other option. Onions started in the team as the fourth bowler. Looking back on his early career, he felt that he tried too hard early on. On one occasion he recalled how [...] "I remember being thrown the ball at an important stage of a game at Scarborough, and Phil Jaques hit me for four successive fours. I was thinking 'I'm not sure I can do this.' But Dale Benkenstein was a huge influence as captain, and you have to learn from all those experiences. Otherwise I could not have done what I did <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> season of Test cricket. I often went for 15 to 20 runs <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> three overs, but always came back strongly." [...] In 2006, Onions regularly opened the bowling for Durham with Ottis Gibson.|$|E

One of those is the fear of teeth being broken, which I used <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> film. Another is the claw of an animal, like a saber-toothed tiger reaching with its tremendous hooks.
