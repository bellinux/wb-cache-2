In addition to DMX512, newer control connections include RDM (remote device management) which adds management and status feedback capabilities to devices which use it while maintaining compatibility with DMX512; and Architecture for Control Networks (ACN) which is a fully featured multiple controller networking protocol. These allow the possibility of feedback of position, state or <b>fault</b> <b>conditions</b> from units, whilst allowing much more detailed control of them.|$|E

500|$|At 17:25 GMT on 7 March 2015, {{a charter}} train {{approached}} Wootton Bassett Junction, where the Great Western Main Line and South Wales Main Line diverge at Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire.

Instead he released the brake by operating the AWS isolating cock after the train's speed had been reduced from [...] to about [...] This action had the effect of isolating the AWS and Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS), and rendering them unable to apply the brakes.

2500|$|There are {{two common}} misconceptions about {{the purpose of}} the fuse in a BS 1363 plug, one is that it protects the {{appliance}} connected to the plug, and the other is that it protects against overloading.

BS1363 plugs are required to carry a cartridge fuse, which must conform to BS1362. [...] Post-War Building Studies No. 11, Electrical Installations included the recommendation that Provision should be made in the plug for the accommodation of a cartridge type of fuse for 13amps., and alternatively, for 3amps. Fuses of these ratings should be interchangeable and be readily identified. [...] The original BS1363:1947 specified fuse ratings of 3A, 7A and 13A. The current version of the fuse standard, BS1362:1973, allows any fuse rating up to 13A, with 3A (coloured red) and 13A (coloured brown) as the preferred (but not mandated) values when used in a plug.

40|$|SummaryThe dynamic {{stability}} of Squirrel Cage Induction Generators (SCIG) based wind turbines may {{be improved by}} Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM). At the time of starting of wind farm and during short circuit fault the voltage of bus connecting the wind farm reduces drastically (Chen, 2005). A controller for the STATCOM has been developed with its capability to coordinate between the positive and the negative sequences of the grid voltage. This paper investigates effects of Squirrel Cage Induction Generator (SCIG) in combination with a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) under normal and during <b>fault</b> <b>condition</b> (Inwai et al., 2005). The {{results show that the}} STATCOM can regulate the fast changing voltage at the point of common coupling between the wind farm and the grid in normal and during <b>fault</b> <b>condition.</b> Also it can supply the active power during the short circuit <b>fault</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R
