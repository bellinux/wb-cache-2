40|$|Introduction Fungal {{pathogens}} {{are integral}} components of healthy natural forest ecosystems. where {{they play a}} major role in eliminating weak and unfit trees (Manion 1981; Burdon 1991; Castello et al. 1995). They also affect species occurrence and distribution, especially in the regeneration layer (Castello et al. 1995). Soil-borne pathogens, in particular, are thought to be important in maintaining plant species diversity and distribution (Augspurger and Kelly 1984; Bever et al. 1997; Mills and Bever 1998; Packer and Clay 2000). It is hypothesised that seedlings close to their parents or other conspecific trees are more likely to he killed by host specific soil-borne pathogens than seedlings further away. Over time, this results in a shift in the juvenile population away from the adults. This relationship has been demonstrated between the temperate tree Prunus serotina and the pathogen Pythium (Packer and Clay 2000) and also for seedling damping off of the tropical tree Platypodium eIegans caused by a variety of soil-borne pathogens (Augspurger and Kelly 1984). Interestingly, canker fungi also have been shown to impart a similar effect on the distribution of the tropical tree Ocotea whitei (Gilbert et al. 1994). Higher levels of light intensity, such as those experienced in light gaps caused by fallen trees, reduce both pathogen activity and the net impact of pathogens (Augspurger and Kelly 1984; Castello et al. 1995). The epidemiology and visual impact of indigenous pathogens in natural forest ecosystems is greatly minimised by genetic diversity. Here, trees and their pathogens have co-evolved and the population structure of the hosts is characterised by genetic and age diversity (Manion 1981; Hansen 1999). Consequently, individuals in a mature tree population will vary in their susceptibility to a particular pathogen. Usually, the tree is not susceptible throughout its life cycle, consequently, some individuals in some age classes may be susceptible, but not the whole population. Large populations of susceptible trees do not develop and therefore, widespread disease epidemics cannot occur. This immunity of natural ecosystems to disease epidemics can be overcome in two ways. Firstly, either a natural or human disturbance could result in (lie growth of an <b>even</b> <b>aged</b> <b>stand</b> of a single species that may then be susceptible to an indigenous pathogen. Secondly, virulent pathogens, to which the trees have no resistance, could be introduced to a natural ecosystem. Introduced pathogens often lead to the elimination of entire species and result in permanent changes in the species composition of an ecosystem. Ineffective quarantine has often led to epidemics in indigenous and exotic tree populations caused by introduced fungal pathogens (Old and Dudzinski 1998; Palm 1999). Examples of mass destruction of indigenous forests due to fungal pathogens include Chestnut Blight caused by Cryphonnectria parasitica (Anagnostakis 1987), Dutch Elm Disease caused by Ophiostoma ulmi and 0. novo-ulmi in Europe and North America (Brasier 1991; Hubbes 1999) and Cypress Canker in Europe caused by Seiridium cardinale (Graniti 1998). Destructive epidemics caused by fungi in natural woody ecosystems, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, have been covered extensively elsewhere (Anagnostakis 1987; Brasier 1991; Granti 1998; Hubbes 1999). In this chapter, we will rather focus on pathogens of eucalypts in their native range in Australia and in exotic plantations elsewhere in the world. Emphasis is placed in the importance of the origin of a pathogen and the structure of the host plantation...|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{of the methods}} used to {{determine}} site index is tree height. Determining site index is achieved by measuring and averaging the total height and age of trees found on that site.

The two taxa are interfertile, have overlapping flowering times and share a common set of insect and vertebrate pollinators. Previous genetic analysis of both taxa from two geographically remote sites suggested that the two were morphotypes rather than genetically distinct species. In this study we further explore this hypothesis of genic species by expanding sampling broadly through their sympatric locations and examine local-scale spatial genetic structure in stands that differ in species and age composition. Delineation of populations at five microsatellite loci, using an individual-based approach and Bayesian modelling, as well as clustering of individuals based on allele frequencies showed the two species to be molecularly homogeneous. Genetic structure aligned largely with geographic areas of origin, and followed an isolation-by-distance model, where proximal populations were generally less differentiated than more distant ones. At the stand level, spotted gums also generally showed little structure consistent with the high levels of gene flow inferred across the species range.

The forest ecosystem which was studied is located at 1550 m elevation. For statistical analysis of the data were used classical statistical methods: analysis of statistical indicators (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, etc.) and the distribution of the number of trees in diameter classes. Description of the spatial structure of the forest ecosystem was analyzed by point process analysis techniques in relation to the basal diameter at both individual species and total stand (univariate and bivariate Ripley K function). The distribution of the number of trees per hectare on diameter classes for the Norway spruce (Picea abies), stone pine (Pinus cembra) and Mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) is typical to the relatively <b>even</b> <b>aged</b> <b>stands.</b> Norway spruce, Mountain ash and total trees stand curves have a positively skewed distribution to the left while stone pine curve has a negatively skewed distribution to the right.

Stone pine has an aggregate structure and Mountain ash a randomized spatial structure. In the case of Norway spruce and total stand the trees with the diameter lower than 20 cm have an aggregate structure until the distance of 20 m and after it become randomized.

40|$|In Italy the {{prescribed}} silvicultural system for beech high forests has usually been the uniform shelterwood system. This system {{has not always}} been carried out and completed in the sequence codified by the literature. Consequently, beech forests show highly variable structures which do not meet the canons of classical silviculture. On the other hand, selection felling has usually been considered inadequate for beech forests because of the supposed &# 8220;natural&# 8221; tendency of this species towards <b>even</b> <b>aged</b> structures and of the belief that only <b>even</b> <b>aged</b> beech <b>stands</b> produce high quality timber.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the pyric environment that influences the crown fire initiation and spread in Aleppo pine forests in Greece. Regression equations that predict the canopy fuel load by diameter class were developed for Aleppo pine in northern Evia, Greece. The log/log transformation of the allometric model y=axb gave the best fit for all crown fuel components except the branches with diameter > 7. 5 cm. The R 2 values were between 0. 82 and 0. 88 and SEE were small. Forty Aleppo pine trees were classified into groups according to their expected available canopy fuel load, by applying multivariate statistical methods (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Canonical Discriminant Analysis) on the values of their most significant dendrometric characteristics (diameter at breast height, total height, live crown length, crown width). Inventory of the critical canopy fuel characteristics that influence the initiation and spread of crown fires was conducted in representative Aleppo pine stands in the Kassandra peninsula, Greece. Vertical profiles of available canopy fuel load, canopy base height and canopy bulk density are presented. Aleppo pine crown fuel complexes are characterized by low canopy base height, while available canopy fuel load and canopy bulk density values are similar with other conifer fuel types worldwide. Crown fire behavior (probability of crown fire initiation, fire type, crown fire rate of spread, fireline intensity and flame length) in Aleppo pine stands with various surface fuel types and under various meteorological conditions, was simulated with modern and field-tested models of crown fire prediction. The simulation results indicated that crown fires in Aleppo pines forests cover a wide range of expected fire behavior. The probability of crown fire initiation was found high and passive crown fires and high intensity active crown fires were observed in uneven <b>aged</b> and <b>even</b> <b>aged</b> <b>stands,</b> respectively. Assessment of potential crown fire behavior is required in regional fire management planning and suppression tactics. Nomographs for the calculation of the pyric parameters (probability of crown fire initiation, active crown fire rate of spread, fireline intensity and flame length) of crown fires burning in the Aleppo pines stands in Greece were created. Fuel complexes typical of Aleppo pine forests were comprised and used as inputs to recent models of crown fire prediction, in order to calculate the pyric parameters under a wide range of environmental conditions. The results are considered as realistic, based on common experience of crown fire behavior in conifer forests, worldwide. Such nomographs are presented for the first time in Greece and are expected to offer substantial help to fire management practice. Fuel treatments that affect crown fire behavior in Aleppo pine stands were simulated under extreme and normal fuel moisture conditions. Treatments were simulated by adjusting surface fuels (total load, load-by-size class, depth) and canopy fuels (available canopy fuel load, canopy base height, canopy bulk density). Under typical conditions, stand thinning followed by prescribed burning and/or controlled grazing with slash removal avert crown fire initiation in most cases. Restoration of Aleppo pines ecosystems must include an analysis of how proposed treatments affect fuel structures. Fuel treatments must be incorporated in the forest management plan of Aleppo pine forests in Greece. ...|$|R

40|$|Student Number : 0115350 V - MSc {{dissertation}} - School of Plant, Animal and Environmental Science - Faculty of ScienceThe {{effect of}} between-tree competition in separate <b>even</b> <b>aged</b> <b>stands</b> of a Eucalyptus grandis seedling {{and a single}} Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla hybrid clone was assessed. This was done by comparing treatments within an experiment, {{that was designed to}} test the effect planting density and genotype had on timber production and stand dynamics through time. This experiment is located on an escarpment in the Summer rainfall region of South Africa, approximately 7 km North West of Albert Falls dam in the Kwa-Zulu Natal Midlands. The terrain is flat with deep apedal soils, and the site has an estimated mean annual precipitation of 1143 mm. The simplest method of evaluating competition effects in plantation stands is through the use of spacing trials. Spacing trials create stands/plots in which all silvicultural and climatic variables are constant. Differences between treatments can then be attributed to competition alone. The planting densities tested were 6667 stems. ha- 1, 3333 stems. ha- 1, 2222 stems. ha- 1, 1587 stems. ha- 1 and 1111 stems. ha- 1 respectively. Competition was measured at three levels, namely; (i) individual tree, (ii) size-class and (iii) stand level. Vigour and its distribution within the population were used to explain competition processes. Basal area was chosen as the size variable for which vigour would be analysed. Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and Relative Production Rate (RPR) were chosen as the measures of vigour for analysis. Morphological changes in the trees as a result of competition were also used to understand the competitive mechanisms. It was found that resources are not shared amongst individuals in proportion to their size, but rather the larger individuals use disproportionately more of the resources than the smaller individuals, and therefore competition is asymmetrical. The dominant form of competition was found to be resource pre-emption where larger individuals passively prevent solar resources from reaching smaller competitors. Using RPR as the measure of vigour, competition was found to be one-sided, meaning that smaller individuals do not reduce the vigour of larger ones. If RGR is accepted as the measure of vigour then competition is two-sided meaning that the smaller individuals do reduce the vigour of the larger ones to a certain extent. There was no difference in {{the degree to which the}} smaller competitors in the clonal and seedling treatments reduced the growth of the larger individuals. The self-thinning rate in the seedling treatments was significantly higher than in the clonal treatments. Increases in mean tree size and production per hectare were accompanied by increases in mortality in the seedling treatments. In the clonal treatments it was found that even once the mean tree size approached the self thinning line, very few or no trees died, however there was also very little or no increase in mean tree size. When the relationship between number of live trees and production per hectare was analysed it was found that the clone could increase production per hectare without any change in survivorship, which is contrary to popular theory. As time progressed the skewness of the population progressed from negative to positive. This increase was the most pronounced in the higher planting density treatments, and the clonal treatments. The size variability in the population first decreased, then steadily increased. This increase was more pronounced in the high planting density treatments, and the clonal treatments. Clones and seedlings react in very different ways to competition. The large differences in population dynamics observed, indicate that we cannot just apply knowledge built up over the years regarding the management of Eucalyptus grandis and other plantation species to Eucalyptus hybrid clones...|$|R

The second report treats the error owing to the height of measurement. If the stem curves of all trees are identical and expressed by Kunze 2 ̆ 7 s stem curve equation and gamma is about 2 in the stand, the diameter d _ 2 at a distance l cm from the breast height is expressed by Equation(1), where d 1 is d. b. h. and A is tan alpha (see fig. 1). Then, if the diameter is measured by equal frequency within l cm {{above and below the}} breast height, the variance of d is expressed by Equation(3), where V(d _ 1) =V(D _ 1 t) + 1 / 12 (R̅^ 2 + sigma R^ 2) (see the first report), V (ε) is…sigma^ 2 by the least square solution, and V(l) = 1 / 3 (i^ 2 + sigma ^ 2). In the practical stand, gamma ≠ 2, and, especially, in the <b>even</b> <b>aged</b> artificial <b>stand,</b> the variation of height is smaller than the variation of d. b. h. The stem curves of all trees, therefore, are not identical in the stand. In this case, the equation corresponding to (1) is (12 ̆ 7), so that the variance of d _ 2 is expressed by (32 ̆ 7). Since these data were taken from the even-aged artificial stand, Equation (32 ̆ 7) is used. Inserting the practical data in Equation (32 ̆ 7), the increase of variance owing to both the variations of height and direction of measurement is 0. 4 per cent, and the increase of variance owing to the variation of height of measurement only is 0. 05 per cent. The variation of height, therefore, is out of the question. In the sampling survey, the difference between the center of measurement height and breast height is permitted to about 95 cm, but in the every tree measurement, the difference is permitted to about 5. 3 cm. In the every tree measurement, therefore, care must be taken so that the center of measurement height be located within about 5 cm from the breast height...|$|R
