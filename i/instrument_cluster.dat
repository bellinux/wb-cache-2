25|$|Early 1980-1985 models {{featured}} butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only {{a single}} set of tail lights {{on each side of}} the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster,</b> and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project is to design and develop a GUI (graphical user interface) based Driver {{information}} system. <b>Instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> are the traditional readout meters available in the dashboard of cars and motorbikes. In regard of the conventional meters that are in existence, the analog meters have disadvantages in lack of storage capability and accuracy whereas digital meters have display problems in dim light areas. In order to overcome these disadvantages the <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> can be controlled and made user friendly {{with the help of}} GUI. Graphical User Interface allows the drivers to interact with <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> using images rather than text commands and command line arguments. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and ease of use for the underlying logical design. These actions are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements. This can be implemented in <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> with the help of. NET software along with the assistance of MS access as back end tool...|$|R
50|$|Electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> {{are being}} {{increasingly}} common features on railway vehicles, in which individual instruments {{are replaced by}} various forms of digital readouts. Early uses of <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> often employed LEDs to display analog-type or numeric readings for pressure gauges, electrical gauges, and other displays. They have been increasingly integrated with various cab signalling systems and together with the installation of multi-function displays, have simplified the cab layout and improved user interaction with the engineer.|$|R
25|$|In {{the event}} of a warning, the door chime played three times rapidly and then played the voice alert. This {{happened}} twice in case the driver missed the warning the first time. Every alert also had a corresponding light on the <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Australian U13 Bluebirds were {{available}} in three different models, LX—the base model but very well equipped, Ti—the luxury model, and the SSS—the sports model. Compared to the LX, the Ti had climate control, a sunroof, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> (automatic models only). while comparing the LX to the SSS, the SSS had a HUD (heads-up display—digital speedo on windscreen), climate control, fog lights, ski-port, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> (automatic models only). Despite there being a sports model (SSS), the LX was the fastest of the Australian models due to having the least weight. The engine used in the Australian and US U13 models was the KA24DE (112kW, 210Nm of torque).|$|E
25|$|In 2000 a few {{minor changes}} {{were made to the}} Clio range, which {{included}} revised specification levels, a new <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster,</b> and a passenger airbag fitted as standard for all models. The Clio achieved a four-star Euro NCAP rating in 2000, which was class-leading at the time.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers such as BMW, Honda, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz have {{included}} fuel-economy gauges in some <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters,</b> showing fuel mileage in real time. The ammeter was the gauge {{of choice for}} monitoring {{the state of the}} charging system until the 1970s. Later it was replaced by the voltmeter. Today most family vehicles have warning lights instead of voltmeters or oil pressure gauges in their dashboard <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters,</b> though sports cars often have proper gauges for performance purposes and driver appeasement.|$|R
50|$|Series {{production}} Night View Assist system {{introduced in}} 2005 on the redesigned Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W221). It {{was the first}} system to use the <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster's</b> LCD as a display.|$|R
50|$|TFT LCDs {{are also}} used in car <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> because they allow the driver to {{customize}} the cluster, {{as well as being}} able to provide a skeuomorphic, analog-like display with digital elements.|$|R
25|$|Toyota GT86 Modellista is {{a version}} of Toyota 86 with new side skirts, rear bumper and diffuser, a special lip spoiler, 18 inch matte chrome “Wing Dancer II” wheels with 225/40 Toyo tires, a {{two-tone}} black and red interior, <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> and interior panels are in a red metal finish.|$|E
25|$|The S1 Esprit was {{distinguished}} from later Esprits by its shovel-style front air dam, Fiat X1/9-sourced taillights, absence of body-side ducting, and Wolfrace alloy wheels. Inside the car, the S1 Esprit had a one-piece <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> with green-faced Veglia gauges. The S1 is rare today, mostly due to drivetrain problems.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the GS 460, the GS lineup received a mid-cycle styling refresh, including a revised front bumper, headlights and grille, turn signals added to the side mirrors, and new wheel options and exterior colors. The interior received a redesigned steering wheel, revised <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> gauges, and different trim pieces.|$|E
2500|$|Ford {{purchased}} {{the site in}} 1936, and spent nearly $800,000 refurbishing, updating, and equipping the plant. [...] The plant opened in 1941, and employed up to 279 people making ammeters, gauges, and <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{air core}} gauge is a {{specific}} type of rotary actuator in an analog display gauge that allows an indicator to rotate a full 360 degrees. It is used in gauges and displays, most commonly automotive <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters.</b>|$|R

The SSZ was discontinued upon arrival of the VE series.|$|E
25|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the GS 460, the GS lineup received a mid-cycle styling refresh, including a revised front bumper, headlights and grille, turn signals added to the side mirrors, and new wheel options and exterior colors. Inside the vehicle, the GS received a redesigned steering wheel, revised <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> gauges, and different trim pieces.|$|E
50|$|Vehicle {{instruments}} {{have been}} augmented by software-powered display panels conveying information on display panels. Digital instruments present {{data in the}} form of numeric parameters, textual messages, or graphical gauges. Unlike the electro-mechanical <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> of the past, these interactive displays are much more versatile and flexible.|$|R
40|$|Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) of {{tell-tale}} <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> is the extensively researched area in automobile industries due to {{its simplicity}} in inspection line and its reliability.

5000|$|HS-SE {{stands for}} [...] "High speed, Single-ended Electrical." [...] This {{is the fastest}} {{electrical}} slice. It sends a gigabit per second, but the 8 meter range limits its usage to <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters.</b> However, the modulation and link control features of this standard are also used by the wide-area fiber optic protocols.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{interior}} uncluttered, a number of convenience functions were integrated into multifunction controls. For example, the power windows and mirrors were controlled by a single instrument. Also, the center-mounted <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> was canted slightly toward the driver. The displacement of these gauges {{to the middle of the}} dash was intended to offer an unimpeded view of the hood and the road ahead.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 models saw a new semiconcave squared {{tail light}} {{design and the}} five-dial <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> with a round {{speedometer}} at the very center. The best change for the year appeared {{in the form of}} the fully synchronized 150-T model three-speed manual transmission as standard equipment, meaning the end of non-synchromesh units in VAM cars. The new transmission was joined by a 3.73:1 rear differential gear ratio. Hazard lights were added to the standard equipment list.|$|E
25|$|The <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> and the {{infotainment}} panel {{are driven}} by separate Nvidia Tegra 3 3D Visual Computing Modules. Tesla was the first company to ship this technology. (Audi later delivered this technology in its 2013 model year in Europe, and in North America in 2014.) The Tegra {{system on a chip}} (SoC) integrates eight specialized processors, including a multi-core ARM CPU, a GPU, and dedicated audio, video and image processors. Nvidia claimed that it consumes 2% of the energy of a typical CPU.|$|E

Sporadic-E layers {{are related}} to the neutral {{enhancements}} via ion-neutral coupling (Raizada et al. 2011, 2012), any structure-like appearance of billow-like features are usually linked to dynamical instabilities (Sarkhel et al. 2012 b). In order to address this aspect comprehensively, further investigations involving <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters</b> are needed (Mathews 1996).|$|R
50|$|COQOS is {{a highly}} {{scalable}} software framework for in-car head units, <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters,</b> connectivity boxes, or driver assistance systems. Its hypervisor-based architecture {{makes it possible to}} run several separated software partitions on a single processor. Within such a partition, COQOS supports both AUTOSAR real time automotive functions and full operating systems like Linux and Android™.|$|R
50|$|Another popular {{cosmetic}} upgrade {{were the}} AMG body kits. These ranged from subtle front spoilers, to an aggressive Wide Body kits for the W126 coupes. Other options included Recaro seats, smaller diameter steering wheels, <b>instrument</b> <b>clusters,</b> chrome delete option (all brightworks colour-coded or painted satin black), refrigerators, shift knobs, hi-fi stereo systems, custom upholstery and enhanced interior wood packages.|$|R
25|$|The GT-R had a {{significantly}} larger intercooler, larger brakes, and aluminium front guards and bonnet. Other distinguishing features include flared front and rear wheel arches. More supportive seats were fitted, and the turbo boost gauge and digital clock were removed from inside the <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster.</b> The clock was replaced with a torque meter that indicated how much torque was being delivered to the front wheels (0%–50%). Oil temp, voltage, and turbo boost gauges were fitted just above the climate control.|$|E
25|$|Up front, the {{passenger}} seat also folds flat, accommodating long items like surf boards or allowing drivers to use the tray in its back to hold items like a laptop computer. An electronic device can be charged with the 115 volt/100 watt power inverter(US models only). The first year of production (2003), the <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster</b> was completely red. However, the next year, Toyota made the numbers white while keeping {{the rest of the}} gauges red. When the car was updated in 2005, a digital clock was added to the radio bezel.|$|E
25|$|The XG was {{essentially}} an update of the XF. It gained the EB II's 4.0-l OHC inline six-cylinder engine, {{with either a}} five-speed manual or four-speed auto transmissions (floor or column shift), meaning Ford could retire the old engine and transmission options. It also gained interior updates from the EB including the <b>instrument</b> <b>cluster,</b> centre console (in two-seater models), steering wheel, and seats. Exterior changes were minimal, and included an EB-style grill, black window trims (as opposed to chrome on XF's) EB style door 'rubbing' strips, and indicator lights on the front quarter panels.|$|E
