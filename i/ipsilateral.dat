5|$|Stage 2A: Unilateral tumor with {{incomplete}} gross resection; identifiable <b>ipsilateral</b> and contralateral {{lymph node}} negative for tumor.|$|E
5|$|Stage 2B: Unilateral tumor with {{complete}} or incomplete gross resection; with <b>ipsilateral</b> lymph node positive for tumor; identifiable contralateral lymph node negative for tumor.|$|E
25|$|Compression of the <b>ipsilateral</b> {{posterior}} {{cerebral artery}} will result in ischemia of the <b>ipsilateral</b> primary visual cortex and contralateral visual field deficits in both eyes (contralateral homonymous hemianopsia).|$|E
25|$|Hemifacial {{sensorimotor}} seizures {{are often}} entirely localised {{in the lower}} lip or spread to the <b>ipsilateral</b> hand. Motor manifestations are sudden, continuous or bursts of clonic contractions, usually lasting from {{a few seconds to}} a minute. <b>Ipsilateral</b> tonic deviation of the mouth is also common. Hemifacial sensory symptoms consist of unilateral numbness mainly {{in the corner of the}} mouth.|$|E
25|$|At diagnosis, 30% of renal cell carcinomas {{have spread}} to the <b>ipsilateral</b> renal vein, and 5–10% have {{continued}} into the inferior vena cava.|$|E
25|$|Early stage {{disease is}} {{associated}} with a relatively favourable outcome, for which single modality therapy is recommended, the choice depending on tumour location and accessibility. For instance unilateral tonsil or tongue base tumours will generally be treated with transoral resection and selective <b>ipsilateral</b> neck dissection. On the other hand, a large midline tongue lesion would require bilateral neck dissection, but in the absence of what are considered adverse pathology (positive margins, extracapsular extension) will likely be treated by surgery alone or radiation including <b>ipsilateral</b> or bilateral neck radiation fields, with surgery for those instances where the likelihood of adjuvant therapy is low.|$|E
25|$|Some sensory {{information}} from the teeth and jaws is sent from the principal nucleus to the <b>ipsilateral</b> thalamus via the small dorsal trigeminal tract. Touch-position {{information from the}} teeth and jaws of {{one side of the}} face is represented bilaterally in the thalamus and cortex.|$|E
25|$|This {{results in}} a HPV+OPC tumour being given a lower stage than if it were HPV-OPC. For instance, a 5cm tumour with one <b>ipsilateral</b> node {{involved}} that is 5cm in size but has ECE would be considered T3N3bM0 Stage IVB if HPV- but T3N1M0 Stage II if HPV+.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{finding is}} a false localizing sign, the so-called Kernohan's notch, which results from compression of the contralateral cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal and some corticobulbar tract fibers. This leads to <b>Ipsilateral</b> hemiparesis {{in reference to the}} herniation and contralateral hemiparesis with reference to the cerebral crus.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{untested}} {{hypothesis that}} claims that referred itch uses the spinocervical tract pathway. The cells in this tract {{lie in the}} dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and its axons run in the <b>ipsilateral</b> and dorsolateral quadrant, {{which is consistent with}} observations that stimuli in the trigger points are <b>ipsilateral</b> to the sites of referred sensations. These axons project to the thalamus and midbrain, suggesting that the thalamus is involved in the phenomenon. The cells in this tract are also excited by mechanical stimuli, lending support that this pathway can explain the mechanism of referred itch. Central neuronal damage to this area – either direct or secondary to peripheral nerve damage – makes it an area of focal hyperexcitability or reduced inhibition. This hypothesis {{has been found to be}} unlikely because there would be an expected progression of itches (i.e., from legs to trunk, and from trunk to neck). However, there is no symmetrical distribution found between trigger zones and sites of referred sensation.|$|E
25|$|Output neglect {{includes}} {{motor and}} pre-motor deficits. A patient with motor neglect {{does not use}} a contralesional limb despite the neuromuscular ability to do so. One with pre-motor neglect, or directional hypokinesia, can move unaffected limbs ably in <b>ipsilateral</b> space but have difficulty directing them into contralesional space. Thus a patient with pre-motor neglect may struggle to grasp an object {{on the left side}} even when using the unaffected right arm.|$|E
25|$|The lateral lemniscus {{is located}} where the {{cochlear}} nuclei and the pontine reticular formation (PRF) crossover. The PRF descends the reticulospinal tract where it innervates motor neurons and spinal interneurons. It {{is the main}} auditory tract in the brainstem that connects the superior olivary complex (SOC) with the inferior colliculus (IC). The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) has input from the LL and output to the contralateral LL via the <b>ipsilateral</b> and contralateral Dorsal Acoustic Stria.|$|E
25|$|The SIEA flap {{design is}} more or less similar to the DIEAP flap design, however, it is perfused by {{different}} blood vessels. The superficial epigastric vessels branch off the common femoral vessels in the groin area and vascularise the <b>ipsilateral</b> lower hemi-abdomen. Unlike the DIEAP flap the SIEA flap is not a perforator flap, because the vessels do not perforate the abdominal wall musculature. Therefore, the flap can be raised without incising the anterior rectus sheath and dissecting within the rectus muscles and thus further reducing the chance of donor site morbidity.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} due to focal seizures differ {{depending on}} {{the region of the}} brain where the seizure occurs. For example, visual hallucinations during occipital lobe seizures are typically visions of brightly colored, geometric shapes that may move across the visual field, multiply, or form concentric rings and generally persist from a few seconds to a few minutes. They are usually unilateral and localized to one part of the visual field on the contralateral side of the seizure focus, typically the temporal field. However, unilateral visions moving horizontally across the visual field begin on the contralateral side and move toward the <b>ipsilateral</b> side.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a visual}} cortex in each {{hemisphere}} of the brain, {{much of which}} {{is located in the}} Occipital lobe. The left hemisphere visual cortex receives signals mainly from the right visual field and the right visual cortex mainly from the left visual field, although each cortex receives a considerable amount of information from the <b>ipsilateral</b> visual field as well. The visual cortex also receives information from subcortical regions, such as the lateral geniculate body, located in the thalamus. However, ample evidence indicates that object identity and location are preferentially processed in ventral (occipito-temporal) and dorsal (occipito-parietal) cortical visual streams, respectively.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in the neural {{plasticity}} underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and inhibitory interneuron loss. Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes hyperexcitability, and downregulation of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (sensory neuron specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons and are restricted to the <b>ipsilateral</b> (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of postherpetic neuralgia.|$|E
25|$|With a {{contralateral}} (opposite side) autogenous patellar tendon graft, the graft {{includes the}} middle {{section of the}} patellar tendon along with two attached bone plugs one on each end. The contralateral autogenous patellar tendon graft is rarely used as primary revision due to the concern of donor site morbidity. Instead it is primarily considered when a patient is opposed to using an allograft but has already undergone an ACL revision using the <b>ipsilateral</b> patellar tendon. In addition, there are many health care settings around the nation where readily available, safe, and cost effective allograft tissues are not obtainable. In this situation the contralateral autogenous Patellar tendon graft {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
25|$|Eversion and inversion: Stretching the {{eversion}} and inversion muscles {{allows for}} better {{range of motion}} to the ankle joint. Seated ankle elevations and depressions will stretch the peroneus and tibilalis muscles {{that are associated with}} these movements as they lengthen. Eversion muscles are stretched when the ankle becomes depressed from the starting position. In like manner, the inversion muscles are stretched when the ankle joint becomes elevated. Throughout this seated stretch, the ankle joint is to remain supported while depressed and elevated with the <b>ipsilateral</b> (same side) hand in order to sustain the stretch for 10–15 seconds. This stretch will increase overall eversion and inversion muscle group length and provide more flexibility to the ankle joint for larger range of motion during activity.|$|E
25|$|The nucleus geniculatus lateralis {{is made up}} of {{different}} cellular strata separated by lamellae, parallel to the surface. The stratae 1 and 2, the most ventral, are magnocellular. The other are mediocellular. From the retina, the axons of the optic nerves go directly to the geniculate nuclei. The nasal component of the optic nerves (the axons issued from the nasal field of the retina of both sides) crosses at the chiasma.The axons of the temporal field do not cross. This is very important in clinical neurology. After the chiasma, axons form the visual tracts turning around the peduncles and arriving into the polar anterior part of the geniculate nucleus. Retinal axons from the controlateral retina end in stratae 1,4 and 6. Those from the <b>ipsilateral</b> retina end in 2,3 and 5. The axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus, through the optic radiation, end in the primary visual cortex around the calcarine fissure. See visual system.|$|E
25|$|Referred itch is the {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} stimulus applied in one region {{of the body is}} felt as an itch or irritation in {{a different part of the}} body. The syndrome is relatively harmless, though it can be irritating, and healthy individuals can express symptoms. Stimuli range from a firm pressure applied to the skin – a scratch – to irritation or pulling on a hair follicle on the skin. The referred sensation itself should not be painful; it is more of an irritating prickle leading to the compulsion to scratch the area. The stimulus and referred itch are <b>ipsilateral</b> (the stimulus and the referred itch occur on the same side of the body). Also, because scratching or putting pressure on the referred itch does not cause the stimulus area to itch, the relationship between the stimulus and the referred itch is unidirectional. The itching sensation is spontaneous and can cease with continued stimulation.|$|E
500|$|Brown-Séquard {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the spinal cord is injured on one side {{much more than the}} other. It is rare for the spinal cord to be truly hemisected (severed on one side), but partial lesions due to penetrating wounds (such as gunshot or knife wounds) or fractured vertebrae or tumors are [...] common. On the <b>ipsilateral</b> side of the injury (same side), the body loses motor function, proprioception, and senses of vibration and touch. On the contralateral (opposite side) of the injury, there is a loss of pain and temperature sensations.|$|E
500|$|Damage to the {{accessory}} nerve (XI) {{will lead to}} <b>ipsilateral</b> weakness in the trapezius muscle. This can be tested by asking the subject to raise their shoulders or shrug, upon which the shoulder blade (scapula) will protrude into a winged position. [...] Additionally, if the nerve is damaged, weakness or an inability to elevate the scapula may be present because the levator scapulae muscle is now solely able to provide this function. Depending on {{the location of the}} lesion there may also be weakness present in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which acts to turn the head so that the face points to the opposite side.|$|E
500|$|Lesions of {{the facial}} nerve (VII) may {{manifest}} as facial palsy. This is where a person is unable to move the muscles on one or both sides of their face. A very common and generally temporary facial palsy is known as Bell's palsy. [...] Bell's Palsy is the result of an idiopathic (unknown), unilateral lower motor neuron lesion {{of the facial}} nerve and is characterized by an inability to move the <b>ipsilateral</b> muscles of facial expression, including elevation of the eyebrow and furrowing of the forehead. [...] Patients with Bell's palsy often have a drooping mouth on the affected side and often have trouble chewing because the buccinator muscle is affected.|$|E
500|$|Cranial nerves have paths {{within and}} outside of the skull. [...] The paths within the skull are called [...] "intracranial" [...] and the paths outside the skull are called [...] "extracranial". [...] There are many holes in the skull called [...] "foramina" [...] by which the nerves can exit the skull. All cranial nerves are paired, which means that they occur on both the right and left sides of the body. The muscle, skin, or {{additional}} function supplied by a nerve {{on the same side of}} the body as the side it originates from, is referred to an <b>ipsilateral</b> function. If the function is on the opposite side to the origin of the nerve, this is known as a contralateral function.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ipsilateral</b> (...) : on {{the same}} side as another structure. For example, the left arm is <b>ipsilateral</b> to the left leg.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{defined as}} a {{mononeuritis}} [...] (involving only one nerve), people diagnosed with Bell’s palsy may have [...] "myriad neurological symptoms" [...] including [...] "facial tingling, moderate or severe headache/neck pain, memory problems, balance problems, <b>ipsilateral</b> limb paresthesias, <b>ipsilateral</b> limb weakness, {{and a sense of}} clumsiness" [...] that are [...] "unexplained by facial nerve dysfunction".|$|E
2500|$|The table below {{shows that}} each of the nuclei have a {{complicated}} arrangement of <b>ipsilateral</b> and contralateral afferent inputs and outputs: ...|$|E
2500|$|For example: {{compression}} to {{the facial}} nerve causes a lesion and the set of axons that innervates the orbicularis oris (mouth muscle) degenerate. [...] Once the compression has relieved, regeneration of axons from the lesion site begins. This time though, only 50% of the set of axons that innervate the orbicularis oris successfully reinnervate the original site. The other half aberrantly branched off and innervated the orbicularis oculi(eye muscle). Thus, when the patient purses their lips, the <b>ipsilateral</b> eye will squint.|$|E
2500|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} {{toward the}} ventral intermediate {{nucleus of the}} thalamus and potentially the subthalamic nucleus and caudal zona incerta nucleus {{have been shown to}} reduce tremor in numerous studies. [...] That toward the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus has been shown to reduce contralateral and some <b>ipsilateral</b> tremor along with tremors of the cerebellar outflow, head, resting state and those related to hand tasks; however, the treatment has been shown to induce difficulty articulating thoughts (dysarthria), and loss of coordination and balance in long-term studies. [...] Motor cortex stimulation is another option shown to be viable in numerous clinical trials.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007-2009 279 {{patients}} underwent primary ACL reconstruction surgery {{with the}} use of the contralateral autogenous patellar tendon graft while 58 control patients had the same surgery but with an <b>ipsilateral</b> patellar tendon. [...] When it came comparing the quadriceps muscles to the pre-operative baseline test those who used the contralateral patellar tendon graft had significantly more strength in the ACL reconstruction leg and this held true in the 2 year follow up measurements as well. The study concluded that the use of the contralateral patellar tendon graft does not leave the patient with unresolved donor-site strength loss.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{explained}} by the anatomy of the brainstem. In the medulla, the ascending spinothalamic tract (which carries pain-temperature information from {{the opposite side of}} the body) is adjacent to the ascending spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve (which carries pain-temperature information from the same side of the face). A stroke which cuts off the blood supply to this area (for example, a clot in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery) destroys both tracts simultaneously. The result is a loss of pain-temperature (but not touch-position) sensation in a [...] "checkerboard" [...] pattern (<b>ipsilateral</b> face, contralateral body), facilitating diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Glomus tympanicum and Glomus jugulare: Both {{commonly}} {{present as}} a middle ear mass resulting in tinnitus (in 80%) and hearing loss (in 60%). [...] The cranial nerves of the jugular foramen may be compressed, resulting swallowing difficulty, or <b>ipsilateral</b> {{weakness of the}} upper trapezius and sternocleiodomastoid muscles (from compression of the spinal accessory nerve). [...] These patients present with a reddish bulge behind an intact ear drum. [...] This condition {{is also known as}} the [...] "Red drum". [...] On application of pressure to the external ear canal {{with the help of a}} pneumatic ear speculum the mass could be seen to blanch. [...] This sign is known as [...] "Brown's sign". [...] A deficient bony plate along the tympanic portion of the internal carotid artery (aberrant ICA) is a normal variant and can be mistaken with glomus jugulare.|$|E
5000|$|Laterocollis is the tilting of {{the head}} from side to side. This is the [...] "ear-to-shoulder" [...] version. This {{involves}} many more muscles: <b>ipsilateral</b> sternocleidomastoid, <b>ipsilateral</b> splenius, <b>ipsilateral</b> scalene complex, <b>ipsilateral</b> levator scapulae, and <b>ipsilateral</b> posterior paravertebrals.|$|E
