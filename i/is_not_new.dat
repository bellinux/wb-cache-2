5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} become {{important}} elements of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama in the modern age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares to be painted nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>new.</b> The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E
5|$|While {{the concept}} of only eating locally grown food <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>new,</b> the book coincided with the {{emerging}} popularity of the locavore movement and farmer's markets. Media outlets in North America examined the feasibility of only eating food produced locally, local food-themed events, and locavore groups. During World Food Day in 2006, playing off the popularity of Smith and MacKinnon's articles in The Tyee, the Vancouver City Hall held a 100-mile themed breakfast. Locavore groups have held local-only dinner parties and week-long challenges. Some restaurants and caterers offered 100-mile menus, one being The Herbfarm Restaurant in Woodinville, Washington. Some farmers, gardeners, or regional food producers began offering subscription services to deliver produce or urban farming or gardening services. The 100-mile diet spawned many variations to allow for various circumstances and motivations. Examples include the allowance of a few non-local items, like Barbara Kingsolver chose to include spices into her local diet, or expanding the geographic area to more convenient boundaries, like the economic region, or the entire state or province. A 'made-in-Manitoba' diet challenge led to a government Manitoba Food Charter recognizing and encouraging local food markets.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} Maya, or the {{principle}} of illusion, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>new</b> to oriental philosophy.

Meher Baba makes a distinction, however, from the traditional interpretation of Maya as illusion itself, and says that it is that principle that causes one to be deceived into seeing the false as real.|$|E

25|$|Medications and {{treatments}} {{are said to}} have a palliative effect if they relieve symptoms without having a curative effect on the underlying disease or cause. This can include treating nausea related to chemotherapy or something as simple as morphine to treat the pain of broken leg or ibuprofen to treat aching related to an influenza (flu) infection. Although the concept of palliative care <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>new,</b> most physicians have traditionally concentrated on trying to cure people.|$|E

The Hunza diet, supposedly practiced {{in an area of}} northern Pakistan, has been claimed to give people the ability to live to 140 or more. There has been no proof that any diet has led humans to live longer than the genetically-recognized maximum however Caloric restriction diets have increased lifespans of rodents significantly.|$|E
25|$|Biopiracy {{describes}} a practice in which indigenous knowledge of nature, originating with indigenous peoples, {{is used by}} others for profit, without permission from and {{with little or no}} compensation or recognition to the indigenous people themselves. For example, when bioprospectors draw on indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants which is later patented by medical companies without recognizing the fact that the knowledge <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>new,</b> or invented by the patenter, and depriving the indigenous community to the rights to commercial exploitation of the technology that they themselves had developed. Critics of this practice, such as Greenpeace, claim these practices contribute to inequality between developing countries rich in biodiversity, and developed countries hosting companies that engage in 'biopiracy'.|$|E

25|$|Though coined {{as late as}} the 1910s, the {{phenomenon}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>new.</b> It was referred to in the Hebrew Bible. The word has undergone several changes of meaning since it was first coined and is still used in a variety of senses. Today, the term transvestite is commonly considered outdated and derogatory, with the term cross-dresser used as a more appropriate replacement. This is because the term transvestite was historically used to diagnose medical disorders, including mental health disorders, and transvestism was viewed as a disorder, but the term cross-dresser was coined by the transgender community. In some cases, however, the term transvestite is seen as more appropriate for use by members of the transgender community instead of by those outside of the transgender community, and some have reclaimed the word.|$|E
25|$|Historically, refugee {{populations have}} often been portrayed as a {{security}} threat. In the U.S and Europe, {{there has been much}} focus on the narrative that terrorists maintain networks amongst transnational, refugee, and migrant populations. This fear has been exaggerated into a modern-day Islamist terrorism Trojan Horse in which terrorists hide among refugees and penetrate host countries. 'Muslim-refugee-as-an-enemy-within' rhetoric is relatively new, but the underlying scapegoating of out-groups for domestic societal problems, fears and ethno-nationalist sentiment <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>new.</b> In the 1890s, the influx of Eastern European Jewish refugees to London coupled with the rise of anarchism in the city led to a confluence of threat-perception and fear of the refugee out-group. Populist rhetoric then too propelled debate over migration control and protecting national security.|$|E
25|$|The park holds {{a remnant}} of the Nigerian lowland forests that once formed a {{continuous}} 50–100km wide belt from the Niger River west to the Dahomey Gap in Benin. To the south and southeast the forest was separated from the coast by mangrove and swamp forests, while to the north it merged into the Guinean Forest-Savanna Mosaic ecoregion. Human pressure <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>new.</b> In the Okomu park there is an extensive layer of charcoal and pottery below the forest, indicating that it was cleared and then regenerated over the last 700 years. By {{the start of the}} 20th century the forest survived only in disconnected blocks, which were under intense pressure from human activity. The British colonial administration set up a series of forest reserves to manage what remained, including controlled extraction of valuable trees such as African mahogany.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} giving celebrity status to architects <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>new,</b> but is {{contained}} within the general tendency, from the Renaissance onwards, to give status to artists. Until the modern era, artists in Western civilization were generally working under a patron - usually the Church or the rulers of the state - and their reputation could become commodified, such that their services could be bought by different patrons. One of the first records of celebrity status is artist-architect Giorgio Vasari's monograph Le Vite delle più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori (in English, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects), first published in 1550, recording the Renaissance (rinascita) {{at the time of}} its flourishment. Vasari, himself under the patronage of Grand Duke CosimoI de' Medici, even favoured architects from the city where he resided, Florence, attributing to them innovation, while barely mentioning other cities or places further away. The importance of Vasari's book was in the ability to consolidate reputation and status without people actually having to see the works described. The development of media has thus been equally of central importance to architectural celebrity as other walks of life.|$|E

500|$|For season three, Jonathan {{also has}} to deal with his {{emerging}} heart problems. For Schneider, the [...] "treatments" [...] and [...] "cures" [...] that his character underwent were all for nothing, as the actor believes that Jonathan's heart attack at the end of [...] "Hereafter" [...] was less of a real heart attack and more of Jor-El trying to get Jonathan's attention.

In contrast to those versions, it was Smallville that tied his heart condition to a deal that he makes with Jor-El. When the moment came for his character to die, Schneider considers the event an [...] "empowering death", which he likens to John Wayne's character death as Wil Andersen in The Cowboys.|$|E
