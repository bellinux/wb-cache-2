A 2016 Gallup poll also concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%. In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesbian,</b> and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.|$|E
5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay rights group, Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret {{organizations}} concentrating on <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.|$|E
5|$|Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts. In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women. Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams). Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.|$|E

5|$|From the 1980s onwards, {{homosexuality}} gained {{much wider}} mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues {{relevant to the}} LGBT community. This development was helped by {{the growing number of}} openly <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.|$|E

5000|$|Al Sharpton, a Baptist {{minister}} and Civil rights leader, {{during his campaign}} for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 said that asking whether <b>gays</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesbians</b> {{should be able to}} get married was insulting: [...] "That's like saying you give blacks, or whites, or Latinos the right to shack up - but not get married ...

2500|$|Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, {{claimed the}} Pope had not wished {{specifically}} to attack people with homosexual inclinations, {{and had not}} mentioned <b>gays</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesbians</b> in his text.

[...] Nevertheless, the remarks were interpreted as a call to save mankind from homosexuals and transsexuals.|$|R

25|$|A parent's {{gender is}} not a factor in a child's adjustment. An individual's sexual {{orientation}} does not determine whether that individual {{can be a good}} parent.

25|$|In Celtic mythology, {{no direct}} {{representation}} of <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> relationships exist. Ancient Greek and Roman commentators attribute sexual activity between males, including pederasty, to pre-Christian Celtic tribes.

25|$|LGBT {{members of}} the church are {{expected}} to keep the law of chastity.

50|$|The {{general public}} is {{becoming}} more aware of existence of gay and transgender people through greater press and media content, but this has not necessarily led to greater tolerance. In particular, {{there have been more}} depictions and discussions of homosexuality in the Indonesian news media, also depictions of gay lifestyles in Indonesian television and films. Indonesia does have a reputation as being a relatively moderate and tolerant Muslim nation; however, the recent survey revealed that intolerance of minorities is growing, with the highest level of hostility directed at the gay and lesbian community. The Indonesian Survey Circle (LSI) found in its most recent poll conducted in 2012 that a staggering 80.6 percent of its sample population objected to having <b>gays</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesbians</b> as neighbors. The figure has jumped significantly from 64.7 percent in 2005.|$|R

Though some respondents felt that the balance of lesbian to gay titles was skewed in favor of lesbian titles, the overall perception of Hove and Brighton’s services to LGB patrons was excellent or good.|$|E
25|$|The {{church does}} not nationally allow the {{ordination}} of <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> pastors, but some Jurisdictions and Annual Conferences have begun to ordain gay and lesbian pastors and same-sex marriages or have passed resolutions supporting such ceremonies.

25|$|Hepp, Milos, and Braun-Scharm {{state in}} their study on gender {{identity}} disorder and anorexia nervosa in male monozygotic twins that the correlation between childhood gender identity disorder and adult homosexuality is stronger than the correlation between childhood gender identity disorder and adult transsexualism.

50|$|For {{both men}} and women, the {{percentage}} of bisexual people who have experienced domestic violence is higher than either <b>gay</b> men <b>or</b> <b>lesbians.</b> The high rate of domestic violence faced by bisexual people may be {{in part because of}} the specific challenges bisexual people face in receiving help, as bisexuality is often misunderstood, even by those who administer domestic violence help professionally.|$|R
