5|$|Megalodon faced {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment. However, its position {{at the top of}} the food chain probably <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and diversification of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on {{the structure}} of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> {{on biological}} thinking. In the early 19th century, {{a number of}} biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks {{to the work of}} Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what {{came to be known as}} cell theory.|$|E

5|$|Ball {{then took}} leave in England. His feats in France had {{received}} considerable publicity. He {{was the first}} British ace to become a household name, and found that his celebrity was such {{that he could not}} walk down the streets of Nottingham without being stopped and congratulated. Prior to this the British government had suppressed the names of its aces—in contrast to the policy of the French and Germans—but the losses of the Battle of the Somme, which had commenced in July, made politic the publicising of its successes in the air. Ball's achievements <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on budding flyer Mick Mannock, who would become the United Kingdom's top-scoring ace and also receive the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|However, one {{particular}} incident in Kasi <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy {{felt compelled to}} enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on world {{politics}} and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves {{over how to}} interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E

5|$|Banagher was {{extensively}} {{planted by}} the English, {{particularly during the}} periods 1621–1642 and 1650–1690. The plantations <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on Ireland in several ways. The first was {{the destruction of the}} native ruling classes and their replacement with the Protestant Ascendancy, of British-origin (mostly English) Protestant landowners. Their position was buttressed by the Penal Laws, which denied political and land-owning rights to Roman Catholics. The dominance of this class in Irish life persisted until the late 18th century, and it voted for the Act of Union with Britain in 1800. As a result, by the early 20th century, Banagher had a mix of Irish of native descent and Irish of English descent and supported two churches, one Catholic and one Protestant, both of which still exist.|$|E
5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes. A large number of genetic studies have been undertaken based on this species; these have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on the study of gene expression, gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation. Other studies have investigated physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics. The studies on dipteran relationships by Willi Hennig helped in the development of cladistics, techniques that he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics.|$|E
5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded by Blood met through mutual friends. The idea of {{creating}} a band was conceived by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced by groups like The Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. He always had an appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had noticed that there were few or even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Ray married Bijoya Das, {{his first}} cousin and long-time sweetheart. The couple had a son, Sandip, {{who is now}} a film {{director}}. In the same year, French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. Ray helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about his idea of filming Pather Panchali, which had long been on his mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project. In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at its headquarters office. During his three months in London, Ray watched 99 films. Among these was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves) (1948) by Vittorio De Sica, which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on him. Ray later said that {{he came out of the}} theatre determined to become a film-maker.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Miyazaki was {{employed}} at Toei Animation. He {{worked as an}} in-between artist on the theatrical feature anime Doggie March and the television anime Wolf Boy Ken (both 1963). He also worked on Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon (1964). He was a leader in a labor dispute soon after his arrival, and became chief secretary of Toei's labor union in 1964. Miyazaki later worked as chief animator, concept artist, and scene designer on The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun (1968). Throughout the film's production, Miyazaki worked closely with his mentor, Yasuo Ōtsuka, whose approach to animation <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on Miyazaki's work. Directed by Isao Takahata, with whom Miyazaki would continue to collaborate {{for the remainder of}} his career, the film was highly praised, and deemed a pivotal work in the evolution of animation.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians hold widely varying {{opinions}} of the Crusaders. To some, their conduct was incongruous with the stated aims and implied moral authority of the papacy, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that on occasion the Pope excommunicated Crusaders. Crusaders often pillaged as they travelled, and their leaders generally retained control of captured territory instead of returning it to the Byzantines. During the People's Crusade, thousands of Jews were murdered in what is now called the Rhineland massacres. Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade. However, the Crusades <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on Western civilisation: they reopened the Mediterranean to commerce and travel (enabling Genoa and Venice to flourish); they consolidated the collective identity of the Latin Church under papal leadership; and they constituted a wellspring for accounts of heroism, chivalry, and piety that galvanised medieval romance, philosophy, and literature. The Crusades also reinforced the connection between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism.|$|E

5|$|The realist {{narrative}} {{style of}} Pather Panchali {{was influenced by}} Italian neorealism and the works of French director Jean Renoir. In 1949 Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River (1951). Ray, {{a founding member of}} the Calcutta Film Society (established in 1947), helped him scout for locations in the countryside. When Ray told him about his longstanding wish to film Pather Panchali, Renoir encouraged him to proceed. In 1950 Ray was sent to London by his employer, the advertising agency D.J. Keymer, to work at their headquarters. During his six months in London, he watched about 100 films. Among these, Vittorio De Sica's neorealist film Bicycle Thieves (1948) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on him. In a 1982 lecture, Ray said that he had come out of the theatre determined to become a filmmaker. The film made him believe that it was possible to make realistic cinema that was shot on location with an amateur cast.|$|E
5|$|The same year, {{the family}} moved to Deurne, a suburb of Antwerp, where he came in contact with nature and with scouting, which both <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> on his {{character}} and his later work. With the scouts, he became the troop reporter, writing down heavily illustrated reports on their outings and adventures, in a similar vein as what Hergé did in his scouting period. Through the scouts, he also came into contact with Le Boy-Scout Belge, the Walloon scouting magazine where Hergé made Totor, his first published comic. Vandersteen made a few sequels to these adventures for his friends as amusement, which are the earliest preserved comics he made. He continued to follow the work of Hergé later on. Meanwhile, Vandersteen combined his studies at the Academy with his work in his father's workshop until 1935, when the market for stone decorations for houses collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Preface to Plato <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>impact</b> almost {{immediately}} after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent. The book's claims refer to the ideas {{of a number of}} different fields: the study (then fairly new) of oral literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek philology; the book also acknowledges the influence of literary theory, particularly structuralism. The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to Preface from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances of oral influence. Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, was moving in a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal movers in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as psychology and anthropology.|$|E
