25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have <b>different</b> <b>assortments</b> <b>of</b> enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. Sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans.

40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{reported to}} regulate the expression of myc family genes are multiple and complex and include gene amplification, transcriptional activation, transcriptional attenuation, and mRNA stability. We have investigated which of these mechanisms {{are responsible for the}} extreme variation in myc gene family mRNA levels observed in human small-cell lung cancer cell lines. In addition to gene amplification, a block to nascent mRNA chain elongation, causing attenuation of transcription, is an important regulatory mechanism controlling the steady-state levels of c-myc and L-myc mRNA. The loss of transcriptional attenuation is correlated with overexpression of these two genes in cell lines which do not show gene amplification. Expression of c-myc mRNA appears to be dependent on promoter activity and attenuator function. In contrast, regulation of expression of the N-myc gene does not involve transcriptional attenuation; steady-state mRNA levels are correlated with promoter activity as well as gene amplification. We conclude that transcriptional regulation of each member of the myc gene family is accomplished by a <b>different</b> <b>assortment</b> <b>of</b> complex mechanisms, including gene copy number, promoter activation, and transcriptional attenuation. Interference at multiple points in this complex regulatory process appears to be an important mechanism by which small-cell lung cancer and other human tumors evade growth control...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims Adansonia {{comprises}} nine species, six {{of which}} are endemic to Madagascar. Genetic relationships between the Malagasy species remain unresolved due to conflicting results between nuclear and plastid DNA variation. Morphologically intermediate individuals between distinct species have been identified, indicative of interspecific hybridization. In this paper, microsatellite data are used to identify potential cases of hybridization and to provide insights into the evolutionary history of the genus on Madagascar. Methods Eleven microsatellites amplified with new primers developed for Adansonia rubrostipa were used to analyse 672 individuals collected at 27 sites for the six Malagasy species and morphologically intermediate individuals. Rates of individual admixture were examined using three Bayesian clustering programs, STRUCTURE, BAPS and NewHybrids, with no a priori species assignment. Key Results Population differentiation was coherent, with recognized species boundaries. In the four Malagasy species of section Longitubae, 8 · 0, 9 · 0 and 9 · 5 % of individuals with mixed genotypes were identified by BAPS, NewHybrids and STRUCTURE, respectively. At sites with sympatric populations of A. rubrostipa and A. za, NewHybrids indicated these individuals to be F 2 and, predominantly, backcrosses with both parental species. In northern Madagascar, two populations of trees combining A. za and A. perrieri morphology and microsatellite alleles were identified in the current absence of the parental species. Conclusions The clear genetic differentiation observed between the six species may reflect their adaptation to <b>different</b> <b>assortments</b> <b>of</b> climate regimes and habitats during the colonization of the island. Microsatellite variation reveals that hybridization probably occurred in secondary contact between species of section Longitubae. This type of hybridization {{may also have been}} involved in the differentiation of a local new stabilized entity showing specific microsatellite alleles and morphological characters, suggesting a potential role of hybridization in the recent history of diversification on Madagascar.

40|$|The Swedish {{production}} of biogas was 1, 5 TWh 2011. About {{half of the}} production was used as vehicle fuels. The cost for upgrading biogas depends {{on the size of}} the biogas plant and its gas production. If the gas flow is low the cost will be high. However, further development of existing upgrading technologies or development of new ones, have good potential to decrease the upgrading cost for small scale biogas plants. The aim of this master thesis is to investigate a new technology for upgrading biogas to vehicle fuel standards. The investigated technology is based on the carbonation principle, which means that carbon dioxide is fixed by calcium oxide under the formation of calcite. Wood ash, which is rich of calcium oxide, has been used for capturing carbon dioxide in biogas during the lab-scale tests. During the tests the composition of the ingoing biogas was 35 % carbon dioxide and 65 % methane. When the gas passes through the ash bed the carbon dioxide was fixed by the ash and that is the reason why the methane yields is about 95 - 100 % in the outgoing gas. Three different types of wood ashes have been investigated. They originate from combustion of wood pellets respectively <b>different</b> <b>assortment</b> <b>of</b> wood chips. Ash from combustion of wood pellets shows the best ability to capture carbon dioxide, 0, 24 g CO 2 /g dry ash.

S. film, television and radio writers, called a strike targeted at the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, a trade association representing over 350 entertainment production companies. Eventually over 12, 000 writers joined the strike, which ended in February 2008. Production on many television programs ceased, which made this strike immediately visible to a large number of Americans - the national television audience. Informed by a critical theory perspective and guided by the principles of qualitative textual analysis, this study examines framing of the strike in three major newspapers: the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. The Post's and the Journal's mutual parent company, News Corporation, had a financial stake in the strike; it owns the Fox television networks and film production studios, and is represented by the alliance. The New York Times' parent company, in contrast, did not have a stake in the strike. The results show that though the three newspapers used <b>different</b> <b>assortments</b> <b>of</b> frames to cover the strike, they all framed it negatively - by emphasizing "damage" caused by the strike, promoting consumer values and marginalizing the guild. Ultimately, this study affirms the literature describing media coverage of labor, and furthers the understanding of the relationship between media ownership and content. ...|$|R
