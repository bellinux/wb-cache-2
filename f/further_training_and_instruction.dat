40|$|Objective: The {{current study}} {{investigated}} (under optimal conditions) the accuracy and completeness of professionals&# 039; contemporaneous written notes {{of child abuse}} interviews. Method: Participants included 107 experienced child abuse investigators who were all trained to adhere to best-practice interview guidelines and who routinely took notes as records of interviews. The interviews documented {{for this study were}} read live for 15 min duration, and at a pace of 2. 2 words (on average) /s. The professionals&# 039; notes of the interviews were analyzed for completeness and accuracy. Key outcome measures were the prevalence and discernability of the questions (i. e., whether the structure of questions was recorded accurately) as well as the child responses. Results: Despite the omission of 39 % of abuse-related details, recording of content details was clearly prioritized over interviewer questions. This was revealed irrespective of the measure of note taking quality or the quality of the interview being recorded. Of the various layout styles employed, scrutiny of interviewer questions was maximized by: (a) using symbols or spacing to delineate questions and responses, (b) capturing the first two words of a question, and (c) using abbreviations. Conclusions: Although note taking could potentially improve with <b>further</b> research, <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction,</b> this form of documentation does not provide full scrutiny of the interview process, even under optimal conditions. Practice implications: Electronic recording is strongly recommended for all interviews, especially considering global concerns about interviewers&# 039; adherence to best-practice interview guidelines. If notes continue {{to be used as a}} record of interview, <b>further</b> research <b>and</b> <b>training</b> are urgently warranted to improve note taking competency...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the perceptions of leadership behavior and coach–athlete relationship in Scandinavian coaches. A secondary purpose was to investigate if differences in national sport education, level of coaching and coaching experiences in individual or team sport have an influence on leadership behavior and coach–athlete relationships. One hundred and forty nine coaches at international level or national top level from Denmark, Norway and Sweden participated in this study (134 male and 15 female). The methods of investigation were Chelladurai’s Leadership scale of sport (LSS) (Chelladurai & Saleh, 1980) and Jowett’s coach–athlete relationship perspective (Jowett & Wyllemann, 2006). The results showed that the most frequent self-reported behavioral components between the described coach–athlete relationship subscales and preferred leadership behavior among Scandinavian top-level coaches were <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instructions,</b> positive feedback <b>and</b> democratic behavior, respectively. The study also revealed a positive coach–athlete relationship between (1) commitment <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction,</b> (2) positive feedback and social support, and (3) between complementarities <b>and</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction</b> behavior. A significant difference was found between top coaches in Denmark and Sweden on commitment and complementarity, and more experienced coaches used significantly more <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>and</b> social support in their coaching than did less experienced coaches.

40|$|The study {{explored}} {{the relationships between}} athletes’ perception of coaching behaviours and satisfaction towards coaches’ leadership. The path-goal theory (House, 1971) and a multidimensional model of leadership (Chelladurai, 1990) were used as the theoretical base. A stratified random sample of 234 males and 183 females adolescent school athletes were selected to answer a questionnaire which consists of personal data, Leadership Scale for Sports (Chelladurai & Saleh, 1980), and satisfaction scale towards leadership. The results indicate that <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction</b> behaviour, <b>and</b> rewarding behaviour are often exhibited by coaches, and the autocratic behaviour is seldom portrayed. The results of Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation also show that the score of each dimension of the coaches' <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction,</b> democratic, social support and rewarding behaviours has positive significant relation to athletes' satisfaction towards the leadership of coaches. Nevertheless, the “stepwise” multiple regression analysis reveal that <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction,</b> democratic <b>and</b> social support behaviour of coaches show positive and significant contribution in relationship of athletes' satisfaction towards coaches' leadership. Furthermore, autocratic behaviour is also found to contribute significantly and negatively in relation to athletes' satisfaction towards coaches' leadership. Therefore, the study suggests that to increase atheletes’s satisfaction towards leadership, coaches should exhibit more <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction,</b> social support <b>and</b> democractic behaviours, besides reducing the characteristics of autocratic behaviour...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} <b>further</b> {{vocational}} <b>training</b> <b>and</b> retraining is evaluated {{in this paper}} {{on the basis of}} a comparison group approach and using a new data source. For this the IAB employment sample was extended to include details about <b>further</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> retraining measures. For a cohort of people completing <b>further</b> <b>training</b> or retraining measures in 1986 the authors analyse as an example the effects on the individual labour market success between 1986 and 1990. The access requirements for these measures are reconstructed for the participants of the <b>further</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> retraining measures and for a control group. The control group is made up of people who were employed for a short time in the period 1983 - 1986 and, like the participants in the <b>further</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> retraining measures, previously claimed unemployment benefit. By means of a hierarchical matching method, statistical doubles are found for about 90 % of all the participants in the <b>further</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> retraining measures. On the basis of 985 pairs of participants and comparison persons, event-analytical estimations are made concerning the return to employment subject to social security contributions after a course of <b>further</b> <b>training</b> or retraining or after the period of short-term employment. In addition the determinants of the duration of this first phase of employment are estimated. The results suggest that in the period under examination participation in <b>further</b> <b>training</b> or retraining has a weak positive employment effect for individuals who were unemployed before beginning the training measure if they take up work immediately after the measure. However, <b>further</b> <b>training</b> <b>and</b> retraining have a significantly negative effect - seen in relation to the control group - on remaining in employment. The authors interpret this as a consequence of employment-relevant deficits that can not be influenced by <b>further</b> <b>training</b> or retraining. <b>Further</b> detailed evaluation studies with (extended) business statistics can help to clarify this.
