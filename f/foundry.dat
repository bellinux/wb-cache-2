5|$|Major {{pieces were}} created at Crawfords Casting <b>foundry</b> in Enfield in Sydney's inner western suburbs. Although the <b>foundry</b> would {{fabricate}} {{the elements of}} the sculptures, Oliver would still undertake the initial stages, training <b>foundry</b> staff and supervising their activity. Some of the pieces assembled to create the sculptures were made using copper rod, while others were formed using the lost-wax casting technique. Individual pieces would take up to two months to complete.|$|E

50|$|A few <b>foundries</b> provide other {{services}} before shipping cast products to their customers. It {{is common to}} paint castings to prevent corrosion and improve visual appeal. Some <b>foundries</b> assemble castings into complete machines or sub-assemblies. Other <b>foundries</b> weld multiple castings or wrought metals {{together to form a}} finished product.|$|R
40|$|The {{business}} model and strategic position of Quebec's rural <b>foundries</b> {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th century is virtually unknown. Inferences have been made based on pictorial and oral data sources. This data reveals that successful rural <b>foundries</b> were, in essence, confined to producing and selling agricultural tools to local farmers on an as-needed basis, because large urban <b>foundries</b> were already mass-producing domestic and industrial objects. In contrast, use of detailed accounting records and advertising publications of three rural <b>foundries</b> over the 1900 to 1914 period provides a clearer picture of the production and of the clientele of those rural <b>foundries.</b> Analysis of these sources suggests that the strategic {{business model}} of rural <b>foundries</b> was much more elaborate than the existing literature posits. Rural owner-managers of the early 20 th century were sophisticated strategists, marketers, and operators...|$|R
50|$|Mr Shirlaw {{had been}} the {{managing}} director of Southern <b>Foundries</b> Ltd, {{which was in the}} business of iron castings. But then another company called ‘Federated <b>Foundries</b> Ltd’ took over the business. The new owners had altered article 8 of Southern <b>Foundries</b> Ltd's constitution, empowering two directors and the secretary (who were friends of Federated <b>Foundries)</b> to remove any director. Then they acted on it, by sacking Mr Shirlaw. Mr Shirlaw's contract, signed in 1933 stated that he was to remain in post for ten years.|$|R
5|$|Because of his {{nickname}} and {{connection to the}} <b>foundry,</b> John McGraw named McGinnity the starter for the Giants' March 23, 1904 exhibition game against the Southern Association's Birmingham Iron Men which was scheduled {{to raise funds for}} the Vulcan statue then being cast for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition that summer in St. Louis, Missouri. At his own request, McGinnity was allowed to visit the downtown <b>foundry</b> and personally pour some of the iron into the moulds for the statue.|$|E
5|$|Ellet's men {{returned}} to De Soto Point and constructed an artillery battery targeting an iron <b>foundry</b> recasting spent Union artillery shells. Construction was begun on June 19, which placed a 20-pounder Parrott rifle in a casemate of railroad iron. The targeted <b>foundry</b> was destroyed on June 25 {{and the next}} day a second Parrott gun was added to the battery, which continued to harass the defenders until the garrison's surrender.|$|E

40|$|Background: {{there is}} a lack of field studies aimed at {{reducing}} occupational injuries (01), particularly in <b>foundries.</b> Objectives: to evaluate effectiveness of multidisdplinary intervention in <b>foundries.</b> Methods: the study was carried out in two <b>foundries</b> (cast-iron=A, non-ferrous=B). Since 1999 - 2000, a multidisdplinary intervention was developed, by a team managed by the occupational physician, including safety personnel and workers' representatives. Interventions regarded maintenance, protective equipment, procedures, training, health surveillance (US), fitness for work, first aid. The desired outcome was a reduction in injury rates. Results: In <b>foundries</b> A andB, respectively 522 and 90 01 occurred in 1997 - 2007, accounting for 10, 500 and 2, 300 lost workdays. Statistical analysis showed a significant decrease in incidence and frequency in both <b>foundries.</b> HS allowed for human factor and fitness for work evaluation, return-to-work management. Safety culture, behaviour and procedures positively changed. Conclusions: the study was effective in reducing 01 rates and improving a number of secondary outcomes. The same intervention, taking into account Evidence Based Prevention, is ongoing in about 50 <b>foundries...</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{artifacts}} from the <b>Foundry's</b> history can be viewed at the Putnam History Museum on Chestnut Street. Built in 1830, the building was originally a one-room schoolhouse for the <b>Foundry's</b> teenage apprentices {{and the children of}} employees.|$|R

50|$|Vulcan Iron Works was {{the name}} of several iron <b>foundries</b> in both England and the United States during the Industrial Revolution and, in one case, lasting until the mid-20th century. Vulcan, the Roman god of fire and smithery, was a popular namesake for these <b>foundries.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1746 Thomas Bilbie, from Chew Stoke in Somerset, {{created a}} new bell <b>foundry</b> (The West of England Church Bellfoundry) in the town, paying an annual rent of £1/13/4 (£1.67) for {{premises}} in the Almshouse building. He recast the six bells of Cullompton church as eight new ones. In 1754 Thomas's eldest son also called Thomas moved to Cullompton {{to take over the}} bell <b>foundry.</b> Over a period of 26 years he cast 239 bells, the majority for churches in Devon. When he died, aged 53 in 1780, his son Thomas Castleman Bilbie took over the business and cast 197 bells from 1780 to 1813. The business was then sold to Pannell and Co. who moved it to Exeter in 1850.|$|E

50|$|Centrifugal casting at Goldens' is {{designed}} for specific product applications, as opposed to other <b>foundries</b> strictly devoted to the centrifugal process, such as steel pipe <b>foundries.</b> The centrifugal casting process was added in the late 1990s as a complement to the green sand mold processes already in place.|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} {{and application of}} technology to monitor and control the production and delivery of products and service in casting <b>foundries</b> has gained importance and are necessary to sustain in competitive market conditions. Setup of the industries as applied to casting <b>foundries</b> need timely setup and changes to cope up with the increasing demand from the customers as <b>foundries</b> have great demand for the products produced, in numerous fields. In this paper various parameters of importance are improved by employing shell mould process to the castings which were previously produced by green sand mould process...|$|R

5|$|The Whitechapel Bell <b>Foundry,</b> a {{principal}} supplier of church bells in Britain, {{is based at}} No.32–34 Whitechapel Road. The buildings date from 1670 and are Grade II listed. Originally a coaching inn known as the Artichoke, it has been occupied by the <b>foundry</b> since 1738, replacing smaller premises {{on the north side}} of the road. Davenant Foundation School moved to No.173 Whitechapel Road in 1818. The school expanded with a new hall and classrooms in 1896, with further improvements in 1909. However, a decreasing child population meant that in 1965, the school moved to Loughton, Essex. The building remains on the north side and is Grade II listed.|$|E
5|$|The {{bell tower}} has {{a ring of}} eight bells. The third bell was cast by Richard Keene of Woodstock in 1697. The fourth was cast by Henry III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire in 1716.

Taylor in 1840, presumably at their then Oxford <b>foundry.</b> In 1928 Taylors cast the treble, second and tenor bells, but at their Loughborough <b>foundry</b> St Mary's also has a small Sanctus bell cast by Peter de Weston of London in about 1336.|$|E
