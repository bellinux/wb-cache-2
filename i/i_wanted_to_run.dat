5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
25|$|I {{shall never}} forget the {{sensation}} of freedom which I experienced after scaling that wall. The sun shone, the waves sparkled, I had freedom at last. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> Never did I experience such joy.|$|E

However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When we walked out, all I could hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I could barely hear myself think for those screams. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> back down the tunnel." ...|$|E

500|$|After this loss, McGovern {{remained}} in the Senate. He was scarred by the enormous defeat, and his wife Eleanor took it even worse; {{during the winter of}} 1972–73, the couple seriously considered moving to England. His allies were replaced in positions of power within the Democratic Party leadership, and the McGoverns did not get publicly introduced at party affairs they attended. On January 20, 1973, a few hours after Richard Nixon was re-inaugurated, McGovern gave a speech at the Oxford Union that talked about the abuses of Nixon's presidency; it brought criticism, including from some Democrats, for being ill-mannered. In order to get past the [...] "bitterness and self-pity" [...] he felt, McGovern forced himself to deal with the defeat humorously before audiences; starting at the March 1973 Gridiron Dinner, he frequently related his campaign misadventures in a self-deprecating fashion, such as saying, [...] "For many years, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for the Presidency in the worst possible way – and last year I sure did." [...] Nevertheless, emotions surrounding the loss would remain with McGovern for decades, as it did with some other defeated presidential nominees. Nixon resigned in August 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. McGovern said President Gerald R. Ford's subsequent September 1974 pardon of Nixon was difficult to understand given that Nixon's subordinates were going to prison.|$|E

60|$|Well, I didn't {{like the}} idea of going and {{explaining}} to Dick very much, but {{it had to be done}} unless <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the risk of having Pinky Carewe in the family. So I went the next morning.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{it was her}} querulous tone, {{perhaps a}} mere boyish dislike to being tied down, or even it might be mere hurry, that made him answer impatiently, 'I can't tell--as it may happen. D'ye think <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away! Only take care of yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> run," [...] Jumper {{kept saying}} to himself. Then he would say, [...] "But I mustn't. I mustn't. I mustn't." [...] And so Jumper did {{the hardest thing}} in the world,--sat still and stared danger in the face. He was sitting still to save his life.|$|R

6000|$|... "I did. When we were hustled {{on board}} the steamer, there was nobody at the gangway {{for a few moments}} and I felt <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away. There didn't seem to be any reason for this, but I very nearly went." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't say I WOULD run. I said <b>I</b> <b>WANTED</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> That's a {{different}} thing. I {{want to help}} people, too. But oh, I wish there weren't any ugly, dreadful things in the world. I wish everything was glad and beautiful." ...|$|E
60|$|Greaser {{uttered a}} shrill cry. Dick leaped to his feet. Then I grew dizzy, and my sight blurred. I heard hoarse shouts and saw dark forms rising as if {{out of the}} earth. All was confusion. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> but could not get up. There was a wrestling, {{whirling}} mass in front of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{being shot}} as a spy," [...] she {{answered}} quickly. [...] "There! I'm not a fool, you know. You may think I'm a fool about you but I am not about things in general. Good-bye!

6000|$|... "It's possible," [...] said Mr. Barclay with a {{trace of}} dryness. [...] "The first thing, however, is to beach this vessel, and then you and Jake must get off in the sloop.

6000|$|... "I was daunted," [...] Kit declared. [...] "When I landed from Cayman {{and started}} for the desert with three or four sailors, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> back to the boats. You see, the thing was ridiculous. All my fine romantic plans had led to this. However, we'll let it go. You're staunch and you helped me out. Now, when I'm hipped and moody you let me talk. I doubt if you know what a very good sort you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll tell you," [...] {{answered}} the Nome. [...] "When those Oz people took my kingdom away from me--just {{because it was}} my kingdom and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> it to suit myself--they said I could take as many precious stones as I could carry. So I {{had a lot of}} pockets made in my clothes and loaded them all up. Jewels are fine things to have with you when you travel; you can trade them for anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is fine! This is funny!" [...] I cried, and for {{a moment}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> But the same grim, deadly feeling that had taken me with Don around the narrow shelf now rose in me {{stronger}} and fiercer. I pronounced one savage malediction upon myself for leaving my gun. I could not go for it; I would have {{to make the best of}} my error, and in the wildness born of the moment I swore if the lions would stay treed for the hounds they would stay treed for me.|$|E
6000|$|The captain nodded. [...] "It {{is kind of}} lonely, isn't it?" [...] he said; [...] "but I can't go up till I get {{the code}} signals. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> up 'Got Left' or something, just to {{brighten}} up this island home. Captain Trent hasn't been here yet, but he'll drop in before long; and it'll cheer him {{up to see a}} signal on the brig." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did she?" [...] exclaimed Miss Cornelia delightedly. [...] "Well, I'm real {{thankful to}} hear it. Sometimes I've {{wondered}} if she really did want me around at all--she never let me think so. You must have thawed her out more than you think, or she wouldn't have said that much itself to you. Oh, that poor, heart-broken girl! I never see Dick Moore but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a knife clean through him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Nancy sails in four days, so I shall go down {{tomorrow}} morning. <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> {{the risk}} again {{of losing the}} boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|To {{all this}} and much more I listened trembling, with a fearful interest, and when I had once grasped the idea that death {{when it came to}} me, as it must, would leave me alive after all--that, as she explained, the part of me that really mattered, the myself, the I am I, which knew and {{considered}} things, would never perish, I experienced a sudden immense relief. When I went out from her side again <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> and jump for joy and cleave the air like a bird. For I had been in prison and had suffered torture, and was now free again--death would not destroy me! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, dear," [...] she said, leaning {{down towards}} {{him as he}} walked, for now they were going on again, [...] "I told you why <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away from Bambatse, didn't I?--because I would rather risk my life than stay. Well, {{do you think that}} I wish to return there and live in that place alone with Jacob Meyer? Also, I will tell you another thing. You {{remember}} about Mr. Seymour? Well, I can't get over that; I can't get over it at all, and therefore, although of course I am afraid, it is all one to me. No, we will escape together, or die together; the first if we can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} as glad as if I did; {{and it made me}} resolve never to do or say a thing that could lower your opinion of me; and then, you know, there at the door--it all seemed part of our trying to make each other better. But when father looked at me in that way, and asked me if we were engaged, I went down into the dust with shame. And {{it seemed to me that}} you had just been {{laughing}} at me, and amusing yourself with me, and I was so furious I didn't know what to do. Do you know what I wanted to do? <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> downstairs to father, and tell him what you had said, and ask him if he believed you had ever liked any other girl." [...] She paused a little, but he did not answer, and she continued. [...] "But now I'm glad I didn't. And I shall never ask you that, and I shall not care for anything that you--that's happened before to-day. It's all right. And you do think I shall always try to make you good and happy, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think so}} either, but <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the risk, Jim; besides, I am sure {{neither of us}} can be trusted to keep watch." ...|$|R
2500|$|Colbert {{also stated}} on the {{aforementioned}} Meet The Press episode {{that he did}} not expect to win the presidency: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be president. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for president. There's a difference," [...] he said. Colbert made no attempt to appear on the ballots in any other state primaries, and so it is unlikely that he {{would have been able to}} gather enough delegates to secure either party nomination unless he were to win other states by a write-in vote.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have more}} wind, out there, than {{we shall have}} here," [...] the captain said; [...] "which is an advantage, for <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away from them.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} ten o'clock when Hal jogged into a broad trail on the {{outskirts}} of Holston. A gray flat lay before me, {{on the other side of}} which began the slow rise of the slope. I could hardly contain myself. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the mustang, but did not for the sake of the burdened pony. That sage-flat was miles wide, though it seemed so narrow. The back of the lower slope began to change to a dark green, which told me I was surely getting closer to the mountains, even if it did not seem so. The trail began to rise, and at last I reached the first pine-trees. They were a disappointment to me, being no larger than many of the white oaks at home, and stunted, with ragged dead tops. They proved to me that trees isolated from their fellows fare as poorly as trees overcrowded. Where pines grow closely, but not too closely, they rise straight and true, cleaning themselves of the low branches, and making good lumber, free of knots. Where they grow far apart, at the mercy of wind and heat and free to spread many branches, they make only gnarled and knotty lumber.|$|E

I knew it was right out there, anywhere, all around the cabin, but there was always the bread to set, the scrubbin' and the washin' and the work that was never done. I used to be plumb sick at times, jes' to get out into it all, {{especially}} in the spring when the songs of the birds drove me most clean crazy. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out through the long pasture grass, wetting my legs with the dew of it, and to climb the rail fence, and keep on through the timber and up and up over the divide so as to get a look around. Oh, I had all kinds of hankerings--to follow up the canyon beds and slosh around from pool to pool, making friends with the water-dogs and the speckly trout; to peep on the sly and watch the squirrels and rabbits and small furry things and see what they was doing and learn the secrets of their ways. Seemed to me, if I had time, I could crawl among the flowers, and, if I was good and quiet, catch them whispering with themselves, telling all kinds of wise things that mere humans never know.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why ask now?” she remonstrated. “The truth—the {{truth is}} that I never asked myself. Enough {{or not there was}} no room for {{anything}} else. He was the shadow and the light and the form and the voice. He would have it so. The morning he died they came to call me at four o’clock. I ran into his room bare-footed. He recognized me and whispered, ‘You are flawless.’ I was very frightened. He seemed to think, and then said very plainly, ‘Such is my character. I am like that.’ These were the last words he spoke. I hardly noticed them then. I was thinking that he was lying in a very uncomfortable position and I asked him if I should lift him up a little higher on the pillows. You know I am very strong. I could have done it. I had done it before. He raised his hand off the blanket just enough to make a sign that he didn’t want to be touched. It was the last gesture he made. I hung over him and then—and then I nearly ran out of the house just as I was, in my night-gown. I think if I had been dressed I would have run out of the garden, into the street—run away altogether. I had never seen death. I may say I had never heard of it. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from it.” ...|$|E
