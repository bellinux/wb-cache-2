The tensile <b>elastic</b> modulus, <b>bend</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus and tensile {{strength}} of the composite materials hose were determined by uniaxial tension test and three point bending test. The specimen was first destroyed from the inner or outer layer rubber, and then the spiraled cords threads was pulled out and the specimen destroyed with irregular fracture shape.

50|$|The {{simplest}} boundary {{is that of}} a tilt boundary {{where the}} rotation axis is parallel to the boundary plane. This boundary can be conceived as forming from a single, contiguous crystallite or grain which is gradually bent by some external force. The energy associated with the <b>elastic</b> <b>bending</b> of the lattice can be reduced by inserting a dislocation, which is essentially a half-plane of atoms that act like a wedge, that creates a permanent misorientation between the two sides. As the grain is bent further, more and more dislocations must be introduced to accommodate the deformation resulting in a growing wall of dislocations - a low-angle boundary. The grain can now be considered to have split into two sub-grains of related crystallography but notably different orientations.|$|E

[...] Needing bars {{longer than}} {{the width of the}} tank to get the {{required}} spring rate and maximum <b>elastic</b> <b>bend</b> angle from available steel alloys, designer Ernst Lehr created a suspension that effectively folded the bars in half. For each wheel, one rod was attached to the suspension arm, while another was mounted to a nearby point on the frame. On {{the opposite side of the}} tank, the two rods were attached to each other and fitted into a pivot. Deflection of the suspension arm caused both halves of the double torsion bar to twist. A disadvantage of the torsion bar suspension used in Tiger and Panther tanks was the inability to incorporate an escape hatch through the bottom of the hull, a common feature of WWII-era tanks, as the torsion bar arrangement would have blocked crew access to such a hatch.|$|R

Motivated by these experiments, we study the <b>elastic</b> <b>bending</b> energy of polyhedral bilayer vesicles. In agreement with experiments, and provided that excess amphiphiles exhibiting spontaneous curvature are present in sufficient quantity, we find that polyhedral bilayer vesicles can indeed be energetically favorable compared to spherical bilayer vesicles. Consistent with experimental observations we also find that the bending energy associated with the vertices of bilayer polyhedra can be locally reduced through the formation of pores. However, the stabilization of polyhedral bilayer vesicles over spherical bilayer vesicles relies crucially on molecular segregation of excess amphiphiles along the ridges rather than the vertices of bilayer polyhedra. Furthermore, our analysis implies that, contrary to what has been suggested on the basis of experiments, the icosahedron does not minimize <b>elastic</b> <b>bending</b> energy among arbitrary polyhedral shapes and sizes.
