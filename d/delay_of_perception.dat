Qualitatively speaking, with GCD we see a minimal model implementation of the information mismatch problem mentioned in the Introduction: The incongruous information provided to ring nodes by leader nodes leads to a decrease of performance with increasing centralized control. This aspect deserves a much more detailed analysis in future investigations, distinguishing between three types of information errors: (1) erroneous status <b>perception,</b> (2) time <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> status <b>perception,</b> and (3) true color errors (random color changes). With the distinction of leader nodes and ring nodes in mind, one can also distinguish between status information errors (management is not properly informed) and decision information errors (management does not inform properly).|$|R

The findings from one cyclist support the hypothesis that dissociative strategies induce electrophysiological conditions facilitating flow performance states, which are mainly characterized by extensive functional connectivity across all brain areas in the alpha band. Associative strategies do not seem to conform to this framework, although focusing on the core components of action minimized the awareness of unpleasant afferent feedback, thus <b>delaying</b> detrimental increments <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> effort, which manifest as a predominant frontal-motor coupling in the alpha band and frontooccipital coupling in the beta band...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{studied the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> on <b>perception</b> and action {{in contact with}} a force field that emulates elastic soft tissue with a rigid {{nonlinear}} boundary. Such field is similar to forces exerted on a needle during teleoperated needle insertion. We found that delay causes motor underestimation of the stiffness of this nonlinear soft tissue, without perceptual change. These experimental results are supported by simulation of a simplified mechanical model of the arm and neural controller, and a model for <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> stiffness, {{which is based on}} regression in the force-position space. In addition, we show that changing the gain of the teleoperation channel cancels the motor effect <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> without adding perceptual distortion. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} achieve perceptual and motor transparency in virtual one-dimensional remote needle insertion task...|$|R

Sixty-six genital warts patients were approached while attending a sexual health clinic. They completed a questionnaire assessing their illness perceptions, psychological distress and treatment-seeking <b>delay.</b> Negative <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> illness consequences and control and a perceived cyclical timeline were associated with increased psychological distress. Perceived illness consequences maintained significance in a multiple regression equation, which accounted for 25 % variance in distress. Depression was associated with treatment-seeking delay (r = 0. 28, P = 0. 03). In conclusion, illness perceptions may {{play an important role}} in the experience of psychological distress in genital warts patients.

40|$|AbstractUnder {{appropriate}} stimulus conditions, {{judgments about}} the degree of temporal synchrony in sequences containing rapid alternations of colour and motion direction imply a large apparent <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> motion <b>perception</b> relative to colour perception. Whether this colour–motion asynchrony results from the relative processing <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> different visual attributes, or from inappropriate matching of time markers assigned to first-order change of colour and position {{has been the subject}} of recent debate. Colour–motion asynchrony is significantly weakened when the angle of direction change is reduced from 180 ° (direction reversal) to a smaller change in direction. Although this finding has been interpreted to favour the processing delay hypothesis, here we show that it is consistent with the time marker account. First, the reported dependence on the motion direction angle was particularly strong for random-dot stimuli, but our results indicate that this may reflect the introduction of an artefact, motion streaks, that allows subjects to make a colour–orientation synchrony judgement rather than a colour–motion synchrony judgment for direction change angles other than 180 °. Second, when we used streak-free plaid stimuli, a certain amount of angle dependence remained regardless of whether we asked the observers to judge the apparent binding or synchrony of colour and motion direction changes. The degree of direction change also affected reaction times, but the effect of apparent asynchrony for a direct comparison of sequences of 90 ° and 180 ° motion direction changes was very small, if at all present. These findings with plaid stimuli are consistent with the time marker account; in that we allow that the direction change angle can affect the time course of the recruitment of neural responses to the new direction of motion, which will have a consequential effect on the temporal location of salient features in the sequence of motion changes...|$|R

We used a forced choice paradigm in which subjects were asked to identify the stiffer of two virtual spring-like surfaces based on manipulation without visual feedback.

Adoles-cence {{is considered to be}} a particularly vulnerable period given that the brain is experiencing dramatic developmental change during this time. The present study examined a sample of adolescents (N = 125) considered to be at high risk for stress exposures and drug use by virtue of their environment and low income levels to identify possible neurocognitive (i. e., impulsiv-ity, <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> gratification, emotional <b>perception,</b> and risky decision-making) and social compe-tency mechanisms that may mediate this relationship. Using Mplus, a mediational model was tested using full information maximum likelihood estimates. Risky decision-making and poor social competency skills were related to previous stressful experiences; however, only social competencies mediated the effect of stressors on reports of past year marijuana, alcohol, and polydrug use. As such, stress appears to exert its negative impact through alterations in abil-ities to generate and execute prosocial decisions and behaviors. Interventions that directly address the effects of stress on social competencies may be especially important for children who have experienced adversity including those exposed to parental divorce, parental psy-chopathology, neglect or abuse, parental death, and poverty.

40|$|In the Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) paradigm, {{the stimuli}} for two {{separate}} tasks {{are presented in}} rapid succession. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) is typically varied, resulting in slower responses to Task 2 for shorter SOA. This slowing {{is referred to as}} PRP interference. Previous results have suggested that introspective estimates of response time are not sensitive to PRP interference. That is, although response time to Task 2 is slowed substantially at shorter SOAs, estimates of this response time typically do not vary with SOA. One interpretation of these findings is that <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the stimulus for Task 2 is <b>delayed</b> during processing <b>of</b> Task 1. Therefore, according to this interpretation, introspective response times (IRTs) are not sensitive to PRP interference because the second stimulus (S 2) is not perceived while the interference is occurring. Across two experiments using different approaches, I found that IRTs are still not sensitive to PRP interference under conditions in which <b>delayed</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> S 2 is precluded. The lack of sensitivity is therefore not dependent on perception being delayed, and must have had some other cause in my experiments. My results are consistent with an existing account in which IRTs are based on the perceived difficulty of each trial rather than on mental timing. However, the results may be best explained by an account in which people simply are not very good at estimating durations while under cognitive load...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises of two essays that investigate {{factors influencing}} interdependent decision-making and the evaluations of such decision outcomes. In the first essay, {{we examine the}} influence of time taken by a bargaining opponent to respond to an offer on bargainers' <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> their own bargaining outcomes. Extending previous research in several important ways, we propose and test a conceptualization where inferences of opponent's reservation price lie {{at the core of}} the underlying explanation. Second, we provide additional insight into the underlying process by showing that <b>delay</b> influences <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> bargaining outcomes only when it is related to the bargaining. Third, unlike previous work that examined the effect <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> when an offer was accepted, we extend the inquiry to situations where an offer is rejected. Fourth, we identify and test two factors - knowledge of opponent's best alternative to negotiated agreement and persuasion knowledge - that moderate the influence of response time on <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> bargaining outcomes. Results of five studies provide insight into the underlying process by identifying and testing boundary conditions for the effect <b>of</b> <b>delay.</b> In the second essay, we focus on generic campaigns that are funded voluntarily (rather than mandatory contributions), and examine the influence of situational factors (e. g., market trends) and solicitation appeals on voluntary contributions to a generic campaign. Viewing generic advertising campaigns as a public goods problem, a conceptual framework based on goal systems theory is developed to suggest that situational factors such as market trends induce different goals, which in turn, influence voluntary contributions. The conceptual framework also suggests that a solicitation appeal that is more congruent with the induced goal is likely to be more effective in increasing voluntary contributions relative to incongruent appeals. Consistent with the framework, three studies show that voluntary contributions to generic campaigns are higher when the market trend is declining versus increasing. Further, solicitations that make the induced goal and the means to achieve that goal salient are more effective in increasing contributions. The implications of the findings are discussed along with directions for future research...|$|R

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving healthy individuals 16 years of age or older. Subjects underwent inspiratory resistive loading testing, in which the level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was quantified with the modified Borg scale. We also determined body mass indices (BMIs), assessed maximal respiratory pressures, performed pulmonary function tests, applied the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) -long form, and conducted six-minute walk tests (6 MWTs). The level <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> dyspnea was classified as low (Borg score 5). Results: We included 48 healthy subjects in the study. Forty-two subjects completed the test up to a load of 46. 7 cmH 2 O/L/s.
