Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the Hampton Roads area include: Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair, General Dynamics NASSCO Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's Norfolk Naval Shipyard is just across the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place.

5|$|Little {{academic}} {{discourse on}} Joehana was published until the 1960s; according to Kartini et al., this <b>is</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> Joehana's use of non-formal Sundanese. This renewal {{began with the}} republication of two of his works: Rasiah nu Goreng Patut in 1963 as a standalone book by Kiwari, and Moegiri as a serial beginning with the 15 October 1965 edition of Sunda magazine. Rosidi, that magazine's editor, included discussion of Joehana in his 1966 book Kesusastraan Sunda Dewasa Ini (Contemporary Sundanese Literature). Some more discussion, by authors such as Yus Rusyana and Rusman Sutiamarga, was published in magazines such as Wangsit or included in university lectures. Until 1979 Joehana's works had not been taught in Sundanese-language courses in schools.|$|E
5|$|The reason Byzantine Greek merchants {{have often}} been {{neglected}} in historiography {{is not that they}} were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade.

5|$|Lead shows {{two main}} {{oxidation}} states: +4 and +2. The tetravalent state {{is common for}} the carbon group. The divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon, minor for germanium, important (but not prevailing) for tin, and is the more important for lead. This <b>is</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> relativistic effects, specifically the inert pair effect, which manifests itself {{when there is a}} large difference in electronegativity between lead and oxide, halide, or nitride anions, leading to a significant partial positive charge on lead. The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. This is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity such as carbon in organolead compounds. In these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp3 hybridization is still energetically favorable. Lead, like carbon, is predominantly tetravalent in such compounds.|$|E

5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses <b>is</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> one or more metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane {{has been reported to}} result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{disparity}} in genus sizes <b>is</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as Ranunculus and Potentilla.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water <b>is</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> its source. Malvern Hills are amongst {{the oldest and}} hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology {{responsible}} {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

The objective was to estimate the annual costs of coronary heart diseases (CHD) and mental disorders (MD) <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> job strain exposure according to Karasek’s model in France for the year 2003 from a societal perspective. Methods: We produced attributable fraction estimates which were applied to the number of cases (morbidity and mortality) and the costs of CHD and MD. Relative risk estimates came from a systematic literature review of prospective studies. We conducted meta-analyses based on this selection of studies. Prevalence of exposure to job strain came from the national SUMER survey conducted in France in 2003. Costs included direct medical costs and indirect costs: production losses due to sick leaves and premature deaths. Results: Between 8. 8 and 10. 2 % of CHD morbidity <b>was</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> job strain, and between 9. 4 and 11. 2 % of CHD mortality <b>was</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> this exposure for men.
