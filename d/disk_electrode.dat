5000|$|The RRDE is an {{important}} tool for characterizing the fundamental properties of electrocatalysts used in fuel cells. For example, in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, dioxygen reduction at the cathode is often enhanced by an electrocatalyst comprising platinum nanoparticles. When oxygen is reduced using an electrocatalyst, an unwanted and harmful by-product, hydrogen peroxide, may be produced. Hydrogen peroxide can damage the internal components of a PEM fuel cell, so oxygen-reduction electrocatalysts are engineered {{in such a way}} as to limit the amount of peroxide formed. An RRDE [...] "collection experiment" [...] can be used to probe the peroxide generating tendencies of an electrocatalyst. [...] In this experiment, the disk is coated with a thin layer bearing the electrocatalyst, and the <b>disk</b> <b>electrode</b> is poised at a potential which reduces the oxygen. Any products generated at the <b>disk</b> <b>electrode</b> are then swept past the ring electrode. The potential of the ring electrode is poised to detect any hydrogen peroxide that may have been generated at the disk.|$|E

In sensor design, the potential of the <b>disk</b> <b>electrodes</b> is set to the wave plateau of DA, whereas the plane electrode is biased at the irreversible wave plateau of AA before the onset of the DA oxidation wave. Thus, AA is scavenged but DA is allowed to enter the nanocavities to be oxidized at the <b>disk</b> <b>electrodes,</b> and its signal is further amplified by redox cycling between <b>disk</b> and plane <b>electrodes.</b> Several different theoretical approaches are elaborated herein to analyze the behavior of the system, and their conclusions are successfully tested by experiments. This reveals the crucial role of the plane-electrode area which screens access to the recessed disks (i. e. acts as a diffusional Faraday cage) and simultaneously contributes to amplification of the analyte signal through positive feedback, as occurs in interdigitated arrays and scanning electrochemical microscopy. Simulations also allow for the evaluation of the benefits of different geometries inspired by the above design and different operating modes for increasing the sensor performance...|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{cyclic voltammetry}} {{is not a}} {{hydrodynamic}} technique, useful electrochemical methods are. In such cases, flow is achieved at the electrode surface by stirring the solution, pumping the solution, or rotating the electrode {{as is the case}} with rotating <b>disk</b> <b>electrodes</b> and rotating ring-disk electrodes. Such techniques target steady state conditions and produce waveforms that appear the same when scanned in either the positive or negative directions, thus limiting them to linear sweep voltammetry.|$|R
50|$|Rotated {{electrode}} voltammetry, a subclass of voltammetry, is {{technique in}} which the working electrode usually a rotating <b>disk</b> <b>electrode</b> (RDE) or rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) is rotated {{at a very high}} rate (2000 to 10,000 (?) RPM). This asserts some control over the mass transport process which brings the analyte to the electrode surface. This technique was made popular through the work of the Russian electrochemist, Benjamin Levich. This technique is useful for studying the kinetics and electrochemical reaction mechanism for a half reaction. This technique {{is part of a larger}} class of electroanalytical methods known as hydrodynamic voltammetry (see also hydrodynamics).|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between a rotating ring-disk electrode and a rotating <b>disk</b> <b>electrode</b> is {{the addition of a}} second working electrode {{in the form of a}} ring around the central disk of the first working electrode. The two electrodes are separated by a non-conductive barrier and connected to the potentiostat through different leads. To operate such an electrode it is necessary to use a bipotentiostat or some potentiostat capable of controlling a four electrode system. This rotating hydrodynamic electrode motif can be extend to rotating double-ring electrodes and rotating double-ring-disk electrodes and other even more esoteric constructions as suited to a given experiment.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} parameter for an RRDE is the [...] "collection efficiency". This parameter is {{a measure}} of the percentage of the material generated at the <b>disk</b> <b>electrode</b> which is detected at the ring electrode. For any given set of RRDE dimensions (disk OD, ring ID, and ring OD), the collection efficiency can be computed using formulae derived from fluid dynamics first principles. One useful aspect of the theoretical collection efficiency is that it is only a function of the RRDE dimensions. That is, it is independent of the rotation rate over a wide range of rotation rates.|$|E
40|$|The {{conditions}} for genesis of chemically induced hydrodynamic convection flow at resting and slowly rotating <b>disk</b> <b>electrodes</b> were studied. On {{the basis of}} these studies, the convection flow patterns beneath the electrode could be directly correlated with the etched patterns in the surfaces of the corresponding electrodes. It was not possible to capture images during experiments at high rotational speeds (1000 - 6000 rpm) on account of the very fast movements in the solution as well as the strong light absorption of concentrated iron(III) chloride solution. However, the hydrodynamic flow emerges as an etched spiral pattern in the electrode surface, thus enabling detailed investigation of the structures after each experiment. These spiral-like patterns follow a logarithmic rule and feature an invariant curvature, even under different experimental conditions. This invariant behaviour of the spiral pattern formation can be explained physically, and a fixed ratio of tangential to radial flow of 2 :sup:-½:/sup: was found for the curvature of the spirals generated. Besides the formation of a topographically structured surface, the system exhibits galvanostatic potential oscillations. In addition to classical electrochemical oscillations, a new type of oscillation was detected. These superimposed oscillations could be correlated directly with the circular height profile of the topographically structured surface. It could be shown that this new type of oscillation is caused by the interaction between hydrodynamic vortex patterns in the boundary layer, on the one hand, and the electrochemical dissolution process, on the other hand. The experiments and theoretical interpretations shown in this work regarding the pattern formation at non-, slow and fast rotating <b>disk</b> <b>electrodes</b> under dissolving conditions provide a fundamental contribution to understanding the coupling between electrochemical processes and hydrodynamic flow at dissolving <b>disk</b> <b>electrodes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pt {{nanoparticle}} (NP) -modified polycrystalline boron-doped diamond (pBDD) <b>disk</b> <b>electrodes</b> {{have been}} fabricated and employed as amperometric sensors for {{the determination of}} dissolved oxygen concentration in aqueous solution. pBDD columns were cut using laser micro-machining techniques and sealed in glass, {{in order to make}} <b>disk</b> <b>electrodes</b> which were then characterized electrochemically. Electrodeposition of Pt onto the diamond electrodes was optimized so as to give the maximum oxygen reduction peak current with the lowest background signal. Pt NPs, > 0 - 10 nm diameter, were found to deposit randomly across the pBDD electrode, with no preference for grain boundaries. The more conductive grains were found to promote the formation of smaller nanoparticles at higher density. With the use of potential step chronoamperometry, in which the potential was stepped to a diffusion-limited value, a four electron oxygen reduction process was found to occur at the Pt NP-modified pBDD electrode. Furthermore the chronoamperometric response scaled linearly with dissolved oxygen concentration, varied by changing the oxygen/nitrogen ratio of gas flowed into solution. The sensor was used to detect dissolved oxygen concentrations with high precision over the pH range 4 - 10...|$|R
30|$|Finally, the PPD {{membrane}} effectiveness was validated at {{analysis of}} real biological samples. The transducers with no membranes demonstrated weak signals after addition of blood serum {{to the working}} cell due {{to the presence of}} electroactive compounds. However, after deposition of the membrane, no responses were obtained. Similar results were obtained with the lysate of neurons. These experiments demonstrate that the developed method of PPD deposition on platinum <b>disk</b> <b>electrodes</b> is effective and the modified transducers can be used for work with complex biological samples.|$|R
5000|$|The RRDE takes {{advantage}} of the form of the laminar flow created during rotation. As the system is rotated the solution in contact with the electrode is driven {{to the side of the}} electrode the same as with a rotating <b>disk</b> <b>electrode.</b> As the solution flows to the side it crosses the ring electrode and back into the bulk of the solution. If the flow in the solution is laminar then the solution is brought in contact with the disk quickly followed by the ring in a very controlled manner. The resulting currents are dependent on the electrodes' respective potentials, areas, and spacing as well as the rotation rate and given substrate.|$|E
50|$|Potential sweep {{reversals}} {{as used in}} {{cyclic voltammetry}} are different for a RDE system, since {{the products of the}} potential sweep are continually swept away from the electrode. A reversal would produce a similar i-E curve, which would closely match the forward scan, except for capacitive charging current. A RDE cannot be used to observe the behavior of the electrode reaction products, since they are continually swept away from the electrode. However, the rotating ring-disk electrode is well suited to investigate this further reactivity. The peak current in a cyclic voltammogram for a RDE is a plateau like region, governed by the Levich Equation. The limiting current is typically much higher than the peak current of a stationary electrode, being that the mass transport of reactants is actively stimulated by the rotating disk, and not just governed by diffusion, as is the case for a stationary electrode. Any rotating <b>disk</b> <b>electrode</b> can, of course, also be used as a stationary electrode by using it with the rotator turned off.|$|E
