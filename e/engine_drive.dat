5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II, T-26s served {{mainly in}} {{separate}} light tank brigades (each brigade had 256–267 T-26s) and in separate tank battalions of rifle divisions (one company of T-26s consisted of 10–15 tanks). These were the type of tank units that participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939 and in the Winter War from December 1939 – March 1940. The Winter War proved that the T-26 was obsolete and its design reserve was totally depleted. Finnish 37mm antitank guns and even 20mm antitank rifles easily penetrated the T-26's thin anti-bullet armour and tank units equipped with the T-26 suffered significant losses during the breakthrough of the Mannerheim Line, in which the flame-throwing tanks based on the T-26 chassis played a significant role.By mid-1941, most of the Red Army's vast numbers of tanks were suffering from serious wear and tear. Poor quality roads, the vulnerabilities of track design in the early 1930s and inadequate maintenance, recovery and repair services all took their toll. In some of the front line armoured units, {{up to half of}} the T-26, T-28 and BT tanks had major drive train components (<b>engine,</b> <b>drive</b> train or suspension) that were broken down or worn out and these disabled tanks were parked and cannibalised for spare parts to keep the rest running. Tanks damaged during the 1939 Winter War with Finland were also cannibalised for parts.|$|E

Stout even commissioned the well known Dutch auto designer John Tjaarda to design some streamlined car bodies, although none of the car designs ever reached production.|$|E
25|$|In December 1960, {{after its}} last tax disc expired, Dr. Carr stored the Bugatti {{along with other}} classic cars in a lock up garage in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. There it {{remained}} unused and untouched until after Carr's death, when it was discovered by Carr's nephew clearing the garage of his uncle's possessions in 2008. 57502 still possessed its original chassis, <b>engine,</b> <b>drive</b> train and body, though it did contain some modifications: bespoke bumpers, rear-view mirrors on the A-pillars, and a luggage rack dating from the Earl Howe ownership, {{as well as a}} Marshall K200 supercharger fitted by a later owner.|$|E

25|$|When {{design work}} began in November 1940, the AC1 was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} 2 pounder gun-equipped vehicle, that was intended to be a true Cruiser tank, with a weight of between 16 and 20 tonnes. Due to a lack of home grown experience in tank design a mission was sent to the US to examine the M3 design and Colonel W.D. Watson MC, an artillery officer with many years of tank design experience was provided by the UK. He arrived in December 1940. Like the Canadian Ram, the Australian Cruiser was {{to be based on the}} <b>engine,</b> <b>drive</b> train, and lower hull of the American M3 Medium tank, mated to an upper hull and turret built closely along the lines of a British Crusader. By 1942, attempting to keep pace with German tank developments, the design specification had become more like an American medium tank, resulting in a heavier design and a higher silhouette profile.|$|E
500|$|After X1 was {{commissioned}} in December 1925 and accepted in April 1926 {{she made a}} voyage to Gibraltar after which her main <b>engine</b> <b>drive</b> wheels {{were found to be}} damaged. After repairs she was sent to the Mediterranean Sea. Her starboard camshaft driveshaft broke during a full-power run in January 1928 and a new set of gears was needed, but after refitting at Malta her port camshaft driveshaft broke in the same place in April 1928. By 1930 her commanding officer reported [...] "internal arrangements not very satisfactory because of overcrowding with auxiliary machinery, accommodation is cramped, ventilation poor and the ship suffers from humidity, diving arrangements good." [...] Both the main and auxiliary engines were troublesome and she spent most of her time under repair, before being laid up. X1 was placed in reserve after 1930, before she was finally scrapped at Pembroke on 12 December 1936.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{centre section}} contained the [...] "engine room" [...] with its two 450hp (336kW) Napier Lions in tandem. [...] One was ahead of the wing leading edge and the other at the wing centreline, with an enclosed, illuminated space between them where the engineer could stand upright and monitor and manage them. [...] The engines were mounted on the upper fuselage longerons, leaving a crawl space beneath. [...] The Lions were oriented with their gearboxes away from the engineer's room and the power from each {{was taken to the}} airscrews by two drive shafts at right angles to the fuselage. [...] The two from the front engine drove a pair of two-bladed tractor propellers ahead of the leading edge via a pair of gearboxes half way between the wings, just beyond the first interplane struts. Their mountings extended rearwards to carry a similarly driven pair of four-bladed pusher propellers driven by the rear engine. [...] Port and starboard airscrews rotated in opposite directions and the fore and aft pairs did likewise, so that either engine could be shut down without any power asymmetry. [...] The centre section, <b>engine</b> <b>drive</b> shafts and propeller mountings were built as a unit independent of the wings, the drives having their own struts and bracing. [...] The space between each fore and aft pair of propellers was occupied by a cylindrical petrol tank, and thin radiators extended between these tanks and the fuselage. [...] Radiators and driveshafts were enclosed by a streamlined fairing on either side.|$|E

50|$|The phase I {{design of}} the Chrysler TV-8 {{featured}} a Chrysler V-8 engine with 300 gross horsepower which was coupled to an electric generator located within the rear turret; the generator powered two electric motors in the front hull, each motor driving {{either of the two}} 28-inch wide tracks.

50|$|The first {{aircraft}} to fly, the Wright Flyer had an asymmetrical arrangement of pilot and engine.
