5|$|In 2010, {{two of the}} disused {{platforms}} {{hosted a}} theatrical performance of The Railway Children by E. Nesbit. The audience was seated {{either side of the}} actual railway track. The show included the use of a steam locomotive coupled to one of the original carriages from the 1970s film (propelled by a <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive).</b> The performance moved to London after two acclaimed summer runs at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E
5|$|The B's use of {{electrification}} {{instead of}} steam {{power in a}} Baltimore tunnel on the Royal Blue Line, beginning in 1895, marked the first use of electric locomotives by an American railroad and presaged the dawn of practical alternatives to steam power in the 20th century. Spurred by intense competition from the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad, the dominant railroad in the lucrative New YorkWashington market since the 1880s, the Royal Blue in its mid-1930s reincarnation was noted {{for a number of}} technological innovations, including streamlining and the first non-articulated <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> on a passenger train in the U.S., a harbinger of the steam locomotive's eventual demise.|$|E
5|$|The hotel {{had its own}} railway platform, Track 61, {{that was}} part of the New York City Subway and was {{connected}} to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform. However, it is rarely opened to the public.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> used by NSB was {{a single}} Di 1 unit {{delivered}} in 1942. It was more cost-efficient than the steam locomotives used on the non-electrified lines, and in 1945, NSB decided {{that it would not}} order more steam locomotives. General Motors' Electro Motive Division (EMD) made a bid to deliver twelve units based on their F7, and NSB agreed to lease a single unit for trial. The body and mechanical components were built by NOHAB, the motors by ASEA and prime mover by EMD. While under production in 1954, GM shipped a G12 for trial in Norway and Sweden. It was tested on the express train on the Dovre Line on 7 August, but proved to have insufficient power, causing the train to be 20 minutes late.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} repairs are the {{grinding}} of the wheels; more complicated repairs {{are made by}} replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer. By having components in reserve, trains can have shorter maintenance times. The center also has the system's work trains, including a <b>diesel</b> <b>locomotive</b> that can fetch broken trains. At any time, there are four people working at the control center. Two monitor the ATC system, one monitors passenger information, while the last is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, {{there is always a}} team of technicians who can be sent to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, Varanasi {{experienced}} a cultural revival under the Mughal emperor Akbar who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu, though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the Maratha and Brahmin kings. The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. The city {{is governed by}} the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the Parliament of India by the current Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, who won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 by a huge margin. Silk weaving, carpets and crafts and tourism employ {{a significant number of}} the local population, as do the <b>Diesel</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Works and Bharat Heavy Electricals.
