40|$|Stonecutting treatises, {{from the}} Renaissance to the Enlightenment, {{classify}} dressing methods in two broad areas. Both are named mainly after masons' tools: the square -équarrissement, escuadría, <b>dérobement,</b> robos- and the template -panneaux, plantas. However, {{the significance of}} these categories lies mostly in the geometrical notions they stand for; the square is applied when tracings make use of the orthographic projection, usually double, whereas the template is used where geometrical constructions provide true-size representations of the sides of the dressed stones. Thus, both methods are related to key concepts in Descriptive Geometry, the double orthographic projection for the square and developments and rabattements for the templates. This is not surprising, if we take into account that Gaspard Monge, the founder of Descriptive Geometry, was Professor of Theory of Stonecutting in the Ecole de Génie at Mézieres (Monge 1799, 4; Loria] 92] : 84 - 91; Taton 1954, 17 - 20; Sakarovitch] 992, 530 - 536; Sakarovitch 1995, 208 - 210; Sakarovitch] 998, 218 - 227; Rabasa 2000, 241). The picture is not so clear as it appears in the treatises, however. It has been pointed out (Rabasa 2000, 158 -] 60) that modern stonecutting mixes both methods, and that Frézier (1737, 2 :] 4; 2 :] 15 - 116), and his Spanish follower Bails (J 779, 433 - 437) propose the dressing of some pieces by a method known as demi-équarrissement or media escuadría. We shalI deal in this paper with an early example of these hybrid methods. In Cerramientos y trazas de montea, a manuscript written by Ginés Martínez de Aranda around 160 O, we can find stonecutting problems solved by means of pure squaring or full templates, the two canonical methods of mainstream treatises. Neverthe]ess, Aranda also explains the use of a two-side adjustable temp]ate, the saltarregla or sauterelle, combined with squaring; and what is more remarkable, the combination of squaring and full templates. First, we shall discuss stonecutting operations based only on orthographic projections or on true size, taking into account not only Aranda's manuscript, but also other Spanish works and, when the need arises, Philibert de L'Orme's Premier tome de L'Architecture; afterwards, we shall study the hybrid methods that appear, here and there, in Aranda' s manuscript...|$|E
