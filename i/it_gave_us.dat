25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E

[...] Grillo-Marxuach described the [...] "hysterical CPR" [...] as [...] "the biggest cliché in the book," [...] but added [...] "the nine people who were writing for the show decided, maybe we earned that. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> the emotional payoff for the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing of}} [...] "The Last Time", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it [...] "a bridge into {{thinking}} about {{writing for the}} Stones. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it." [...] The song {{was based on a}} traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.|$|E

Lynch believed the Treaty to be the practical solution, arguing {{for it in the}} Dáil debates, saying that “I stand for this Treaty on four grounds, and the one I mention last is the one that will mean the most to me. I stand for <b>it</b> because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> an army, because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> evacuation, because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> control over the finances of the country, and lastly, and greatest of all to me, because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> control over our education.” ...|$|R

500|$|The band's second UK LP, The Rolling Stones No. 2, was {{released}} in January 1965 and reached No.1 in the charts. The US version {{was released}} in February as The Rolling Stones, Now! and reached No.5. The album was recorded at Chess Studios in Chicago and RCA Studios in Los Angeles. In January and February that year the band played 34 shows for around 100,000 people in Australia and New Zealand. The single [...] "The Last Time", released in February, was the first Jagger/Richards composition to reach No.1 in the UK charts; it reached No.9 in the US. It was later identified by Richards as [...] "the bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|McDonald's {{arrival in}} Calgary was {{considered}} {{a turning point for}} the organization, one where his personality, demeanor and on-ice play came to define the Flames in the 1980s. [...] Poile argued that it signaled the true beginning of the team in its new market: [...] "The trade for Lanny McDonald was the start of the Calgary Flames franchise. [...] <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> that Calgary identity, that Western Canadian flavor." [...] Columnist and co-author of McDonald's autobiography, Steve Simmons, agreed. He added that the personal and professional disappointments McDonald endured in Toronto and Colorado resulted in his gaining a greater appreciation of both the game and himself. [...] McDonald was extremely popular with his teammates and the fans wherever he played, {{as well as with the}} media – he was named Colorado's athlete of the year in 1980 by the state's sportswriters.|$|E

Destiny's Child had dance rehearsals for the video in late September and continued the following month. During the rehearsals, Beyoncé tore her right hamstring, while overdoing the choreography. Following the injury, she was advised by a specialist to avoid dancing and other physical activities for a week; MTV News further reported that the injury could further postpone the filming of the video. However, the next week, the group revealed {{in an interview with}} the publication that the video would be filmed as originally planned as Beyoncé's leg healed fast. She said, [...] "My leg was actually a blessing in disguise because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> more time to prepare for the video".

500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones [...] "used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and {{doing it in a}} much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> all a warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E
500|$|Holland {{referred}} to Veronica's line [...] "I don't want his apology" [...] {{in the scene}} in which Logan assaults Gorya Sorokin as indicative {{of one of the}} main themes of the series: [...] "She's not interested in apologies. She's driven by a nihilistic need for action and payback." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN wrote that the scene [...] "had an air of ambiguity that could be interpreted in many ways." [...] The reviewer elaborated that Veronica's smile could have indicated further romantic interest or that Logan might have been killed in retaliation for attacking Gorya. Zacharek stated that the episode's ending [...] " [...] truncated, unfinished. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> no clear signposts telling us where, exactly, these characters are headed next, where they'll end up." [...] Holland said that the theme of the final scene [...] "seemed emphatically clear and killingly accurate. Life's a bitch until you die." [...] Goldman wrote that the ending was fitting for the series: [...] "Veronica Mars wasn't exactly a show that was driven by happy thoughts or events, even though we wouldn't have minded the characters ending up happy." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "C–" [...] grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was a}} very enjoyable and balanced episode. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> the scares, the humor, and the layered commentary that we had come to expect from the series. With only five episodes to go, it’s the perfect time for 1013 to be giving the series a good bit of resolution, even if it’s more metaphorical than actual." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two enjoyed Schnauz's script, calling it [...] "better than most" [...] of season nine's episodes, and noted that he wrote it with [...] "pace and wit". They noted, however, that the entry's self-references [...] "feel like carping [...] at the audience who are still left to complain." [...] Despite this, Shearman and Pearson also positively critiqued several of the episode's juxtapositions, such as the scene featuring Scully performing an autopsy on a cat while wearing a kitchen apron that says [...] "something smells goooood", calling them [...] "the funniest of the season". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode a [...] "solid little entry", saying that it was a [...] "nice spin on the isolation stories that the series has always done so effectively".|$|E
