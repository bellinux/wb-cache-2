5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the <b>group</b> <b>could</b> cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. Its ultimate failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither <b>group</b> <b>could</b> ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power {{well enough to know}} that their policies might be crippling it; second, the American military leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{performance}} is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, {{such as in}} the 1512 encyclopedia called the Taigensho, but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist WilliamP. Malm observed that Japanese players within a <b>group</b> <b>could</b> not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.|$|E
5|$|A Trick of the Tail had a {{positive}} reception from music critics, who were impressed that the <b>group</b> <b>could</b> not only survive the loss of Gabriel but still deliver a good album. The sound quality had improved from previous albums {{as a result of}} Hentschel's production skills. The album reached No. 3 in the UK, remaining on the charts for 39 weeks, and No. 31 in the U.S. It was certified Gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry in June and in the US by the RIAA in March 1990. The album remained in the UK charts for 39 weeks and recouped a significant amount of $400,000 worth of debt they had accumulated by the time Gabriel left.|$|E
5|$|In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle {{group who}} {{were looking for}} someone with a proper drum kit so that the <b>group</b> <b>could</b> {{transition}} from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as Starr Time.|$|E

5|$|Lloyd {{negotiated}} with Curb {{to distribute the}} group's fifth and final album on Forward Records. Released in 1970, Markley insisted the album, originally self-titled, should be released under the name Markley, A Group. The album benefited from the full involvement and production experience of Lloyd, who sang {{the majority of the}} lead vocals, provided keyboards, and organized the orchestral arrangements. Danny Harris was a key influence on the album, writing half of its tracks. However, although the album is generally considered an improvement over Where's My Daddy?, the <b>group</b> <b>could</b> no longer cope with Markley's erratic behavior, and disbanded soon after the album's release.|$|E
5|$|The Fastra II's predecessor, the Fastra I, has 4 dual-GPU GeForce 9800 GX2 video cards, for a {{total of}} 8 GPUs. At that time, the ASTRA group needed a {{motherboard}} that had four PCI Express x16 slots with double-spacing between each of them. The only such motherboard the ASTRA <b>group</b> <b>could</b> find at that time was the MSI K9A2 Platinum, which has four such slots. In 2009, the Asus P6T7 WS Supercomputer motherboard, which the Fastra II uses, was released, which has seven PCI Express x16 slots. The Fastra II has six faster dual-GPU GeForce GTX 295 video cards, and a single-GPU GeForce GTX 275, {{for a total}} of 13 GPUs. In the Fastra II, the GPUs mainly perform tomographic reconstruction. The technique which allows GPUs to perform general-purpose tasks like this outside of gaming, instead of CPUs, is called GPGPU, general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.|$|E
5|$|The Snow Prince Gasshōdan {{group is}} a {{temporary}} boy choir that was formed specially for this movie, and it is led by actor Shintaro Morimoto. The group comes under the management of Johnny Jr., a Japanese talent agency that specially trains male idols. Snow Prince Gasshōdan {{is made up of}} 10 boys, who together, had an average age of 10.5 years {{at the time of the}} filming. This makes the group Snow Prince Gasshōdan the youngest group in the history of all the Johnny Jr. idol groups to release a single. According to the movie's release committee, the group Snow Prince Gasshōdan existed until the end of 2010 before it was disbanded. Leader Shintaro Morimoto expressed hope the <b>group</b> <b>could</b> be reunited again after 10 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{crews of}} the torpedo boats {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} government, and army troops moved to the presidential palace and the coastline, but neither <b>group</b> <b>could</b> stop the mutineers. The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause, coupled with chance that the capital might be bombarded by the mutinous ships, forced the National Congress of Brazil {{to give in to}} the rebels' demands. These included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret; its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.|$|E
5|$|While in government, Disraeli {{presided over}} a series of social reforms which {{supported}} his one-nation politics and aimed to create a benevolent hierarchy. He appointed a Royal Commission to assess the state of law between employers and employees, the result of which prompted Richard Cross to pass the Employers and Workmen Act of 1875. This act made both sides of industry equal before {{the law and the}} breach of contract a civil offence, rather than criminal. Cross also passed the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act in the same year which enshrined the right to strike of workers by ensuring that acts carried out by a workers' <b>group</b> <b>could</b> not be indicted as conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the many}} {{different}} and unknown radioactive half-lives in the experiment's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring, Fermi's <b>group</b> <b>could</b> not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically. They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this, including Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner who were among the best radiochemists {{in the world at}} the time and supporters of Fermi's claim, but they all failed. Much later, it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element 93's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series. This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum, uranium below tungsten, and further suggested that element 93, at that point referred to as eka-rhenium, should be similar to the group 7 elements, including manganese and rhenium. Thorium, protactinium, and uranium, with their dominant oxidation states of +4, +5, and +6 respectively, fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, rather than below the lanthanide series, which was at the time viewed as a fluke, and whose members all have dominant +3 states; neptunium, on the other hand, has a much weaker, more unstable +7 state, with +4 and +5 being the most stable. Upon finding that plutonium and the other transuranic elements also have dominant +3 and +4 states, along with the discovery of the f-block, the actinide series was firmly established.|$|E

5|$|The group {{became a}} {{professional}} band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry. During this time, the group accepted a position {{playing at the}} nearby Canyonland theme park. The park would bring in established stars, such as Jerry Wallace, Bobby Bare, and Narvel Felts, and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set. After a while, with opportunities for the band slimmed, a discouraged Cook took a government job in Anniston, Alabama. Owen was studying English at Jacksonville State University, and Cook had an electronics job. The trio shared at $56-a-month apartment in Anniston, working to keep the band afloat with night and weekend gigs. The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973, and began performing at bars throughout the Southeast. In March, the band relocated to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, performing six nights {{a week at a}} club named The Bowery for tips. They made their best money performing cover songs of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Merle Haggard. The <b>group</b> <b>could</b> not secure a record contract and began to self-finance recordings. The group borrowed $4,000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows. Vartanian dropped out of the group, and following a rotation of four more drummers, they settled on Rick Scott in 1974.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Government {{considered}} deploying pilots from 805 Squadron {{to fight}} in Vietnam during 1967 and 1968. On 12 May 1967, the Naval Board recommended to the Government that six Skyhawk pilots and their ground crew be offered to the US Navy during May the next year after these personnel had completed their training on the new aircraft. This decision was motivated {{by a desire to}} keep the pilots gainfully occupied while Melbourne completed her refit, and would not involve deploying the A-4Gs as they lacked the weapons systems and avionics needed to counter North Vietnamese air defences. As part of the initial consideration of this option, the Minister for Air suggested that the Australian Skyhawks could be sent to Ubon Air Force Base in Thailand to relieve the CAC Sabre-equipped No. 79 Squadron RAAF stationed there, but such a deployment was found to be impractical. The Government's Defence Committee subsequently recommended that FAA fighter pilots be attached to a United States Marine Corps (USMC) unit stationed at Chu Lai Air Base and conduct combat missions over South Vietnam. While the USMC Skyhawk units frequently attacked targets in North Vietnam, the FAA aircrew were to be prohibited from joining these operations as the Government had previously decided to restrict Australia's war effort to South Vietnam. This plan was announced by Prime Minister Harold Holt in October 1967 as part of a package of Australian reinforcements to the war effort in Vietnam. In the event, the deployment did not proceed as the delays to 805 Squadron's initial Skyhawk conversion course meant that the pilots were not ready until after Melbourne re-entered service. The Navy assessed {{that it would not be}} possible to both man a fighter squadron on the carrier and post pilots to Vietnam, and delaying the reactivation of Melbournes air <b>group</b> <b>could</b> lead to criticism of the Skyhawk acquisition. In February 1969 the Minister for Defence directed that no further consideration was to be given to sending naval fighter pilots to Vietnam.|$|E
