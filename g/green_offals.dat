The red offals, of lungs, heart and liver, are then washed by the skinners and made {{ready for the}} veterinary officers to inspect them in the post-mortem examination. Another set of flayers, (splitters), divide the remaining carcass into two and then wash the carcass {{to get rid of}} any traces of blood and bone before examination.|$|E
30|$|The {{study also}} found that {{conditional}} passing occurs when 6 to 20 parasitic cysts are found and treatment by either sterilization by heat or cold treatment is used. However, in this scenario, the inspectors release the meat to specific customers mainly colleges, childrens’ homes, hospitals or other service, training and learning institutions as contact meat but cannot be sold as retail meat to consumers. However, the veterinary officers after inspecting the meat may during the judgment stage declared the meat unfit for human consumption and thus the head, the tongue, carcass, red and <b>green</b> <b>offals</b> are condemned. Condemnation of meat is based on either the health concerns that may occur if the meat finds its way to consumers or the discomfort with which consumers of meat may have with eating meat infested with liver flukes or Stilesia hepatica and other parasitic cysts. As aesthetics is one factor driving the consumption of meat, meat infested with parasitic cysts becomes less appealing, and thus, condemnation is necessitated.|$|E

To get the full text please contact the other at karm@uofk. eduSheep, either live or slaughtered, are the most important among Sudan’s animal exports – a major source of foreign currency. Accordingly, diseases that cause rejection of live sheep at veterinary quarantines and in importing countries, as well as pathological conditions causing condemnation of sheep meat, should receive more attention by veterinarians; not only because of their economic importance, but also because of the potential hazards to human health, especially through meat consumption and handling. The present investigation reviewed the causes of sheep carcass condemnations as well as the condemnation of red offals and some <b>green</b> <b>offals</b> of sheep slaughtered for export. The study analysed records from two major abattoirs in Khartoum State of Sudan covering the period Jan – Dec 2011. Whole carcass condemnation during this period was 0. 1 % of the total sheep slaughtered for export. Main causes of carcass condemnations were jaundice, (64. 8 %) and hydatid cysts (20 %). Other causes (15. 2 %) included abscesses, emaciation, and adhesions. Total condemnation of offals (liver, kidney, heart, lung and spleen) was high (12. 8 %), with liver constituting the major condemned part (83 %) followed by the lungs (12. 4 %), the heart (4. 0 %), kidneys (0. 4 %) and the spleen (0. 2 %). Major pathological changes in the condemned livers were necrosis, calcification, hydatid cysts, adhesions, fascioliasis, abscesses, jaundice, colour changes and fatty degeneration. Although the described pathological conditions were not further investigated in relation to the diseases they can represent, they point to a high prevalence of parasitic diseases in slaughtered animals. Although the described conditions were not related to areas of animal breeding in the country, they more or less reflect the diseases of sheep {{in the western part of}} the country, especially Kurdofan region, where most of export sheep are raised. It is highly recommended that the diseases manifesting as jaundice, in addition to other liver diseases in sheep are investigated...|$|E

30|$|I interviewed 20 {{people out}} of which we had 16 men who included: pastoralists, butchers, {{livestock}} buyers, veterinary officers, <b>green</b> <b>offal</b> cleaners, splitters, skinners, and those who slaughter the livestock at the slaughterhouse. I also managed to interview 4 women at the slaughterhouse among them were 2 veterinary officers, a single pastoralist woman and one butcher. The proportion of women was less because of their low rate of engagement in slaughterhouse operations as {{compared to that of}} men. This study collected qualitative data only and relied on convenient sampling in selecting informants. Literature on the actors and their roles, and the institutional settings and changes at the slaughterhouse was reviewed. Interviews using key informant interview guides were conducted with pastoralists, livestock buyers, butchers, veterinary officers and flayers as key stakeholders at the slaughterhouse. This elicited information on the specific objectives, establishing actors and their roles in pastoralism at the slaughterhouse and describing the institutional settings and changes in pastoralism. Another data collecting method used at the slaughterhouse was unstructured observations, to give insights into the design and the terrain of the slaughterhouse and the level of physical interactions eliciting economic and social relationships among actors and their roles.|$|R
40|$|Livestock-associated MRSA {{has been}} found in various animals, {{livestock}} farmers and retail meat. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and determinants of nasal MRSA carriage in pig slaughterhouse workers. Three large pig slaughterhouses in The Netherlands were studied in 2008 using human and environmental samples. The overall prevalence of nasal MRSA carriage in employees of pig slaughterhouses was 5. 6 % (14 / 249) (95 % CI 3. 4 - 9. 2) and working with live pigs was the single most important factor for being MRSA positive (OR 38. 2, P< 0. 0001). At the start of the day MRSA was only found in environmental samples from the lairages (10 / 12), whereas {{at the end of the}} day MRSA was found in the lairages (11 / 12), the dirty (5 / 12) and clean (3 / 12) areas and <b>green</b> <b>offal</b> (1 / 3). The MRSA status of the environmental samples correlated well with the MRSA status of humans working in these sections (r= 0. 75). In conclusion, a high prevalence of nasal MRSA carriage was found in pig-slaughterhouse workers, and working with live pigs is the most important risk factor. Exact transmission routes from animals to humans remain to be elucidated in order to enable application of targeted preventive measures...|$|R
30|$|At the {{post-mortem}} examination area, the veterinary officers conduct visual examinations, palpation and incise the head, the tongue, the <b>green</b> and red <b>offals</b> {{and the rest}} of the carcass before declaring the products fit for human consumption. The examination inspects the slaughter stock for discoloration of the eyes, ears, nostrils, exposed muscles and tongue. In so doing, they screen for signs of jaundice, anemia, hemorrhages, abcesses and swellings. They also screen for liver cirrhosis, degeneration of the liver, inflammation of the capsule of the liver and any signs of parasitic cysts like liver flukes, Stilesia hepatica, abcesses and swelling of the liver. Additionally, they also look for possible conditions like pneumonia, pleurisy, parasitic cysts, Echinococcus granulosus, hemorrhages, Cysticercus bovis, and pericarditis.|$|R
30|$|A set of flayers {{take over}} the {{slaughterhouse}} operations from the veterinary officers in the ante-mortem examination. The first set of flayers is the slaughterhouse workers charged with slaughtering the livestock. They use a captive-bolt pistol to knock down the slaughter stock. This {{is considered to be}} a humane method of slaughter in line with the Islamic laws governing the consumption of Halal foods for members of the Islamic faith. The study was informed that the use of the Halal method ensures that the slaughterhouse workers pronounce the name of the Almighty God, Allah, before severing the neck of the slaughter stock, leaving it to bleed out to death and then detaching the head of the slaughter stock. Skinners are the second set of flayers, who open up the hide of the stock. The skinners also open up the carcass from the thorax to allow veterinary officers to inspect the organs and also remove the <b>green</b> and red <b>offals.</b>|$|R
