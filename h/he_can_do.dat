5|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Steven Moffat wrote the episode as an introduction for Amy {{into the role}} of the Doctor's companion. The episode showcases her first adventure away from her home world and her first time in space. The climax of the episode, where the Doctor decides the best thing <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is kill the Star Whale as painlessly as possible but Amy comes up with an alternative solution that is more humane, was designed to stand out in the Doctor's memory as a failure of a huge scale.

After Bob has measured all the photons, he communicates with Alice over the public classical channel. Alice broadcasts the basis each photon was sent in, and Bob the basis each was measured in.

25|$|For a {{good deal}} of time, Ryang had to rely on Fanta to deal with evil affinities until they could be purified. This changed when Fanta's brother gave Ryang some strong magical {{abilities}} using his skateboard as a medium. So far, Ryang has used the skateboard to fly, and created a powerful energy blast by drawing on its power, even though it was nowhere near him. Five spirits can inhabit the skateboard, each representing one of the five elements (earth, fire, wood, water, and metal). Evidently, Ryang does not have to have the skateboard with him to access magical power, and is extremely likely <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> much more.|$|E

5000|$|Capturing the {{opposing}} King or Landowner - {{this is usually}} a crippling blow to a player in any case, as <b>he</b> <b>can</b> no longer win by capturing all his opponent's pieces; <b>he</b> <b>can</b> only <b>do</b> so by trapping his opponent's remaining forces as above.|$|R
