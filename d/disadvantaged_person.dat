In addition, ziswa also works so that the circulation of wealth is not just spinning among a group of people just standing.

40|$|Social {{economy is}} a widely {{discussed}} topic in the Czech Republic and other states at the moment. This is mainly thanks to its {{positive impact on the}} employment of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>persons</b> and their integration into the society, which is in many cases very difficult and the state fails to provide for it. The support for <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>persons</b> and their entering open job market is still struggling and the tools that the engaged parties try to use do not always work. Social enterprise is one of the possible solutions to this problem. The thesis's theoretical part outlines the topic of social enterprise taking into account both external (legislation, funding, legal forms) and internal (<b>disadvantaged</b> <b>persons</b> employment specifics, organizational culture, employees mentoring and development) factors that affect the way social enterprises work. The practical part uses qualitative research to focus on the opinions of persons with disabilities and executives on the development of social enterprises employees and their possible transfer to the open job market.

40|$|The study, {{focused on}} the European Union law, deals with the puzzling {{relationship}} between the prohibition of every discrimination founded on sex in employment (and social) matters (art. 157 TFEU, secondary EU law, and art. 23 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights) and the faculty, now recognized to the Member States by primary European law (art. 157 par. 4 TFEU, art. 23, par. 2 of the EU Charter) to provide the under-represented sex with special (compensatory) advantages. The question discussed in the essay is whether the case law of the European Court of Justice deems these "positive actions" as a normative exception to the prohibition of every discrimination (therefore of restrictive interpretation) or as a normative expression of the general principle of equality. At present the case law suggests an holistic approach. The equality principle, in that vein, is structured not only in a negative, but in a positive dimension too. The unwritten European Union law recognizes a substantial or "true" meaning of the equality, whose fulfilment is entrusted to the national (or European) legislator. However the negative dimension of the principle mandates a careful delimitation of the special privilege attributed to the under-represented sex, and may conveniently force (by virtue of the substantial strand of the equality) its extension to the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>person</b> of the opposite sex...|$|E
40|$|DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE are apathetic toward {{and anxious}} about any {{organization}} {{in which there}} is a credibility gap between what it purports to provide and what it actually does provide. The effective library enables the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>person</b> to find answers to his immediate problems. Disadvantaged people may have to go through one stage of using the library for practical immediate information before they can accommodate themselves to use the library for aesthetic satisfaction. The purpose of this article is to summarize current research findings in reading and to describe programs and practices about the disadvantaged as they relate or may relate to the library and librarians. The article has been divided into a number of sections in order to discuss the various aspects of reading research and practices. The final section consists of a variety of implications which have been culled from the research and the reported practices, as well as the experiences of the authors of this article in working with the disadvantaged learner. FAMILY STATUS AND HOME ENVIRONMENT In identifying characteristics of the disadvantaged learner, the home environment has received considerable attention. Bloom, et at., stated that the home is the single most important influence on the intellectual and emotional development of young children. They noted that there were fewer books in lower class homes, and that children were read to less frequently and spoken to less by their parents than upper class children. Their environment has been described as overcrowded, noisy...|$|E

40|$|The Protestant {{work ethic}} (PWE) is {{prevalent}} in many cultures. Abundant work in social psychology, {{primarily in the}} U.

The main goal of the present investigation was to show that PWE does not necessarily develop a justifier meaning within or across cultures.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the possibilities of}} ergodiagnostics (pre-work rehabilitation), appraisal diagnostics, {{in the area of}} employment of medically handicapped people. It emphasises the value of work and being employed for the medically disadvantaged. It familiarises those interested with this matter with the means of a complete system of rehabilitation where occupational rehabilitation is irreplaceable. The study informs where legislation on (pre-work) ergodiagnostics can be found, through vocational rehabilitation we discover more detailed information and furthermore what a medically <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>person</b> should do to be able to participate actively in ergodiagnostics. It also offers a thorough overview of ergotherapy which {{plays an important role in}} diagnostics, particularly ergodiagnostics of medically handicapped people. It leads you through individual evaluations which are currently used by ergotherapists in complete rehabilitation centres where ergodiagnostics is practised. It is not only ergotherapists, however, who participate in vocational rehabilitation but a whole multi-discipline team which cooperates with job centres. The practical part is oriented on the field of ergodiagnostics or else vocational rehabilitation. Two suppositions were made for the research. The first supposition explores how well-informed people with a medical handicap are about ergodiagnostics. The second then assumes that ergodiagnostics plays a significant role in searching for suitable vacancies for the medically handicapped. The study should serve as informative material for all interested in the problem concerned. It should be especially useful to those who work with the medically handicapped and who want to have an integral view of (pre-work) ergodiagnostics, vocational rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Social {{inclusion}} {{is considered}} to lead to equal participation in society, and, indirectly, to people’s welfare (Gingrich and Lightman 2015). Researchers and policy makers have put forth the adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), arguing that these can deliver reforms and support disadvantaged individuals to overcome long-standing inequalities (Sourbati 2012). However, mere adoption of ICT {{is not enough to}} achieve social inclusion. Rather, it is necessary that the design and the functionality of ICT meet the needs and expectations of disadvantaged individuals (Zheng 2009), as these can help them meet their personal goals. However, disadvantaged individuals exhibit quite different characteristics, which form their needs and expectations. On the one hand, ICT products and services that may support one type of individuals and help them overcome some impediments, may as well inhibit others’ access to these ICT. On the other hand, aside accessibility and availability, desirability is also important for the successful use of ICT. In other words, ICT products and services need to account both for what individuals are able to do, and what they wish to achieve. This chapter investigates the abilities, needs and desires of individuals who experience to some extent social exclusion, by focusing specifically on the role of ICT. It is based on a literature review of previous studies at the crossroad of social inclusion and ICT. Drawing upon Sen’s Capability Approach (Sen 2000), it identifies the individual abilities, the opportunities and the expectations a <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>person</b> has so that she can lead a life she values (Zheng 2009). In this sense, it illustrates the needs and requirements of disadvantaged individuals, with the aim to facilitate the discussion on social inclusion through ICT products and services that can be of benefit for the concerned individuals...|$|E

40|$|The {{capabilities}} {{approach has}} emphasized that inequalities {{can be analyzed}} in various dimensions of human functioning. Indicators of these inequalities {{can be incorporated into}} assessments of well-being. The capabilities approach also highlights the intrinsic importance of agency and demonstrates empirically that agency is instrumentally valuable for achieving various functionings. This paper draws together these discussions to delineate the relationships among inequalities, agency, and well-being of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>persons.</b> A person 2 ̆ 019 s relative deprivation (e. g., being illiterate or being in ill-health) negatively affects her well-being and contributes to her lack of agency.
