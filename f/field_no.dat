These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic <b>field.</b> <b>No</b> mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} February, {{the warring}} parties reached a compromise. Under its terms, Modell {{would be allowed}} to take his personnel to Baltimore, but would leave Cleveland the Browns' colors, logos and heritage for a reactivated Browns franchise that would take the <b>field</b> <b>no</b> later than 1999. The $175 million earmarked for stadium improvements was to be used instead build a new stadium, with up to $48 million of additional financial assistance from the NFL. Further, Modell was ordered to pay Cleveland $9.3 million to compensate for lost revenues and taxes during the Browns' three years of inactivity, plus up to $2.25 million of the city's legal fees. As a result of the deal Modell's team was technically an expansion franchise, called the Baltimore Ravens.|$|E

Both coaches are considered to be among the best in the MLS, and it was the first meeting between the two in the playoffs. The Sounders lost by a 3–1 aggregate and Arena moved within one game of Schmid's MLS postseason record of 19 wins.|$|E

25|$|After {{his victory}} in the {{qualification}} race, Vernay started from pole position with Ericsson starting alongside, with Mortara and Bottas on row two. Due to damage inflicted in his spectacular accident the previous day, Boyd did not start, thus leaving the grid at 28 cars.

Into Lisboa, Ricciardo got alongside Ericsson as they battled for fourth with the Australian brushing {{the wall and the}} two continued side-by-side into San Francisco, with Ricciardo again nudging the wall. Behind them, Vanthoor left his braking far too late for Lisboa, and mounted over Chilton, which caused the teenage Briton to retire on the spot. Ricciardo's clip with the wall caused a left-rear puncture, but he managed to carry on up the hill, until he crashed {{at the entrance to the}} Solitude Esses. His car rebounded off the wall, and into direct line of the rest of the <b>field.</b> <b>No</b> less than half a dozen cars impacted with the stricken car, and blocked the track which ultimately led to a red flag, and a race suspension.

Imperatori was also involved, returning to the pits for a lengthy period, but returned to complete three laps towards the end. Vanthoor, with a damaged front wheel after his collision with Chilton, stopped just short of the accident site, and was thus able to continue in the race.|$|E
