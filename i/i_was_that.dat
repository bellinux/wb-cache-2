However, she later said that her career struggles continued after Election due to public confusion between the character and the actress. [...] "I'm not Tracy Flick.

[...] The poem Pinsky reads in the episode was picked by the Simpsons writing staff, [...] "The poem has two jokes in it," [...] Pinsky said, [...] "and when I say jokes I don't mean witty remarks. It's more like an optician, the pope and a zebra go into the bar and then there's a punch line at the end." [...] He stated that the poem was [...] "an elegy for {{a friend of mine who}} liked jokes". He added that his appearance on the show gave him [...] "a lot more prestige" [...] when visiting high schools and colleges.

500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> day." [...] Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad.|$|E
500|$|During Brain's {{tenure at}} de Havilland, the company {{manufactured}} sixty-nine Vampire T35 jet trainers at its Bankstown factory for delivery to the RAAF, {{as well as}} Sea Venoms for the RAN. Leaving deHavilland upon its merger with Hawker Siddeley in 1960, he gave up full-time work and joined the board of East-West Airlines as a consultant in January 1961. In August 1964, he began negotiations with the Federal government on behalf of International Parcels Express Company (now Toll IPEC), which was attempting to enter the air freight business in Australia with the purchase of five DC-4 Skymasters; the government rejected the proposal later that year. Along with Arthur Coles, Brain was a guest {{at the opening of}} TAA's new headquarters at Franklin Street, Melbourne in November 1965. In 1978, he met with adventurer Dick Smith, who was about to launch an expedition to recover the Kookaburra from the Tanami Desert. Smith was keen to get directions from the man who had found the missing plane in 1929, in spite of receiving advice against taking the word of someone from the [...] "cap and goggles" [...] era. He rediscovered the Kookaburra in August that year [...] "exactly where Lester Brain had said...Lester was completely chuffed when I got back and told him I'd found the Kookaburra thanks to his directions and how thankful <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> despite everyone else's suggestions, I'd taken Lester's advice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Director Kenneth Branagh's {{frequent}} composing collaborator Patrick Doyle called Thor [...] "the most commercially {{high profile}} film I have done since Frankenstein", {{and noted that}} [...] "Marvel Studios have a brand in Thor. Their interest, like mine, was for strong thematic material that would {{capture the essence of}} that brand." [...] Branagh and Doyle wanted the score to have a contemporary feel, while Doyle [...] "was also eager for the score to contain a strong sense of melody, which [...] responds to in my work. He was keen, as indeed <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> the grand images were not in any way hyperbolized, and {{that there would be a}} balance between playing with, and against the images." [...] To distinguish between the realms of Asgard and Earth musically, Doyle used [...] "broader orchestral strokes and thicker orchestration" [...] to depict the grandeur and beauty of Asgard, and more [...] "contemporary, electronic and percussion driven" [...] music for the Earth scenes, incorporating the then-popular ostinato technique [...] "in a symphonic way whenever appropriate".|$|E
