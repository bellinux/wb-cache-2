25|$|The fuel {{channels}} {{can only}} maintain criticality {{if they are}} mechanically sound. If {{the temperature of the}} fuel bundles increases {{to the point where they}} are mechanically unstable, their <b>horizontal</b> <b>layout</b> means they will bend under gravity, shifting the layout of the bundles and reducing the efficiency of the reactions. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimum for a chain reaction and the natural uranium fuel has little excess reactivity, any significant deformation will stop the inter-fuel pellet fission reaction. This will not stop heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable heat output. If this process further weakens the fuel bundles, they will eventually bend far enough to touch the calandria tube, allowing heat to be efficiently transferred into the moderator tank. The moderator vessel has a considerable thermal capability on its own, and is normally kept relatively cool.|$|E

2500|$|Megatokyos early strips {{were laid}} out in four square panels per strip, in a two-by-two square array – a {{formatting}} choice made as a compromise between the <b>horizontal</b> <b>layout</b> of American comic strips and the vertical layout of Japanese comic strips.

This format allowed for both large, detailed drawings and small, abstract progressions, as based on the needs of the script.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a stochastic model of urban railway track geometry irregularities, based on experimental data. The considered irregularities are track gauge, su-perelevation, horizontal and vertical curvatures. They are modelled as random fields whose statistical properties are extracted from a large set of on-track measurements of the geometry of an urban railway network. About 300 to 1000 terms are used in the Karhunen-Lò eve/Polynomial Chaos expansions to represent the random fields with appropriate accuracy. The construction of the random fields is then validated by comparing on-track measurements of the contact forces and numerical dynamics simulations for different operational conditions (train velocity and car load) and <b>horizontal</b> <b>layouts</b> (alignment, curve). The dynamics simulations are performed both with and without randomly generated geometrical irregularities for the track. The power spectrum densities obtained from the dynamics simulations with the model of geometrical irregularities compare extremely well with those obtained from the experimental contact forces. Without irregularities, the spectrum is 10 to 50 dB too low...|$|R

40|$|In Data mining project most of {{the time}} {{consuming}} task is to prepare a required data set for data mining analysis because in general the relational database has collection of tables and views that must be joined, aggregated and transformed in order to build the required data set. As result, {{most of the}} complex SQL queries are written multiple times independently from each other and in a disorganized manner. Therefore, the database grows with many tables and views that are not present as entities in the ER model. Similarly existing SQL aggregations having some limitations to prepare normalized data sets because they return only one column per aggregated group. To address this issue, we propose simple methods to generate SQL code to return aggregated columns in a <b>horizontal</b> tabular <b>layout,</b> where every row corresponds to an observation and every column is associated to a one variable. This new class of functions is called horizontal aggregations. Horizontal aggregations is extension of standard SQL aggregation for building data sets with a <b>horizontal</b> denormalized <b>layout,</b> which is input for most of the data mining algorithms.

Three years later, a new plant was built at the present location and Hatz started to export engines to South America.

50|$|The {{standard}} conveyor uses {{a specially}} designed plastic crescent top chain. The chain actually runs on its side (on its link plates), with the crescent plate attached {{to the other side}} plate by means of a snap pin.

Further, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>layout</b> means that there is no return side of the chain, which not only eliminates chain sag and sliding with the roller, but allows for a much shallower design.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} aimed at {{developing}} effective techniques for reducing learner cognitive overload while using pinyin to learn Chinese language. Pinyin {{is one of the}} phonetic systems used to provide auditory information about Chinese characters. It was suggested that certain commonly used formats for presenting pinyin might impose high levels of cognitive load that exceed learner working memory capacity. In one experiment, learning effects of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>layouts</b> of characters, pinyin, and English translations were compared. It was suggested that the horizontal presentation format might require learner to search and match characters and the corresponding components of pinyin that might unnecessarily consume cognitive resources making them unavailable for effective learning. Results indicated a significant difference favouring the vertical format. This advantage of the vertical layout was attributed to the reduced split attention by making the correspondence of instructional components obvious when parts of pinyin were placed exactly below the matching characters. Another type of extraneous cognitive load that may be caused by pinyin is associated with multimedia redundancy. It was suggested that simultaneously presenting written (pinyin) and spoken (corresponding pronunciation) text that contained identical information could be detrimental for learning. In this situation, additional cognitive activities involved in processing pinyin and cross-referencing them with corresponding pronunciation might impose a wasteful cognitive load. Learning effects of alternative presentation formats (full pinyin, partial pinyin, and no pinyin) were compared using learners with different levels of prior experience (pinyin reading skills and spoken Mandarin proficiency) and materials with different levels of complexity (modern Chinese vocabulary, modern Chinese sentences, and classical Chinese sentences). Results demonstrated that the removal of pinyin might enhance learning Chinese language. However, the effect depended on learners&# 146; prior language proficiency and experience with pinyin (an expertise reversal effect), {{as well as on the}} level of instructional support provided by pinyin. The effect might also apply only to certain aspect of language learning, for example, recognition of characters and pronunciation...|$|R
