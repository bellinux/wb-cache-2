40|$|Objective: Four {{different}} patterns of demyelination {{have been described}} in active <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesions</b> of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients that were biopsied shortly after disease onset. These patterns were suggested to represent heterogeneity of the underlying pathogenesis. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether lesion heterogeneity also exists in an unselected collection of autopsy material from patients with established MS. Methods: All MS brain tissue available in the VU Medical Center was assessed for the presence of active <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesions</b> using magnetic resonance imaging-guided sampling and immunohistochemistry. Tissue blocks containing active <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesions</b> were evaluated for the presence of complement and antibody deposition, oligodendrocyte apoptosis, differential loss of myelin proteins, and hypoxia-like damage using histology, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. Blocks with active <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesions</b> were compared with blocks with active (nondemyelinating) and inactive lesions. Results: Complement and antibodies were consistently associated with macrophages in areas of active demyelination. Preferential loss of myelin proteins, extensive hypoxia-like damage, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis were absent or rare. This pattern was observed in all tissue blocks containing active <b>demyelinating</b> lesions; <b>lesion</b> heterogeneity between patients was not found. Interpretation: The immunopathological appearance of active <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesions</b> in established MS is uniform. Initial heterogeneity of <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesions</b> in the earliest phase of MS lesion formation may disappear over time as different pathways converge in one general mechanism of demyelination. Consistent presence of complement, antibodies, and Fcγ receptors in phagocytic macrophages suggests that antibody- and complement-mediated myelin phagocytosis is the dominant mechanism of demyelination in established MS. © 2008 American Neurological Association...|$|R

40|$|Tumefactive <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesion,</b> {{a variant}} of {{multiple}} sclerosis, is a solitary large <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesion,</b> which mimics cerebral neoplasm. Distinguishing tumefactive lesions from other etiologies of intracranial space-occupying lesions is essential to avoid inadvertent surgical or toxic chemotherapeutic interventions. We report two unusual cases of tumefactive <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesion.</b> The first patient presented with recurrent right focal tonic-clonic seizures with secondary generalization of three-month duration. Her neurological examination was normal. Another patient presented with right homonymous hemianopia. In this patient, the diagnosis was established after biopsy of the lesion, which revealed perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and aggregates of foam cells in white matter with relatively uninvolved grey matter, suggestive of tumefactive <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesion.</b> Administration of intravenous methylprednisolone resulted in rapid clinical improvement in both the patients and the brain lesion decreased in size. Both, epilepsy and homonymous hemianopia, are unusual manifestations of tumefactive demyelinating lesions. In our cases, cerebral tumors were initial diagnoses. Presence of an open ring or incomplete ring lesions and other magnetic resonance characteristics helped in differentiating demyelinating lesions from other neoplastic and infective diseases of the brain.

40|$|Abstract A {{stereotactic}} biopsy of a 17 -year-old woman {{revealed an}} active inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesion</b> compatible with pattern III multiple sclerosis (MS) according to Lucchinetti et al. The biopsy included a white matter region {{distant from the}} active inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesion</b> with abnormal MRI signal, lacking histopathological signs of demyelination and/or oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Expression analysis of this area revealed a strong up-regulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Furthermore, detection of nitrotyrosine provided evidence for reactive nitrogen species (RNS) -mediated damage to oligodendrocytes. Concomitantly, genes involved in neuroprotection against oxidative stress such as heme oxygenase 1 were up-regulated. Even though a single case report, this study shows earliest molecular changes in white matter surrounding an actively <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesion</b> during the first manifestation of MS, pointing toward a more widespread pathological process. Therapeutic targeting of the identified mechanisms of tissue injury might be crucial to prevent further lesion formation or secondary tissue damage...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMultiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} disorder {{that affects the}} central nervous system myelin. However, a few radiological cases have documented an involvement of peripheral cranial nerves, within the subarachnoid space, in MS patients. We report the case of a 36 -year-old female with a history of relapsing-remitting (RR) MS who consulted for a subacute complete paralysis of the right III nerve. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination showed enhancement and thickening of the cisternal right III nerve, in continuity with a linear, mesencephalic, acute <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesion.</b> Radiological involvement of the cisternal part of III nerve has been reported only once in MS patients. Radiological involvement of the cisternal part of V nerve occurs more frequently, in almost 3 % of MS patients. In both situations, the presence of a central <b>demyelinating</b> <b>lesion,</b> in continuity with the enhancement of the peripheral nerve, suggests that peripheral nerve damage is a secondary process, rather than a primary target of demyelination...|$|E
40|$|SummaryOligodendrocyte {{progenitor}} cells (OPCs) can repair <b>demyelinated</b> <b>lesions</b> by maturing into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. However, the OPC {{potential to}} differentiate {{can be prevented}} by inhibitory signals present in the pathological lesion environment. Identification of these signals is essential to promote OPC differentiation and lesion repair. We identified an endogenous inhibitor of remyelination, Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), which is highly expressed in reactive astrocytes of <b>demyelinated</b> <b>lesions.</b> Using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that ET- 1 drastically reduces the rate of remyelination. We also discovered that ET- 1 acts mechanistically by promoting Notch activation in OPCs during remyelination through induction of Jagged 1 expression in reactive astrocytes. Pharmacological inhibition of ET signaling prevented Notch activation in <b>demyelinated</b> <b>lesions</b> and accelerated remyelination. These findings reveal that ET- 1 is a negative regulator of OPC differentiation and remyelination and is potentially a therapeutic target to promote <b>lesion</b> repair in <b>demyelinated</b> tissue...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic {{encephalopathy}} (PE) {{is one of}} {{the severe}} complications of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).
