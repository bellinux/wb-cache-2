50|$|The <b>intercept</b> <b>method,</b> {{also known}} as Marcq St. Hilaire method, is an astronomical {{navigation}} method of calculating an observer's position on earth. It was originally called the azimuth <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> because the process involves drawing a line which intercepts the azimuth line. This name was shortened to <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> and the intercept distance was shortened to 'intercept'.|$|E

50|$|The Ex-Meridian {{method of}} calculating sights {{is at its}} most {{accurate}} when the azimuth of the object is near to south or north. As the azimuth changes towards the east or west the cross of the position line with the assumed longitude {{becomes more and more}} oblique and the position obtained is therefore less accurate. For this reason it is a less versatile method of calculating sights than the <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> which can be used for all azimuths. The tables are a quick and easy way to correct the altitude when the object is fairly low in the sky and the observer has only missed noon by a few minutes but if noon has been missed by more than that or the sun is high in the sky it is better to work out a sight by the <b>intercept</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E
50|$|A common {{misconception}} in the stereological {{literature is}} that design based methodologies require that all objects of interest {{must have the}} same probability of being selected. It is true that making such a design decision ensures an unbiased result, {{but it is not}} necessary. The use of nonuniform sampling is often used in stereological work. The point sampled <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> selects cells using a point probe. The result is a volume-weighted estimate {{of the size of the}} cells. This is not a biased result.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> {{is based}} on the {{following}} principle.The actual distance from the observer to the geographical position (GP) of a celestial body (that is, the point where it is directly overhead) is [...] "measured" [...] using a sextant. The observer has already estimated his position by dead reckoning and calculated the distance from the estimated position to the body's GP; the difference between the [...] "measured" [...] and calculated distances is called the intercept.The diagram on the right shows why the zenith distance of a celestial body is equal to the angular distance of its GP from the observer's position.|$|E
50|$|An example {{illustrating}} the concept behind the <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> for determining one’s position {{is shown to}} the right. (Two other common methods for determining one’s position using celestial navigation are the longitude by chronometer and ex-meridian methods.) In the adjacent image, the two circles on the map represent lines of position for the Sun and Moon at 1200 GMT on October 29, 2005. At this time, a navigator on a ship at sea measured the Moon to be 56 degrees above the horizon using a sextant. Ten minutes later, the Sun was observed to be 40 degrees above the horizon. Lines of position were then calculated and plotted {{for each of these}} observations. Since both the Sun and Moon were observed at their respective angles from the same location, the navigator would have to be located at one of the two locations where the circles cross.|$|E
5000|$|The {{celestial}} line {{of position}} concept was discovered in 1837 by Thomas Hubbard Sumner when, after one observation he computed and plotted his longitude at more than one trial latitude in his vicinity - and noticed that the positions lay along a line. Using this method with two bodies, navigators were finally able to cross two position lines and obtain their position - in effect determining both latitude and longitude. Later in the 19th century came {{the development of the}} modern (Marcq St. Hilaire) intercept method; with this method the body height and azimuth are calculated for a convenient trial position, and compared with the observed height. The difference in arcminutes is the nautical mile [...] "intercept" [...] distance that the position line needs to be shifted toward or away {{from the direction of the}} body's subpoint. (The <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> uses the concept illustrated in the example in the “How it works” section above.) Two other methods of reducing sights are the longitude by chronometer and the ex-meridian method.|$|E

50|$|The {{alternative}} {{is to take the}} original normal distribution of radiocarbon age ranges and use it to generate a histogram showing the relative probabilities for calendar ages. This has to be done by numerical methods rather than by a formula because the calibration curve is not describable as a formula. Programs to perform these calculations include OxCal and CALIB. These can be accessed online; they allow the user to enter a date range at one standard deviation confidence for the radiocarbon ages, select a calibration curve, and produce probabilistic output both as tabular data and in graphical form.In the example CALIB output shown at left, the input data is 1270 BP, {{with a standard deviation of}} 10 radiocarbon years. The curve selected is the northern hemisphere INTCAL13 curve, part of which is shown in the output; the vertical width of the curve corresponds to the width of the standard error in the calibration curve at that point. A normal distribution is shown at left; this is the input data, in radiocarbon years. The central darker part of the normal curve is the range within one standard deviation of the mean; the lighter grey area shows the range within two standard deviations of the mean. The output is along the bottom axis; it is a trimodal graph, with peaks at around 710 AD, 740 AD, and 760 AD. Again, the ranges within the 1σ confidence range are in dark grey, and the ranges within the 2σ confidence range are in light grey. This output can be compared with the output of the <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> in the graph above for the same radiocarbon date range.|$|E

30|$|We outline here a {{computational}} approach {{designed for}} easy integration into existing inventory techniques for down WD. By {{far the most}} common technique for measuring down wood is the planar <b>intercept</b> <b>method,</b> which allows computation of WD volume and mass using diameter as the only field measurement (Brown 1974, Harmon and Sexton 1996). The planar <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> carries several major assumptions regarding uniformity of inherently heterogeneous properties such as decay status, particle shape, wood density, etc. (Van Wagner 1982); these have been widely accepted in the biometric literature. Because the approach we present here functions within this framework, it necessarily carries assumptions regarding char similar to those historically used for other characteristics (e.g., uniformity of char around particle circumference, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Aboveground plant biomass {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} features of ecosystems, and it is widely used in ecosystem research. Non-destructive biomass estimation methods provide an important toolkit, because the destructive harvesting method is in many cases not feasible. However, only few studies have compared the accuracy of these methods in grassland communi - ties to date. We studied the accuracy of three widely used methods for estimation of aboveground biomass: the visual cover estimation method, the point <b>intercept</b> <b>method,</b> and field spectroscopy. We applied them in three independent series of field samplings in semi-arid sand grasslands in Central Hungary. For each sampling method, we applied linear regression to assess the strength of the relationship between biomass proxies and actual aboveground biomass, and used coefficient of determina - tion to evaluate accuracy. We found no evidence that the visual cover estimation, which is generally considered as a subjective method, was less accurate than point <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> or field spectroscopy in estimating biomass. Based on our three datasets, we found that accuracy was lower for the point <b>intercept</b> <b>method</b> compared to the other two methods, while field spectroscopy and visual cover estimation were similar to each other in the semi-arid sand grassland community. We conclude that visual cover estimation can be as accurate for estimating aboveground biomass as other approaches, thus the choice amongst the methods should be based on additional pros and cons associated with each of the method and related to the specific research objective...|$|E

Vegetative parameters were quantified using combinations of distance and line <b>intercept</b> <b>methods.</b> Acquired {{data were analyzed using}} cluster analysis and analysis of variance tests. Results indicated that three of the four plant communities of the study sites were dominated by Acacia tortilis with underground cover composed of lesser species. On the other hand, White Jabal was dominated by scrubs composed mainly of Fagonia indica with sparse Acacia trees. Rumrumiyya site recorded the highest species abundance and vegetative coverage (133 %) among the sites. It is concluded that Black Jabal and White Jabal sites are used as nesting and foraging habitats for houbaras, whereas Jabal Khurse is specifically a males’ display site. Nevertheless, Rumrumiyya site was used for foraging and shelter. The study confirmed that density and vegetation cover are of prime importance for houbara site selection.

40|$|Some unique {{characteristics}} of the polar atmosphere affect the height assignment of cloud and water vapor features used in high-latitude wind estimation. In particular, low water vapor amounts, atmospheric temperature inversions, and low, thin clouds on height assignment can significantly impact the infrared window, CO 2 -slicing, and H 2 O <b>intercept</b> <b>methods.</b> Satellite-derived and modeled cloud and atmospheric properties show that 20 - 35 % of polar clouds are low (greater than 600 hPa) and thin (optical depths less than 5), with associated height assignment errors averaging 75 hPa.

The tephra forms an isochronous marker bed for various late-Holocene stratigraphic and palaeoen vironmental studies but is particularly important for evaluating the chronology of New Zealand's notably short prehistory because it was erupted within the last millennium, close {{to the time of}} first Polynesian colonization. We derive a definitive radiocarbon age, previously ambiguous, for the Kaharoa Tephra of 665615 BP using cluster analysis of 22 radiocarbon ages relevant to the Kaharoa eruptive episode. The error-weighted mean age obtained on unscreened ages, minus outliers, is supported by statistically identical ages obtained from three sets of screened ages selected to minimize the effects of inbuilt age or contamination. Based on the <b>intercepts</b> <b>method</b> and 1 sigma range of Northern Hemisphere calibration curves, and after subtraction of 27 years for the interhemispheric offset, the radiocarbon age 665615 BP corresponds to calibrated dates ranging from c. 650 – 560 cal.
