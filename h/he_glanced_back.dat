60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at the village, {{then turned}} right round and {{regarded}} it steadfastly.|$|E
60|$|At this {{question}} the aged colored man blinked {{his eyes and}} shifted uneasily. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back,</b> over his load of wood.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> once {{to see a}} tall, dark-faced {{man wearing}} a frock-coat speak to the others and then wildly fling out his arms.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned again}} to the spoor of the {{stranger}} bull, which showed plainly to his trained senses, nor did <b>he</b> <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> to note if Taug followed. The latter laid Gazan in Mumga's arms with a parting: [...] "If he dies Tarzan will kill you," [...] and he followed after the brown-skinned figure that already was moving at a slow trot along the jungle trail.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> was <b>glancing</b> <b>back</b> {{toward the}} hill, {{the light of}} {{calculations}} in his eyes. Once more he was measuring out those plots of land, calculating rent, deducting interest.|$|R
60|$|He {{would not}} look towards her, but for a time all his senses were alert to hear whether she {{followed}} him. Safe in the summer-house <b>he</b> could <b>glance</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{that will}} satisfy you," [...] snarled Bellingham, with hate and fear {{in his little}} grey eyes as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at his tormenter.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the first}} time he had even peeped into her room in New York. The old shyness was on him, and <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was a {{pleasant}} voice,--Mrs. Peyton's. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at the gateway; it was empty. He looked quickly {{to the right and}} left; no one was there.|$|E
40|$|Sitting at Myatt with JM, {{also present}} JoJ. JM {{is looking at}} a card with {{cartoons}} of a dog chasing a man in forest. On {{one side of the}} card, the leash gets caught and the dog is pulled back. On {{the other side of the}} card, the cartoons starts in the same way, but the man hits a tree as <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> to see where the dog is. JM tells the stories to CS (cartoons for Quis) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{scene and}} album end with [...] "Timelessness". Edgecrusher {{walks away from}} the figure and as <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>back,</b> {{it seems as though}} it he has been weeping. The Securitron forces capture Edgecrusher in the conclusion. This last song has a very melancholic feel to it. The lyrics are desperate; they are Edgecrusher's words (or {{probably}} thoughts) from the jail. We can feel his fear and despair: he lost his battle against machines and failed in saving mankind.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{following}} us all right," [...] he answered. Lingard was so {{certain that the}} prisoners would be delivered {{to him on the}} beach that <b>he</b> never <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> till, after reaching the boat, he and Mrs. Travers turned about.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a camp fire," [...] whispered Robin, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at his companions, [...] "but I see no one there. They {{must have}} {{just left the}} place." ...|$|E
60|$|What had happened? <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back.</b> Irene {{was very}} close to the architect, and her face not like the face he knew of her. He hastened up to his son.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> as {{they went}} along between Lady Petchworth's {{herbaceous}} border and the poppy beds. [...] "She's so full of life," [...] he said, with a sigh in his voice.|$|E
60|$|Henry made no reply, and plodded on alone, {{though often}} <b>he</b> cast anxious <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> into the grey {{solitude}} where his partner had disappeared. An hour later, {{taking advantage of}} the cut-offs around which the sled had to go, Bill arrived.|$|R
60|$|The conservative, looking {{before and}} after, draws from each contemplation the matter for content. Out {{of the age}} of gas lamps <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> slightingly at the mirk and glimmer in which his {{ancestors}} wandered; his heart waxes jocund at the contrast; nor do his lips refrain from a stave, in the highest style of poetry, lauding progress and the golden mean. When gas first spread along a city, mapping it forth about evenfall for the eye of observant birds, a new age had begun for sociality and corporate pleasure-seeking, and begun with proper circumstance, becoming its own birthright. The work of Prometheus had advanced by another stride. Mankind and its supper parties were no longer at the mercy of a few miles of sea-fog; sundown no longer emptied the promenade; and the day was lengthened out to every man's fancy. The city-folk had stars of their own; biddable, domesticated stars.|$|R
60|$|Deliberately {{he turned}} his glasses across the Hollow and studied the {{opposite}} mountain for a greater length of time than he had watched {{the point where he}} had seen the flash. Then he squatted down and leisurely turned his glasses from point to point in the Hollow in the manner of one having no interest in anything but the view. Not once did <b>he</b> <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> along the ridge, although he was burning with curiosity and desire to do so. He ignored it as if it held no further interest for him whatever. For perhaps ten minutes he continued to act the part of a mere sightseer. Then putting his glasses back in his rucksack he stretched lazily and in a leisurely manner began to pick his way down into a little draw which cut back into the ridge in the opposite direction from the pass. Once down in this he would be out of sight of a possible watcher at the spruce lookout.|$|R
6000|$|... "Best not go {{far from}} camp alone, sir. 'T isn't above safe hereabouts," [...] {{he said in a}} low voice. I noticed that <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> over his {{shoulder}} as he spoke.|$|E
60|$|When he {{left the}} cabin and walked away <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at his dummy and a smile lit up his bronzed face. At a {{distance}} it looked exactly like somebody on guard.|$|E
60|$|Wildeve slowly went up {{the steps}} and descended into the {{darkness}} on the other side; and as he walked <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back,</b> till the bank blotted out her form from his further view.|$|E
50|$|Cobb {{manages to}} escape with Jimmy but is soon confronted by an undead Big Ben who wants revenge on him; Ben was taken {{prisoner}} and tortured before dying, and he blames Cobb {{for failing to}} save him. Cobb confronts Ben, no longer afraid of his fears, and destroys him with explosives {{as he and his}} son escape the burning house. In the end, <b>he</b> triumphantly <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> at the house while regaining control of his life and reunites with his wife and child.|$|R
60|$|With {{his hand}} upon the knob a sudden thought stayed the fugitive's flight. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> quickly <b>back</b> at the sleeper--he had not moved. Then {{the man who}} wore the uniform of the king of Lutha recrossed the {{apartment}} to the bed, reached beneath one of the pillows and withdrew two neatly folded official-looking documents. These he placed in the breastpocket of his uniform. A moment later he {{was walking down the}} spiral stairway to the main floor of the castle.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} Dave gained the highway leading to Barnett, Ward Porton {{had reached the}} {{vicinity}} of the first of the houses in the village. Here <b>he</b> paused to <b>glance</b> <b>back,</b> and, seeing his pursuer, shook his fist at Dave. Then he went on about fifty yards farther, suddenly turning into a lane between two of the houses.|$|R
60|$|After {{running a}} few steps, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> over his shoulder, and then ceased running; the {{elephant}} {{was no longer}} in sight above the waggon, but had fallen an inert mass by its side.|$|E
60|$|She {{crossed the}} road and began to descend the path on the other side. Twice <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back,</b> after he had started, and once {{surprised}} her poised lightly among the leaves, looking over her shoulder.|$|E
60|$|They {{drank the}} toast with acclamation, and Courthorne, who strolled away, retired early {{and started for}} the {{railroad}} before daylight next morning. He laughed softly as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> a moment at the lights of the settlement.|$|E
5000|$|As Ned travels, he {{encounters}} other neighbors. He meets 20-year-old Julie (Janet Landgard), {{who used}} to babysit his daughter, and reveals his plan to her; she joins him. Together, they have several experiences, including crashing another pool party and sipping champagne. While chatting in a grove of trees, Julie reveals {{that she had a}} schoolgirl crush on Ned, who then begins talking about how he will protect her, making plans for the two of them. Discomfited by his intimate approaches, Julie runs away. Ned meets a wealthy older couple, unbothered by his eccentric behavior but also unimpressed by his posturing. He then encounters Kevin, a lonely young boy, who he tries to teach how to swim. They use an abandoned, empty pool, which Ned urges the boy to imagine is filled with water. The boy warms to this method, and soon is [...] "swimming" [...] the length of the empty pool. As Ned takes his leave, <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> and sees the boy bouncing on the diving board over the deep end of the empty pool.|$|R
5000|$|... "Through {{my glasses}} I saw the FÃ¼hrer stop, {{glance at the}} Alsace-Lorraine monument.... Then he read the {{inscription}} on the great granite block {{in the center of}} the clearing: Here on the eleventh of November 1918 succumbed the criminal pride of the German empire... vanquished by the free peoples which it tried to enslave." [...] I look for the expression on Hitler's face. I am but fifty yards from him and see him through my glasses as though he were directly in front of me. I have seen that face many times at the great moments of his life. But today! It is afire with scorn, anger, hate, revenge, triumph. He steps off the monument and contrives to make even this gesture a masterpiece of contempt. <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> at it contemptuous, angry[...] [...] [...] Suddenly, as though his face were not giving quite complete expression to his feelings, he throws his whole body into harmony with his mood. He swiftly snaps his hands on his hips, arches his shoulders, plants his feet wide apart. It is a magnificent gesture of defiance, of burning contempt....|$|R
60|$|Prince Shan {{rose to his}} feet. He {{walked to}} the heavy silk {{curtains}} which led into his own bedchamber, pushed them apart, and looked {{for a moment at}} the familiar objects in the room. Then <b>he</b> came <b>back,</b> <b>glancing</b> on his way at the ebony cabinet.|$|R
60|$|Before {{he turned}} the corner <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back,</b> and saw Bosinney {{following}} him slowly--'slinking along the wall' {{as he put it}} to himself, 'like a great cat.' He paid no attention when the young fellow raised his hat.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{and he won}} the hand. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at Nelly with awe, then {{clutched}} his new hand, fearfully, dizzily, staring at it as though it might conceal one of those malevolent deceivers of which Nelly had just warned him--a left bower.|$|E
60|$|She {{was sitting}} in a {{listless}} attitude, with her hands in her lap; she seemed to be tired. She was dressed simply, as if for walking and escaping observation. When he had greeted her <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at her companion, and recognized the faithful Assunta.|$|E
60|$|The {{burden of}} worry and dread {{that had been}} Casey's was now no more--vanished as if by magic. His job {{had not yet been}} completed, but he had won. <b>He</b> never <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> at the Sioux. They had failed in their first effort at ambushing the cut, and Casey knew the troops would prevent a second attempt. Casey faced ahead. The whistle of wind filled his ears, the dry, sweet odor of the desert filled his nostrils. His car was on a {{straight}} track, rolling along down-grade, half a mile a minute. And Casey, believing he might do well to slow up gradually, lightly put on the brake. But it did not hold. He tried again. The brake had broken.|$|R
50|$|Later on, Franck goes {{swimming}} {{far from}} shore. Henri, {{making the most}} of Franck's absence, goes to see Michel and tells him he's convinced that the recent drowning wasn't an accident, that he has realised that Michel was the killer, and that the inspector will identify the murderer sooner or later. He looks at Michel knowingly and mockingly, then stands up and says he's going {{to go for a walk}} in the woods. As he enters the woods, <b>he</b> casts a <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> at Michel.|$|R
60|$|When MacNelly {{saw that}} Duane {{intended}} to greet him, to meet him, he hurried forward. A keen light flashed from his eyes. He was glad, eager, yet suppressing himself, and the <b>glances</b> <b>he</b> sent <b>back</b> {{and forth from}} Duane to Longstreth were questioning, doubtful. Certainly Longstreth did not look the part of an outlaw.|$|R
