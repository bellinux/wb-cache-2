50|$|The Apollo program's goal {{of landing}} {{a man on}} the Moon {{required}} development of the Saturn family of rockets. The large Saturn V rocket necessary to take men to the Moon required a larger launch facility than Cape Canaveral could provide, so NASA built the Kennedy Space Center located west and north of Canaveral on Merrit Island. But the earlier Saturn I and IB could be launched from the Cape's Launch Complexes 34 and 37. The first four Saturn I <b>development</b> <b>launches</b> were made from LC-34 between October 27, 1961 and March 28, 1963. These were followed by the final test launch and five operational launches from LC-37 between January 29, 1964 and July 30, 1965.|$|E
50|$|Development {{began in}} 1973 for an updated Pershing. The Pershing 1a had a 400 kt warhead which was greatly over-powered for the quick {{reaction}} alert (QRA) tactical role the weapon system filled. Reducing warhead yield however required {{a significant increase in}} accuracy to match Pershing 1a's ability to kill hard targets like command bunkers. The contract went to Martin Marietta in 1975 with the first <b>development</b> <b>launches</b> in 1977. Pershing II was to use the new W85 warhead with a five to 50 kt variable yield or an earth-penetrator W86 warhead. The warhead was packaged in a maneuverable reentry vehicle (MARV) with active radar guidance and would use the existing rocket motors. Requests from Israel to buy the new Pershing II were rejected in 1975.|$|E

For some, the deficit of meaningful spaces of citizenship results in frustrated relations with key decision-makers. Others are engaged in their own practices of citizenship, devising creative ways in which to carve out and reconstruct everyday spaces and identities. Contributing to new geographical knowledge(s), this thesis concludes by calling for schools and (rural) communities to support and respect teenagers' own interests, needs, aspirations and current acts of citizenship in their own diverse spaces.

40|$|Tourism <b>development</b> <b>launches</b> {{growth of}} other {{complementary}} industries. River tourism, {{as a special}} selective tourism form, experiences intensive development, with an importance for all the regions through which the Danube, {{as an integral part}} of the Rhine - Main - Danube waterway, flows. During cruising, the largest consumption is achieved on the ship itself, where meat and meat products are an integral element of every meal and represent the most expensive component of the dish. The task of this paper is to analyse the consumption of meat and meat products on six tourist ships run by to 'Grand Circle Corporation' in 2013, in order to point out the possibility of supplying them with meat and meat products from sources in the territory where the ships sail. The paper presents the current suppliers and manufacturers of meat and meat products in Republic of Serbia that could supply the company 'Grand Circle Cruise Line' and other tourist ships that cruise on the Danube. Also, the research indicates that the export of meat products from the Republic Serbia could have a significant effect on improving the agricultural conditions and food production through increased competition, assuming the Serbian manufacturers supply most of tourist ships and not only the six ships analysed in this paper. Research results, specifically, point out the possibility of increasing export of poultry and beef if the potential demand of each of the eight companies with their 54 ships which operate tourist cruises on the Danube is taken into account. The data have been systematized, analysed and presented statistically in tables and graphs...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of Master Degree within the field of Special Education at Malmö University. The purpose of the {{research}} is to elucidate how the supportive material Assessment Tool for Accessible Education of the Swedish National Agency of Special Needs Educations and Schools is being used by educational institutions in Sweden and how it contributes to the change in the learning environment among preschools and schools. The reading provides valuable knowledge for how the agency can develop their support to educational institutions, {{as well as for the}} actors of the field to make the learning environment accessible to the students. The study looks at similarities and differences between the inclusive learning environments based on previous research, and the accessible learning environment based on Assessment Tool for Accessible Education. A lot of similarities can be found in the pedagogic and social aspects, while the differences become prominent in aspects of the physical environment which can only be found in accessible learning environments. Further, pros and cons of supporting individual needs in relation to the learning environment are discussed and what consequences it may give rise to for disabled students. Research questions are as follow; Does the Assessment Tool for Accessible Education contribute to a change in the learning environment? What developing processes contribute to the change? How should institutions be supported in order to develop the accessible learning environment? Mixed methods have been used for collection of data; a poll was answered by 425 people and interviews were held with nine focus groups from four different institutions, including one group of students. The theoretical frame of the analysis follows the organization theory; learning organization and rational-analytic, interactional, and political perspective. The empiric has been worked through thematically and is presented in a chronological order from when people first came in touch with Assessment Tool for Accessible Education, how the work has been implemented and processed at the institutions, and a description of what changes has been processed and its effects upon the learning environment. Obstacles and factors of success experienced by the respondents as well as the need of support for development are also presented. The results of the research show that the assessment tools contribute to a change in how the pedagogues approach the knowledge of how the learning and development of the students is affected by the learning environment when organizational development exists within the institution. <b>Development</b> <b>launches</b> when structural and cultural conditions exist and are processed which in turn leads to development of the learning organization. The research looks at the consequences when these conditions are lacking. Further, when good conditions exist the learning environments develop. The research shows changes that have been processed through the physical, pedagogic, and social environment. Also, all students receive a higher level of accessibility than disabled students. The conclusion is that the Assessment Tool for Accessible Education contributes to a higher level of knowledge regarding the significance of the learning environment which implies changes, provided that organizational development exists within the institution.
