5|$|Victoria's {{youngest}} son, Leopold, {{was affected}} by the blood-clotting disease <b>haemophilia</b> B and two of her five daughters, Alice and Beatrice, were carriers. Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed {{he would have been}} seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 {{at the time of her}} conception and <b>haemophilia</b> arises more frequently in the children of older fathers. Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Alan Rushton {{adds that}} no one in the {{household}} of the newly married Duchess of Kent, including Conroy, is known to have had <b>haemophilia,</b> and that her probable awareness of the scandals surrounding the behaviour of Caroline of Brunswick and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain would have deterred her from seeking an affair elsewhere. Furthermore, Princess Victoria was said to have borne a strong family resemblance to her father and grandfather George III.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} Nicholas's son Alexei in 1904 moved Michael back to second-in-line, but Alexei {{inherited}} the blood-clotting disorder <b>haemophilia</b> {{and was not}} expected to live. Michael caused a commotion at the imperial court when he took Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, a married woman, as a lover. Nicholas sent Michael to Orel to avoid scandal but this did not deter Michael, who travelled frequently to see his mistress. After the couple's only child, George, was born in 1910, Michael brought Natalia to St. Petersburg where she was shunned by society. In 1912, Michael shocked Nicholas by marrying Natalia {{in the hope that}} he would be removed from the line of succession. Michael and Natalia left Russia to live in exile abroad in France, Switzerland and England.|$|E
5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with <b>haemophilia.</b> The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E
5|$|The {{beauty of}} Beatrice's daughter, Ena, was known {{throughout}} Europe, and, despite her low rank, {{she was a}} desirable bride. Her chosen suitor was King Alfonso XIII of Spain. However, the marriage caused controversy in Britain, since it required Ena to convert to Catholicism. This step was opposed by Beatrice's brother, King Edward VII, and Spanish ultra-conservatives were against the King's marriage to a Protestant of low birth, as her father, Prince Henry, {{was the son of}} a morganatic marriage. Thus, they considered Ena to be only partly royal and thus unfit to be Queen of Spain. Nonetheless, the couple wed on 31 May 1906. The marriage began inauspiciously when an anarchist attempted to bomb them on their wedding day. Apparently close at first, the couple grew apart. Ena became unpopular in Spain and grew more so when it was discovered that her son, the heir to the throne, suffered from <b>haemophilia,</b> a disease for which Alfonso held Beatrice responsible for having brought the disease to the Spanish royal house and turned bitterly against Ena.|$|E
25|$|Contaminated <b>haemophilia</b> blood {{products}} were a serious {{public health problem}} in the late 1970s up to 1985.|$|E

25|$|These may be {{particularly}} useful in situations where the wound is not clotting, which can be due to external factors, such as size of wound, or medical factors such as <b>haemophilia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first phase, in 1985–88, {{involved}} {{a small number}} of imported cases in coastal cities — mostly foreigners and overseas Chinese. Four people with <b>haemophilia</b> from Zhejiang province also became infected with HIV after using imported factor VIII.|$|E
25|$|The Talmud {{explicitly}} instructs that a boy {{must not}} be circumcised if he had two brothers who died due to complications arising from their circumcisions, and Maimonides says that this excluded paternal half-brothers; {{this may be due}} to a concern about <b>haemophilia.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Babylonian exile, Sabbath and {{circumcision}} {{became the}} characteristic {{symbols of the}} Jewish people. However, the Talmud orders that a boy must not be circumcised if he had two brothers, from the same mother as him, who have {{died as a result}} of their circumcisions; this may be due to a concern about <b>haemophilia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over 600 {{clinical}} trials utilizing SCGT are underway in the US. Most focus on severe genetic disorders, including immunodeficiencies, <b>haemophilia,</b> thalassaemia, and cystic fibrosis. Such single gene disorders are good candidates for somatic cell therapy. The complete correction of a genetic disorder or {{the replacement of}} multiple genes is not yet possible. Only {{a few of the}} trials are in the advanced stages.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin {{agonists}} {{are used}} therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue desmopressin {{is used in}} conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion, {{as well as for}} control of bleeding (in some forms of von Willebrand disease and in mild <b>haemophilia</b> A) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. Terlipressin and related analogues are used as vasoconstrictors in certain conditions. Use of vasopressin analogues for esophageal varices commenced in 1970.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{frequency}} of {{sickle cell disease}} is found in tropical regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, tribal regions of India and the Middle-East. Migration of substantial populations from these high prevalence areas to low prevalence countries in Europe has dramatically increased in recent decades and in some European countries sickle-cell disease has now overtaken more familiar genetic conditions such as <b>haemophilia</b> and cystic fibrosis. In 2015, it resulted in about 114,800 deaths.|$|E
25|$|Early {{clinical}} failures led to dismissals of gene therapy. Clinical successes since 2006 regained researchers' attention, although as of 2014, it {{was still}} largely an experimental technique. These include treatment of retinal diseases Leber's congenital amaurosis and choroideremia, X-linked SCID, ADA-SCID, adrenoleukodystrophy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma, <b>haemophilia,</b> and Parkinson's disease. Between 2013 and April 2014, US companies invested over $600 million in the field.|$|E
25|$|Pharmaceuticals {{and medical}} {{equipment}} do not fall under international sanctions, but Iran is facing shortages of drugs {{for the treatment}} of 30 illnesses—including cancer, heart and breathing problems, thalassemia and multiple sclerosis (MS)—because it is not allowed to use international payment systems. A teenage boy died from <b>haemophilia</b> because of a shortage of medicine caused by the sanctions. Deliveries of some agricultural products to Iran have also been affected for the same reasons.|$|E
25|$|HIV/AIDS denialism is the belief, {{contradicted by}} {{conclusive}} medical and scientific evidence, that {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) does not cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Some of its proponents reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that HIV exists but {{argue that it is}} a harmless passenger virus and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as they acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of sexual behavior, recreational drugs, malnutrition, poor sanitation, <b>haemophilia,</b> or the effects of the drugs used to treat HIV infection.|$|E
25|$|PGD is {{available}} for {{a large number of}} monogenic disorders—that is, disorders due to a single gene only (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked)—or of chromosomal structural aberrations (such as a balanced translocation). PGD helps these couples identify embryos carrying a genetic disease or a chromosome abnormality, thus avoiding diseased offspring. The most frequently diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, Beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1. The most common dominant diseases are myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease; {{and in the case of}} the X-linked diseases, most of the cycles are performed for fragile X syndrome, <b>haemophilia</b> A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Though it is quite infrequent, some centers report PGD for mitochondrial disorders or two indications simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Alexei's <b>haemophilia</b> was {{integral}} {{to the rise of}} Grigori Rasputin. One of the many things Rasputin did that unintentionally facilitated the fall of the Romanovs was to tell the Tsar that the war would be won once he (Tsar Nicholas II) took command of the Russian Army. Following this advice was a serious mistake as the Tsar had no military experience. The Tsarina, Empress Alexandra, a deeply religious woman, came to rely upon Rasputin and believe in his ability to help Alexei where conventional doctors had failed. This theme is explored in Robert K. Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra. It is possible that if Alexei had not suffered so terribly, Rasputin could never have gained such influence over Russian politics during World War I, which is generally seen to have at least hastened the collapse of Romanov rule.|$|E
25|$|The cell-mediated {{response}} to the virus and to vectors is poorly characterised, and has been largely ignored in the literature as recently as 2005. Clinical trials using an AAV2-based vector to treat <b>haemophilia</b> B {{seem to indicate that}} targeted destruction of transduced cells may be occurring. Combined with data that shows that CD8+ T-cells can recognise elements of the AAV capsid in vitro, it appears {{that there may be a}} cytotoxic T lymphocyte {{response to}} AAV vectors. Cytotoxic responses would imply the involvement of CD4+ T helper cells in the response to AAV and in vitro data from human studies suggests that the virus may indeed induce such responses, including both Th1 and Th2 memory responses. A number of candidate T cell stimulating epitopes have been identified within the AAV capsid protein VP1, which may be attractive targets for modification of the capsid if the virus is to be used as a vector for gene therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{time period}} for X-chromosome {{inactivation}} explains this disparity. Inactivation {{occurs in the}} epiblast during gastrulation, which {{gives rise to the}} embryo. Inactivation occurs on a cellular level, resulting in a mosaic expression, in which patches of cells have an inactive maternal X-chromosome, while other patches have an inactive paternal X-chromosome. For example, a female heterozygous for <b>haemophilia</b> (an X-linked disease) would have about half of her liver cells functioning properly, which is typically enough to ensure normal blood clotting. Chance could result in significantly more dysfunctional cells; however, such statistical extremes are unlikely. Genetic differences on the chromosome may also render one X-chromosome more likely to undergo inactivation. Also, if one X-chromosome has a mutation hindering its growth or rendering it non viable, cells which randomly inactivated that X will have a selective advantage over cells which randomly inactivated the normal allele. Thus, although inactivation is initially random, cells that inactivate a normal allele (leaving the mutated allele active) will eventually be overgrown and replaced by functionally normal cells in which nearly all have the same X-chromosome activated.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain made an {{official}} state {{visit to the}} United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenie's uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner in Buckingham Palace, in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, King Edward's sister. He noticed Victoria Eugenie and asked who the dinner guest with almost white hair was. Everybody knew that King Alfonso {{was looking for a}} suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, daughter of King Edward's brother, the Duke of Connaught. As Princess Patricia seemed not to be impressed by the Spanish monarch, Alfonso indulged his interest in Victoria Eugenie, and so the courtship began. When Alfonso returned to Spain he frequently sent postcards to Victoria Eugenie and spoke of her approvingly. His widowed mother, Queen Maria Cristina, did not like her son's choice, in part because she considered the Battenbergs non-royal because of the obscure origin of Prince Henry's mother, and in part because she wanted her son to marry within her own family, the Habsburgs from Austria. Another obstacle to a marriage was Victoria Eugenie's Protestantism (Alfonso was Roman Catholic; she was Anglican). Another potential problem was <b>haemophilia,</b> the disease that Victoria had transmitted to some of her descendants. Eugenie's brother Leopold was a haemophiliac, so there was a 50% probability that Victoria Eugenie would be a carrier, although the degree of risk was not yet known. Still, if Alfonso married her, their issue could be affected by the disease. Nonetheless, Alfonso was not dissuaded.|$|E
500|$|<b>Haemophilia</b> B {{has been}} known to arise spontaneously in the {{children}} of older fathers, and the Duke of Kent was fifty-one when Victoria was born. Nicholas Wright Gillham proposes that the <b>haemophilia</b> mutation could have first occurred with either Victoria or the Duke of Kent. Gillian Gill and her son Christopher, an infectious disease specialist, also view a genetic mutation as the most likely possibility; Gillian Gill writes that [...] "a few historians in recent years have found it seductive" [...] to doubt Victoria's stated paternity because a random mutation is [...] "an unexciting solution". Helen Rappaport concurs, remarking that [...] "the best and most logical" [...] explanation is that <b>haemophilia</b> first appeared in Victoria as a mutation.|$|E

500|$|During Victoria's {{lifetime}} and {{after her death}} in 1901, there have been rumours that Conroy or someone else, and not the Duke of Kent, was her biological father. Historians have continued to debate the accuracy and validity of these claims. In his 2003 work The Victorians, biographer A. N. Wilson suggests that Victoria was not actually descended from George III because several of her descendants had <b>haemophilia,</b> which was unknown among her recognised ancestors. <b>Haemophilia</b> is a genetic disease that [...] impairs the body's ability to control blood clotting, {{which is used to}} stop bleeding when a blood vessel is broken; it is carried in the female line but the symptoms manifest mostly in males. Wilson proposes that the Duchess of Kent took a lover (not necessarily Conroy) to ensure that a Coburg would sit on the British throne.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of , Emperor Nicholas II, under pressure from generals and Duma representatives, abdicated in favour of his son, Alexei, with Michael as Regent. Later that evening, though, he reconsidered his decision. Alexei was gravely ill with <b>haemophilia</b> and Nicholas feared that if Alexei was Emperor, he would be separated from his parents. In a second abdication document, signed at 11.40 p.m. but marked as having been issued at 3.00 p.m., {{the time of the}} earlier one, Nicholas II declared: ...|$|E
500|$|Tatiana's English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, {{recalled}} that Tatiana had grown razor thin in captivity and seemed [...] "haughtier" [...] and more inscrutable {{to him than}} ever. In April 1918 the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra and Maria to Yekaterinburg. The remaining children remained behind in Tobolsk because Alexei, who had suffered another attack of <b>haemophilia,</b> could not be moved. It was Tatiana who persuaded her mother to [...] "stop tormenting herself" [...] and {{make a decision to}} go with her father and leave Alexei behind. Alexandra decided that level-headed Tatiana must be left behind to manage the household and look after Alexei.|$|E
500|$|When she was 17, Heyer began {{a serial}} story to amuse her brother Boris, who {{suffered}} from a form of <b>haemophilia</b> and was often weak. Her father enjoyed listening to her story {{and asked her to}} prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and The Black Moth, about the adventures of a young man who took responsibility for his brother's card-cheating, was released in 1921. According to her biographer Jane Aiken Hodge, the novel contained many of the elements that would become standard for Heyer's novels, the [...] "saturnine male lead, the marriage in danger, the extravagant wife, and the group of idle, entertaining young men". The following year one of her contemporary short stories, [...] "A Proposal to Cicely", was published in Happy Magazine.|$|E
500|$|Nicholas was {{particularly}} upset because his heir, Alexei, was gravely ill with <b>haemophilia,</b> which Michael cited {{as one of}} his reasons for marrying Natalia. Michael feared that he would become heir presumptive again on Alexei's death and {{would never be able to}} marry Natalia. By marrying her beforehand, he would be removed from the line of succession early and preclude losing Natalia. In a series of decrees over December 1912 and January 1913, Nicholas relieved Michael of his command, banished him from Russia, froze all his assets in Russia, seized control of his estates and removed him from the Regency. Society in Russia was shocked at the severity of Nicholas's reprisal, but there was little sympathy for Natalia. She was not entitled to be known as Grand Duchess; she instead used the style [...] "Madame or Countess Brasova".|$|E
500|$|Alice's {{descendants}} {{went on to}} play significant {{roles in}} world history. Her fourth daughter, Alix, married Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, passing her mother's gene for <b>haemophilia</b> on to her only son, the Tsarevich Alexei. Alix, her husband, and her children {{were killed by the}} Bolsheviks in the city of Ekaterinburg in the summer of 1918, sixteen months after the February Revolution forced Nicholas to abdicate. Alice's second daughter, Elizabeth, who had married Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, and had become a nun after his assassination in 1905, met a similar fate, being killed by the Bolsheviks the day after the former tsar and tsaritsa. Louis Mountbatten, son of Alice's eldest daughter, Victoria, was the last Viceroy of India. He was assassinated by the IRA in 1979. [...] Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, her great-grandson through Victoria's daughter Princess Alice of Battenberg, married Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Tragedy befell Alice on 29 May 1873, {{when her}} {{youngest}} and favourite son, Friedrich, called [...] "Frittie", died after falling 20feet from a window. The child suffered from <b>haemophilia,</b> {{and although he}} regained consciousness, the internal bleeding could not be stopped. Alice never recovered from Frittie's death, writing to her mother two months later: [...] "I am glad {{you have a little}} coloured picture of my darling. I feel lower and sadder than ever and miss him so much, so continually." [...] However, the Queen's attention was more focused on the engagement of her son Prince Alfred to the Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia, the only surviving daughter of Tsar Alexander II and his first wife, Empress Marie Alexandrovna. The Tsar had refused to present his daughter for pre-marriage inspection in England, and instead invited the Queen to meet the family in Germany. Alice supported this suggestion, and on the same day she wrote to the Queen about how much she missed Frittie, the Queen wrote to Alice in scathing terms: [...] "You have entirely taken the Russian side, and I do not think, dear child, that you should tell me...what I ought to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In practice, {{this would}} have {{required}} the Duchess's lover to be haemophiliac– an extremely unlikely survival, given the poor state {{of medicine at the}} time, or the Duchess herself to be a carrier of <b>haemophilia,</b> since <b>haemophilia</b> is X-linked, meaning that her mother would have been a carrier, if <b>haemophilia</b> was not otherwise previously expressed in the Duchess's parents. Actual evidence to support this theory has not arisen, and <b>haemophilia</b> occurs spontaneously through mutation in at least 30% of cases. [...] Queen Victoria has also been said by some to have a strong resemblance to her Hanoverian relatives, particularly George IV.|$|E
