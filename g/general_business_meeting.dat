The four national officers always represent the significant ethnic groups within the church. Each local assembly is entitled to send a pastor and a delegate as voting members. Additional voting members are members of the National Leadership Forum, members of standing committees, one additional member representing each church department and one additional representative of the church's theological training institutions. Before 2000, the <b>General</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Meeting</b> was known as the Workers Council, met annually, and possessed greater power.

The research explores the use of <b>business</b> <b>meeting</b> simulations in a higher education setting {{in order to bring}} into focus how patterns of linguistic interactions among BE students are structured, with and without a BE teacher’s corrective feedback. The findings provide possible solutions for the effective integration of <b>business</b> <b>meeting</b> simulations into BE programmes to improve students’ performance in international <b>business</b> <b>meetings</b> in which English is the lingua franca by using <b>business</b> <b>meeting</b> simulations as a BE teaching tool. Corpus analysis and qualitative analysis of linguistic, sociolinguistic and pragmatic elements of foreign language communicative competence (FLCC) were used to explore the development of FLCC elements of BE students in the spoken corpus of English <b>business</b> <b>meeting</b> simulations. The main finding of the study is that whilst repeated <b>business</b> <b>meeting</b> simulation practice may provide BE students with a certain concrete experience of this communicative context even without a teacher’s corrective feedback, practice without corrective feedback does not facilitate the correct and comprehensive development of FLCC...|$|R
