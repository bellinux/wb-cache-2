5000|$|Margaret Woods {{wrote on}} the novel: [...] "Well, 'Ugly Little Boy' draws you right in and does not let go. An enthralling plot, {{credible}} characters which make you feel great empathy - all of which serves to hide a very fundamental flaw: the basic premise of the plot just does not make any sense. What the hell {{is the use of}} {{spending a lot of money}} and effort in order to bring a Neanderthal child into the here-and-now - and then proceeding to give him an English name, teach him English, and place him in a modern environment with modern toys to play with? How <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> help you learn about the Neanderthals? (...) Not only is it cruel to the child - because he will never get out of his cage, never see America, and will eventually have to go back to his own time and survive there. It also makes no scientific sense. The obvious course would be to send in a team of the world's most skilled linguists, charged with learning the child's language and absolutely forbidden to utter a singe word of English in his presence. To place him in the closest approximation which could be made to a Neanderthal dwelling and fill it with Neanderthal artifacts, so that the child could teach researchers their names in his language. There is no reason whatsoever to teach the child anything at all about the world of the 21st Century, and several good reasons not to. It is the child who should teach the researchers all that a child could teach of Neanderthal life and society - and when they learned all they could, they should send him back. (...) It is not implausible, also in that scenario, for a lonely woman researcher to start feeling strongly maternal - even to the point of deciding to follow the child back to Prehistoric times. And if she goes there after having learned to speak at least the rudiments of the Neanderthal language, she would be a bit better equipped to survive...".|$|E

Sitting {{at the intersection of}} art and craft, contemporary jewellery blurs the relationship between form and function. Emerging out of the aesthetic radicalism of the 1960 s and evolving ever since, contemporary jewellery breaks the culturally-informed role as bodily adornment and exists as conceptual artwork that constantly challenges traditional thinking. Not surprisingly, contemporary jewellery has also challenged traditional exhibition strategies. The standard museum practices of display are called into question. In this exhibition I examine the relationship between the human body and contemporary jewellery via the works of six artists. I also explore ways to interact with visitors to experience the works visually and tactilely. As contemporary jewellery is a relatively new art form, my thesis exhibition contributes to scholarships in the realm, as well as the curatorial practice for other art-based objects...|$|E

40|$|The old {{scholastic}} {{principle of}} the "convertibility" of being and goodness strikes nearly all moderns as either barely comprehensible or plain false. "Convertible" is a term of art meaning "interchangeable" in respect of predication, where the predicates can be exchanged salva veritate albeit not salva sensu: their referents are, as the maxim goes, really the same albeit conceptually different. The principle seems, at first blush, absurd. Did the scholastics literally mean that every being is good? <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> include a cancer, a malaria parasite, an earthquake that kills millions? If every being is good, then no being is bad—but how can that be? To the contemporary philosophical mind, such bafflement is understandable. It derives from the systematic dismantling of the great scholastic edifice that took place over half a millennium. With {{the loss of the}} basic concepts out of which that edifice was built, the space created by those concepts faded out of existence as well. The convertibility principle, like virtually all the other scholastic principles (not all, since some do survive and thrive in analytic philosophy), could not persist in a post-scholastic space wholly alien to it...|$|E
