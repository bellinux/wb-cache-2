5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar.

5|$|Because the {{faithful}} {{are obliged to}} attend Mass {{unless there is a}} grave impediment, pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept.... Yet more than a precept, the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life.

5|$|In England, Anne largely {{turned from}} {{political}} {{to social and}} artistic activities. Though she participated <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> life of James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors {{the prestige of the}} Stuart dynasty and its Danish connections.|$|E

5|$|Over the bridges, the new key is set <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor mode, {{avoiding}} the Dorian inflections present in previous Harrison songs. These sections begin on an E minor chord, which, in Roman numeral analysis, represents a v minor in the tonic of A and an iv minor {{in the new}} key. At {{the end of each}} bridge, the return to the home key is effected via an E major chord, marking the only use of the expected G note in the A major scale.|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{negative}} real number b to a rational power u/v, where u/v is in lowest terms, yields a positive real result if u is even, and hence v is odd, because then b'u is positive; and yields {{a negative}} real result, if u and v are both odd, because then b'u is negative. The case of odd u and even v cannot be treated this way within the reals, {{since there is}} no real number x such that , the value of b'u/v in this case must use the imaginary unit i, as described more <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> section § Powers of complex numbers.|$|E

5|$|Didsbury has a non-selective {{education}} system, {{assessed by}} the SATs exam. There are seven primary schools and two state comprehensive secondary schools. The Barlow RC High School {{is one of those}} chosen by Manchester Council to benefit from funding made available in wave 4 of the government's Building Schools for the Future programme, a national scheme for the refurbishment and remodelling of every secondary school in England. It is planned to replace all the current buildings, which date back to 1951.

5|$|Now <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town of Lockport, NY31 and NY93 proceed {{northeast}} {{through an}} open area of the town as a four-lane divided highway. The two routes continue to {{the western edge of}} the city of Lockport, where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and the Lockport Bypass. The overlap ends here as NY93 turns southeastward onto the two-lane bypass. Along the bypass, NY93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with Hinman Road (CR903) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal. Past the waterway, the bypass takes a more southerly course through an undeveloped part of the town of Lockport to a junction with Robinson Road (CR123) on the Lockport–Pendleton town line. The Lockport Bypass ends here, leaving NY93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road.|$|E
5|$|The Gothic style {{developed}} <b>fully</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later nineteenth century. Important figures included Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832–98), who {{adapted the}} Gothic style {{for the needs}} of the Free Church of Scotland, as at Barclay Viewforth Church, Edinburgh (1862–64). Robert Rowand Anderson (1834–1921), trained in the office of leading Gothic Architect George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh, where he worked on many small churches, including St James the Less in Leith, Christ Church, Falkirk (1862) and the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh (1876). He also supervised the renovation of Dunblane (1890–93) and Paisley Abbey (1898–1907). Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75), working mainly in Glasgow, began in the Gothic style, but soon turned toward the ancient Greeks and Egyptians for inspiration, {{as can be seen in}} the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856). Scotland's most influential architect of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Charles Rennie MacKintosh, designed a number of churches, but only one, Queen's Cross Free Church, Glasgow (1898–99) was built. It avoided the characteristic steeple of Glasgow churches in favour of a wide tower, and has a simple, elegant, rectangular structure with a single aisle.|$|E
