25|$|After a punt {{from both}} teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring drive. Newton {{completed}} {{all four of}} his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter. Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, {{but none of them}} attempted to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Panthers 14-yard line. Despite Denver's excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.|$|E
25|$|The next year, in 1993, Haile won {{the first}} of what would {{eventually}} be four consecutive world championships titles in the men's 10,000 metres at the 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999 World Championships. His win at the 1993 was however his most infamous as he accidentally stepped on the heel of Moses Tanui's shoe at the bell, causing it to fly off his foot. After the contact, with just one shoe, an angered Tanui moved out to a 10-meter lead, only to have Haile run <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final straight. Also at the 1993 World Championships he ran in the 5,000-metre race to finish a close second behind Ismael Kirui of Kenya. In 1994 he won a bronze medal at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Later that year he set his first world record by running a 12:56.96 in the 5,000-metres, breaking Saïd Aouita's record by two seconds.|$|E
25|$|At {{the summit}} of their social success, Rawdon is arrested for debt, {{possibly}} at Becky's connivance. The financial success of the Crawleys had been a topic of gossip; in fact they were living on credit even when it ruined those who trusted them, such as their landlord, an old servant of the Crawley family. The Marquis of Steyne had given Becky money, jewels, and other gifts but Becky does not use them for expenses or to free her husband. Instead, Rawdon's letter to his brother is received by Lady Jane, who pays the £170 that prompted his imprisonment. He returns home to find Becky singing to Steyne and strikes <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> assumption—despite her protestations of innocence—that they are having an affair. Steyne is indignant, having assumed the £1000 he had just given Becky {{was part of an}} arrangement with her husband. Rawdon finds Becky's hidden bank records and leaves her, expecting Steyne to challenge him to a duel. Instead Steyne arranges for Rawdon to be made Governor of Coventry Island, a pest-ridden location. Becky, having lost both husband and credibility, leaves England and wanders the continent, leaving her son in the care of Pitt and Lady Jane.|$|E

500|$|Tarbuck {{attended}} the Naval Postgraduate School at Annapolis from 1927 to 1928, {{and then the}} Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island. While there he wrote a thesis entitled [...] "The Nicaraguan Policy of the United States", which was subsequently published by the United States Naval Institute. He returned to sea in 1929 as {{executive officer of the}} destroyer , which sailed to China, Japan and the Philippines as part of the Asiatic Fleet. His daughter Joan died in Shanghai. On returning to the United States in 1932, he was assigned to the University of California as a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps instructor. He taught astronomy there as an assistant professor. Robert Gordon Sproul requested that Tarbuck be permanently assigned to the university, but the Navy turned <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that Tarbuck's career would suffer without sea duty. Tarbuck's next assignment was to a battleship, the , where he was promoted to lieutenant commander. Following the pattern of alternating duty at sea with duty ashore, he was assigned to the Fleet Training Division of the Bureau of Navigation from June 1937 to May 1939.|$|E
2500|$|After {{falling to}} three time French Open {{champion}} Gustavo Kuerten in 2004, Federer's frustration in Paris was due solely to his arch-rival Rafael Nadal. They first {{played in the}} 2005 semifinals and then again in the finals in 2006, 2007, and 2008. During this four year period Federer complied 23–0 record against all other players at Roland Garros and an 0–4 record against Nadal; whose high bouncing lefty forehand to Federer's one handed backhand ground <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dirt year after year.|$|E
2500|$|During World War I Count von Salm {{served as}} a dragoon officer in the Austrian Army and as a {{military}} aide to the Governor of Vienna. After the war he settled in Vienna, where he lost much of his fortune and properties over card games held at the Jockey Club. He married his first wife, Anne-Marie von Kramsta, on 30 June 1909. [...] His second marriage, on 8 January 1924, was to American heiress Millicent Rogers and produced one child, but the couple had divorced before he was born. Apart from playing tennis he occasionally acted in movies thanks to his friend Count Alexander Kolowrat, who was a film producer and owner of Sascha-Film. His director Mihály Kertész encouraged Alexander to offer Ludwig movie roles and hire him. He was cast in three feature films alongside Lucy Doraine, including the 1922 pieces Masters of the Sea and A Vanished World. In 1929 he published a book dedicated to his son, Peter, entitled Mein lieber Peter ... beichte eines vaters. While living in Austria he gave private tennis etiquette and fair-play lessons to Viennese children. After his financial breakdown Salm moved to Budapest and started a wine business. He rented and lived in a second-story room in the Hotel Dunapalota-Ritz. On 23 July 1944 he jumped off the hotel balcony onto the Danube Promenade and died immediately. According to the Winona Daily News he did so because the Nazis had {{arrived on the scene}} to arrest him for his Jewish ancestry. According to his friend Sidney Wood, the root cause behind his suicide was that the Nazi regime pressured him to engage in espionage, which he refused to do and thus the SS wanted to hunt <b>him</b> <b>down.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary, according to the Jewish Criterion he was a Nazi collaborationist and avid anti-Semite and chose to end his life in fear of post-war reprisals. He was buried on 28 July; his funeral was a big social affair.|$|E
