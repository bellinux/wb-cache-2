5|$|Decades {{of efforts}} to {{eradicate}} or simply thin the rat population in the system have been unsuccessful. In March 2009, the Transit Authority announced a series of changes to its vermin control strategy, including new poison formulas and experimental trap designs. In October 2011, the MTA announced a new initiative to clean 25 subway stations, along with their garbage rooms, of rat infestations. Also in October 2011, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in the subways by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations. As of March 2016, stations along the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and various other stations had their garbage cans removed due {{to the success of}} the program.|$|E

25|$|During the Cold War, when Howard Stark {{demands the}} Pym Particle Suit, created to shrink its wearer, from S.H.I.E.L.D. {{scientist}} Hank Pym {{to take down}} radicals in Soviet-occupied Germany who are reverse-engineering Hydra technology, Pym insists on carrying out the mission himself to keep his invention out of the wrong hands. Crossing the Berlin Wall and infiltrating the enemy compound, Pym discovers the plans for Hydra memory suppression technology, and {{makes his way to}} a secret lab where the reverse-engineered machine <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>tested.</b> Taking out the radicals using the suit's size-changing properties, Pym destroys the technology so that no one can use it. Pym then decides to continue taking missions for S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
25|$|The BMW i3 has two pedals {{like all}} cars with {{automatic}} transmission. The accelerator pedal acts as both accelerator and engine brake. When the driver releases the pedal, the vehicle's kinetic energy is regenerated by the vehicle drivetrain to recharge the battery. This {{has the effect}} of slowing the car down. During the field testing of the Mini E, which features an accelerator that recharges the battery in this way, and consists of brakes that only apply to the rear wheels, BMW has learned that drivers tend to rely on the engine brake: around 75% of all deceleration maneuvers are initiated without the brake pedal in urban traffic areas. BMW also expected the i3 to use the same type of battery and powertrain that <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> in the BMW ActiveE trials.|$|E
25|$|A single Jianghu I (hull 516) was {{modified}} very recently. It has its anti-ship missiles replaced with several multiple-rocket launchers. The rockets are of 122mm caliber, and {{are based on}} the Type 89 system, which is itself quite similar to the Soviet BM-21 rocket system. The 122mm rockets are launched from a stabilized launcher, meaning that even if the ship is affected by wave motion, the launcher itself will be stabilized. The rockets have a range of up to 40km, and can achieve reasonable accuracy in fire. This installation may be seen as an experiment by the PLAN to make use of older warship designs, by turning them into shore bombardment platforms. Though only one ship <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> for now, this is a very possible concept for future PLAN conversions of their large number of old Luda's and Jianghu's. Fire support from ships is seen as very important by the PLAN when conducting amphibious operations.|$|E

25|$|Marine energy (also {{sometimes}} referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both wave powerpower from surface waves, and tidal powerobtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> at a small scale (50 kW). Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water. The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{campaign}} as low-key as possible, General Abrams had suggested that the commencement of the incursion be routinely announced from Saigon. At 21:00 on 30 April, however, President Nixon appeared on all three U.S. television networks to announce that [...] "It is not our power but our will and character that <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> tonight" [...] and that [...] "the time has come for action." [...] He announced his decision to launch American forces into Cambodia with the special objective of capturing COSVN,"the headquarters of the entire communist military operation in South Vietnam." [...] COSVN as a single headquarters for control of PAVN operations in South Vietnam probably did not exist, or, at least, was never found.|$|E

They present the award for the oldest man in Springfield to Cornelius Chapman, who is 108 years old. Chapman comes up to accept his award, but when Spears gives him a congratulatory kiss on the cheek, he dies of a heart attack. The award is therefore given to the now oldest Springfieldian in the crowd, Mr. Burns. After Burns wins, he realizes {{he is not a}} young man anymore, so he and his assistant Smithers go to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for a check-up. Burns decides to give the Simpson family an opportunity to house sit his private mansion while he <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>tested</b> for various diseases.|$|E
