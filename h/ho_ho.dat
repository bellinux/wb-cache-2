Ken Veeder of The Advocate praised RuPaul's interpretations of the Christmas classic in [...] "the gay way", positively responding to the changes made to the songs' titles; Veeder highlighted [...] "I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus" [...] as his favorite track from the album.

500|$|<b>Ho</b> <b>Ho</b> <b>Ho</b> was {{recorded}} in RuPauls' living room in New York City; it was completed over the span of three days in June 1997. RuPaul attributed the album’s success to his chemistry with Michelle Visage, saying, [...] "You can hear us having a good time.

[...] RuPaul and Visage interpreted Christmas songs as examples of camp while still holding a clear message; RuPaul explained, [...] "Even the camp stuff still holds the true meaning of Christmas, the sweetness and the love about another year gone by." [...] Rhino executive promoted the album through the following line: [...] "Celebrate Christmas with classic holiday songs and camp, RuPaul style!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1927, O'Neill {{returned}} to the United States, and by 1937 was living at Bonniebrook permanently. By the 1940s, she had lost the majority of her money and properties, partly through extravagant spending, {{as well as the}} cost of fully supporting her family, her entourage of [...] "artistic" [...] hangers-on, and her first husband. The Great Depression also hurt O'Neill's fortune. During that period, O'Neill was dismayed to find that her work was no longer in demand. After thirty years of popularity, the Kewpie character phenomenon had faded, and photography was replacing illustration as a commercial vehicle. O'Neill experimented with crafting a new doll, eventually creating Little <b>Ho</b> <b>Ho,</b> which was a laughing baby Buddha. However, before plans could be finalized for production of the new little figure, the factory burned to the ground.|$|E

2500|$|Drawing: Warhol {{started his}} career as a {{commercial}} illustrator, producing drawings in [...] "blotted-ink" [...] style for advertisements and magazine articles. Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as Yum, Yum, Yum (about food), <b>Ho,</b> <b>Ho,</b> <b>Ho</b> (about Christmas) and (of course) Shoes, Shoes, Shoes. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably A Gold Book, compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. A Gold Book is so named because of the gold leaf that decorates its pages. In April 2012 a sketch of 1930s singer Rudy Vallee claimed to have been drawn by Andy Warhol was found at a Las Vegas garage sale. The image was said to have been drawn when Andy was nine or 10. Various authorities have challenged the image's authenticity.|$|E

Apart from dealing strictly with Christian themes, the band incorporated songs addressing social issues, such as racism in the song [...] "Walls" [...] and abortion in [...] "Children Can Live Without It". The hip hop/pop styling of the album earned the band attention, expanding the group's audience, and by 1991, Nu Thang had sold 200,000 copies. The band became an opening act for Michael W. Smith and received a Dove Award. The release of their Rap, Rock, n' Soul [...] video garnered a wider audience for the group, being certified gold for long form video.|$|E
