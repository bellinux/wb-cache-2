40|$|International audienceMaurocalcine is {{the first}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>example</b> of an animal toxin peptide with {{efficient}} cell penetration properties. Although it is a highly competitive cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), its relatively large size of 33 amino acids {{and the presence of}} three internal disulfide bridges may hamper its development for in vitro and in vivo applications. Here, we demonstrate that several efficient CPPs can be derived from maurocalcine by replacing Cys residues by isosteric 2 -aminobutyric acid residues and sequence truncation down to peptides of up to 9 residues in length. A surprising finding is that all of the truncated maurocalcine analogues possessed cell penetration properties, indicating that the maurocalcine is a highly specialized CPP. Careful examination of the cell penetration properties of the truncated analogues indicates that several maurocalcine-derived peptides should be of great interest for cell delivery applications where peptide size matters...|$|E

In this paper, we first build the COOIS network and experimental platform to aggregate the comprehensive ocean observation information.

Data assimilation is widely applied for those different type data, but we firstly propose to solve this problem with fuzzy set. Theoretically, this will efficiently reduce the complexity and enhance the accuracy and utility of COOIS.

40|$|International audienceMaurocalcine (MCa) is a 33 -amino-acid residue peptide toxin {{isolated}} from the scorpion Scorpio maurus palmatus. External application of MCa to cultured myotubes is known to produce Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores. MCa binds directly to the skeletal muscle isoform of the ryanodine receptor, an intracellular channel target of the endoplasmic reticulum, and induces long lasting channel openings in a mode of smaller conductance. Here we investigated the way MCa proceeds to cross biological membranes to reach its target. A biotinylated derivative of MCa was produced (MCa(b)) and complexed with a fluorescent indicator (streptavidine-cyanine 3) to follow the cell penetration of the toxin. The toxin complex efficiently penetrated into various cell types without requiring metabolic energy (low temperature) or implicating an endocytosis mechanism. MCa appeared to share the same features as the so-called cell-penetrating peptides. Our results provide evidence that MCa {{has the ability to}} act as a molecular carrier and to cross cell membranes in a rapid manner (1 - 2 min), making this toxin the first <b>demonstrated</b> <b>example</b> of a scorpion toxin that translocates into cells...|$|E
40|$|The Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) is a finite-volume based {{general-purpose}} computer program for analyzing steady state and time-dependant flow rates, pressures, temperatures, and concentrations {{in a complex}} flow network. The program is capable of modeling real fluids with phase changes, compressibility, mixture thermodynamics, conjugate heat transfer between solid and fluid, fluid transients, pumps, compressors and external body forces such as gravity and centrifugal. The thermo-fluid system to be analyzed is discretized into nodes, branches, and conductors. The scalar properties such as pressure, temperature, and concentrations are calculated at nodes. Mass flow rates and heat transfer rates are computed in branches and conductors. The graphical user interface allows users to build their models using the 'point, drag, and click' method; the users can also run their models and post-process the results in the same environment. The integrated fluid library supplies thermodynamic and thermo-physical properties of 36 fluids, and 24 different resistance/source options are provided for modeling momentum sources or sinks in the branches.

30|$|The two {{algorithms}} {{are different}} by definition, and offer different information as the comparison shows. It {{is difficult to}} verify the results against ground truth, but we argue that our method has two important advantages. First, there is no arbitrary control {{of the number of}} central nodes. To study the interaction of technologies in cohesive families, to have a set of central nodes rather than a given number of top centrality nodes is intuitively closer to the real-world situation. Second, our method identifies the set of central nodes based on tracked communities over a time window, while the betweenness centrality calculated is for a single time period (3 years in the <b>demonstrated</b> <b>example)</b> - additional efforts are needed to track communities over time in order to calculate the centrality values for continuous time periods. It would only be more inaccurate to simply aggregate data in a time window of 10 years and calculate the centrality. These issues stand true for all other centrality measure. Figure  7 also shows the central nodes identified using our proposed method are more consistent and concentrated, while the top betweenness centrality nodes are more spread out over the whole IPC scheme.|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} the Alzheimer's β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is internalized from the axonal cell surface. In this study, we use biochemical and cell biological methods to characterize endocytotic compartments that participate in trafficking of APP in central neurons. APP is present in presynaptic clathrin-coated vesicles purified from bovine brain, together with the recycling synaptic vesicle integral membrane proteins synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, and SV 2. In contrast, APP is largely excluded from synaptic vesicles purified from rat brain. In primary cerebellar macroneurons, cell-surface APP is internalized with recycling synaptic vesicle integral membrane proteins but is subsequently sorted away from synaptic vesicles and transported retrogradely to the neuronal soma. Internalized APP partially co-localizes with rab 5 a-containing compartments in axons and with V-ATPase-containing compartments in both axons and neuronal soma. These results provide direct biochemical evidence that an obligate sorting compartment participates in the regeneration of synaptic vesicles during exo/endocytotic recycling at nerve terminals but do not preclude concurrent 'kiss-and-run' recycling. Moreover, APP is now, to our knowledge, the first <b>demonstrated</b> <b>example</b> of an axonal cell-surface protein that is internalized with recycling synaptic vesicle membrane proteins but is subsequently sorted away from synaptic vesicles. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
