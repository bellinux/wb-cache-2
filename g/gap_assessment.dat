STD prevention programs and certain other health care facilities offer an arrayof preventive services and often link persons they encounter with services provided by other agencies (e. g., homeless shelters or substance abuse treatment centers).

It typically entails the use of fertilizers, new cultivars, irrigation, and other modern technology. In {{regions of the world}} affected by seasonal or chronic water scarcity, yield gap closure is strongly dependent on irrigation (blue water). Global yield <b>gap</b> <b>assessments</b> have often ignored whether the water required to close the yield gap is locally available. Here we perform a gridded global analysis (10  km resolution) of the blue water consumption that is needed annually to close the yield gap worldwide and evaluate the associated pressure on renewable freshwater resources. We find that, to close the yield gap, human appropriation of freshwater resources for irrigation would have to increase at least by 146 %. Most study countries would experience at least a doubling in blue water requirement, with 71 % of the additional blue water being required by only four crops – maize, rice, soybeans, and wheat. Further, in some countries (e. g., Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen) the total volume of blue water required for yield gap closure would exceed sustainable levels of freshwater consumption (i. e., 40 % of total renewable surface and groundwater resources) ...|$|R

40|$|Yields {{of crops}} must {{increase}} substantially {{over the coming}} decades {{to keep pace with}} global food demand driven by population and income growth. Ultimately global food production capacity will be limited by the amount of land and water resources available and suitable for crop production, and by biophysical limits on crop growth. Quantifying food production capacity on every hectare of current farmland in a consistent and transparent manner is needed to inform decisions on policy, research, development and investment that aim to affect future crop yield and land use, and to inform on-ground action by local farmers through their knowledge networks. Crop production capacity can be evaluated by estimating potential yield and water-limited yield levels as benchmarks for crop production under, respectively, irrigated and rainfed conditions. The differences between these theoretical yield levels and actual farmers' yields define the yield gaps, and precise spatially explicit knowledge about these yield gaps is essential to guide sustainable intensification of agriculture. This paper reviews methods to estimate yield gaps, with a focus on the local-to-global relevance of outcomes. Empirical methods estimate yield potential from 90 to 95 th percentiles of farmers' yields, maximum yields from experiment stations, growers' yield contests or boundary functions; these are compared with crop simulation of potential or water-limited yields. Comparisons utilize detailed data sets from western Kenya, Nebraska (USA) and Victoria (Australia). We then review global studies, often performed by non-agricultural scientists, aimed at yield and sometimes yield <b>gap</b> <b>assessment</b> and compare several studies in terms of outcomes for regions in Nebraska, Kenya and The Netherlands. Based on our review we recommend key components for a yield <b>gap</b> <b>assessment</b> that can be applied at local to global scales. Given lack of data for some regions, the protocol recommends use of a tiered approach with preferred use of crop growth simulation models applied to relatively homogenous climate zones for which measured weather data are available. Within such zones simulations are performed for the dominant soils and cropping systems considering current spatial distribution of crops. Need for accurate agronomic and current yield data together with calibrated and validated crop models and upscaling methods is emphasized. The bottom-up application of this global protocol allows verification of estimated yield gaps with on-farm data and experiments. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|For {{developing}} country agriculture {{to contribute to}} climate change mitigation, a credible pathway for achieving both development and environmental goals is needed. To deliver these dual objectives, strategies based on improving farm productivity and closing yield gaps are receiving increasing attention. In this study we estimate yield gaps for smallholder farmers in six Sub-Saharan African sites covering five countries (Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Senegal and Burkina Faso), and we assess the potential to increase food supply and reduce emission intensities, {{as a result of}} closing these yield gaps. We use stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and dataenvelopment analysis (DEA) to construct production frontiers for each site, based on 2012 survey data from the CGIAR CCAFS research program. Instead of relying on theoretically optimal yields, which is commonplace in yield <b>gaps</b> <b>assessments,</b> our yield <b>gaps</b> are based on observed differences in productivity among farms within each site. Accordingly, we are able to identify more plausible pathways of improvement, based on better use of existing technology. Significant yield gaps were estimated to be present in all of the sites from each of the five countries. Expressed as potential percentage increases in outputs, the yield gaps ranged from 54 % to 179 %, depending on the site and the methodology. Through closing these yield gaps, we estimate corresponding reductions in the emission intensity of food supply, of between 35 % and 64 %. Market orientation (i. e. proportion of outputs sold) and asset wealth were significantly and positively correlated with productivity across most sites, while farmer age and off-farm income tended to be negatively correlated with productivity. These findings can help improve the targeting of extension and investment efforts to close yield gaps, improve farmer livelihoods and environmental performance...|$|R
