500|$|The {{title is}} a {{reference}} to The Pilgrim's Progress. The episode begins with a cutaway gag featuring Alan Rickman's answering machine. When Madame Claude tells everyone who {{they were in a}} past life, she reveals that Quagmire was Jack the Ripper. Also, when Madame Claude first speaks, Peter says that she sounds like Sebastian the crab from Disney's The Little Mermaid [...] King Stewart III orders to kill the cast of How I Met Your Mother after he is displeased with their performance. Griffin Peterson's act in the talent show is {{a reference to}} the act the Lambda Lambda Lambdas perform at the homecoming in the 1984 film Revenge of the Nerds. As a running gag throughout the episode, Fox promos appear {{on the bottom of the}} screen for made up shows including Shovin' Buddies, Slowly Rotating Black Man, and Cross-Armed Opposites, parodying stereotypical types of Fox mid-show advertising. Griffin Peterson says that he is the happiest <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> because he's on his way to get married and there are [...] "290 years separating me from the films of Kevin Smith." [...] A clip is shown of Madonna celebrating her 16th birthday, suggesting she is over 300 years old. During King Stewart's invasion of the settlement the music and lyrics are identical to that of Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles, with Rock Ridge changed to Quahog. A lady says of King Stewart, [...] "I didn't vote for him," [...] alluding to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Harry MacAfee from the film Bye Bye Birdie makes an appearance. Peter's appearance is similar to Kajagoogoo frontman Limahl.|$|E

2500|$|Colt McCoy led the Longhorns {{through the}} snow flurries to the Nebraska 5. With {{less than a minute}} remaining, Nebraska leading by one point, and the Horns facing fourth down, Texas needed a field-goal to win. Johnson had already missed three kicks (two field goals and a blocked extra point) and he told Coach Brown late in the game that his leg was {{tightening}} up. [...] Brown looked to walk-on sophomore Ryan Bailey to attempt the kick. [...] Bailey was not listed on UT's depth chart and coach Brown later admitted he wasn't sure whether Bailey had even been on the team as a freshman. [...] Bailey had made only 10 kicks as a high-school kicker from Anderson High School in Austin, Texas and he had never attempted a kick for the Longhorns. The trip to Nebraska was only the second time he had ever been included in the travel roster, which is limited to 64 players. Before the kick, Brown told him [...] "You're the luckiest <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> You've got a chance to be Dusty Mangum on your first kick." [...] Mangum had scored the game-winning field goal as time expired to lift the Longhorns to victory over the Michigan Wolverines in the 2005 Rose Bowl.|$|E
