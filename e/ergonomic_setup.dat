40|$|Abstract Background Work urgency, {{accuracy}} and demands compel the computer professionals to spend longer hours before computers without giving importance to their health, especially body weight. Increase {{of body weight}} leads to improper Body Mass Index (BMI) may aggravate work related musculoskeletal discomfort and occupational-psychosocial stress. The objective {{of the study was}} to find out the effect of BMI on work related musculoskeletal discomforts and occupational stress of computer workers in a developed <b>ergonomic</b> <b>setup.</b> Methods A descriptive inferential study has been taken to analyze the effect of BMI on work related musculoskeletal discomfort and occupational-psychosocial stress. A total of 100 computer workers, aged 25 - 35 years randomly selected on convenience from software and BPO companies in Bangalore city, India for the participation in this study. BMI was calculated by taking the ratio of the subject's height (in meter) and weight (in kilogram). Work related musculoskeletal discomfort and occupational stress of the subjects was assessed by Cornell University's musculoskeletal discomfort questionnaire (CMDQ) and occupational stress index (OSI) respectively as well as a relationship was checked with their BMI. Results A significant association (p Conclusion From this study, it has been concluded that, there is a significant effect of BMI in increasing of work related musculoskeletal discomfort and occupational-psychosocial stress among computer workers in a developed <b>ergonomic</b> <b>setup.</b> </p...|$|E
30|$|The {{aforementioned}} {{factors may}} have influenced our results to a certain extent; however, our results clearly indicate that the improved <b>ergonomic</b> <b>setup</b> of RALS leads to lower physiological indicators of stress in this study population. These results provide early indicators that the employment of RALS equipment could decrease surgeon fatigue and reduce the stress that {{has been shown to}} affect both the technical [33] and nontechnical (communication, teamwork and decision making) skills [34 – 37] of the surgeon. A reduction in the stress that impairs these fundamental skills could therefore improve surgical outcomes for patients as well as decreasing the negative effects of long-term stress exposure on the surgeon.|$|E
30|$|Robotic-assisted {{laparoscopic surgery}} (RALS) is making an {{increasingly}} {{significant contribution to}} the field of gynaecological surgery. RALS offers similar patient benefits to standard laparoscopic surgery (SLS) with a potentially more ergonomically friendly and less stressful environment for the surgeon. However, our understanding of how RALS may potentially reduce physiological stress on the surgeon is currently limited. To assess how performing surgical tasks using RALS in comparison to SLS impacts on hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, two key indicators of the physiological stress response. This study is an analytical, within subjects, crossover design study. Sixteen surgically inexperienced medical students performed tasks with both SLS and RALS instrumentation. Blood pressure (BP) was taken before and after task performance. Skin conductance level (SCL), heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) were measured continuously during task performance. Pre- and post-task saliva samples were collected to determine cortisol levels using ELISA. SCL was significantly lower during RALS in comparison to SLS task performance (p[*]<[*] 0.05). HR was significantly lower during RALS vs. SLS tasks (p[*]<[*] 0.01). Both HRV measures were significantly higher during RALS vs. SLS tasks (p[*]<[*] 0.01). Cortisol levels and BP were lower during RALS vs. SLS but did not reach statistical significance (p[*]=[*] 0.73 and p[*]=[*] 0.22, respectively). Stress can impair surgeon’s technical and nontechnical skills. These results indicate that the improved <b>ergonomic</b> <b>setup</b> of RALS has a beneficial impact on physiological indicators of stress. This also demonstrates the potential of RALS to reduce the negative effects of long-term stress exposure on the surgeon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Computer work is {{characterized}} by sedentary static workload with low-intensity energy metabolism. The aim of our study was to evaluate the dynamics of skin surface temperature in the hand during prolonged computer mouse work under different <b>ergonomic</b> <b>setups.</b> Digital infrared imaging of the right forearm and wrist was performed during three hours of continuous computer work (measured at the start and every 15 minutes thereafter) in a laboratory with controlled ambient conditions. Four people participated in the study. Three different <b>ergonomic</b> computer mouse <b>setups</b> were tested on three different days (horizontal computer mouse without mouse pad; horizontal computer mouse with mouse pad and padded wrist support; vertical computer mouse without mouse pad). The study revealed a significantly strong negative correlation between {{the temperature of the}} dorsal surface of the wrist and time spent working with a computer mouse. Hand skin temperature decreased markedly after one hour of continuous computer mouse work. Vertical computer mouse work preserved more stable and higher temperatures of the wrist (> 30 °C), while continuous use of a horizontal mouse {{for more than two hours}} caused an extremely low temperature (< 28 °C) in distal parts of the hand. The preliminary observational findings indicate th...|$|R

40|$|Teleoperation aims {{to extend}} the human {{capabilities}} to manipulate objects remotely by providing the operator with similar conditions as those at the remote location. Using a well-considered type of force feedback, motion and force scaling, the precision can be increased. The {{ultimate goal is to}} reach total transparency, while remaining stable: The operator should feel as if he is manipulating the remote environment directly. This work takes a closer look at minimal invasive surgery (MIS) and haptic feedback overall. Besides an increased precision, MIS shows more advantages. For instance the fact that the medical specialists can work in a more <b>ergonomic</b> <b>setup,</b> tasks can be automated (suturing) and remote surgeons can assist local surgeons. Through the years haptic feedback developed rapidly. Major headlines in the world where directly caused by developments in the technique. For instance the race to the moon in the late 1960 ’s asked for remote space robots and a few years later during the big oil crisis of the 1970 ’s undersea robots were demanded to search for offshore oil, using unmanned submarines. During the same years, the software industry established their first businesses and asked for telerobotics in the manufacturing of the first computer chips. Since in teleoperation a human operator and an environment are involved it is hard to determine the stability of the total system using the regular robust stability criterions (hard to make a model of a human and a complex environment). The passivity approach makes it easier to determine the stability, since basically no dynamical model is needed of those subsystems and it is also applicable to nonlinear systems. After discussing passivity (and it’s extensions the scattering theory and the wave variable theory) this paper will treat different control structures using mainly the passivity theory and of every structure the practical benefit will be examined, regarding stability and transparency...|$|E
