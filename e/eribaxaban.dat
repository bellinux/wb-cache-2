50|$|Rivaroxaban, apixaban and {{edoxaban}} {{are already}} on the market. As of October 2016, several new direct Xa inhibitors have entered clinical trials. These are betrixaban from Portola Pharmaceuticals, letaxaban from Takeda and <b>eribaxaban</b> from Pfizer.|$|E
50|$|A {{new series}} of oral, direct-acting inhibitors of Factor Xa have entered {{clinical}} development, and are competitors of dabigatran, which is a direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor. These include rivaroxaban (Xarelto) from Bayer, apixaban (Eliquis) from Bristol-Myers Squibb, betrixaban from Portola Pharmaceuticals, darexaban (YM150) from Astellas, edoxaban (Lixiana) from Daiichi, otamixaban by Sanofi, and more recently letaxaban (TAK-442) from Takeda and <b>eribaxaban</b> (PD0348292) from Pfizer.|$|E
50|$|Drugs such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and {{edoxaban}} work by inhibiting factor Xa directly (unlike the heparins and fondaparinux, which work via antithrombin activation).Also betrixaban from Portola Pharmaceuticals, darexaban (YM150) from Astellas, {{and more}} recently letaxaban (TAK-442) from Takeda and <b>eribaxaban</b> (PD0348292) from Pfizer. The development of darexaban was discontinued in September 2011: in a trial for prevention of recurrences of myocardial infarction in top of dual antiplatelet therapy, the drug did not demonstrate effectiveness {{and the risk of}} bleeding was increased by approximately 300%. The development of letaxaban was discontinued for acute coronary syndrome in May 2011 following negative results from a Phase II study.|$|E
40|$|The {{geometries}} and {{energies of}} factor Xa inhibitors edoxaban, <b>eribaxaban,</b> fidexaban, darexaban, letaxaban, and the dual factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors tanogitran and SAR 107375 {{in both the}} gas-phase and aqueous solution were studied using the Becke 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 ++G(d,p) or Grimmeâ€™s B 97 D/ 6 - 31 ++G(d,p) method. The fully optimized conformers of these anticoagulants show a characteristic l-shape structure, and the water had a remarkable effect on the equilibrium geometry. According to the calculated pKa values <b>eribaxaban</b> and letaxaban are in neutral undissociated form at pH 7. 4, while fidexaban and tanogitran exist as zwitterionic structures. The lipophilicity of the inhibitors studied lies within a large range of log P between 1 and 4. The dual inhibitor SAR 107375 represents an improvement in structural, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics over tanogitran. At blood pH, SAR 107375 predominantly exists in neutral form. In contrast with tanogitran, it is better absorbed and more lipophilic and active after oral application...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{the most}} common complication after major joint surgery. VTE can easily develop into pulmonary embolism (PE), leading to cardiopulmonary dysfunction or sudden death. We aimed to comprehensively analyse the thromboprophylactic drugs that are used to prevent thrombosis and reduce bleeding risk. Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of thromboprophylaxis after major joint surgery. The major outcomes were the numbers of all-cause VTE and bleeding events, and the secondary outcomes were major VTE and major bleeding/clinically relevant non-major bleeding events. A random-effects network meta-analysis was used to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of each anticoagulant after major joint surgery. Results: We included 104 trials that assessed 110, 643 patients in our meta-analysis. The cluster ranking of major outcomes indicated that FXI-ASO, ardeparin, aspirin, and apixaban were ideal for preventing all-cause VTE and avoiding all bleeding events. Nadroparin, recombinant hirudin, and rivaroxaban effectively inhibited VTE but were associated with a high risk of bleeding. For secondary outcomes, we found that betrixaban, dalteparin, warfarin, and <b>eribaxaban</b> were ideal for preventing major VTE and reducing major bleeding, while rivaroxaban effectively inhibited major VTE but was associated with a high risk of major/clinically relevant non-major bleeding. A sensitivity analysis showed that the effect of apixaban was more robust for major outcomes, while aspirin was more robust for preventing all-cause bleeding events. In secondary outcomes, the effect of warfarin was more robust, while apixaban was still considered an ideal treatment to inhibit major VTE and bleeding events. Conclusion: Our study indicates that FXI-ASO, ardeparin, aspirin, and apixaban are ideal for preventing all-cause VTE and reducing all bleeding events, among which apixaban {{is the most}} reliable. Betrixaban, dalteparin, warfarin, and <b>eribaxaban</b> are ideal for preventing major VTE and reducing major/clinically relevant non-major bleeding events, among which warfarin is the most reliable...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVenous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{a serious}} disease that is often neglected, and effective and safe antithrombotic treatments are a public health priority. New antithrombotics such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, darexaban, TAK- 442, LY 517717, <b>eribaxaban,</b> otamixaban are being developed to overcome current therapeutic limitations. The new oral anticoagulants and parenteral otamixaban are under evaluation in clinical trials for VTE treatment, for VTE prevention in orthopedic surgery, for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and for cardiovascular event prevention in patients with acute coronary syndrome. These antithrombotic agents directly and selectively inhibit factor Xa, and do not require coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment. Several of these drugs have shown promising results and {{have the potential to}} either replace or act as alternatives to traditional anticoagulants (heparins, vitamin K antagonists) ...|$|E
