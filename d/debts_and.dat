5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site {{would allow them to}} clear their <b>debts</b> <b>and</b> reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these <b>debts</b> <b>and</b> further work.|$|E
5|$|Work resumed {{under the}} {{supervision}} of Priddy, but he was soon replaced by Edmund Lingard, who had been the engineer for the Coventry Canal. The canal was opened in stages as it was completed. It reached Chippenham Platt at the end of 1777, Ryeford in January 1779, and it was open throughout to the Wallbridge terminus on 21 July 1779. It had cost £40,930, which had been raised by calling £150 on each £100 share, by borrowing money from the shareholders, by running up <b>debts,</b> <b>and</b> by using the tolls from the parts of the canal which were already open. Traffic was around 16,000 tons per year, which enabled the company to repay the <b>debts</b> <b>and</b> to declare a first dividend of five per cent in 1786.|$|E

We investigate how the senior-sub structure affects the optimal policies for default, conversion and investment the values of equity, straight <b>debt,</b> convertible <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> investment.

The company received tax breaks to pay its <b>debts,</b> <b>and</b> was selected to print banknotes of the Argentine peso. It is suspected that Vandenbroele is actually a frontman for Boudou, and that he employed his clout as minister of economy to benefit a company that actually belonged to him.|$|E

She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale.

This article is based on empirical research on the relationship between household <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> disposable income, net wealth, interest rates and inflation for the period between 1975 and 2013. Using regression analyses, the study examines the linkage between household <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> consumption spending in South Africa to capture the short-run and long-run dynamics. The results show that there is a significant relationship between household <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> disposable income, net wealth and inflation. Further tests indicate that there is a bidirectional causality running from economic growth to household <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. However, it is revealed that there is no direct relationship between household <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> lending rates...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> growth {{for a number of}} developing and industrial economies. For developing countries, we find that lower total external debt levels are associated with higher growth rates, and that this negative relationship is driven by the incidence of public external <b>debt,</b> <b>and</b> not by private external debt. Regarding the channels through which debt accumulation affects growth, we find that this is mainly driven by the capital accumulation growth. There is only limited evidence on {{the relationship between}} external <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> total factor productivity growth. In addition, for private savings rates there are mixed results. We do not find any support for an inverted-U shape relationship between external <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> growth. For industrial countries, we do not find any significant relationship between gross government <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> economic growth.

5|$|After {{the death}} of the Member {{intestate}} in 1820, the estate was inherited by his younger brother George Ferguson (1748–1820), who died shortly after inheriting the estate. He was succeeded by his illegitimate son George Ferguson who, despite incurring severe debts, continued to develop the estate by adding a stable block, race course, an observation tower and other follies. He had huge gambling <b>debts,</b> <b>and</b> although the estate had been valued at £300,000 when he inherited it, he sold off many of the farms {{and other parts of the}} estate to raise funds. Despite these injections of funds, when he died the estate was mortgaged to the extent of £250,000. It was further decimated by his son, George Arthur Ferguson (1835–1924). George Arthur was sequestrated, and what remained of the estate was marketed in 1909. It was eventually sold in mid-1926, and the mansion house was knocked down.|$|E

The rumour was that a former Customs colleague, E. G.

On 11February 1795, he died in his sleep in his house in Gamla Kungsholmsbrogatan. He was buried in Klara churchyard with no gravestone, its location now unknown. The Swedish Academy belatedly placed a memorial in the churchyard in 1851, complete with a bronze medallion by Johan Tobias Sergel.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{purpose of}} the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> partly with equity.

The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> equity to use for financing.|$|R

Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill.
