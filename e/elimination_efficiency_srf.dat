40|$|Objective: The {{major benefit}} of {{tracheal}} gas insufflation (TGI) {{is an increase}} in CO 2 <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> by removal of CO 2 from the anatomical deadspace. In conjunction with mechanical ventilation, TGI may also alter variables that affect CO 2 elimination, such as minute ventilation and peak airway pressure (peak Paw) and cause the development of auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP). We tested the hypothesis that TGI-induced auto-PEEP alters ventilatory variables. We predicted that TGI-induced auto-PEEP offsets the beneficial effects of TGI on CO 2 elimination and that keeping total PEEP (ventilator PEEP + auto-PEEP) constant enhances the CO 2 <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> afforded by TGI. Design: Prospective study of two series of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving mechanical ventilation. Setting: Intensive care units at a university medical center. Patients: Each series consisted of eight sequential hypercapnic patients. Interventions: In series 1, we examined the effect of continuous TGI at 0 and 10 L/min on Paco 2, without compensating for the development of auto-PEEP. In series 2, we examined this same effect of continuous TGI while reducing ventilator PEEP to keep total PEEP constant. TGI-induced auto-PEEP was calculated based on dynamic compliance measurements during zero TGI flow conditions (ΔV/ΔP) after averaging the two baseline values for peak Paw and tidal volume and assuming compliance did not change between the zero TGI and TGI flow conditions (ΔV(TGI) /ΔP(TGI)). Measurements and Main Results: In series 1, total PEEP increased from 13. 2 ± 3. 2 cm H 2 O to 17. 8 ± 3. 5 cm H 2 O without compensation for auto-PEEP (p =. 01). Paco 2 decreased (p =. 03) from 56. 2 ± 10. 6 mm Hg (zero TGI) to 52. 9 ± 9. 3 mm Hg (TGI at 10 L/min), a 6 % decrement. In series 2, total PEEP was unchanged (p = NS). Paco 2 decreased (p =. 03) from 59. 5 ± 10. 4 mm Hg (zero TGI) to 52. 2 ± 8. 3 mm Hg (TGI at 10 L/min), a 12 % decrement. There was no significant change in Pao 2; there were no untoward hemodynamic effects in either series. Conclusions: These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mechanical ventilation + TGI causes an increase in auto-PEEP that can blunt CO 2 elimination. In addition to the ventilator modifications necessary to keep ventilatory variables constant when TGI is used, it is also necessary to reduce ventilator PEEP to keep total PEEP constant and further enhance CO 2 <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Barotrauma and {{cardiovascular}} insufficiency are frequently encountered problems {{in patients with}} acute bronchospastic disease who require mechanical ventilation. Permissive hypercapnia is a recognized strategy for minimizing these adverse effects; however, it has potential risks. Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI) {{has been shown to}} increase carbon dioxide <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> and thus could permit mechanical ventilation at lower peak airway pressures without inducing hypercapnia. However, caution exists as to the impact of TGI on lung volumes, given that expiratory flow limitation is a hallmark of bronchospastic disease. Purpose: To examine these issues, we studied ventilatory and hemodynamic effects of continuous TGI as an adjunct to mechanical ventilation before and after methacholine-induced bronchospasm. Materials and Methods: Ten anesthetized, paralyzed dogs were ventilated on volume-controlled mechanical ventilation during administration of continuous TGI (0, 2, 6, and 10 L/min) while total inspired minute ventilation (ventilator-derived minute ventilation plus TGI) was kept constant. In an additional step, with TGI flow of 10 L/min, total inspired minute ventilation was decreased by 30 %. Results: Paco 2 decreased (44 ± 7 mm Hg at zero flow to 34 ± 7 mm Hg at 6 L/min and 31 ± 6 mm Hg at 10 L/min, respectively, P <. 05), as did the dead space to tidal volume ratio at TGI of 6 and 10 L/min compared with zero flow. There were no significant changes in end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure, mean arterial pressure, or cardiac output. During the highest TGI flow (10 L/min), with a 30 % reduction of total inspired minute ventilation, both Paco 2 and peak airway pressure remained less than during zero flow conditions. Conclusion: We conclude that TGI increases carbon dioxide <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> during constant and decreased minute ventilation conditions without any evidence of hyperinflation or hemodynamic instability during methacholine-induced bronchospasm...|$|R

40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} contains, {{along with}} suspended solids, oxygen consuming compounds and nutrients, {{a great number}} of organic trace pollutants. These are industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic hormones, as well as ingredients of personal care products. Even in very low concentrations (ng/L to µg/L) some of these compounds can already {{have a negative impact on}} the environment. The impact can manifest itself for example in toxic, carcinogenic and/or endocrine effects of wastewater treatment plant effluents in aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, the elimination of organic trace pollutants has not been taken into consideration yet, neither in design nor during the operation of municipal wastewater treatment plants. On the basis of the European Water Framework Directive requirements on the quality of surface waters, some changes in this attitude are to expect in the future. This study examines around 500 organic trace pollutants which are continuously monitored by the federal environmental agencies. It shows that 52 compounds are relevant for the environment, because their concentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface waters in Germany have exceeded the target values. Due to the impossibility of studying the behaviour of all 52 relevant trace pollutants during the wastewater treatment, the industrial chemicals nonylphenol and bisphenol A, natural hormone 17 b-estradiol and synthetic steroid 17 a-ethinylestradiol were appointed as model compounds. The criteria of choice were different biological degradation and volatilisation rates, as well as different affinity to sewage sludge. The behaviour of the model trace pollutants during the mechanic-biological treatment of wastewater and sewage sludge was studied in pilot wastewater treatment plants and in laboratory sorption and degradation experiments with radiolabelled compounds. In these experiments biodegradation was identified as the main elimination pathway. By the biodegradation of the model compounds carbon dioxide and some unidentified metabolites were generated. Further research is required to perform a risk assessment of the biodegradation products. The evaluation of <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> of various wastewater treatment plant configurations was performed using the experiment results and the mathematical model developed in this study. A conventional activated sludge plant with simultaneous aerobic sludge digestion showed the best <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the model compounds. It was followed by membrane activated sludge plants with simultaneous aerobic and separate anaerobic sludge digestion. The lowest <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> was observed in a conventional activated sludge plant with separate anaerobic sludge digestion. Sand filtration of the effluents of conventional treatment plants did not contribute significantly to the elimination of the model trace pollutants. Since, according to the mathematical model the studied wastewater treatment plant configurations do not retain some organic trace pollutants like 17 a-ethinylestradiol and the pharmaceutical carbamazepine sufficiently, 16 various measures of enhancing the elimination of trace pollutants were assessed with respect to their technical and economical efficiency. For the smaller wastewater treatment plants (up to 5, 000 PE) the addition of pulverised activated carbon into the aeration tank was especially suitable.

The poorly reversible internal concentrations in organisms are caused by the persistence of short-chain PFAAs and their continuous presence in the environment. Therefore, the organismal <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are of secondary relevance. This becomes more evident when considering that the half-lives of short-chain PFAAs in the environment exceed their half-lives in the organisms by far. Cousins et al. [41] addresses this approach in more detail, showing exemplary that the contamination of drinking water resources with short-chain PFAAs leads to a poorly reversible exposure in humans, comparably to a contamination with long-chain PFAAs. Due to the high mobility of short-chain PFAAs and the missing suitable water treatment technologies for drinking water, short-chain PFAAs will remain in the water resources over time (this scenario proves true, see “Case example Rastatt”). This results in a permanent exposure via drinking water, independently of the elimination half-lives of short-chain PFAAs.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} of water pollution is the capability of pollutants to concentrate in aquatic organisms. Bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of such chemicals in fish render it unsuitable for human consumption. Bioconcentration of water pollutants through algae, zooplankton and other organisms, can lead to their accumulation through food. chain, with the fish {{at the top of}} the pelagic food web. The occurrence of elevated residue levels of various xenobiotics with increasing trophic level has been demonstrated in a variety of aquatic environments and organisms. The increased bioconcentration occurs with increasing trophic level. The tendency of a chemical to bioconcentrate has been shown to be strongly related to its lipophilicity. Trophic. level differences in bioconcentration are due largely to increased lipid content and decreased chemical <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> of organisms occupying increasing trophic levels. The accumulation of pollutant is expressed as the bioconcentration factor (BCF), which is determined as the rate of its uptake to the organism and its elimination from it plus the organism growth rate. Chemical uptake efficiency from water, excretion rate, and chemical assimilation efficiency are variable as a function of the octanol. water partition coefficient (Kow) ...|$|R

But {{in the next}} process, it will experience an accumulation or concentration so that at certain concentrations, it can cause the {{negative impact on the}} environment. The results from the previous research showed that the water hyacinth plant (Eichhornia crassipes) has the highest ability in reducing heavy metal pollution of mercury. The objective of this research is to analyze the ability of the water hyacinth plant (Eichhornia crassipes) in reducing the concentration of metal with variety of water flow rates. This research was conducted to test the water hyacinth plant (Eichhornia crassipes) in some discharge water sources which contaminated with mercury in the downstream of gold mining in Batang Hari River on a laboratory scale with a continuous flow. The result of this research revealed that the water hyacinth plant (Eichhornia crassipes) can lower the concentration of heavy metals Hg to the limit of water quality for irrigation. The <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> levels from heavy metals mercury ranged between 49. 9...|$|R
40|$|The living cell DNA {{is under}} {{permanent}} attack {{of a variety}} of exogenous and endogenous damaging factors. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is main pathway which removes a wide variety of bulky DNA adducts formed by UV light, electrophilic environmental mutagens, and chemotherapeutic agents. NER process in mammalian cells consistently leads to the very specific excision of damaged DNA fragments 24 – 32 nucleotides in length. The following DNA repair synthesis and DNA ligation restore intact DNA helix. The main set of the genes inactivated in NER-deficient higher eukaryotic cells was identified; about 30 proteins are involved in the specific multi-subunit complexes responsible for NER process. The specific NER feature is wide substrate specificity and great difference of damages <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> A key limiting step in NER is damage recognition and verification. One of the advanced and upcoming approaches to NER process investigation is based on the application of model DNAs – artificial DNA structures, which are analogs of substrate or intermediates of the repair process. This article reviews our current knowledge concerning the model DNA design, synthesis and application as a tool for the NER process comprehensive study. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAims: The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} impact of the applied mass loading on the {{selection}} of an efficient microbial community able to degrade a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Methods and Results: Two reactors were used and were supplied with a gaseous effluent containing 11 VOCs with different concentrations. The response of the microflora was monitored as a function of time: biodegradation activity, bacterial density and diversity. The results showed that the applied mass loading seems to have an impact on the functioning and the genetic structure of the bacterial community. Conclusions: A high mass loading seems to induce a low efficient functioning in terms of <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> and a simplification of the genetic structure of the total bacterial community with the apparition of a dominant microflora. A low mass loading seems to favour a better functioning and allows to keep a healthier bacterial diversity. Significance and Impact of the Study: In the treatment processes of gaseous effluents, it would be judicious to define the functioning parameters of the process to keep the diversity of important functional bacterial groups. These results provide also useful information about changes in microbial communities following natural or anthropogenic alterations in different ecosystems...|$|R
