500|$|In May 2008, the Wynn Las Vegas casino filed a civil {{complaint}} against Barkley, alleging {{that he had}} failed to pay a $400,000 debt stemming from October 2007. Barkley responded by taking blame for letting time lapse on the repayment of the debt and promptly paid the casino. After repaying his debt, Barkley stated during a pregame show on TNT, [...] "I've got to stop gambling...I am not going to gamble anymore. For right now, the next year or two, I'm not going to gamble... Just because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to lose money doesn't mean I should do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Lowell had {{intended}} never to remarry {{after the death}} of his wife Maria White. However, in 1857, surprising his friends, he became engaged to Frances Dunlap, who many described as simple and unattractive. Dunlap, niece of the former governor of Maine Robert P. Dunlap, was a friend of Lowell's first wife and formerly wealthy, though she and her family had fallen into reduced circumstances. Lowell and Dunlap married on September 16, 1857, in a ceremony performed by his brother. Lowell wrote, [...] "My second marriage was the wisest act of my life, & as long as I am sure of it, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to wait till my friends agree with me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Dewey {{publicly}} supported Nelson Rockefeller in {{all four}} of his campaigns for Governor of New York, and backed Rockefeller in his losing 1964 bid for the Republican presidential nomination against Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, he did privately express concern and disappointment with what he regarded as Rockefeller's [...] "spendthrift" [...] methods as governor, and once told him [...] "I like you Nelson, but I don't think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> you." [...] In 1968, when both Rockefeller and Nixon were competing for the Republican presidential nomination, Dewey was publicly neutral, but [...] "privately, according to close friends, he favored Nixon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Guinness {{disliked the}} fame that {{followed}} work {{he did not}} hold in high esteem, Lucas and fellow cast members Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher have spoken highly of his courtesy and professionalism, {{on and off the}} set. Lucas credited him with inspiring cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming. Guinness was quoted as saying that the royalties he obtained from working on the films gave him [...] "no complaints; let me leave it by saying I can live {{for the rest of my}} life in the reasonably modest way I am now used to, that I have no debts and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to refuse work that doesn't appeal to me." [...] In his autobiography, Blessings In Disguise, Guinness tells an imaginary interviewer [...] "Blessed be Star Wars", regarding the income it provided.|$|E
2500|$|Needing {{additional}} {{sources of}} finance to fund Birmingham's bid for immediate promotion {{back to the}} Football League First Division, the board approached Clifford Coombs, founder of home credit company S, for a loan. He agreed to put money into the club, but only if he could run it himself. He duly bought out the Morris family, promised to [...] "find all the money <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford.</b> My heart is in Birmingham City and now my pocket will be as well", became chairman in January 1966, and lured Stan Cullis, manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers in their glory days, out of retirement. Cullis's team played attractive football, and average attendance doubled between 1965–66 and 1967–68. Cullis led Birmingham to the semi-final of the League Cup in 1967, and in the 1967–68 FA Cup, they beat Arsenal and Chelsea in front of crowds in excess of 50,000 at St Andrew's before losing to West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final. Cup success was not restricted to the first team: the youth team reached {{the final of the}} FA Youth Cup in 1967, losing to what was described as an experienced Sunderland team. Fourth place in the division in 1967–68 and seventh in 1968–69 preceded a slump towards the bottom of the table, and Coombs decided {{it was time for a}} change. He persuaded Cullis back into retirement in March 1970, and approached top-class managers, including Brian Clough and Peter Taylor and Don Revie, without success, before appointing Freddie Goodwin of Brighton & Hove Albion manager.|$|E
