40|$|Problem statement: Fisheries {{sector is}} a rising sector in Bangladesh. Many farmers are {{shifting}} their rice fields to ponds for <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> {{in the study}} areas. This transformation of farming raises a question to the researchers whether <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> has any impact on household income or not. Thus, the researchers took the present study to identify the contribution of <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> on household income of the fish farmers in the study areas. Approach: The population of the study consisted of all fish farmers of the selected eight villages from four sub-districts of Mymensingh district. Required data for the study were collected with questionnaire through personal interviewing of the respondent farmers. Results: Result shows that <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> is contributing {{in a range of}} 15. 35 - 86. 63 % on household income of the respondent farmers and the average contribution of <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> is 50. 99 % indicating major contribution of this entrepreneurship on household income of the practitioner farmers. The result of the stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that all of the income sources jointly can elucidate 98. 3 % variation on household income where <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> alone can contribute the highest (44 %) on household income of the respondent farmers. However, the results of multiple regressions indicate that 74 % {{of the variance in the}} income from <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> could be explained by the explanatory variables of the study. The study successfully explored following factors: age of the household head, family land holdings, pond size, training on <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> and access to information on <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> which can influence income from <b>fish</b> <b>farming.</b> Conclusions/Recommendations: The study reported that <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> has significant contribution on household income of the practitioner farmers. Thus, it is essential for the policy makers in the field of fisheries to take into account the identified factors for rapid expansion of <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> in rural Bangladesh...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> biodeposition on benthic bacteria, thraustochytrid protists, and heterotrophic protozoa (nanoflagellates and ciliates) in an oligotrophic area of the Mediterranean Sea.

In both systems, sediment samples were collected with a multicontrol sampling strategy (i. e., beneath the <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> and at three control sites per system). The uneaten food pellets supplied to the fish determined the accumulation of sediment organic matter and the enhancement of protein content in impacted sediments (both seagrass bed and soft sediments). In both systems, the abundance and biomass of heterotrophic protists increased significantly beneath the <b>fish</b> <b>farm,</b> but {{the structure of the}} protist assemblages responded differently in vegetated and unvegetated sediments.

40|$|Aquaculture, or more {{generally}} <b>fish</b> <b>farming,</b> and fisheries interact {{in several different}} ways. First, many types of <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> require <b>fish</b> products as inputs, mostly for feeding purposes. Second, <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> and wild fish products compete in fish markets with consequences for both the industry and, of course, consumers. Third, <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> generates various types of polluting agents that may affect wild fish stocks and their habitat. Several other interactions exist. This paper is primarily concerned with {{the implications of the}} first of these interactions, namely the input relationships, for the overall supply of fish products in the future. To the extent that the <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> industry demands wild fish products such as fish meal, fish oil, etc. as inputs, the price of these products is increased compared to what would otherwise be the case and, as a result, the price of fish landings. This encourages increased demand from the <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> industry may – especially given the ecosystem context of most fisheries – lead to long-term fluctuations, instability and even chaotic behavior of wild fish supply. A formal model describing the above considerations is constructed. Possible schedules of global supply of fish products are calculated given various assumptions about (i) fisheries management, (ii) wild fish requirements of the <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> industry, and (iii) technological progress in <b>fish</b> <b>farming.</b> The impact of expanding global <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> on the wild fish industry and global supply of fish products is assessed.

40|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{represents}} a small scale, easy to access, regional analogue of larger oceanic oligotrophic systems. In this Gulf, the seasonal cycles of stratification and mixing drives the seasonal phytoplankton dynamics. In summer and fall, when nutrient concentrations are very low, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are more {{abundant in the}} surface water. This two populations are exposed to phosphate limitation. During winter mixing, when nutrient concentrations are high, Chlorophyceae and Cryptophyceae are dominant but scarce or absent during summer. In this study it was tried to develop a simulation model based on historical data to predict the phytoplankton dynamics in the northern Gulf of Aqaba. The purpose is to understand what forces operate, and how, to determine the phytoplankton dynamics in this Gulf. To make the models data sampled in two different sampling station (<b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> Station and Station A) were used. The data of chemical, biological and physical factors, are available from 14 th January 2007 to 28 th December 2009.

Most {{efforts of}} Nigerian governments to fight {{unemployment}} and poverty among the educated youths have not succeeded because most agricultural programmes initiated by past governments {{did not go}} down well with the youths due to drudgery, large capital outlay and low returns to resources associated with food crop and livestock production. But recently, some governments are empowering unemployed educated youths to go into <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> for employment and income generation strategy, because <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> is less tedious and requires less resources outlay and has high returns to resources used in its production. This paper examined how efficient <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> can solve unemployment and poverty problems among educated youths in Nigeria. The data for the study were collected from 100 educated fish farmers selected using multistage sampling technique and were analysed using the profitability and stochastic frontier production and cost functions analyses.
