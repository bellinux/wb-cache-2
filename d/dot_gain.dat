50|$|<b>Dot</b> <b>gain</b> can be {{measured}} using a densitometer and color bars in absolute percentages. <b>Dot</b> <b>gain</b> is usually measured with 40% and 80% tones as reference values. A common value for <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> is around 23% in the 40% tone for a 150 lpi screen and coated paper. Thus a <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> of 19% means that a tint area of 40% {{will result in a}} 59% tone in the actual print.|$|E
50|$|Another factor {{upon which}} <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> depends is the dot's area fraction. Dots with {{relatively}} large perimeters {{will tend to}} have greater <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> than dots with smaller perimeters. This makes it useful to have {{a model for the}} amount of <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> as a function of prepress dot area fraction.|$|E
50|$|The {{measure of}} how much an ink dot spreads and becomes larger on paper is called <b>dot</b> <b>gain.</b> This {{phenomenon}} must be accounted for in photographic or digital preparation of screened images. <b>Dot</b> <b>gain</b> is higher on more absorbent, uncoated paper stock such as newsprint.|$|E

50|$|The G7 {{method was}} created by Don Hutcheson, {{chairman}} of the IDEAlliance GRACoL (International Digital Enterprise Alliance, General Requirements for Applications in Commercial Offset Lithography) in 2006. It was created {{to solve the problem}} of computer to plate (CtP) printing systems and other devices printing images with different tonal value increases (TVIs), or <b>dot</b> <b>gains.</b> Also, professionals in the printing industry follow the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) principles of half-tone printing, called ISO 12647-2, which does not specify colorimetric values for gray balance and refers to multiple TVI curves. This results in an ambiguous definition of the print’s final ‘appearance’.|$|R
50|$|Acid-based {{fountain}} {{solutions are}} still the most common variety and yield the best quality results by means of superior protection of the printing plate, lower <b>dot</b> <b>gains,</b> and longer plate life. Acids are also the most versatile; capable of running with all types of offset litho inks. However, because these products require more active ingredients to run well than do neutrals and alkalines, {{they are also the}} most expensive to produce. However, neutrals and, to a lesser degree, alkalines are still an industry staple {{and will continue to be}} used for most newspapers and many lower-quality inserts. In recent years alternatives have been developed which do not use fountain solutions at all (waterless printing).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dot</b> <b>gain,</b> or tonal value increase, is a {{phenomenon}} in offset lithography and some other forms of printing which causes printed material to look darker than intended. It is caused by halftone dots growing in area between the original printing film and the final printed result. In practice, this means that an image {{that has not been}} adjusted to account for <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> will appear too dark when it is printed. [...] <b>Dot</b> <b>gain</b> calculations are often an important part of a CMYK color model.|$|E
50|$|Not all {{halftone}} dots {{show the}} same amount of gain. The area of greatest gain is in midtones (40-60%); above this, as the dots contact one another, the perimeter available for <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> is reduced. <b>Dot</b> <b>gain</b> becomes more noticeable with finer screen ruling, {{and is one of the}} factors affecting the choice of screen.|$|E
50|$|Printed {{magazines}} and newspapers often use a halftone system. Typical newsprint paper is not very dense, and has relatively high <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> or color bleeding, so newsprint is usually around 85 LPI. Higher-quality paper, such as that used in commercial magazines, has less <b>dot</b> <b>gain,</b> and can range up to 300 LPI with quality glossy (coated) paper.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrated}} {{the feasibility of}} embedding unperceivable code sequence by modulating <b>dot</b> <b>gains</b> through laser intensity modulation for halftone images. From a communication systems point of view, a printer and a document scanner form the physical layer of a communication channel, where information can be hidden in halftone images and reliably transmitted and extracted. In the proposed approach, we will leverage our previous results in embedding unperceivable banding signals to halftone images and develop an integrated embedding and detection algorithm to embed and extract information with high payload capacity. Specifically, we will characterize the embedding capacity and detection rate associated with the proposed algorithm. Preliminary experimental results will be presented...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a mixture of}} metal coated quantum dots dispersed in a polymer matrix and, using {{a modified version of}} the standard Maxwell-Garnett mixing rule, we prove that the mixture parameters (particles radius, quantum <b>dots</b> <b>gain,</b> etc.) can be chosen so that the effective medium permittivity has an absolute value very close to zero in the near-infrared, i. e. |Re(epsilon) |<< 1 and |Im (epsilon) |<< 1 at the same near-infrared wavelength.

40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} the printed screen {{elements}} made by the application of two types of offset rubber blankets (ORB) have been investigated in this work. The force in the contact zone between the offset cylinder (ORB) and the printing cylinder (printing substrate) is decisive for making the prints. With the different structure of ORB the different deformation zone is created, which results in forming the different sizes of the screen elements. The printing substrate has also influence, {{and because of that}} 5 characteristic papers (fine art paper gloss, fine art paper mat, offset paper, calendered offset paper and recycled paper) have been analyzed. The results show that on the tested printing substrates, the both ORBs form the greatest <b>dot</b> <b>gains</b> in the following order: offset paper, recycled paper, calendered offset paper, fine art paper mat and fine art paper gloss. Such results are completely in accordance with the original roughness of paper. Key words: offset, offset cylinder, deviation of the printe...|$|R

5000|$|It {{is defined}} as the {{increase}} in the area fraction (of the inked or colored region) of a halftone dot during the prepress and printing processes. Total <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> is the difference between the dot size on the film negative and the corresponding printed dot size. For example, a dot pattern that covers 30% of the image area on film, but covers 50% when printed, is said to show a total <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> of 20%.|$|E

40|$|To {{reproduce}} color {{images in}} print, the {{continuous tone image}} is first transformed into a binary halftone image, producing various colors by discrete dots with varying area coverage. In halftone prints on paper, physical and optical <b>dot</b> <b>gains</b> generally occur, making the print look darker than expected, and making the modeling of halftone color reproduction a challenge. Most available models are based on macroscopic color measurements, averaging the reflectance over {{an area that is}} large in relation to the halftone dots. The aim {{of this study is to}} go beyond the macroscopic approach, and study halftone color reproduction on a micro-scale level, using high resolution images of halftone prints. An experimental imaging system, combining the accuracy of color measurement instruments with a high spatial resolution, opens up new possibilities to study and analyze halftone color prints. The experimental image acquisition offers a great flexibility in the image acquisition setup. Besides trichromatic RGB filters, the system is also equipped with a set of 7 narrowband filters, for multi-channel images. A thorough calibration and characterization of all the components in the imaging system is described. The spectra...|$|R

50|$|The Yule-Nielsen effect, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} optical <b>dot</b> <b>gain,</b> {{is a phenomenon}} caused by absorption and scattering of light by the substrate. Light becomes diffused around dots, darkening the apparent tone. As a result, dots absorb more light than their size would suggest.|$|E
5000|$|However, with today's {{computer-to-plate}} imaging systems, which eliminates film completely, {{the measure}} of [...] "film" [...] is the original digital source [...] "dot." [...] Therefore, <b>dot</b> <b>gain</b> is now measured as the original digital dot versus the actual measured ink dot on paper.|$|E
50|$|The Yule-Nielsen {{effect is}} not {{strictly}} speaking {{a type of}} <b>dot</b> <b>gain,</b> because {{the size of the}} dot does not change, just its relative absorbance. Some densitometers automatically compute the absorption of a halftone relative to the absorption of a solid print using the Murray-Davies formula.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new testing {{form was}} designed, {{in which the}} screens having gray scales and some solid blocks were included. The screens consist of gray scales from 0 to 100 % of dot {{coverage}}, and the solid blocks also have coverage scales from 0 to 100 %. Printing experiment was performed, and densities and dot coverage of specific places were measured and recorded. Based on the testing data, density or dot coverage undulation with printing impressions was indicated by curves. Furthermore analysis was taken. <b>Dot</b> <b>gains</b> in the same prints are not constant, which cause that saddle shape in prints. Some reasons from construction of press such as the gap of cylinder, swing of transferring roller and oscillation of oscillating rollers were brought out. Same values of ink presetting can not get the same printing quality in the ink zones which have the same graphic coverage. The traditional press has a long make-ready time in printing running, which can reduce the efficiency of press. Shaft-less technology of inking system is put forward to cut down the make-ready time and to decrease the power consumption. New algorithm research is necessary for ink zone presetting {{in order to get}} more precise ink feeding.

5000|$|<b>Dot</b> <b>gain</b> {{is caused}} by ink {{spreading}} around halftone dots. Several factors {{can contribute to the}} increase in halftone dot area. Different paper types have different ink absorption rates; uncoated papers can absorb more ink than coated ones, and thus can show more gain. As printing pressure can squeeze the ink out of its dot shape causing gain, ink viscosity is a contributing factor with coated papers; higher viscosity inks can resist the pressure better. Halftone dots can also be surrounded by a small circumference of ink, in an effect called [...] "rimming". Each halftone dot has a microscopic relief, and ink will fall off the edge before being eliminated entirely by the fountain solution (in the case of offset printing). Finally, halation of the printing film during exposure can contribute to <b>dot</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
