5|$|<b>Elapidae</b> is {{a family}} of venomous snakes found in {{tropical}} and subtropical regions around the world, including the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. Two species are found in Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
5|$|Like most <b>Elapidae,</b> {{the scales}} of the black mamba are smooth and flat, without keels. Most {{specimens}} feature 23–25 rows of scales, but rarely as few as 21.|$|E
5|$|Naja nigricollis {{belongs to}} the cobra genus Naja under the family <b>Elapidae.</b> It {{previously}} included two subspecies that have been moved to the species Naja nigricincta - the zebra spitting cobra (Naja nigricincta nigricincta) and the black spitting cobra (Naja nigricincta woodi).|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the <b>Elapidae,</b> thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the <b>Elapidae,</b> with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} in the <b>Elapidae</b> family, {{the majority of the}} Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or trivial. For example, P. platurus has a venom more potent than any terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica based on LD50, but despite its abundance in the waters off its western coast, few human fatalities have been reported. Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be handled with great caution.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca), also {{commonly}} called the black cobra {{and the black}} and white-lipped cobra, is a species of venomous snake in the family <b>Elapidae.</b> The species is native to Africa, mostly the central and western parts of the continent. It is the largest true cobra species with a total length (including tail) of up to 3.1 meters (10 feet). Although it prefers lowland forest and moist savanna habitats, this cobra is highly adaptable {{and can be found}} in drier climates within its geographical range. It is a very capable swimmer and is often considered to be semi-aquatic. The forest cobra is a generalist in its feeding habits, having a highly varied diet: anything from large insects to small mammals and other reptiles. This species is alert, nervous and {{is considered to be a}} very dangerous snake. When cornered or molested, it will assume the typical cobra warning posture by raising its fore body off the ground, spreading a narrow hood, and hissing loudly. Bites to humans are less common than from other African cobras due to various factors, though a bite from this species is a life-threatening emergency.|$|E
25|$|The type genus for the <b>Elapidae</b> was {{originally}} Elaps, {{but the group}} was moved to another family. In contrast to what is typical of botany, the <b>Elapidae</b> family was not renamed. In the meantime, Elaps was renamed Homoroselaps and {{moved back to the}} <b>Elapidae.</b> However, Nagy et al. (2005) regard it as a sister taxon to Atractaspis, which should have been assigned to the Atractaspidinae.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{is even more}} complex in countries like India, with its rich mix of vipers (family Viperidae) and highly neurotoxic cobras and kraits of the family <b>Elapidae.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} {{debates in the}} systematics within the group. For instance, many sources classify Boidae and Pythonidae as one family, while some keep the <b>Elapidae</b> and Hydrophiidae (sea snakes) separate for practical reasons despite their extremely close relation.|$|E
25|$|Of the 120 known {{indigenous}} snake {{species in}} North America, only 20 are venomous to human beings, all {{belonging to the}} families Viperidae and <b>Elapidae.</b> However, in the United States, every state except Maine, Alaska, and Hawaii is home {{to at least one}} of 20 venomous snake species. Up to 95% of all snakebite-related deaths in the United States are attributed to the western and eastern diamondback rattlesnakes. Further, the majority of bites in the United States occur in the southwestern part of the country, in part because rattlesnake populations in the eastern states are much lower.|$|E
25|$|Naja is a genus in {{the family}} <b>Elapidae.</b> Linnaeus first {{described}} Naja nivea in 1758. He originally assigned the binomial name Coluber niveus, but some ten years afterwards Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti described the genus of true cobras under the name Naja. In 2007 Wüster et al. partitioned the genus Naja into four separate subgenera {{on the basis of}} various factors such as lineage, morphology and diet. They placed Naja nivea in the subgenus Uraeus, the African non-spitting cobras: the Cape cobra (N. nivea), the Egyptian cobra (N. haje), the snouted cobra (N. annulifera), Anchieta's cobra (N. anchietae), Arabian cobra (N. arabica) and Senegalese cobra (N. senegalensis).|$|E
25|$|Australia is {{the only}} {{continent}} where venomous snakes outnumber their non-venomous cousins. Australian snakes belong to seven families. Of these, the most venomous species, including the fierce snake, eastern brown snake, taipan and eastern tiger snake are from the family <b>Elapidae.</b> Of the 200 species of elapid, 86 are found only in Australia. Thirty-three sea snakes from family Hydrophiidae inhabit Australia's northern waters; many are extremely venomous. Two species of sea snake from the Acrochordidae also occur in Australian waters. Australia has only 11 species from the world's most significant snake family Colubridae; none are endemic, and they {{are considered to be}} relatively recent arrivals from Asia. There are 15 python species and 31 species of insectivorous blind snake.|$|E
500|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} is {{classified}} under the genus Dendroaspis {{of the family}} <b>Elapidae.</b> Dendroaspis angusticeps was first described by a Scottish surgeon and zoologist, Dr. Andrew Smith in 1849.|$|E
500|$|Naja nigricollis is {{classified}} under the genus Naja {{of the family}} <b>Elapidae.</b> It was first described by Norwegian zoologist Johan Reinhardt in 1843. The generic name Naja is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word [...] (...) , meaning [...] "cobra". [...] The specific epithet nigricollis is Latin for [...] "black-necked": niger, meaning [...] "black", and collis, [...] meaning [...] "neck".|$|E
500|$|The forest cobra is {{classified}} in the genus Naja of the family <b>Elapidae.</b> Naja melanoleuca was first described by American herpetologist Edward Hallowell in 1857. The generic name Naja is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word [...] (...) meaning [...] "cobra". The specific epithet melanoleuca is Ancient Greek and means [...] "of black and white". The word melano is Greek for [...] "black", while leuca comes from the Ancient Greek word for [...] "white". [...] This species {{is also known as}} the black cobra and black and white-lipped cobra.|$|E
500|$|The forest cobra is {{classified}} under the genus Naja {{of the family}} <b>Elapidae.</b> The genus was first described by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. The species Naja melanoleuca was first described by Edward Hallowell in 1857. The genus Naja was split into several subgenera based on various factors, including morphology, diet, and habitat. Naja melanoleuca {{is part of the}} subgenus Boulengerina, along with three other species: Naja annulata, Naja christyi, and Naja multifasciata. The subgenus is united by their restriction to central and west African forest and/or forest-edge type habitat. They are also more aquatic and feed more on aquatic species. The species of the subgenus Boulengerina show great diversity in size, however, ranging from the forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca) which can attain lengths of [...] to the burrowing cobra (Naja multifasciata) which doesn't grow larger than [...] in length. The below cladogram illustrates the taxonomy and relationships among species of Naja: ...|$|E
500|$|The kraits, as {{they are}} {{commonly}} known, belong to the family <b>Elapidae</b> and the genus Bungarus. The genus is endemic to the continent of Asia. They are morphologically well connected, forming a close-knit and cohesive unit. The genus has 12–13 species who are morphologically distinct from the Naja genus and the Afro-elapids according to McDowell (1987). McDowell stated [...] "species diversity is greatest in Africa, but the Asiatic Bungarus and Ophiophagus are each so peculiar in anatomy as to suggest an ancient divergence". Others, including Slowinski, believed that the kraits (Bungarus), {{are part of a}} clade that clusters with a group including the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) and oddly enough, with the African mambas (Dendroaspis) on the most-parsimonious tree or with Elapsoidea on the maximum-likelihood tree. This result calls into question the monophyly of cobras and underscores the uncertainty of the homology of the hood spreading behavior in cobras and mambas. The relationships of Dendroaspis, Ophiophagus, and Bungarus differed between the parsimony and likelihood analyses, suggesting that more work is necessary to resolve the relationships of these problematic taxa. McDowell's findings in regard to the sister-group of Bungarus and the sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) family, propose that the kraits might just be a per-mutable clade between the <b>elapidae</b> [...] "palatine-erectors" [...] and the hydrophiinae [...] "palatine draggers". Two genera within the hydrophiinae family in particular, support McDowell's hypothesis. The two genera are Salomonelaps and Loveridgelaps due to many shared characteristics. Mao et al. (1983) showed that this species, Bungarus multicinctus was slightly distinct from the other members of its genus and was immunologically more similar to Laticauda, terrestrial Australian elapids, and true sea snakes than it is to Elapsoidea sundevalli (Sundevall's garter snake), Naja naja (Indan cobra) or two Micrurus species (New World or American coral snakes). Minton (1981), Schwaner et al. and Cadle & Gorman (1981) all suggested similar things to Mao et al. (1983) based on immunological data. The many-banded krait was more similar to the Australian elapids, Laticauda and true sea snakes than they were to numerous elapids they were compared to.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Elapidae</b> ( [...] éllops, [...] "sea-fish") are {{a family}} of venomous snakes found in the tropics and subtropics around the world, terrestrially in Asia, Australia, Africa, North America, and South America, and aquatically in the Pacific and Indian oceans.|$|E
2500|$|The table above lists {{all of the}} elapid genera and no subfamilies. In the past, many subfamilies were recognized, or {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the <b>Elapidae,</b> including the Elapinae, Hydrophiinae (sea snakes), Micrurinae (coral snakes), Acanthophiinae (Australian elapids) and the Laticaudinae (sea kraits). Currently, none are universally recognized. Good molecular evidence via karyotyping, protein electrophoretic analysis, immunological distance, DNA sequence analysis, and so on, suggests reciprocal monophyly of two groups: ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the genus}} Elaps, above {{referred}} to, the very peculiar style of colour and marking is evidently a [...] "warning colour" [...] {{for the purpose}} of indicating to snake-eating birds and mammals that these species are poisonous; and this throws light on the long-disputed question of the use of the rattle of the rattlesnake. This reptile is really both sluggish and timid, and is very easily captured by those who know its habits. If gently tapped on the head with a stick, it will coil itself up and lie still, only raising its tail and rattling. It may then be easily caught. This shows that the rattle is a warning to its enemies that it is dangerous to proceed to extremities; and the creature has probably acquired this structure and habit because it frequents open or rocky districts where protective colour is needful to save it from being pounced upon by buzzards or other snake-eaters. Quite parallel in function is the expanded hood of the Indian cobra, a poisonous snake which belongs also to the <b>Elapidae.</b> This is, no doubt, a warning to its foes, not an attempt to terrify its prey; and the hood has been acquired, {{as in the case of}} the rattlesnake, because, protective coloration being on the whole useful, some mark was required to distinguish it from other protectively coloured, but harmless, snakes. Both these species feed on active creatures capable of escaping if their enemy were visible at a moderate distance.|$|E
