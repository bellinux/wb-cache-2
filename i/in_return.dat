40|$|Using micro data {{on women}} in the Czech Republic, we compare returns to various {{measures}} of human capital {{at the end of}} communism (1989), in mid-transition (1996) and in late/posttransition (2002). We show: dramatic increases <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> to education from 1989 to 1996 but no change from 1996 to 2002; no differences <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> to education by state vs. privatelyowned firms; ?sheepskin? effects in both regimes, which rise over time and are similar across firm ownership; no difference <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> to education obtained during communism vs. transition; no change in wage-experience profiles over time; and similar increases <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> to education for women and men. In sum, markets pay women and men equally more for their human capital than the planners did; all the adjustment occurred in early transition and was driven by market forces rather than private ownership...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} the Luxembourg Income Study to explore the role of {{differences}} in supply shifts in explaining cross-national differences in the rise in earnings inequality. Changes <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> to age and education are estimated for eight countries using a common specification of earnings functions across years and countries. It is found that the small overall increase in earnings inequality in many countries reflects large but offsetting changes <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> to skill and changes in inequality within age education cells. Furthermore, these differences <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> to skill can largely be explained by differences in supply shifts...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} studies the long memory behavior of daily returns of Chinese Yuan (CNY), Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and Taiwanese Dollar (TWD). Fractionally integrated models, ARFIMA and FIGARCH, {{were used to}} investigate the long memory property <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> and volatility, respectively. The results reveal that CNY and TWD exhibit long memory property <b>in</b> <b>returns.</b> All the three currencies exhibit long memory in volatility. The study further investigates the long memory dynamics <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> and volatility simultaneously using joint ARFIMA-FIGARCH model. The results indicate that there exists dual long memory in CNY and IDR which is better captured by ARFIMA-FIGARCH model under the assumption of skewed student-t distribution. The presence of long memory <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> of CNY and TWD implies that their behavior is predictable and hence, refutes the efficient market hypothesis. Likewise, the evidence of long memory in volatility reveals uncertainty or risk {{in the behavior of}} two exchange rates...|$|R

40|$|We assess empirically {{the changes}} <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> to {{education}} at the subnational level in Uganda using the Uganda National Household Surveys for 2002 / 2003 and 2005 / 2006. Our results indicate that average returns to schooling tended to converge across regions in the last decade. The overall trend <b>in</b> convergence of <b>returns</b> to schooling took place {{at all levels of}} educational attainment and this behaviour <b>in</b> <b>returns</b> to education is mostly driven by the dynamics of <b>returns</b> to schooling <b>in</b> urban areas.
