5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an {{inflammatory}} lung disease of unknown cause.

DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially.

Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used <b>in</b> <b>gas</b> pipelines. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel.

Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E
