500|$|Performance Car {{reviewer}} John Barker {{was also}} {{impressed with the}} performance {{as well as the}} ride and stability of the car, writing [...] "The V6 has a rumbly, loping note which, in league with a remarkably supple ride, belies the speed we are travelling at. <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> to the speedo and have trouble believing that it is indicating 170 mph." [...] Barker was also impressed with the engineering, saying [...] "this car is catalysed, fully homologated and has passed the same tests that a Volvo needs before going on sale," [...] going on to discuss how the vehicle looked at home on the racetrack thanks to the design. Autocars verdict was [...] "Right now, the XJ220 gives us a standard by which all other fast cars can be compared. For the few who will actually own and, hopefully, use their XJ220s, {{the fact that they are}} in command of the most accomplished supercar ever made should suffice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The poem centres {{around three}} characters: {{a man and}} a woman, both {{otherwise}} unidentified, and the speaker. [...] The first stanza of the poem describes Sappho watching [...] "that man" [...] sitting by a woman, apparently Sappho's beloved. [...] The next three stanzas describe the symptoms the narrator experiences [...] "whenever <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at you for a second". [...] The final surviving line, 17, has been thought to {{be the beginning of a}} stanza describing Sappho reconciling herself to the situation in which she found herself. [...] Armand D'Angour argues that the phrase [...] "αλλα παν τολματον" [...] means [...] "all must be dared", rather than [...] "endured" [...] as it is sometimes translated. [...] In this reading, the change of tone in the poem is towards a more hopeful, rather than resigned, position.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at Mabane. His {{confirmation}} {{was swift}} and decisive.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at Lady Angela. She {{was looking}} white and troubled.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards the}} ballroom, but my {{companion}} shook his head.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glance</b> back to {{discover}} the landlord and a gracefully robed woman standing outside the pretty simplicity of the Utopian inn, watching us doubtfully as we recede.|$|E
6000|$|He sits not a dozen yards away. If <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> over my {{shoulder}} I can see him. And if I catch his eye--and usually I catch his eye--it meets me with an expression---- ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>glance</b> {{like the}} {{wildfire}} through country and town; [...] I'm {{seen on the}} causeway--I'm seen on the down; [...] The lightning that flashes so bright and so free, [...] Is scarcely so blithe or so bonny as me." ...|$|E
60|$|He hesitated. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards his}} companion, {{and he had}} no alternative.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at Sir Henry. He, too, had {{coloured}} {{up to the}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at {{the latter}} deferentially {{as he stood}} looking out of window.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} here, is {{modestly}} brooding behind a damp apron pendent from a clothes-line. As <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at him I become--but I don't know why--vaguely reminded of Woolwich, Chatham, Portsmouth, and Dover. When we get out, my respected fellow-constable Sharpeye, addressing Mr. Superintendent, says: ...|$|E
6000|$|How solemn, as one by one, As {{the ranks}} returning, all worn and sweaty--as the men file by where I [...] stand; As the faces, the masks appear--as <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at the faces, {{studying}} the [...] masks; As <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> upward {{out of this}} page, studying you, dear friend, whoever you [...] are;-- How solemn the thought of my whispering soul, to each in the ranks, and to [...] you! I see, behind each mask, that wonder, a kindred soul. O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend, Nor the bayonet stab what you really are. --The soul, yourself, I see, great as any, good as the best, Waiting secure and content,--which the bullet could never kill, Nor the bayonet stab, O friend! ...|$|E
6000|$|He sits {{at one of}} {{the little}} club tables in the huge bay by the fire, stuffing. What is he stuffing? <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> judiciously and catch him biting at a round of hot buttered tea-cake, with his eyes on me. Confound him!--with his eyes on me! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{across at}} the girl. She was {{watching}} her uncle with distressed face.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{around the}} room. We were {{absolutely}} alone, but I dropped my voice.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> up. He was strolling leisurely {{along the}} poop {{on the port}} side.|$|R
6000|$|How solemn as one by one, [...] As {{the ranks}} {{returning}} worn and sweaty, {{as the men}} file by where I [...] stand, [...] As the faces the masks appear, as <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at the faces studying the [...] masks [...] (As <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> upward out of this page studying you, dear friend, [...] whoever you are), [...] How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks, [...] and to you! [...] I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul, [...] O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend, [...] Nor the bayonet stab what you really are; [...] The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best, [...] Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never kill, [...] Nor the bayonet stab O friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> {{back over}} the dreary waste of ages, I see many a glimmering and mark that is {{familiar}} to my memory. And oh, the leagues I have travelled! the things I have seen! the events I have helped to emphasise! I was at the assassination of Caesar. I marched upon Mecca with Mahomet. I was in the Crusades, and stood with Godfrey when he planted the banner of the cross on the battlements of Jerusalem. I--" ...|$|E
60|$|I brush ahead heedlessly, {{knowing that}} caution here only wastes time, {{and study the}} fresh trail where the quarry jumped away in alarm. Straight down the wind it goes. Cunning old buck! He {{has no idea what}} Bluejay's alarm was about, but a warning, whether of crow or jay or tainted wind or {{snapping}} twig, is never lost on the wood folk. Now as he bounds along, cleaving the woods like a living bolt, yet stopping short every hundred yards or so to whirl and listen and sort the messages that the wood wires bring to him, he is perfectly sure of himself and his little flock, knowing that if danger follow down wind, his own nose will tell him all about it. <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at the sun; only another hour of light, and I am six miles from home. <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at the jay, flitting about restlessly in a mixture of mischief and curiosity, whistling his too-loo-loo loudly as a sign to the fleeing game that I am right here and that he sees me. Then I take up the back trail, planning another day.|$|E
60|$|The vulture wheeled and sank, sank and wheeled. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards the}} Boers, {{and saw that}} they were all of them on their knees. <b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> towards the Zulus, and {{saw that they were}} {{watching}} as, I think, they had never watched anything before, for to them this was a new excitement. Then I fixed my eyes upon the bird.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{around at}} the little army of {{servants}} moving noiselessly about on all sides.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at him, {{surprised}} at the question. He {{was staring at the}} English shore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellenza, now that, {{following}} your keener eye, <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> upon {{the face of}} Una, I do, indeed perceive some little variance. But look all round the bell, {{and you will find}} no two faces entirely correspond. Because there is a law in art--but the cold wind is rising more; these lattices are but a poor defense. Suffer me, magnificoes, to conduct you, at least, partly on your way. Those in whose well-being there is a public stake, should be heedfully attended." ...|$|E
60|$|It is so very {{difficult}} to know, by any exercise of common sense, what turn or height the political excitement may take next, and it may so easily, and so soon, swallow up all other things, that I think I shall suppress my next week's readings here (by good fortune not yet announced) and watch the course of events. Dolby's sudden desponding under these circumstances is so acute, that it is actually swelling his head as <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> {{at him in the}} glass while writing.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so I might," [...] replied Oberon. [...] "But {{the devil}} of the {{business}} is this. These people have put me so out of conceit with the tales, that I loathe {{the very thought of}} them, and actually experience a physical sickness of the stomach, whenever <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at them on the table. I tell you there is a demon in them! I anticipate a wild enjoyment in seeing them in the blaze; such as I should feel in taking vengeance on an enemy, or destroying something noxious." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at {{the figure}} of our {{commander}} in the boat ahead, and took courage.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{out of the}} window. For {{many reasons}} I {{did not wish to}} prolong this interview.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> {{towards the}} bed. Guest was sleeping, or feigning sleep. My companion's eyes {{followed}} mine sympathetically.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course Chickerel is Chickerel,' Mr. Doncastle rejoined. 'We {{all know}} what that means. And really, on reflecting, I do {{remember}} that he is of a literary turn of mind--not further by an inch than is commendable, you know. I am quite aware as <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> down the papers and prints any morning that Chickerel's eyes have been over the ground before mine, and that he generally forestalls {{the rest of us}} by a chapter or so in the last new book sent home; but in these vicious days that particular weakness is really virtue, just because it is not quite a vice.' ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> {{across my}} table, I am {{somewhat}} {{distracted by the}} spectacle of a venerable head whose crown occasionally appears beyond, at about its level. The apparition of a very small hand--whose fingers are bunchy and have the appearance of being slightly webbed--which is frequently lifted above the table in a vain and impotent attempt to reach the inkstand, always affects me as a novelty at each recurrence of the phenomenon. Yet both the venerable head and bunchy fingers belong to an individual with whom I am familiar, and to whom, for certain reasons hereafter described, I choose to apply the epithet written above this article.|$|E
6000|$|Tu-Kila-Kila {{smiled a}} hateful and ominous smile. [...] "I am a great god," [...] he said, calmly, {{striking}} an attitude {{as was his}} wont. [...] "Hear how my people clap their hands in my honor! I order all things. I dispose the course of nature in heaven and earth. If I look at a cocoa-nut tree, it dies; if <b>I</b> <b>glance</b> at a bread-fruit, it withers away. We will see before long {{whether or not you}} are afraid of me. Meanwhile, O Korong, I have come to claim my dues at your hands. Prepare for your fate. To-morrow the Queen of the Clouds must be sealed my bride. Fetch her out, that I may speak with her. I have come to tell her so." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> appealingly at the judge. He was adamant. 'Answer as counsel directs you, witness,' he said, sternly.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at Major Colfax, but for {{the life}} of me I could make nothing of his look.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>glanced</b> at {{the paper}} with open pleasure, but the other checked me as I began to speak.|$|R
