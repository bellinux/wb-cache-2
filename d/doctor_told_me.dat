500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Sanz {{suffered}} a mental breakdown and took two months off {{in the middle of}} a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel. He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. So I had to pay. A <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely." [...] Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which [...] "helped [...] a lot" [...] and gave him [...] "more power" [...] to perform.|$|E
500|$|Lody {{began an}} {{apprenticeship}} at {{a grocery store}} in Halle in 1891, before moving to Hamburg two years later to join {{the crew of the}} sailing ship Sirius as a cabin boy. He studied at the maritime academy in Geestemünde, qualifying as a helmsman, and immediately afterwards served with the Imperial German Navy for a year between 1900 and 1901. Subsequently joining the First Naval Reserve, he enlisted as an officer on German merchant ships. In 1904 he returned to Geestemünde, where he successfully obtained a captain's licence.

[...] An operation was required, which weakened his left arm and his eyesight. As Lody put it, [...] "Consequently, my career as a seaman was closed as soon as I discovered that, and my <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I could not go any further." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{has also}} {{reported}} having high cholesterol and other chronic health issues. [...] "People don't believe that I have high cholesterol, but it's a fact," [...] said Spitz. [...] "I take medication every day because my <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that {{diet and exercise}} are not enough to keep my cholesterol down." [...] He is a paid spokesperson for Medco, a pharmacy benefit management company.|$|E
30|$|I don’t believe I slept {{more than}} {{three or four hours}} a night. <b>Doctors</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> my blood {{pressure}} was too high and they would put me on medication (Joanna).|$|R
5000|$|Buslov's {{father was}} an engineer, {{and his mother was}} a housewife. He had two siblings: a brother, Dmitri, and a sister, Anastasia. Anton Buslov married {{for the first time in}} 2005, but {{divorced}} in 2009. His second marriage was in 2012: [...] "When I proposed to my girlfriend, it was not after I was diagnosed with cancer, but right after the <b>doctors</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I have only a year or half a year left".|$|R
60|$|MISS GILPIN (hurriedly). How do you do, Mr. Murray. <b>Doctor</b> Stanton just <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{you were}} here.|$|R
2500|$|That injury did {{not have}} him cancel any shows, as saying [...] "He (the <b>doctor)</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it's going to hurt – though nothing could hurt worse than Saturday, I don't think – and they can give me {{something}} to deaden the pain when I get out there. I also {{have to have a}} doctor standing by should something give, but I'm going to tape it up, and I'm going to get out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In this tent live Mrs B's five {{children}} (three quite grown up) {{and a little}} Kaffir servant girl. Many tents have more occupants. Mrs M. ...has six children in camp, all ill, two in the tin hospital with typhoid, and four sick in the tent. A terrible evil just now is the dew. It is so heavy, and comes through the single canvas of the tents, wetting everything… All the morning the gangways are filled with the blankets and odds and ends, regularly turned out to dry in the sun. The <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> today he highly disapproved of tents for young children, and expected a high mortality before June.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's heart, sir," [...] the man acknowledged. [...] "The <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I might snuff out at any moment. I can't live, anyway, {{for more}} than a year. I've got a little girl." ...|$|E
5000|$|On July 13, 1989, a {{motorcycle}} accident significantly changed Evans' life. He was thrown from a bike {{when he hit}} a ditch from a construction project near his home. He was paralyzed from the chest down. [...] "When the <b>doctors</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> my spinal cord had been severed, it was my worst nightmare come true," [...] says Evans. [...] "But I decided then and there, I {{was not going to}} give up." [...] He saw no reason why not being able to walk should stop him from doing what he loved.|$|R
5000|$|I am {{thinking}} I {{may have an}} obsession about this water. The <b>doctor</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I am dehydrated; there's not enough water in my body. He suggested I should drink 2-3 liters of water every day. Mineral water or tea! ...|$|R
5000|$|When she {{was twenty}} years old, Marcel was {{diagnosed}} with endometriosis, {{and it was also}} discovered that she had a blood clotting disorder: [...] "I was bleeding for about four months then I passed out in the shower and had to be rushed to hospital for an emergency blood transfusion. The <b>doctors</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I'd almost bled to death and further tests revealed I had a blood clotting problem, the female form of haemophilia." [...] Six years later she suffered further problems when she developed the rare condition Behcet's disease, an inflammatory disease in which the white blood cells attack healthy cells.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you like}} to see a clergyman? I dont want to alarm you: I am sure you will get better: the <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so; but I will go for one if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're all wrong, shipmates," [...] said Fred Borders. [...] "That young <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that if they'd begun {{work at the}} day of {{creation}} they would only have just finished the job last year!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest, I {{am going}} away, to die. It cannot be long now. The <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to-day. That was why I couldn't speak or {{explain it to}} you and was so strange at supper. But I am glad now. Good-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, at any rate, <b>doctor,</b> Glover <b>told</b> <b>me</b> half an {{hour ago}} of a piece of luck in which none of us here can share. He is engaged to that very pretty French girl whom he is always calling on when we are in port." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, indeed," [...] Malcolm replied. [...] "It will of {{all things}} be the most pleasant; the <b>doctor</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I shall not be fit for duty until the spring, and I have been {{wondering}} how ever I {{should be able to}} pass the time until then." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 10 January 2013 Neeson {{revealed}} {{that he had been}} diagnosed with a brain tumour and would undergo immediate treatment. At a benefit concert, Rock for Doc, in April Neeson told the audience, [...] "The news is grim. But some people can actually get right through and that's the way I'm trying to think about things. So I'm looking forward optimistically to the future... And I've been sick with a brain tumour, and my <b>doctors</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not to come out tonight. But the show goes on!" [...] He performed two songs; other artists at the Enmore Theatre were members of Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo, Noiseworks, Cold Chisel, Dragon and Mi-Sex.

6000|$|... "No; I like it. I never smoked {{till after}} I got that hurt from the dog, but {{not being able}} to do things like other fellows, I took to smoking. I like it, and the <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that it was a capital {{preventive}} against fever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Several things," [...] was the answer, as Halliday, {{shaking the}} snow from his furs, {{dismounted}} stiffly. [...] "Strain of overwork necessitated a change, my <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> Trust estate I'm winding up comprised doubtful British Columbian mining interests, and last, but not least, to see you, Geoffrey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, O'Grady, {{it is very}} bad for {{anything}} like a wound. The <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> when I was chatting with him before dinner, that he really {{did not think that}} you could go, for you would not obey his orders to give up spirits altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|CURTIS--[With a sobbing groan.] Oh, I know, I know! [After a pause.] She {{read it in}} my eyes. Yes, it's horrible, {{but when}} I saw her there {{suffering}} so frightfully--I couldn't {{keep it out of}} my eyes. I tried to force it back--for her sake--but I couldn't. I was holding her hands and her eyes searched mine with such a longing question in them--and she read only my hatred there, not my love for her. And she screamed and seemed to try to push me away. I wanted to kneel down and pray for forgiveness--to tell her it was only my love for her--that I couldn't help it. And then the <b>doctors</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to leave--and now the door is locked against me--[He sobs.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm too rotten with fever," [...] {{the mate}} grumbled. [...] "I'd die if I left. Remember, I tried it two years ago. It takes {{the cold weather}} {{to bring out the}} fever. I arrived in Sydney on my back. They had to take me to {{hospital}} in an ambulance. I got worse and worse. The <b>doctors</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the only thing to do was to head back where I got the fever. If I did I might live a long time. If I hung on in Sydney it meant a quick finish. They packed me on board in another ambulance. And that's all I saw of Australia for my holiday. I don't want to stay in the Solomons. It's plain hell. But I got to, or croak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you mean, Mr. Bathurst; the <b>Doctor</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about that too. You may wish that you had {{remained}} in the boat, but it was well for me that you did not. You would have lost your life without benefiting me. I should be now in the well of Cawnpore, or worse, at Bithoor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, lad, I cannot {{say that}} I do, though when the <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> your name it seemed {{familiar}} to me. Very likely I should have recognised you if I had met you a week since, but, you see, {{we are both}} altered a good deal from the effect of our wounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} meet him for any earthly consideration. After what the <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to-day, I should throw {{myself out of}} the window, I think, if I heard him coming upstairs. I should like to see him, if I were placed where {{he could not see}} me; but face him I could not." ...|$|E
6000|$|A fox? [...] Five foxes {{rolled in}} one a [...] pony's weight and size, [...] A rampin', ragin' devil, all fangs and [...] 'air and eyes; [34] Too scared to speak, with shriek on shriek, [...] Brown galloped from the sight [...] With just one thought within 'is mind &mdash; [...] "The <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{watching}} us, O king," [...] whispered Busuli. [...] "They are waiting {{until they have}} led us into the innermost recesses of their stronghold, {{and then they will}} fall upon us and tear us to pieces with their teeth. That is the way with spirits. My mother's uncle, who is a great witch <b>doctor,</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all about it many times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not me, sir!" [...] {{protested the}} boy, in haste. [...] "I'm very ignorant about--about health, and {{medicine}} and the like. But in New York I consulted a famous <b>doctor,</b> and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was, <b>doctor.</b> My uncle <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he {{was going}} to dine with him, and Dr. Pearson {{mentioned}} to me {{that he was}} next to the General and caught him as he fell from his chair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I got {{my first}} glimpse into the real state of affairs in that house," [...] the <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> one night on the brae, [...] "the day before she died 'You're sure there's no hope for me?' she asked wistfully, and when I had {{to tell the truth}} she sank back on the pillow with a look of joy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't seen Ruth," [...] Hiram said; [...] "the <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> {{as he came}} down, as she {{was quite}} upset with the sight, {{and that it would}} be no good my going up to see her, as she would have to keep still all day. So I can't see farther into it than another; but surely it must be some stranger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} need worry about him," [...] he said to Chris; [...] "the <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that in a {{fortnight}} he would be very likely to be about again, and none the worse for the wound, the bullet having evidently missed any vital point, in which case its passage would heal {{as quickly as the}} little wounds where the bullet enters and passes out usually do." ...|$|E
3000|$|... “I {{have a lot}} of problems. I {{sometimes}} {{consider myself}} unlucky and feel hopeless. Do you know why? I am a widow, jobless and mother of five. The family is financially dependent on two of my sons, who are shoe shiners. I used to bake injera for hotels. One day, while I was in the kitchen baking injera I collapsed. I was then rushed to a local health center which later sent me to a government hospital. The <b>doctors</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I have anemia. I became bedridden…. One thing I need to tell you is that I couldn’t afford the price for medication. However, I was fortunate that I had a very sympathetic fellow member whose relative owns a pharmacy. She told him all my problems, and he provided me the prescribed tablets for free”.|$|R
6000|$|It was an {{hour before}} the Count {{returned}} to the nursery. [...] "Ah, my friend," [...] he said, [...] "what happiness have you brought to us. Already my wife is a new creature. I had begun to think that I should lose her too, for the <b>doctors</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> frankly that they feared she would fall into a decline. Now her joy is so great that it was with difficulty that I could tear myself away from contemplating her happiness, but the doctor came in and recommended that she should try and sleep for a time, or if she could not sleep that she should at least lie absolutely quiet, so Stephanie has nestled down by her side, and I was able to come to you." [...] He now led the way to a luxuriously furnished smoking-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] George rejoined in an {{authoritative}} voice. [...] "I'm your elder brother and it's {{my duty to}} see {{you do what you}} ought. To begin with, I looked up your <b>doctor</b> and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you needed a long rest." ...|$|R
