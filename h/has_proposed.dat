30|$|Thus far, {{many types}} of DCS <b>have</b> been <b>proposed.</b> Brooks <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> SA (Subsumption Architecture) [7]. Recently, SA is used as typical DCS.

In DAMN, an arbiter performs command fusion and selects an action which best satisfies the prioritized goals of the system by voting. Morales et al. <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> SSM (Sensor Sharing Manager) [9]. In SSM, many processes run in parallel such as localization, obstacle detection, and navigation.

This task force <b>has</b> <b>proposed</b> the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system.

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species's southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and Hume <b>has</b> <b>proposed</b> that this {{may also be the}} case for all the parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands.|$|E
