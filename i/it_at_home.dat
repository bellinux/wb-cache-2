5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the original iPhone, iTunes can activate an iPhone through their mobile carrier. The original plan for the iPhone 3G was to have the carrier authenticate it at the point of sale, either through iTunes or through the carrier's own activation interface. However, a worldwide crash of iTunes' authentication servers on July 11, 2008, the day that the iPhone 3G was released, caused major issues. In some cases, AT and Apple Store employees told iPhone buyers to attempt to activate <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> Also affected were original iPhone users attempting to upgrade to the 2.0 firmware. UK Apple, O2 and Carphone Warehouse stores were further impacted, as carrier O2's contract processing servers (known as Gateway) could not handle the number of new contracts and upgrades happening on launch day. Some stores reverted to hand written contracts, while others held stock. With the launch of the iPhone 3GS on June 19, 2009, iTunes at home activation was available for people purchasing their iPhone from AT Mobility and Apple. This allowed them to activate their new iPhone 3G/iPhone 3GS at home when they arrived.|$|E
25|$|On 23 December 2009 PSV Eindhoven {{decided to}} loan out Reimond Manco until June to Peruvian club Juan Aurich. Juan Aurich {{had the chance}} to play the Copa Libertadores, the {{equivalent}} of the UEFA Champions League in South America, which would give Manco some high-calibre matches, but first they would have to get through the first round against Mexican side Estudiantes Tecos. In Juan Aurich's only pre-season friendly Manco came on in the 32nd minute for injured winger William Chiroque. The first leg of the Copa Libertadores tie was in Juan Aurich's homeground, Chiclayo, where the Peruvians won 2–0 in a dominating game where Manco showcased his great skill and destroyed the struggling Mexican team's defense. Estudiantes Tecos, on a five-game losing streak, firmly believed they could win <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and qualify to the second round, setting up the first goal on the 43rd minute, after beating two defenders on the right flank and crossing perfectly to Luis Tejeda's head, who had also scored the two goals in Peru. Defender Wily Rivas received a red card in the 64th minute and Estudiantes began to press the Peruvians, who tried to hold their ground in defense. The Mexican side came back to score a goal but it was not nearly enough and Juan Aurich entered the group stage of the Libertadores by defeating Estudiantes Tecos 4–1 on aggregate. On 17 March 2010 Reimond Manco was chosen as Man of the Match in a 4–2 Copa Libertadores win over as of then undefeated group leaders Alianza Lima, where he provided an assist and scored a goal.|$|E

Park specifically practiced wushu for the role, as well as studying the character's comic book poses. Park was already familiar with the character, but knew very little of the surrounding saga of G.I. Joe versus Cobra, so he read the comics to further understand the character. He was nervous about wearing the mask, which covered his entire head quite tightly, so he requested to practice wearing <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> He found the full costume, including the visor, very heavy to wear and akin to a rubber band; he had to put effort into moving in it.|$|E
500|$|Douglas Rankine of Wired UK and McKinley Noble of GamePro thought {{previously}} existing Nintendo DS {{games were}} revitalized with the Nintendo DSi XL's larger screens; games like Scribblenauts and The World Ends with You benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased legibility of text, respectively. CVG's Mike Jackson {{argued that the}} bigger screens, which made its unchanged resolution blockier, would probably be less noticeable to the older demographic for which the XL is undoubtedly designed. However, Jackson and IGN's Scott Lowe and Chris Burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution. Carol Mangis of PC Magazine thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a DSi XL, but the larger screens were not enough of an incentive for current DSi owners to upgrade. Lowe, Burke, Jackson, and Bakalar concluded the larger DSi model is not an essential upgrade; Jackson explained [...] "if you tend not {{to carry it out}} with you, and only ever tend to use <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> then the DSi XL is the better choice".|$|E

500|$|Sébastien Mitton, {{who acted}} as art {{director}} {{on the first}} game, returned to the position for Dishonored 2. Viktor Antonov, who also helped conceive of Dishonoreds [...] "painterly" [...] look, had moved on as a general creative consultant for Bethesda and thus was less involved {{in the art of}} Dishonored 2. Arkane drew on paintings and sculptures for the art design, and had Lucie Minne mold several clay busts. The game begins and ends in the city of Dunwall, the setting of the first game, with most of the game taking place in Karnaca, [...] "the jewel of the south". The change in setting in part was out of a desire to show another corner of the series' Empire. On using both settings, Harvey Smith commented that Arkane felt [...] "we need to start <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> ... and then venture out into an exotic place and come back". Mitton wanted Dishonored 2 to be a visual [...] "journey to a new city", though keeping the same sensibility of the first game and elements like oppression, disease, magic, and decay.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound.

[...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E
500|$|Fergie's fledglings began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month – with a rout. Sheringham, Cole and Solskjær all scored twice each at home to Sheffield Wednesday, in a game that they could have scored so many more. David Pleat managed to get sympathy from Ferguson who admitted [...] "every shot United had in the first half went in" [...] but not from the board, cumulating in his sacking the following Monday. The talk of a one-horse race for the Premiership was put on hold after defeat to Arsenal at Highbury. The psychological impact of United opening up a seven-point lead had they won would have been too much ground {{to make up for the}} challengers. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger admitted before the game that defeat would make it [...] "difficult for them" [...] to catch up on United's ground but not [...] "impossible". The Gunners put themselves in front with Nicolas Anelka's first goal for the club and Patrick Vieira's swooping shot which left Schmeichel rattled. Sheringham's admirable brace just before half time left the match finely poised but former United trainee David Platt headed into the far corner with seven minutes left. Thumping Wimbledon courtesy of a Beckham brace and goals from Cole, Scholes and Butt was the perfect response after their second defeat of the season and United bettered <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> to Blackburn Rovers, the only team with an unbeaten away record. A 4–0 win ensured distance between themselves and the challengers, popping the question as to which team was capable of stopping them. The Red Devils managed to score 30 goals in the last nine fixtures prior to this game and qualification to the quarter finals of the Champions League meant that they could prolong their rich domestic goal-scoring form. Ferguson understandably quashed any sort of hype, but admitted that they were in an [...] "ideal position", in comparison to the same point in the last season.|$|E
