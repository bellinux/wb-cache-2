40|$|Objectives-This study {{adopted a}} {{concurrent}} task design and aimed {{to quantify the}} efficiency and smoothness of voluntary movement in Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> via {{the use of a}} graphics tablet which permits analysis of movement profiles. In particular, the aim was to ascertain whether a concurrent task (digit span) would affect the kinematics of goal directed movements, and whether patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> would exhibit abnormal functional asymmetries compared with their matched controls. Methods-Twelve patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and their matched controls performed 12 vertical zig zag movements, with both left and right hands (with and without the concurrent task), to large or small targets over long or short extents. Results-With short strokes, controls showed the predicted right hand superiority in movement time more strongly than patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> who instead showed greater hand symmetry with short strokes. The right hand of controls was less force efficient with long strokes and more force efficient with short strokes, whereas either hand of patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> was equally force efficient, irrespective of stroke length, with an overall performance profile similar to but better than that of the controls 2 ̆ 7 left hand. The concurrent task, however, increased the force efficiency of the right hand in patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the left hand in controls. Conclusions-Patients with Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> compared with controls, were not impaired in the performance of fast, goal directed movements such as aiming at targets; they performed in certain respects better than controls. The findings clearly add to the growing literature on anomalous lateralisation in Tourette 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which may be explained by the recently reported loss of normal basal ganglia asymmetries in that disorder...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{investigation}} {{has focused on}} the nature of adult-child verbal interactions. The research has examined the language of mothers and other adults when assembled with both normal and retarded children. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that mothers of children with Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> and mothers of normal children would present different language characteristics to a Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> child versus a normal child. Type-token ratio, a measure of the subject 2 ̆ 7 s language diversification, was used as the behavioral measure. The findings indicated that all mothers presented smaller type token ratios to the Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> child than those addressed to the normal child. The results were statistically significant at the. 0005 level of confidence on a one-tailed test. No significant differences in type-token ratio were found between groups of mothers of Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> children and mothers of normal children in speeches addressed to the Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Syndrome</b> child or to the normal child.

40|$|Intellectual {{impairment}} is {{a strongly}} disabling feature of Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a genetic disorder of high prevalence (1 in 700 - 1000 live births) caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. Accumulating {{evidence shows that}} widespread neurogenesis impairment is {{a major determinant of}} abnormal brain development and, hence, of intellectual disability in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This defect is worsened by dendritic hypotrophy and connectivity alterations. Most of the pharmacotherapies designed to improve cognitive performance in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> have been attempted in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> mouse models during adult life stages. Yet, as neurogenesis is mainly a prenatal event, treatments aimed at correcting neurogenesis failure in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> should be administered during pregnancy. Correction of neurogenesis during the very first stages of brain formation may, in turn, rescue improper brain wiring. The aim of our study was to establish whether it is possible to rescue the neurodevelopmental alterations that characterize the trisomic brain with a prenatal pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine, a drug that is able to restore post-natal hippocampal neurogenesis in the Ts 65 Dn mouse model of Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Pregnant Ts 65 Dn females were treated with fluoxetine from embryonic Day 10 until delivery. On post-natal Day 2 the pups received an injection of 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine and were sacrificed after either 2 h or after 43 days (at the age of 45 days). Untreated 2 -day-old Ts 65 Dn mice exhibited a severe neurogenesis reduction and hypocellularity throughout the forebrain (subventricular zone, subgranular zone, neocortex, striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus), midbrain (mesencephalon) and hindbrain (cerebellum and pons). In embryonically treated 2 -day-old Ts 65 Dn mice, precursor proliferation and cellularity were fully restored throughout all brain regions. The recovery of proliferation potency and cellularity was still present in treated Ts 65 Dn 45 -day-old mice. Moreover, embryonic treatment restored dendritic development, cortical and hippocampal synapse development and brain volume. Importantly, these effects were accompanied by recovery of behavioural performance. The cognitive deficits caused by Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> have long been considered irreversible. The current study provides novel evidence that a pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine during embryonic development is able to fully rescue the abnormal brain development and behavioural deficits that are typical of Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> If the positive effects of fluoxetine on the brain of a mouse model are replicated in foetuses with Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> fluoxetine, a drug usable in humans, may represent a breakthrough for the therapy of intellectual disability in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
40|$|Gardner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant disease presenting multiple colonic polyps with a predisposition for malignant change. In addition to colonic polyp formation by early adolescence, extracolonic lesions appear often prior to polyp formation. One theoretical {{mechanism for the}} origin of polyps and malignancies in Gardner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a genetic defect in the natural killer cell activity of patients with this disease. Natural killer cells are a of lymphocytes that spontaneously lyse tumor cells subpopulation and virally transformed cells.

However, serum pyridoxal phosphate concentrations were significantly (p less than 0. 05) increased in subjects with Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome</b> receiving the supplement compared with subjects with nonspecific diagnoses receiving the same treatment thus providing further evidence of abnormal vitamin B 6 metabolism in Down 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
