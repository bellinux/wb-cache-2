5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow (Zavattariornis stresemanni), {{also known}} as Abyssinian pie, bush crow, Ethiopian bushcrow, or by its generic name Zavattariornis, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> starling-like bird, which is {{currently}} thought to be member of the crow family, Corvidae, though this is uncertain. It is slightly larger than the North American blue jay and is a bluish-grey in overall colour which becomes almost white on the forehead. The throat and chest are creamy-white with the tail and wings a glossy black. The black feathers {{have a tendency to}} bleach to brown at their tips. The iris of the bird is brown and the eye is surrounded by a band of naked bright blue skin. The bill, legs, and feet are black.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε ring is not precisely known, although the ring is certainly very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed. Namely, {{it is necessary that}} these functions decrease sufficiently rapidly to zero (in the neighborhood of infinity) in order to ensure the existence of the Fourier integral. For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E

5|$|Silver <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> unreactive metal. This {{is because}} its filled 4d shell {{is not very}} {{effective}} in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is {{near the bottom of}} the electrochemical series (E0(Ag+/Ag) = +0.799V). In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionization energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilize. Unlike copper, for which the larger hydration energy of Cu2+ as compared to Cu+ is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, silver is large enough that this factor has a much smaller effect, and furthermore the second ionisation energy of silver is greater than that for copper. Hence, Ag+ is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag2+ being much less stable as it oxidizes water.|$|E

25|$|Patellifolia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> old genus; the {{divergence}} {{from its}} sister genus Beta probably occurred {{early in the}} Late Oligocene. Its subtaxa are relatively young, diversifying in the late Pliocene or early Quaternary. The present distribution area suggests that it was previously a widespread taxon, but later the area fragmented and extensive extinctions occurred.|$|E

25|$|Labyrinth of Reflections, a book heavily {{based on}} various {{internet}} subcultures and cyberpunk mythos, is another product of this period. Although Labyrinth is often labeled as cyberpunk, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> straight romance story, hardly meeting Dozois criterion, and, {{more to the}} fact, was written when the author did not even have an Internet connection; all his internet knowledge was limited to FIDONet membership.|$|E
25|$|D. radiodurans <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> large, spherical bacterium, with a {{diameter}} of 1.5 to 3.5 µm. Four cells normally stick together, forming a tetrad. The bacteria are easily cultured and {{do not appear to}} cause disease. Colonies are smooth, convex, and pink to red in color. The cells stain Gram positive, although its cell envelope is unusual and is reminiscent of the cell walls of Gram negative bacteria.|$|E
