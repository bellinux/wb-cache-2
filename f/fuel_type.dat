25|$|Hydrocarbon oil duty, {{commonly}} referred to as 'fuel duty' or 'fuel tax' is an excise duty levied on some fuels used by road vehicles in the United Kingdom. Tax is based on fuel volume, rather than {{as a percentage of the}} selling price. With the exception of gas, rates don't vary by <b>fuel</b> <b>type.</b> Some vehicles including local bus services, some farm and construction vehicles and aviation pay reduced or no fuel duty. A fuel duty rebate is available for Bus transport in the United Kingdom. In May 2008, UK fuel taxes were the highest in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Four {{classification}} algorithms {{have been}} assessed and compared with mapped forest <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> from Terra-ASTER sensor images in a representative area of Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain). A BEHAVE fuel-type map from 2002, together with field data also obtained in 2002 during the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory, {{was used as}} reference data. The BEHAVE <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> of the reference dataset were first converted into the Fire Behaviour <b>Fuel</b> <b>Types</b> described by Scott and Burgan, {{taking into account the}} vegetation of the study area. Then, three pixel-based algorithms (Maximum Likelihood, Neural Network and Support Vector Machine) and an Object-Based Image Analysis were applied to classify the Scott and Burgan fire behaviour <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> from an ASTER image from 3 March 2003. The performance of the algorithms tested was assessed and compared in terms of quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement. Within the pixel-based classifications, the best results were obtained from the Support Vector Machine algorithm, which showed an overall accuracy of 83 %; 14 % of disagreement was due to allocation and 3 % to quantity disagreement. The Object-Based Image Analysis approach produced the most accurate maps, with an overall accuracy of 95 %; 4 % disagreement was due to allocation and 1 % to quantity disagreement. The object-based classification achieved thus an overall accuracy of 12 % above the best results obtained for the pixel-based algorithms tested. The incorporation of context information to the object-based classification allowed better identification of <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> with similar spectra...|$|R

40|$|MBIR is a {{multipurpose}} fast sodium cooled {{research reactor}} with a thermal power of 150 MW {{designed for a}} broad range of applications in the field of experimental research, including endurance tests and optimization of operating modes for advanced <b>types</b> of <b>fuel,</b> fuel elements, absorber elements and fuel assemblies, radiation tests of advanced structural materials, production of isotopes for a variety of applications and so on [1, 2]. Therefore, one of the major requirements to this reactor is a high flux of neutrons (not lower than 5 ⋅ 1015 n/cm 2 s) depending, in turn, on the <b>type</b> of the <b>fuel</b> used. Vibrocompacted MOX fuel with a plutonium weight content of ∼ 38 % has been adopted currently as the standard MBIR fuel. The capabilities offered by the use of alternative highly dense <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> in this reactor appear to be promising for the future large-scale nuclear power. The most attractive <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> for advanced fast reactors are mixed nitride uranium–plutonium fuel and mixed metallic fuel (a three-component uranium-plutonium-zirconium alloy). Studies on the MBIR reactor, involving advanced dense <b>fuel</b> <b>types,</b> have shown that nitride fuel does not make it possible to achieve the required neutron flux value, while metallic fuel provides for the required neutron flux (practically the same as MOX fuel) and a high dpa rate but requires modified temperature conditions of irradiation.

40|$|Biodiversity {{effects on}} {{many aspects of}} {{ecosystem}} function have been well documented. However, fire is an exception: fire experiments have mainly included single species, bulk litter, or vegetation, and, as such, the role of biodiversity as a determinant of flammability, a crucial aspect of ecosystem function, is poorly understood. This study {{is the first to}} experimentally test whether flammability characteristics of two-species mixtures are non-additive, i. e. differ from expected flammability based on the component species in monoculture. In standardized fire experiments on ground fuels, including monocultures and mixtures of five contrasting subarctic plant <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> in a controlled laboratory environment, we measured flame speed, flame duration and maximum temperature. Broadly half of the mixture combinations showed non-additive effects for these flammability indicators; these were mainly enhanced dominance effects, where the <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> with the more flammable value for a characteristic determined the flammability of the whole mixture. The high incidence of species non-additive effects on ground fuel flammability suggest that the combinations of <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> may have important effects on ground fire regimes in vegetations differing or changing in species composition...|$|R
