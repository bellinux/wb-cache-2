5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E
5000|$|On the grasslands, {{a variety}} of {{butterflies}} including chalkhill blues and <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> <b>fritillaries</b> can be seen. Since the site is relatively quiet, common adders and grass snakes can also be found.The grassland is grazed occasionally by a herd of feral goats, which came from the Great Orme, near Colwyn Bay in North Wales.These are used to further encourage the growth of wildflowers.|$|R

25|$|The site is of high entomological interest, with 29 {{varieties}} of resident breeding species of butterfly recorded. The horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) is locally plentiful and supports both the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and the Adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus) butterflies. Other butterfly species {{to be found}} on and around the site include for the Duke of Burgundy (Hamaeris lucina), the grizzled skipper (Pyrgus malvae), the <b>dark</b> <b>green</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis aglaja), and the small blue (Cupido minimus).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion {{is one way}} {{in which}} people, both secular and religious, connect with nature on a spiritual level. Bron Taylor defines <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion as [...] "religion that {{considers}} nature to be sacred, imbued by intrinsic value, and worthy of reverent care" [...] in his book <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. Nature religion is an overarching term of which <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion is a part of. A key part of <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion is the [...] "depth of its consideration of nature." [...] <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion differs from Green Religion. Green Religion claims that it is a religious obligation for humans to be environmental stewards, while <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion is a movement that simply holds nature as valuable and sacred.Spiritual types of <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion include Naturalistic and Supernaturalistic forms of Animism and of Gaianism. The diverse views within <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion are not without the idea that the earth is sacred and worthy of care. The perceptions of <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion are global and flexible. Taylor's use of the word 'Dark' gestures toward these negative possibilities. According to Taylor, <b>Dark</b> <b>Green</b> Religion has the possibility to [...] "inspire the emergence of a global, civic, earth religion." [...] <b>Dark</b> <b>Green,</b> Green and Nature Religions are arguably all a part of ecospirituality. The term ecospirituality is versatile and overarching.|$|R
