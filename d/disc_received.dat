500|$|Of {{the little}} media {{coverage}} received, Saturate garnered positive reception, with Jason Taylor from AllMusic {{stating that the}} album [...] "has serious potential {{to become one of}} 2002's most successful debuts," [...] feeling that [...] "although it is repetitive and generic, it is undeniably addictive", ultimately scoring the album 2.5 out of 5. The <b>disc</b> <b>received</b> a favorable review from Schwegweb's Vin Cherubino, who noted, [...] "The music has just as much quality as any popular artist in the same genre.

[...] About Entertainment gave the record a mixed review, feeling that [...] "Though it lacks the breakthrough singles of Phobia, Dear Agony does have its moments," [...] adding, [...] "frustratingly, Dear Agony never reaches greatness, settling for an admirable competency that's still the envy of many of their contemporaries." ...|$|E

AllMusic's Gregory Heaney felt similarly, saying, [...] "Shallow Bay is a great jumping-on point for new fans, capturing the band at their height delivering some of their best moments in one convenient package. For older fans, this collection may just serve as a reminder of a crucial turning point in Breaking Benjamin's career." ...|$|E

40|$|The normal {{vascular}} {{anatomy of}} the articular disc of 48 antebrachiocarpal joints was studied in 24 dogs (12 puppies and 12 adult animals) using an India ink vascular injection technique. It {{was found that the}} articular <b>disc</b> <b>receives</b> its blood supply mainly from the palmar and dorsal branches of the palmar interosseous artery. Branches of these 2 arteries arborise and give direct peridiscal vessels to the dorsal, proximal and palmar sides of the articular disc. The peridiscal vessels ramify and anastomose with one another to form a cup-shaped terminal peridiscal capillary plexus around the disc which ends at the peripheral parts of the disc in a series of terminal capillary loops. This leaves the major central segment of the disc without blood vessels. The proportion of vascularised to nonvascularised areas of the disc depends upon the age of the animals. In young puppies, the degree of vascular penetration into the disc is quite extensive, while in adult animals it ranges from 15 to 25 % of the discal width; the considerably larger central area of the articular disc is thus avascular...|$|R
