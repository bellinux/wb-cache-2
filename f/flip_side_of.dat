25|$|Reasoning {{efficiency}}. This {{refers to}} the run time efficiency of the system. The ability {{of the knowledge base}} to be updated and the reasoner to develop new inferences in a reasonable period of time. In some ways this is the <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> expressive adequacy. In general the more powerful a representation, the more it has expressive adequacy, the less efficient its automated reasoning engine will be. Efficiency was often an issue, especially for early applications of knowledge representation technology. They were usually implemented in interpreted environments such as Lisp which were slow compared to more traditional platforms of the time.|$|E
25|$|The yard's slow {{work after}} the war was a symptom of having a glut of extra ships that were {{available}} for the United States Merchant Marine. The passage of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 meant that ships could be sold {{for as little as}} $ (equivalent to roughly $ in today's dollars) per deadweight ton. The <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> this glut of ships was that there was a prediction that in 1961, more ships would be need to be constructed. This was evidenced by the fact that in 1954, there were orders for five tankers, one fleet oiler, and five destroyers. The next year, the yard attempted {{to become part of the}} building of the Forrestal-class aircraft carriers when Bethlehem objected to the awarding of the contracts to the Newport News Shipbuilding and the New York Naval Yard. Although the company pointed out that it had produced many carriers during World War II, Newport News pointed out that the company never requested an improvement of its shipbuilding facilities by the government during the war, which hampered its future bidding of aircraft carrier construction. That it had not built a single carrier since the end of the war also hurt its chances. The yard was later rewarded four frigates to build instead.|$|E

Regan elaborated that [...] "she’s never seen anyone like [...] before and she’s never been beaten before. There’s this competitive but playful obsession with her" [...] which is seen with Underwood's [...] "flirtation" [...] and [...] "feminine prowess". Regan continued, [...] "She knows that to be on top she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie does want to get under her skin. She tries to make her feel uncomfortable and that might be with a look or a glance or what she says." [...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the same coin."

2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it in the back of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day."

The <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the record was [...] "Lonesome Road Blues", which also became very popular. In April 1924, [...] "Aunt" [...] Samantha Bumgarner and Eva Davis became the first female musicians to record and release country songs.

Other important early recording artists were Riley Puckett, Don Richardson, Fiddlin' John Carson, Uncle Dave Macon, Al Hopkins, Ernest V. Stoneman, Blind Alfred Reed, Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers and The Skillet Lickers. The steel guitar entered country music as early as 1922, when Jimmie Tarlton met famed Hawaiian guitarist Frank Ferera on the West Coast.|$|E
2500|$|Before Manilow's {{association}} with Bette Midler {{began at the}} Continental Baths in New York City in 1971, he recorded four tracks as Featherbed, leading a group of session musicians produced by Tony Orlando. Three of the tracks—"Morning," [...] a ballad; [...] "Amy," [...] a psychedelic-influenced pop song; and {{an early version of}} his own composition [...] "Could It Be Magic"—all flopped on the charts, a fact for which Manilow himself is fond of saying he is eternally grateful, {{especially in the case of}} the last. That was because the arrangement of [...] "Could It Be Magic" [...] was an uptempo pop tune. Manilow had arranged the tune as a classical piece that slowly built. The fourth tune recorded was [...] "Rosalie Rosie," [...] which was to be the <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Could It Be Magic," [...] but Bell Records went with [...] "Morning" [...] as the flip for Featherbed's second release instead.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the album's {{negative}} reception, several music critics wrote favorably of {{the single}} [...] "Drop the World" [...] and Eminem's verse on the song, viewing it as a highlight on the album. Charles Aaron of Spin commented that [...] "perhaps the greatest musical tantrum of 2010 ... occurs on perhaps the most misbegotten musical pratfall of 2010." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau felt Rebirth was [...] "underrated" [...] {{and gave it a}} two-star honorable mention (...) , indicating a [...] "likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy." [...] He cited [...] "Drop the World" [...] and [...] "American Star" [...] as highlights and quipped, [...] "So smart and scary about death as the <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> ecstasy, so unperceptive and embarrassing about emo". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that its lyrics [...] "stay dutifully on topic" [...] and found [...] "how it reveals a rapper’s view of rock" [...] as interesting, writing [...] "For Lil Wayne rock is bombast and cliché in which high-school traumas are avenged, heaven and hell are frequently invoked and existential predicaments are taken seriously".|$|E
2500|$|Later, Vanita {{condenses}} {{the ideas}} {{in her book}} into an article, [...] "Same-sex Weddings, Hindu Traditions and Modern India". Here, she summarizes specific cases in which women specifically committed joint-suicides, were married and separated, or successfully married. She points out three different [...] "forces that have helped female couples". These are: the law courts, the media, and some Hindu authorities (such as the swamis mentioned earlier in this article) from her book. [...] When female couples can stay together under the social pressures {{and get to the}} courts, the courts generally hold up their decisions, holding {{to the fact that the}} women are consenting adults. While this does not necessarily stop the harassment, it does lend the couple further legitimacy under the laws. In addition, the more successful same-sex marriages of women are those in which the women are financially independent. If they have social support from their families and community—for the most part—then they may be able to live in peace together. The media may also play an important role in same-sex marriages. In drawing attention to their marriages, women who do not necessarily know about LGBT rights groups may be contacted and supported by those groups after media attention. However, the <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> this is that the anti-LGBT groups also may reach out against their marriage.|$|E
2500|$|As percussionist, vocalist, and writer, Conti {{performed}} with a then virtually unknown {{artist in the}} United States {{by the name of}} Donna Summer. This journey began in 1977 with an audition and an introduction to Donna by her musical director and Conti's close friend Michael Warren. Donna Summer {{went on to become the}} number one act in the world. Through his association with Donna, Conti met famed producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. After hearing Conti's percussion work (live and in the studio), Conti was asked to play on the soon to be double platinum Bad Girls album. He composed a song with Donna Summer on that album: [...] "Can't Get To Sleep at Night". Conti wrote another song with Donna and keyboardist Virgil Weber for an album that was to be recorded at her first Hollywood Bowl performance, [...] "Only One Man", which was chosen to be the <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Heaven Knows", a duet sung by Donna and Joe [...] "Bean" [...] Esposito on the Live and More album. Conti would sing the duet [...] "Heaven Knows" [...] in concert with Donna whenever Joe was not available.
