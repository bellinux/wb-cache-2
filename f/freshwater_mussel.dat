5|$|Some {{freshwater}} bivalves have very restricted ranges. For example, the Ouachita creekshell mussel, Villosa arkansasensis, is known {{only from the}} streams of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and like several other <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> species from the southeastern US, it {{is in danger of}} extinction. In contrast, a few species of {{freshwater bivalves}}, including the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where it has become an invasive species. Another well-travelled freshwater bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> family, Unionidae, {{commonly}} known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E
25|$|In the United States and Canada, areas home to {{the most}} diverse <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> fauna in the world, there are 297 known <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> taxa. Of the 297 known species, 213 (71.7%) taxa are listed as endangered, threatened, of special concern. The main factors {{contributing}} to the decline of freshwater mussels include destruction from dams, increased siltation, channel modification, {{and the introduction of}} invasive species like the Zebra mussel.|$|E

25|$|The Glazert burn, {{previously}} Glazart or Glassert has otters and {{the rare}} <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> (source of freshwater pearls). The name {{may come from}} the celtic, glas in Gaelic meaning grey or green and dur meaning water. It is recorded by Dobie in 1876 as being a favourite resort of fishermen and this {{is still very much}} the case today (2006). Another River Glazert, runs through a considerable part of the parish of Campsie, emptying itself into the Kelvin, opposite the town of Kirkintilloch.|$|E
25|$|Another {{and perhaps}} even more {{immediate}} challenge to the potter using the available backswamp clay is its extreme stickiness, which is called plasticity in ceramic terminology. All but the coarsest of clays are somewhat plastic and malleable {{in the presence of}} water; however, the minute clay plate-like particles of backswamp clay are so small that they are influenced by the ionic charges which sit at their edges. The collective ionic charge acts to cause the clay plates to repel each other and thus slip and slide against each other. The shell particles, also plate-like, were produced by the Mississippian potter by collecting then burning <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> shells, which were originally most likely a byproduct of harvesting the meat for food.|$|E
500|$|The {{two methods}} of culturing pearls insert either [...] "seeds" [...] or beads into oysters. The [...] "seed" [...] method uses grains of ground shell from {{freshwater}} mussels, and overharvesting {{for this purpose}} has endangered several <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> species in the southeastern United States. The pearl industry is so important in some areas, significant sums of money are spent on monitoring the health of farmed molluscs.|$|E

500|$|Although {{reduced and}} altered, {{habitats}} in the watershed support {{a wide range}} of wildlife, some of which is found nowhere else in Portland. Many species that used the slough in 1850 still use it. This includes more than 150species of birds, 26species of fish of which 12species are native several kinds of amphibians, western pond turtles, beaver, muskrat, river otter, and black-tailed deer. Juvenile salmon enter the lower slough as well as Smith and Bybee Lakes. Coastal cutthroat trout inhabit Fairview Creek and Osborn Creek. Three species of native <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> live in the slough and in Smith and Bybee Lakes. Crayfish have been found throughout the slough. Bald eagles are among the resident birds, and great blue herons have established rookeries in the watershed. Migrants that visit the slough include more than a dozen species of ducks, geese, swans, and raptors, as well as neotropical shorebirds and songbirds. Invasive species adapted to the slough include the nutria, common carp, bullfrog, and European starling.|$|E

Several species of fish such as bream breed in the canal, and others reproduce in its feeding rivers and spend part of their life in the canal. [...] Molluscs such as anadontes — a kind of <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel,</b> and corbicules — a kind of freshwater clam occur in the canal. Invasive Coypu (River rat or nutria) and Muskrats introduced from the Americas burrow into the banks, which they damage. Finally, many animals and birds come to drink water from the canal.|$|E

[...] In sixteenth-century Italy, {{an aspect of the}} revival of Antiquity was the desire to recreate Classical spaces as extensions of the revived villa. [...] Ovid's description of the cave of Achelous provided some specific inspiration to patrons in France as well as Italy for the Mannerist garden grotto, with its cool dampness, tuff vaulting and shellwork walls. The banquet served by Ovid's Achelous offered a prototype for Italian midday feasts in the fountain-cooled shade of garden grottoes.|$|E

[...] The Feast of Achelous is derived from Ovid in his Metamorphoses, who describes [...] how Theseus is entertained by the river god in a damp grotto, while waiting for the river's raging flood to subside: [...] "He entered the dark building, made of spongy pumice, and rough tuff. The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with <b>freshwater</b> <b>mussel</b> and oyster shells." [...] The subject was painted a number of times, with Rubens producing an early version with Jan Brueghel the Elder, and a later picture attributed to his [...] "school", and Hendrick van Balen collaborating with Jan Brueghel the Younger.

Of these fauna, 23 vertebrate species are listed as threatened. Other species considered rare either generally or within the region are platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), dusky antechinus (Antechinus swainsonii), greater glider (Petaurus breviceps), wombat (Vombatus ursinus), eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), wallaroo (Macropus robustus), red-necked pademelon (Thylogale thetis), red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). The largest population of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in southern Sydney are found in Wedderburn, which is located {{in and around the}} park. Their breeding habitat runs along the creek lines of the O’Hares Creek and Georges River starting from the Stokes creek junction to north of Kentlyn. Koalas are endangered, and their population is in decline. The eastern pygmy possum, found in the park, is listed as vulnerable. There are also some regionally significant frog and reptile populations found in the park, including the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus) and the great barred frog (Mixophyes fasciolatus). The broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) and the red-crowned toadlet (Pseudophryne australis) inhabit exfoliated rock on the sandstone plateaus. This is a habitat that has been dramatically degraded and fragmented in other Sydney regions but which is relatively undisturbed within the park. Bushrock collection, usually for garden use, {{is considered to be a}} key threatening process for the snake and toadlet as they use the rocks for shelter. There are non-native fauna species found within the protected area include feral cats and dogs, rabbits, foxes, black rat, deer and mosquito fish.|$|E
