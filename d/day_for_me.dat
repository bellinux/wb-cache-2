Her Majesty the Queen, my dear cousin, is British born." [...] Similarly, Marie wrote that {{the day of her}} arrival in England was [...] "a great <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> one of emotions, sweet, happy and the same time glorious emotions to come back as Queen to my own country, to be received officially, in all honour and enthusiastically into the bargain – to feel your heart swell with pride and satisfaction, to feel your heart beat and tears start into your eyes, while something gave you a lump into your throat!" [...] These state visits were a symbolic recognition of the prestige Romania had gained after World War I.

40|$|The rate {{of decline}} of {{fenitrothion}} residues {{was investigated in}} leaves and soil of vineyard over 2 months after treatment with two different kinds of commercial formulations: emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and microencapsulate (ME). Fenitrothion residues were determined with GCNPD after acetone extraction of soil and leaves. The measured initial deposits in soil and leaves varied between 2. 6 and 3. 8 mgkg-(1) and between 89 and 101 mg kg-(1), respectively. Fenitrothion residues in soil dropped at 0. 1 - 0. 2 mg kg-(1) after 60 days following application with EC formulation showing a more rapid decline than the ME. Fenitrothion residues in leaves from ME formulation treatment showed a longer persistence and lower decline rate than those from EC formulation. During the experimental period, fenitrothion remaining in leaves from ME application was 10 times more than from the EC one. Mathematically defined decline curves were established by determining optimal relationships between fenitrothion residues and time. The RF 1 st-order and RF 1. 5 th-order equation achieved the best adjustment to the experimental data of fenitrothion dissipation on leaves <b>for</b> the <b>ME</b> and EC formulation, respectively, giving fenitrothion half-lives of about 2 - 3 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> <b>ME</b> and < 1 <b>day</b> <b>for</b> EC formulation. In vineyard soil, the best adjustment to the experimental data <b>for</b> <b>ME</b> and EC formulation was achieved by the 1 st-order and 1. 5 th-order equations, respectively, giving fenitrothion half-lives in soil of about 17 - 21 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> <b>ME</b> and 5 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> EC formulation...|$|R

500|$|In 1945, Tracy {{returned}} to {{the stage for the}} first time in 15 years. He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a stay in hospital—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, [...] "I'm coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act." [...] The play was The Rugged Path by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: [...] "In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction". Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: [...] "I couldn't say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night... At least every day is a new <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in films... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again." ...|$|E
500|$|The club began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month – with a win. Judge and Fallon scored again to secure a 2–1 home victory against Doncaster Rovers, and pull Argyle clear of the relegation zone. They looked like earning a valuable point when they travelled to play Leicester City but were denied by a 94th-minute goal from midfielder Andy King. Another home defeat, this time to Sheffield United followed, which left Sturrock desperate to improve morale among his squad, but a third consecutive 1–0 defeat at Swansea City, during which Lowry was sent off, signalled the end of Paul Sturrock's second spell as manager. Paul Mariner was placed in charge until further notice. [...] "It's a sad day, but obviously a happy <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> because I'm getting my chance to be a manager in the league," [...] said the former striker. [...] "He's a great friend of mine. The bond that we have together is quite remarkable and we have a mutual respect for each other." [...] His first match was a 2–0 defeat at Preston North End, but he took positives from the performance.|$|E

[...] He ended his career with a record of record of 56 wins, 7 losses and 1 draw, with 40 knockouts. Márquez admitted the decision was hard to make, but initially made the decision 10 days prior to announcing it.|$|E
2500|$|At the 6 June Bislett Games in Oslo, a Golden League event, Tirunesh Dibaba set a {{world record}} in the 5000 metres, running the {{distance}} in 14:11.15.

The early part of the race was pretty good, but at 3000 metres we were a little behind, so then I had to catch up on the pace. I could have run faster if the pacing was a little better." [...] Tirunesh's 800 metre split times were: 2:13.7 - 2:19.0 (4:32.7 through 1600 metres) - 2:22.5 (6:55.2 through 2400 metres and 8:03.7 through 2800 metres) - 2:17.8 (9:13.0 through 3200 metres) - 2:15.4 (11:28.4 through 4000 metres)- 2:10.1 (13.38.5 though 4800 metres), with a last 200 metre split of 32.7.|$|E

2500|$|After {{referring}} to the bequest of the Outhwaite family and making placatory remarks about the Marist Brothers, Liston welcomed the Christian Brothers. He {{said that they were}} [...] "here at the invitation of the Bishop to take charge of St Peter's school and to have their part, along with the Marist Brothers and other religious communities, in our Catholic education system. They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... if I know the Brothers at all, the boys under their care will be put to hard work - an excellent thing - and teachers will not do for them what they should do for themselves. The thought of the years ahead and of the eternal life will be regarded as of first importance. Teachers will feel it their daily duty to fit the boys to bear life's burdens with a spirit of nobility and to meet life's problems with unfaltering courage". At the conclusion of his speech, Bishop Liston said, [...] "This is a very happy <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> indeed for I owe much more than I can say to the training I received {{at the hands of the}} Christian Brothers in Dunedin long years ago".|$|E
2500|$|Language is {{of primary}} {{importance}} in the play insofar as Valentine and Proteus speak in blank verse, but Launce and Speed speak (for the most part) in prose. More specifically, the actual content {{of many of the}} speeches serve to illustrate the pompousness of Valentine and Proteus' exalted outlook, and the more realistic and practical outlook of the servants. This is most apparent in Act 3, Scene 1. Valentine has just given a lengthy speech lamenting his banishment and musing on how he cannot possibly survive without Silvia; [...] "Except I be by Silvia in the night/There is no music in the nightingale./Unless I look on Silvia in the day/There is no <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to look upon" [...] (ll.178–181). However, when Launce enters only a few lines later, he announces that he too is in love, and proceeds to outline, along with Speed, all of his betrothed's positives ("She brews good ale"; [...] "She can knit"; [...] "She can wash and scour"), and negatives ("She hath a sweet mouth"; [...] "She doth talk in her sleep"; [...] "She is slow in words"). After weighing his options, Launce decides that the woman's most important quality is that [...] "she hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults" [...] (ll.343–344). He announces that her wealth [...] "makes the faults gracious" [...] (l.356), and chooses for that reason to wed her. This purely materialistic reasoning, as revealed in the form of language, is {{in stark contrast to the}} more spiritual and idealised love espoused by Valentine earlier in the scene.|$|E
