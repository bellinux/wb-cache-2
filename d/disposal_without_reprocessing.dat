40|$|Accelerator-driven thermal-spectrum molten-salt nuclear {{technology}} can greatly simplify nuclear energy technology by eliminating reprocessing and greatly enhancing once-through burn-up. In effect the accelerator may be {{employed as a}} substitute for frequent reprocessing and recycle. The accelerator makes possible reduction in plutonium and minor actinides from current LWRs by a factor of more than ten <b>without</b> <b>reprocessing</b> while converting the plutonium remnant to a non-weaponsuseful isotopic composition. The accelerator also enhances the once-through energy production from fertile material by a factor of ten <b>without</b> <b>reprocessing</b> compared to once-through LWR technology. This technology would eliminate the need to deploy plutonium production indefinitely, and reprocessing and recycle for at least several hundred years. The energy production technology proposed here operates primarily on the Th-U cycle with a minor contribution from the U-Pu cycle to eliminate the weapons-usefulness of 233 U. There are two key innovations in addition to the accelerator. One is the use of liquid fuel flowing once through a pool of material undergoing fission thereby allowing high burn-up concurrently with continuous removal of fission product <b>without</b> <b>reprocessing.</b> The second is the unanticipated low capture cross section of fission product nuclides which substantially enhances the neutron economy in this type of system. The supplement of neutrons from the accelerator, the reduced fission product neutron capture, and the continuously flowing fuel are the enablers for the performance described here. This technology allows an essentially complete decoupling of nuclear energy from nuclear weapon...|$|R

40|$|Possible {{fuel cycle}} {{scenarios}} for a helium-cooled, sub-critical, fast reactor with a fusion neutron {{source for the}} transmutation of spent nuclear fuel have been analyzed. The transmutation rate was set by the 3000 MWth fission power output. The primary objective was to achieve greater than 90 % burn of the transuranic (TRU) fuel obtained from spent nuclear fuel. A secondary objective {{was to examine the}} possibility of achieving this deep burn <b>without</b> <b>reprocessing</b> after initial fabrication of the TRU into coated particle TRISO fuel. 	Four sets of 5 -batch fuel cycle scenarios, differing in the constraints imposed on the beginning of cycle (BOC) k-eff and the end of cycle (EOC) neutron source strength (characterized by the fusion neutron source power level), were evaluated. In scenario A, BOC k-eff was required to be 0. 95 and EOC Pfus less than 200 MWth was required. In scenario B, the restriction was removed to allow less reactive BOC fuel loadings, while the 200 MW upper limit on EOC Pfus was retained. It was found that the primary objective of greater than 90 % TRU burn-up could be achieved by repeatedly reprocessing the TRISO TRU fuel particles to remove fission products and add fresh TRU makeup {{at the end of each}} 5 -batch burn cycle, without needing to increase the fusion neutron source power above 100 MWth when the BOC k-eff is restricted to 0. 95. 	The secondary objective of obviating processing could only be accomplished when the restriction was removed and recycling was employed or when both EOC Pfus and BOC k-eff restrictions were removed in a single-pass deep burn fuel cycle. In scenario C, with both the BOC k-eff limit and the fusion power limit unrestricted, greater than 90 % TRU burn-up was achieved <b>without</b> <b>reprocessing</b> the TRISO TRU fuel particles, which could then be buried intact in a high-level waste repository, but a neutron source rate of 3370 MWth was required.

40|$|This thesis studies {{incremental}} hierarchical clustering {{for large}} databases. Data clustering concerns how to group similar objects together, while separating dissimilar objects. An incremental clustering algorithm examines incoming objects {{one by one}} and determines how each incoming object should be clustered with the existing objects <b>without</b> <b>reprocessing</b> all the existing objects. Many incremental clustering algorithms employ representatives of clusters to record the distribution of the existing objects. However, this practice may lead to some degree of information loss if insufficient or improper representatives are selected. Furthermore, many existing incremental clustering algorithms suffer order dependence. That is, clustering results may vary dramatically, if the objects are inputted in different orders. This thesis proposes a statistical model based test scheme for incremental clustering algorithm. The main distinction of the proposed algorithm from previous model-based approaches is that abstractions referred to as spherical cluster and homogeneous cluster are verified with some statistical tests. The objective of employing those statistical tests is to reduce the information loss when using representatives of clusters to record the distribution of the existing objects...|$|R
