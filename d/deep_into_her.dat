2500|$|... "Whatchulookinat" [...] {{became the}} album's lead single {{released}} on September 17, 2002. The song received mixed to unfavorable reviews from critics. It {{was seen as}} woe is Whitney song, a rich girl whining. The single became a moderate success worldwide, peaking inside the top forty in most countries. In the US, it became her tenth Hot Dance Club Play topper. The corresponding music video was also considered as Houston's answer to the media for getting too <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> personal life. The video showed a white set with cameras all over, following Houston's every move. The set was also full with old movie cameras and people dressed as reporters and photographers. Houston is shown dancing in front of them.|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club {{found the}} album {{to be too}} dance and R and felt {{that it should have}} {{explored}} her [...] "airy voice", as found on singles like [...] "Body Party", that recaptured the zeitgeist of her earlier work. At USA Today, Steve Jones said that [...] "bass-fueled club bangers and libido-driven ballads tend to hit their mark but ultimately, don't leave a lasting impression." [...] The Boston Globes Ken Capobianco criticized the album for [...] "missing [...] a unique lyrical or musical vision", further elaborating, [...] "we've heard these tropes before," [...] and concluding their review that [...] "now <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> career, the real Ciara still proves elusive." [...] Jon Carmanica of The New York Times found the production [...] "vivid", but felt that Ciara's voice lacks personality and said that she sounds monotonous throughout the album.|$|E
6000|$|Emily heard Amelia's startled exclamation. She {{gripped the}} square rails {{with her hands}} until the sharp edges dinted <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> fingers. John's voice came up to her again, harsh and expressionless: ...|$|E
50|$|He eats Esthers food; but <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> heart.|$|R
60|$|Anne cowered <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> pillows as if {{desirous of}} hiding herself forever from mortal eyes.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{claiming}} {{that she knows}} their son is still alive, in the hazy aftermath of this unimaginable loss, Sarah begins a downwards spiral. Phil, a New York City cop, starts {{to lose sight of}} his morals as Sarah puts herself in increasingly dangerous situations, falling <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own fever dream.|$|R
60|$|She {{stared at}} him till her eyes seemed to become glowing coals that burned <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> brain, and yet she was in mortal fear of making out the {{well-known}} features. Below her the sea lapped softly against the rock with a splash continuous and gentle.|$|E
60|$|She waited {{till they}} were near, then, {{without a word}} or a sound, lifted her strong, white arm and drove the knife <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own heart. For a moment she stood still, till {{suddenly}} she stretched her hands wide and fell face downwards dead upon {{the body of the}} brute who had bought her.|$|E
60|$|With these conceptions in {{his mind}} he went back and looked for her. He called her softly, {{but she did not}} hear, she was sobbing <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> pillow. He came up the stairs and saw her lying face {{downward}} on her bed. His heart rose in his throat, because it was a terrible thing to see his imperious girl weep.|$|E
50|$|Ruth sinks even <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> {{depression}} when Brenda takes Maya back. George {{tries to}} comfort her and promises he will help her get through it. Ruth is helped by {{a phone call to}} Maggie when she tells Ruth that Nate was happy the night he suffered his ultimately fatal stroke.|$|R
50|$|After {{learning}} the apartment’s previous tenant mysteriously disappeared, Marie becomes {{obsessed with the}} mystery, all the while suffering from headaches, nausea, tension and insomnia. As Bobby dismisses her theories and fears, Marie delves <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> investigation, growing suspicious of her loving boyfriend and the ritzy building, whose long-hidden secrets have nightmarish consequences.|$|R
60|$|The tall tunnelman, {{looking down}} {{into the depths of}} Peggy's sunbonnet, saw {{something}} in the round blue eyes and grave little mouth that made him think so too. But here Peggy's serious little face took a shade of darker concern as her arm went down <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> pocket, and her eyes got rounder.|$|R
60|$|Her real philosophy, therefore, {{was quite}} {{different}} from that which her scientific friends formulated for her, and was not modern but ancient as the hills. On the one hand, she never quite freed herself from the old pagan conception of Nemesis, or Fate; on the other, her early Methodist training entered <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> soul and made her mindful of the Cross that forever towers above humanity.|$|E
60|$|Yet Maria suffered. Even she, {{according}} to her conviction belonged to Paolo. And she felt betrayed, betrayed and deserted. The iron had gone <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> soul. Paolo had deserted her, she had been betrayed to other men for five years. There was something cruel and implacable in life. She sat sullen and heavy, for all her quick activity. Her soul was sullen and heavy.|$|E
60|$|And {{she turned}} to spring and the opening buds. There was a large pear tree by a wall, and it was full, thronged with tiny, grey-green buds, myriads. She stood before it arrested with delight, and a {{realization}} went <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> heart. There was so great a host in array behind the cloud of pale, dim green, so much to come forth--so much sunshine to pour down.|$|E
50|$|He travels {{first with}} her to Brighton, where he meets one of his aunt's old acquaintances, and gains an insight <b>into</b> one of <b>her</b> many past lives. Here a psychic foreshadows {{that he will have}} many travels in the near future. This {{prediction}} inevitably becomes true as Henry is pulled further and further into his aunt's lifestyle, and delves <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> past.|$|R
60|$|And {{when the}} Moon {{shone in the}} heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn. All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened. All night long she sang, and the thorn went <b>deeper</b> and <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Joyce intervened at this point, and, {{after some}} little {{discussion}} of a conventional topic, offered to send Victor and his mother home in her car. Victor was not pleased by her offer. It was only putting him just that much <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> debt, {{but he could not}} well refuse, especially as his mother accepted it as a matter of course.|$|R
6000|$|... "Write me {{often and}} bring Jims up faithfully, {{according}} to the gospel of Morgan," [...] Walter said lightly, having said all his serious things the night before in Rainbow Valley. But {{at the last moment}} he took her face between his hands and looked <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> gallant eyes. [...] "God bless you, Rilla-my-Rilla," [...] he said softly and tenderly. After all it was not a hard thing to fight for a land that bore daughters like this.|$|E
6000|$|She couldn't {{have told}} you whether {{it was because she}} was afraid, or because such a voice in the {{darkness}} seemed of necessity a boon; but she listened to him as she had never listened before; his words dropped <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> soul. They produced a sort of stillness in all her being; and it was with an effort, in a moment, that she answered him. [...] "How can you help me?" [...] she asked in a low tone, as if she were taking what he had said seriously enough to make the enquiry in confidence.|$|E
60|$|He {{had talked}} to her a hundred times of the Quarter. They would wander through its {{pleasant}} old streets, and they would sit idly in the charming gardens of the Luxembourg. If the weather was fine perhaps, when they {{had had enough of}} Paris, they might go to Fontainebleau. The trees would be just bursting into leaf. The green of the forest in spring was more beautiful than anything he knew; it was like a song, and it was like the happy pain of love. Mildred listened quietly. He turned to her and tried to look <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{conventionally}} religious in {{her younger}} years, Élisabeth Leseur {{was prompted by}} the attacks of her husband against Christianity and religion to probe <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> faith. She thus underwent a religious conversion {{at the age of}} thirty-two. From this time on, she saw her major task in praying for the conversion of her husband, while remaining patient with his constant attacks on her faith.|$|R
5000|$|Laerte storms the castle, {{demanding}} {{justice for}} the murder of his father, Polonio. Claudio calms him, and the two watch in horror as Ofelia enters, now insane, imagining her father’s funeral (la bara involta). Claudio informs Laerte that Amleto killed Polonio; Laerte swears revenge, and both exit. Hearing the name [...] "Amleto", Ofelia descends <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> madness (Bell’alberel dolente), eventually drowning herself in a brook.|$|R
5000|$|Anne Tyler commented in a 1992 {{interview}} with Patricia Willrich that Celestial Navigation {{was far more}} difficult to write than her previous four novels, because she had finally learned to delve <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> characters and to rework her drafts multiple times. [...] It {{is also one of}} her favorites. She says, “Creating Jeremy was a way of investigating my own tendency to turn more and more inward I write.” ...|$|R
6000|$|While {{the poor}} {{creature}} was thus engaged, the two executioners, without warning, thrust their spears <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> body. It was {{the custom of}} these men to plunge the spears into the loins of their victims {{on each side of}} the back-bone in such a position that they did not produce immediate death, but allowed the martyrs to tumble into the ditch and writhe there in agony for some time with the spears still sticking in them. Happily, in the case of Rasalama, the thrusts were--either intentionally or accidentally--more effective than usual. After a very brief struggle, her happy soul was set free to be [...] "for ever with the Lord." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And did my missis think--ho goodness, did she think--{{as her own}} Miggs, which {{supported}} her under so many trials, and understood her natur' when them as intended well but acted rough, went so <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> feelings--did she think as her own Miggs would ever leave her? Did she think as Miggs, though she was but a servant, and knowed that servitudes was no inheritances, would forgit {{that she was the}} humble instruments as always made it comfortable between them two when they fell out, and always told master of the meekness and forgiveness of her blessed dispositions! Did she think as Miggs had no attachments! Did she think that wages was her only object!' ...|$|E
60|$|And Hereward {{had reason}} to be ashamed. He had been {{faithful}} to Torfrida,--a virtue most rare in those days. Few were faithful then, save, it may be, Baldwin of Mons to his tyrant and idol, the sorceress Richilda; and William of Normandy,--whatever were his other sins,--to his wise and sweet and beautiful Matilda. The stories of his coldness and cruelty to her seem to rest on no foundation. One need believe them as little as one does the myth of one chronicler, that {{when she tried to}} stop him from some expedition, and clung to him as he sat upon his horse, he smote his spur so <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> breast that she fell dead. The man had self-control, and feared God in his own wild way,--therefore it was, perhaps, that he conquered.|$|E
2500|$|Meyer {{also reports}} {{that she was}} praying {{intensely}} while driving to work one morning in 1976 when she said she heard God call her name. She had been born-again at age nine, but her unhappiness drove <b>her</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> faith. She says that she came home later that day from a beauty appointment [...] "full of liquid love" [...] and was [...] "drunk with the Spirit of God" [...] that night while at the local bowling alley.|$|R
60|$|Rosy nestled down {{among the}} thick gray feathers, and put both arms round his neck; and whiz they went, up, up, up, higher and higher, till the trees looked like grass, {{they were so}} far below. At first it was very cold, and Rosy cuddled <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> feather bed; then, as they came nearer to the sun, it grew warm, and she peeped out to see the huts {{standing}} in a green spot {{on the top of}} the mountain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Strange how {{everything}} seems to throw me ever <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> debt," [...] he thought, a little later. But he did not quite dare put into words the resentment which mingled with his gratitude. He hated to be put so constantly into {{the position of the}} one protected, defended. And yet it was his own fault. He had put himself among people and conditions where she was the stronger. Having ventured out of his world into hers he must take the consequences.|$|R
60|$|Shefford {{bent over}} Fay, {{and as the}} strain on him broke he held her closer and closer and his tears {{streamed}} down and his voice broke in exclamations of tenderness and thanksgiving. It did not matter what she had thought, but she must never know what he had thought. He clasped her as something precious he had lost and regained. He was shaken with a passion of remorse. How could he have believed Fay Larkin guilty of murder? Women less wild and less justified than she had been driven to such a deed, yet {{how could he have}} believed it of her, when for two days he had been with her, had seen her face, and <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes? There was mystery in his very blindness. He cast the whole thought from him for ever. There was no shadow between Fay and him. He had found her. He had saved her. She was free. She was innocent. And suddenly, as he seemed delivered from contending tumults within, he became aware that it was no unresponsive creature he had folded to his breast.|$|E
60|$|It did sound {{pleasant}} even to Polly's ears, and {{she felt}} suddenly so rich, and so contented, that she seemed a different creature from the silly girl who cried {{because she could n't}} go to the party. It passed through her mind like a flash, the contrast between her life, and that of the wan creature lying before her, {{and she felt}} as if she could not give enough out of her abundance to this needy little sister, who had nothing in the wide world but the life just saved to her. That minute did more for Polly than many sermons, or the wisest books, for it brought her face to face with bitter truths, showed her the dark side of life, and seemed to blow away her little vanities, her frivolous desires, like a wintry wind, that left a wholesome atmosphere behind. Sitting on the bedside, Polly listened while Jane told the story, which was so new to her listener, that every word sank <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> heart, and never was forgotten.|$|E
60|$|Jane felt {{swayed by}} a {{strength}} that far exceeded her own. In {{a clash of}} wills with this man {{she would go to}} the wall. If she were to influence him it must be wholly through womanly allurement. There was that about Lassiter which commanded her respect. She had abhorred his name; face to face with him, she found she feared only his deeds. His mystic suggestion, his foreshadowing of something that she was to mean to him, pierced <b>deep</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mind. She believed fate had thrown in her way the lover or husband of Milly Erne. She believed that through her an evil man might be reclaimed. His allusion to what he called her blindness terrified her. Such a mistaken idea of his might unleash the bitter, fatal mood she sensed in him. At any cost she must placate this man; she knew the die was cast, and that if Lassiter did not soften to a woman's grace and beauty and wiles, then it would be because she could not make him.|$|E
60|$|The light annoyed her. Complete {{darkness}} fitted her strange mood. She {{retired and}} tried to compose herself to sleep. Sleep for her was {{not a matter of}} will. Her cheeks burned so hotly that she rose to bathe them. Cold water would not alleviate this burn, and then, despairing of forgetfulness, she lay down again with a shameful gratitude for the cloak of night. Stewart's kisses were there, scorching her lips, her closed eyes, her swelling neck. They penetrated <b>deeper</b> and <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> blood, <b>into</b> <b>her</b> heart, <b>into</b> <b>her</b> soul--the terrible farewell kisses of a passionate, hardened man. Despite his baseness, he had loved her.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of her senior year, she begins having vivid dreams about the American Revolution. She soon becomes {{convinced}} the dreams are real-they always start where the last one ended, and she discovers {{that some of the}} events in her dreams actually happened. As she tries to figure out what is happening to her, she pushes away her closest friends and family in order to dive <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> dreams, exploring the world of 18th century America and the interesting people she meets there.|$|R
5000|$|The She-Devil sneaks {{up behind}} Zazel, {{who is sitting}} at a table airbrushing a design of the She-Devil and her costume, and [...] "decapitates" [...] the artist with a scythe. The She-Devil crawls around Zazel's freshly [...] "severed" [...] head, now placed upon the table. The She-Devil grips the shaft of her latex tail and pushes the butt plug {{attachment}} <b>deeper</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> anus before thrusting <b>her</b> vulva <b>into</b> Zazel's face. The She-Devil French kisses Zazel's head and continues to anally masturbate with the tail/butt plug.|$|R
