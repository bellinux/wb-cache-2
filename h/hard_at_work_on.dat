During this period Samuel was <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> a revision of the translation of Matthew's Gospel in Chinese. The amount of work that still was left to be done prompted him to write to England in the following year, appealing for more workers to be sent out. Robert Morrison died at Guangzhou in 1834.|$|E

60|$|It {{was very}} true that the queen {{did not live}} in a palace. Her house was nearly {{large enough to hold}} an old-fashioned four-posted bedstead, such as they have at my Aunt Sarah's. The little room that was cut off from the main {{apartment}} was really too small to count. The queen was <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> sitting <b>on</b> her door-stone by the side of her bits of sugar-cane and pepper-pods. There were no customers. She was a good-looking old body, about sixty, perhaps, but tall and straight enough for all queenly purposes.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Pernkopf was <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the fourth volume. Two of his former colleagues, Alexander Pickler and Werner Platzer, {{completed}} it for its 1960 publication. A few years later, the publisher brought out a condensed two-volume set with all the color plates, removing most of Pernkopf's explanatory text (and, later, airbrushing out the Nazi symbols Lepier and the others added to their signatures). Since little translation was necessary, this was the version of the atlas which medical students and physicians elsewhere in the world came to know and revere.|$|E
25|$|By Saturday, March 30, Sheriff Presley and Chief of Police Jack Runnels {{posted a}} $500 reward {{in an effort}} to gain any new {{information}} on the Griffin and Moore case that would lead to the arrest and conviction of the slayer or slayers. Officers stated that all clues found thus far had been fruitless. The results from the blood-stained sand were expected to arrive the day before, but due to delays at the laboratory, the results had not come in. By April 11, the officers were still <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the case. Presley said that his department and other authorities had not relaxed for one minute since the discovery of the crime. He also stated that the $500 reward was still being offered and that no tip, no matter how small, was left without a thorough investigation.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Gordon {{became the}} center of media {{attention}} due to a series of scandals in her private life. The serial's home network Channel Seven decided to support Gordon through the ordeals. The scandals cast doubt over whether Gordon would be staying with the serial and it was reported that she wanted to leave Australia for other roles. However, it was later confirmed she would be staying with the show and a spokesperson said, [...] "Jodi is looking forward, not backward, and is <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the set of Home and Away". Gordon was backed by her fellow cast members and fans of her character, who voiced their support for her. At the time Gordon was signed to appear in the serial for another two years after she had signed to a three-year contract.|$|E

6000|$|Tom {{was off to}} the West; Polly {{went home}} for the summer; Maud {{was taken to the}} seaside with Belle; and Fanny left alone to wrestle with housekeeping, [...] "help," [...] and heartache. If it had not been for two things, I fear she never would have stood a summer in town, but Sydney often called, till his {{vacation}} came, and a voluminous correspondence with Polly beguiled the long days. Tom wrote once a week to his mother, but the letters were short and not very satisfactory, for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear. Fanny forwarded her bits of news to Polly. Polly sent back all the extracts from Ned's letters concerning Tom, and by putting the two reports together, they gained the comfortable assurance that Tom was well, in good spirits, <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and intent <b>on</b> coming out strong in spite of all obstacles.|$|R
6000|$|Francois de Montcorbier, ALIAS Francois des Loges, ALIAS Francois Villon, ALIAS Michel Mouton, Master of Arts in the University of Paris, {{was born}} in that city {{in the summer of}} 1431. It was a memorable year for France on other and higher considerations. A great-hearted girl and a poor-hearted boy made, the one her last, the other his first {{appearance}} on the public stage of that unhappy country. On the 30th of May the ashes of Joan of Arc were thrown into the Seine, and on the 2d of December our Henry Sixth made his Joyous Entry dismally enough into disaffected and depopulating Paris. Sword and fire still ravaged the open country. On a single April Saturday twelve hundred persons, besides children, made their escape out of the starving capital. The hangman, as is not uninteresting to note in connection with Master Francis, was kept <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in 1431; <b>on</b> the last of April and on the 4th of May alone, sixty-two bandits swung from Paris gibbets. (1) A more confused or troublous time it would have been difficult to select for a start in life. Not even a man's nationality was certain; for the people of Paris {{there was no such thing}} as a Frenchman. The English were the English indeed, but the French were only the Armagnacs, whom, with Joan of Arc at their head, they had beaten back from under their ramparts not two years before. Such public sentiment as they had centred about their dear Duke of Burgundy, and the dear Duke had no more urgent business than to keep out of their neighbourhood. [...] . At least, and whether he liked it or not, our disreputable troubadour was tubbed and swaddled as a subject of the English crown.|$|R
500|$|Darwin was <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the {{manuscript}} for his [...] "big book" [...] on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 {{he received a}} parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that [...] "your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled" [...] and he would [...] "of course, at once write and offer to send [...] to any journal" [...] that Wallace chose, adding that [...] "all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled [...] On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.|$|E
500|$|Released in March 2006 and {{reported}} on game news sites as a curiosity in April {{of the same}} year, the Oblivion Topless Mod had been created by a woman calling herself [...] "Maeyanie." [...] Maeyanie created the mod in protest against what she called [...] "government/society/whatever forcing companies to 'protect our innocent population from seeing those evil dirty things 50% of them possess personally anyways.'" [...] The gaming website Joystiq reported on the mod on April 6, 2006: [...] "Modders are already <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> bending the code of the recently released PC version of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to their will. Early success: topless mod FTW!" [...] Kotaku, another gaming site, reporting on the mod on April 5, 2006, didn't consider the mod anything new and said, [...] "As usual {{in the world of}} computer gaming, one of the very first mods released for a popular game allows you to see the breasts of the main character." [...] The content of the mod, wrote commentator Michael Zenke, Editor of Slashdot games, was fairly tame. Without nudity of the lower torso, and without self-consciousness {{on the part of the}} nude NPCs, Zenke wrote, the Oblivion Topless Mod was [...] "as erotic as a doctor's visit." [...] Pete Hines had discussed the mod with GameSpot staff before the game was re-rated, saying that he did not consider it a concern. [...] "We can't control and don't condone the actions of anyone who alters the game so that it displays material that may be considered offensive. We haven't received any complaints on the issue from anyone." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{interviews}} with Charles Rowell and Randall Kenan, Butler credited {{the struggles of}} her working-class mother as an important influence on her writing. Because Butler's mother received little formal education herself, she made sure that young Butler was {{given the opportunity to}} learn by bringing her reading materials that her white employers threw away, from magazines to advanced books. She also encouraged Butler to write. She bought her daughter her first typewriter when she was 10 years old, and, seeing her <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> a story, casually remarked that maybe one day she could become a writer, causing Butler to realize {{that it was possible to}} make a living as an author. A decade later, Mrs. Butler [...] would pay more than a month's rent to have an agent review her daughter's work. She also provided Butler with the money she had been saving for dental work to pay for Butler's scholarship so she could attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop, where Butler sold her first two stories.|$|E
2500|$|Hugo {{copyrights}} {{were acquired}} by the German game publisher Krea Medie A/S, {{a part of the}} media company Kraemedie. New Hugo owner Henrik Kølle stated in October 2012 that Hugo Games A/S [...] "is happy that the traditional Hugo countries, where Hugo was aired in the '90s, still love Hugo and seemingly can’t get enough of him. [...] Angry Birds have shown us the way here, so now we are <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on,</b> among other things, a film project, exciting licensing deals for toys and finally we hope to release another Hugo game in time for summer 2013." [...] On 28 November 2012, Krea Medie was acquired by Egmont Group, but Hugo Games and the rights to Hugo were not part of the sale agreement with Egmont. A possible new Hugo live show was hinted in July 2014. Hugo Games is owned and managed by Henry Mallet, and was valued at DKK 56 million and generating an annual income of about DKK 10 million as estimated in September 2014 when the company was listed for investment as HUGO NewHold ApS.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1981, even Simmons had {{resigned}} from the band. Now {{faced with the prospect}} of calling themselves [...] "The Doobie Brothers" [...] with no remaining original members, a sound that was light years away from their original version and a [...] "leader" [...] in McDonald who was ready for a solo career, the group elected instead to disband. It wasn't even decided upon until after a rehearsal done without Simmons in a vain attempt to keep the band going, according to an interview with McDonald for [...] "Listen To The Music," [...] the Doobie Brothers official video history/documentary released in 1989. He went on to say in that interview that by that point they couldn't have gotten further away from the Doobies sound if they had tried to. The reluctant Simmons, already <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> his first solo album entitled Arcade, rejoined for a 1982 Farewell Tour on the promise that this truly would be the end of the Doobie Brothers. At their last concert at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California, they were joined onstage by founding member Tom Johnston for what was presumed to be the final rendition of his staple, [...] "China Grove". Former members Porter, Hossack and Hartman subsequently took the stage for an extended version of [...] "Listen to the Music". Knudsen sang lead vocals while Johnston, Simmons and McFee traded licks on guitar. The live album Farewell Tour followed in 1983.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1833 and 1836, American {{painter and}} {{putative}} [...] "founder" [...] of The Hudson River School, Thomas Cole, had been <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> his {{series of paintings}} The Course of Empire. The work was commissioned by New York patron Luman Reed, who had met Cole in 1832, and the two held a friendship largely based on Reed's generosity in buying Cole's paintings. Reed requested The Course of Empire to comprise no less than five paintings of a historic composition. Cole himself was excited by such a project, but doubt began to set in {{by the end of}} 1835. The work was slow and laborious, and Cole found great difficulty in painting the figures. Reed had begun to notice Cole was becoming lonely and depressed, and suggested that he suspend work on The Course of Empire and paint something that was more in his element for the April 1836 opening of the National Academy of Design's annual exhibition. Cole, in replying to Reed in a letter, stated that he felt obliged to finish the series as Reed had been so generous in his support, and instead suggested that he simply complete the last painting in the series and display that at the exhibition. Reed however, did not really like the idea, as he thought it might spoil the unveiling of the series as a whole. He suggested instead that he paint a picture much like the already completed second painting in the series, The Pastoral State. This depicted a peaceful setting which Reed thought [...] "no man ever produced a more pleasing landscape in a more pleasing season." [...] Responding in a letter in March 1836, Cole agreed to take Reed's advice and paint a picture for the exhibition, writing: ...|$|E
