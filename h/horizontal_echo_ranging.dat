40|$|The need {{frequently}} arises {{among individuals}} whose work must {{be carried out}} on the ice in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs for an instrument which conveniently measures ice layer thickness. Safety is possibly the most important consideration. In addition scientific studies of the processes involved in ice jam formation or of the effect of the ice layer on the ecology of the river lake or reservoir could be enhanced by an instrument that could conveniently and quickly measure ice thickness. At present ice thickness can be reliably determined by drilling a hole and measuring the thickness by some form of hook gage. This procedure requires, however, that individuals venture out on what is possibly "too thin" ice to make the measurement. For a number of thickness measurements over an area, surface drilling becomes a time consuming process. The various forms of nondestructive measuring devices currently in use employ an <b>echo</b> <b>ranging</b> technique with electromagnetic or acoustic waves. These devices are known by a number of acronyms such as; LASER ranging, RADAR, and SON AR. Their usefulness for ice- layer thickness measurements would depend, in addition to other considerations, on the strength of the reflection from an ice water interface. The expected distance to be measured is estimated from 1 cm to 100 cm (in the Minnesota Region) from the ice surface to the ice-water interface below. The velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves of nearly 300, 000, 000 mls indicates <b>echo</b> <b>ranging</b> with electromagnetic waves would require the measurement of very small time intervals to infer distances as small as one centimeter. The time required for distance measurement using ultrasound, with a sound wave velocity of 3200 mls in ice, would be considerably longer, typically a few hundred microseconds. While the technology exists for the measurement of the extremely short transit time of electromagnetic pulses, the cost and complexity compared to the measurement of a considerably longer time for a acoustic pulse to travel the same distance is considerably greater.

40|$|Abstract. Peculiar near <b>range</b> <b>echoes</b> {{observed}} in summer with the SuperDARN HF radar in Finland are presented. The echoes were detected at four frequencies of 9, 11, 13 and 15 MHz at slant ranges of 105 – 250 km for about 100 min. Inter-ferometer measurements {{indicate that the}} echoes are returned from 80 – 100 km altitudes with elevation angles of 20 ◦– 60 ◦. Echo power (≤ 16 dB), Doppler velocity (between – 30 and + 30 m s− 1) and spectral width (≤ 60 m s− 1) fluctuate with periods of several to 20 min, perhaps due to short–period at-mospheric gravity waves. When the HF radar detected the echoes, a vertical incidence MST radar, located at Esrange in Sweden (650 km north of the HF radar site), observed po-lar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE) at altitudes of 80 – 90 km. This fact suggests that the near <b>range</b> HF <b>echoes</b> are PMSE at HF band, although both radars did not probe a common volume.

This paper presents an integrative synchronization and imaging approach for this particular system. Firstly, a novel synchronization method using the direct-path signal, which can be collected by a dedicated antenna, is proposed and applied. The synchronization error can be completely removed using the proposed method. However, {{as the cost of}} synchronization, the characteristic of synchronized <b>echo’s</b> <b>range</b> history becomes quite different from that of general bistatic SAR data. To focus this particular synchronized data, its 2 -D spectrum is derived under linear approximations and then a frequency-domain imaging algorithm using two-dimensional inverse scaled Fourier transform (2 -DISFT) is proposed. At last, the proposed integrative synchronization and imaging algorithm is verified by simulations.|$|R

It is found that with increasing disturbance level, <b>echo</b> <b>ranges</b> become shorter because of wave refraction during propagation due to more enhanced D and E region electron density. When geomagnetic H component variation (ΔH) is less than about - 900 nT, echoes are returned from the central E region where geomagnetic aspect angle is close to zero. When ΔH is very high (= - 1500 nT), the echoes are backscattered from the D and lower E regions and their power, Doppler velocity and spectral width are largely suppressed. The results suggest that we must always consider, more or less, wave refraction effect in analyzing near-range E region HF radar echoes...|$|R
