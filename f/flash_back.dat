500|$|The group {{experimented with}} several {{gameplay}} models, and opted {{for one that}} allowed players to freely switch characters. The final product mimics isometric dungeon crawling video games. Raven designed gameplay with strategy in mind; each character's abilities allow different interactions with the environment and other characters. [...] For example, a physically strong character like Colossus can break walls but is unable to reach certain areas that require the ability to fly, and Iceman is able to freeze enemies so that other characters can easily defeat them. [...] Staff hoped that the differences would force players to switch characters regularly during missions. [...] Extraction points, specific locations that players can switch characters, were added to allow players to continue without a game over in the event one or more team member was defeated. [...] Raven included <b>flash</b> <b>back</b> missions as an homage to the franchise and based some on specific comic book issues. Originally a single-player game, Raven eventually incorporated simultaneous co-orperative gameplay. [...] The developers chose to not create an online multi-player mode, stating that the gameplay was [...] "designed around localized encounters." ...|$|E
