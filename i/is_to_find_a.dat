5|$|The 2-satisfiability problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> truth {{assignment}} to these variables {{that makes the}} whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so {{that at least one}} literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|Important {{polynomial}} time computational problems on DAGs include topological sorting (finding a topological ordering), {{construction of the}} transitive closure and transitive reduction (the largest and smallest DAGs with the same reachability relation, respectively), and the closure problem, in which the goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> minimum-weight subset of vertices with no edges connecting them {{to the rest of}} the graph. Transforming a directed graph with cycles into a DAG by deleting as few vertices or edges as possible (the feedback vertex set and feedback edge set problem, respectively) is NP-hard, but any directed graph can be made into a DAG (its condensation) by contracting each strongly connected component into a single supervertex. The problems of finding shortest paths and longest paths can be solved on DAGs in linear time, in contrast to arbitrary graphs for which shortest path algorithms are slower and longest path problems are NP-hard.|$|E

25|$|In color science, {{chromatic}} adaptation is {{the estimation of}} the representation of an object under a different light source from {{the one in which}} it was recorded. A common application <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> {{chromatic adaptation}} transform (CAT) that will make the recording of a neutral object appear neutral (color balance), while keeping other colors also looking realistic. For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between ICC profiles with different white points. Adobe Photoshop, for example, uses the Bradford CAT.|$|E
25|$|Given a {{collection}} of sets, a set which intersects all sets in the collection {{in at least one}} element is called a hitting set, and a simple NP-hard problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> hitting set of smallest size or minimum hitting set. By mapping the sets in the collection onto hyperedges, this can be understood as a natural generalization of the vertex cover problem to hypergraphs which is often just called vertex cover for hypergraphs and, in a more combinatorial context, transversal.|$|E

25|$|This {{technique}} involves {{solving a}} difficult problem by transforming {{it into a}} better known problem for which we have (hopefully) asymptotically optimal algorithms. The goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> reducing algorithm whose complexity is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one selection algorithm for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique {{is also known as}} transform and conquer.|$|E
25|$|Other {{computational}} {{problems with}} quasi-polynomial time solutions but no known polynomial time solution include the planted clique problem {{in which the}} goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> large clique in the union of a clique and a random graph. Although quasi-polynomially solvable, it has been conjectured that the planted clique problem has no polynomial time solution; this planted clique conjecture {{has been used as}} a computational hardness assumption to prove the difficulty of several other problems in computational game theory, property testing, and machine learning.|$|E
25|$|Since {{string theory}} {{incorporates}} {{all of the}} fundamental interactions, including gravity, many physicists hope that it fully describes our universe, making it a theory of everything.

25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> better one or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E
25|$|The cyprid larva is {{the last}} larval stage before adulthood. It is not a feeding stage; its role <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> {{suitable}} place to settle, since the adults are sessile. The cyprid stage lasts from days to weeks. It explores potential surfaces with modified antennules; once it has found a potentially suitable spot, it attaches head-first using its antennules, and a secreted glycoproteinous substance. Larvae assess surfaces based upon their surface texture, chemistry, relative wettability, colour, and the presence/absence and composition of a surface biofilm; swarming species {{are also more likely}} to attach near other barnacles. As the larva exhausts its finite energy reserves, it becomes less selective in the sites it selects. It cements itself permanently to the substrate with another proteinaceous compound, and then undergoes metamorphosis into a juvenile barnacle.|$|E

25|$|C. lectularius only feeds {{every five}} to seven days, which {{suggests}} {{that it does not}} spend the majority of its life searching for a host. When a bed bug is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches for a host. If it successfully feeds, it returns to its shelter. If it does not feed, it continues to search for a host. After searching—regardless of whether or not it has eaten—the bed bug returns to the shelter to aggregate before the photophase (period of light during a day-night cycle). Reis argues that two reasons explain why C. lectularius would return to its shelter and aggregate after feeding. One <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> mate and the other is to find shelter to avoid getting smashed after eating.|$|E
25|$|Having {{training}} aids {{may make it}} easier to become comfortable with riding a unicycle. One method for training is using a spotter to make riding easier. One other easy way to learn <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> narrow hallway {{that can be used to}} help alleviate left and right balancing while allowing a beginner to focus on forward and backward balance. If a hallway cannot be found, a fence or clothes line is suitable. Equally, riding back and forth between two chairs, faced back to back, whilst holding on to the chair backs allows the user to gauge how to appropriately position oneself before setting off. Using props such as sticks or ski poles is generally discouraged as they hinder balance and create dependence. A fall onto props could also cause serious injury.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} aim of each batsman <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> means of safely scoring runs against each bowler he faces. To do this, the batsman {{must take into}} consideration the bowler's strategy, the position of the fielders, the pitch conditions, and his own strengths and weaknesses. The strategy he will decide on will incorporate a number of preconceived attacking responses to the various deliveries he may anticipate receiving, designed specifically to score runs with minimal risk of being dismissed. The success of this strategy will be dependent upon both the accuracy of its conception and the technical ability with which it is carried out. The level of aggression of his strategy will be informed by the target run rate and the calculated risk of losing his wicket, which will be dependent upon the match situation. As such, strategies vary between the three forms of international cricket, T20, Test cricket and One Day International cricket.|$|E
