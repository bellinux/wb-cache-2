50|$|While lower {{voltages}} do not, in general, jump a {{gap that}} is present before the voltage is applied, interrupting an existing current flow with a gap often produces a low-voltage spark or arc. As the contacts are separated, {{a few small}} points of contact become the last to separate. The current becomes constricted to these small hot spots, causing them to become incandescent, so that they emit electrons (through thermionic emission). Even a small 9 V battery can spark noticeably by this mechanism in a darkened room. The ionized air and metal vapour (from the contacts) form plasma, which temporarily bridges the widening gap. If the power supply and load allow sufficient current to flow, a self-sustaining arc may form. Once formed, an arc may be extended to a significant length before breaking the circuit. Attempting to open an <b>inductive</b> <b>circuit</b> often forms an arc, since the inductance provides a high-voltage pulse whenever the current is interrupted. AC systems make sustained arcing somewhat less likely, since the current returns to zero twice per cycle. The arc is extinguished every time the current goes through a zero crossing, and must reignite during the next half-cycle to maintain the arc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Investigation of {{transition}} phenomena accompanying {{the evolution of}} metallic phase of electric arc into gaseous phase {{is very important for}} the further progress in such fields as plasma technologies, electrical apparatus, plasmatrons and other technical applications. Some aspects of this transition are considered in presented paper on the base of mathematical model described dynamics of phenomena in the arc column, near-electrode zones, anode and cathode solids. Cathode and anode phenomena such as ion bombardment, thermionic emission, inverse electron flux, evaporation, radiation, heat conduction etc. are considered in dependence on time, current, opening velocity, parameters of the gas and contact materials. The conditions of the arc transition from one phase to another are formulated in terms of above characteristics and increasing of gas ionization level. Special experiments with two contacts materials, AgCdO and 2 AgSnO have been carried to verify the mathematical model. The results of calculation and experimental data enables us to conclude that in metallic arc phase (short arc length), which is characterized by material transfer from the anode to the cathode, the erosion of 2 AgSnO contacts is considerably small than erosion of AgCdO contacts both for resistive and <b>inductive</b> <b>circuits,</b> while in gaseous arc phase (long arc length) with opposite material transfer the rate of erosion depends on the inductance. If the inductance 0 =L, then 2 AgSnO contacts have smaller erosion in comparison with AgCdO contacts, however for <b>inductive</b> <b>circuits</b> situation is quite different, thus use of AgCdO contacts in the case of long arcs burning in gaseous phase is more preferable. It was found also that the addition of niobium diselenide 2 NbSe (1 %) and tantalum Ta (5 %) into silver contact material which are sublimating into arc plasma enables to change ionization potential, that leads to decreasing of the arc temperature, arc duration and contact erosion...|$|R
