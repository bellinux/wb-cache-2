Identification of the termini in cell lines established with the three virus strains revealed that the newly transformed cell lines had a greater number of TR than did the template DNA in the producer cell line.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which herpesvirus genome ends are fused to form circles after infection and are re-formed by cleavage from concatemeric DNA are unknown. We used the simple structure of guinea pig cytomegalovirus genomes, which have either one repeated DNA sequence at each end or one repeat {{at one end and}} no repeat at the other, to study these mechanisms. In circular DNA, two restriction fragments contained <b>fused</b> <b>terminal</b> sequences and had sizes consistent with the presence of single or double terminal repeats. This result implies a simple ligation of genomic ends and shows that circularization does not occur by annealing of single-stranded terminal repeats formed by exonuclease digestion.

One element coincided with the A-rich region of a pac 2 sequence and had 9 of 11 bases identical between the two sites. The second element had six bases identical at both sites, in each case 7 bp from the termini. To confirm the presence of cis cleavage elements, a recombinant virus in which foreign sequences displaced the 6 - and 11 -bp elements 1 kb from the cleavage point was constructed. Cleavage at the disrupted site did not occur. In a second recombinant virus, restoration of 64 bases containing the 6 - and 11 -bp elements to the disrupted cleavage site restored cleavage.

40|$|Cellulose {{is one of}} {{the major}} biomass on the earth, and billions tons of that are {{produced}} a year by many biological organisms. This is because cellulose has strong mechanical strength and biological resistance, which are given by its high crystalline fibrous structure rich with hydrogen b onding network, microfibril. The gene of cellulose synthase is identified in many species, but none of them is proven to be the molecule that synthesizes cellulose microfibril. It’s because the cellulose synthase is membrane protein and forms complex. As a simple model, vinegar-producing bacterium, Gluconacetobacter xylinus is selected. It is shown in this organism that two proteins are necessary to synthesize cellulose in vitro: GxCesA and GxCesB. Then, this study focused on these proteins and aimed to analyze these structures. Experiment GxCesA and GxCesB protein were coexpressed by E. coli expression system, which was designed to have GxCesB with His 6 tag <b>fused</b> at carboxyl <b>terminal.</b> Cell membrane was isolated from the grown E. coli cells expressing GxCesA and GxCesB by differential centrifugation, and solubilized by detergent to have these two proteins in extract. The solubilized fraction was purified by metal affinity and gel filtration chromatography. In the current protocol, it is not possible to purify both GxCesA and GxCesB as the former was lost during the purification steps, and as a result highly purified GxCesB was obtained. Thi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCell-to-cell {{movement}} of potexviruses requires cognate recognition between the viral RNA, the triple gene block proteins (TGBp 1 – 3) and the coat protein (CP). cis-acting motifs required for recognition and translocation of viral RNA were identified using an artificial potexvirus defective RNA encoding a {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) reporter transcriptionally <b>fused</b> to the <b>terminal</b> viral sequences. Analysis of GFP fluorescence produced in vivo from these defective RNA constructs, referred to as chimeric RNA reporters, was used to identify viral cis-acting motifs required for RNA trafficking. Mapping experiments localized the cis-acting element to nucleotides 1 – 107 of the Potato virus X (PVX) genome. This sequence forms an RNA secondary structural element that has also been implicated in viral plus-strand accumulation [Miller, E. D., Plante, C. A., Kim, K. -H., Brown, J. W. and Hemenway, C. (1998) J. Mol. Biol. 284, 591 – 608]. While replication and movement functions associated with this region have not been separated, these {{results are consistent with}} sequence-specific recognition of RNA by the viral movement protein(s). This situation is unusual among viral movement proteins that typically function to translocate RNA between cells in a non-sequence-specific manner. These data support the concept of cis-acting elements specifying intercellular potexvirus RNA movement and thus provide a basis for dissection of RNA-mediated intercellular communication in plants...|$|R
