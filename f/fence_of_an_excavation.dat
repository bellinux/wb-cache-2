40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{requirements}} is to ensure safeguards are in place to protect workers in <b>an</b> <b>excavation</b> area from such common hazards as structural instability, cave-in, lack of egress, falls, hazardous atmosphere(s), water accumulation, and hazards associated with heavy equipment. They also help ensure that the excavation is conducted in compliance with regulatory and ESH requirements. The following requirements apply to all <b>excavations</b> that require <b>an</b> <b>excavation</b> permit and they address the period from when excavation activity begins through backfilling and/or waste disposal. They apply to university technical representatives (UTRs) and project managers (PMs) in charge <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>excavation</b> and the excavation competent person. ...|$|R
50|$|An 11th-century Norse coin was (allegedly)found in Brooklin at {{the site}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Native American trading center.

40|$|Base {{instability}} due to hydraulic uplift {{can be a}} {{major concern}} for deep excavations in soft soils with an underlying aquifer. To understand the failure mechanism <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>excavation</b> subjected to hydraulic uplift, <b>an</b> in-flight simulation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multi-propped <b>excavation</b> in soft clay with an underlying aquifer {{was carried out in}} centrifuge. Digital cameras are used to capture images of soil deformation during the in-flight test. Based on the captured digital images, soil displacements developed during excavation and hydraulic uplift are deduced by using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique coupled with a close-range photogrammetry correction. In order to verify the observed failure mechanism, a three-dimensional, elasto-plastic, coupled consolidation numerical analysis was carried out. Findings from both physical and numerical investigations are discussed and reported...|$|R
50|$|Often {{there were}} {{arbitrary}} tests {{to judge the}} worthiness of their tax payments. A chicken, for example, might be required {{to be able to}} jump over <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given height to be considered old enough or well enough to be valued for tax purposes. The restraints of serfdom on personal and economic choice were enforced through various forms of manorial customary law and the manorial administration and court baron.|$|R
30|$|Previous {{works on}} {{excavators}} {{can be found}} at [2 – 5]. Ref. [2] presents a dynamic model for an excavator with the intention <b>of</b> developing <b>an</b> automated <b>excavation</b> control system for terrestrial, lunar, and planetary excavation. The kinematics of excavators having hydraulic actuators are investigated in detail in [3]. Ref. [4] mainly focuses on a system that completely automates the truck loading task. In that system the excavator’s software decides where to dig in the soil, where to dump in the truck, and how to quickly move between these points while detecting and stopping for obstacles. The nature <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>excavation</b> process and the way it may be controlled is investigated with the intention of automatic excavation in [5].|$|R
50|$|The Tonotan Guns and Caves are <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> World War II-era {{military}} fortification on {{the island}} of Weno, the main island of Chuuk State in the Federated States of Micronesia.

The installations are located on the lower north flank of Mount Teroken, the island's highest peak.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of caves {{dug into the}} hill behind the shrine is attested since ancient times and probably have also been a refuge for robbers.
