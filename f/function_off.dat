50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{requirement}} for fast robust T/R switches, the main factor affecting good QSK operation is the ability for the radio receiver to recover its sensitivity quickly whilst operating quietly (without popping noises) {{during and after the}} fast transient signals created by the fast T/R switch operation. Many receivers have automatic gain control (AGC) circuits with time constants that take many milliseconds to recover their sensitivity and volume level after a strong transient signal is presented to their antenna input port.

50|$|The {{original}} {{construction of}} the GJMS operators used the ambient construction of Charles Fefferman and Robin Graham. A conformal density defines, in a natural way, a function on the null cone in the ambient space. The GJMS operator is defined by taking density &fnof; of the appropriate weight k &minus; n/2 and extending it arbitrarily to a function F off the null cone so that it still retains the same homogeneity. The function ΔkF, where Δ is the ambient Laplace - Beltrami operator, is then homogeneous of degree &minus;k &minus; n/2, and its restriction to the null cone {{does not depend on}} how the original function &fnof; was extended to begin with, and so is independent of choices. The GJMS operator also represents the obstruction term to a formal asymptotic solution of the Cauchy problem for extending a weight k &minus; n/2 <b>function</b> <b>off</b> the null cone in the ambient space to a harmonic function in the full ambient space.|$|E

Sleeping brains are like soldiers on a battlefield, locked in vicious biological combat. There are two armies in our brain, one army is composed of neurons, hormones, and various other chemicals to keep us awake. This army is called circadian arousal system (C). If this army would had its way, we would be awake all the time. The other army is composed by brain cells, hormones, and other chemicals, these combatants put us to sleep. They are termed the homeostatic sleep and never wake up. It's a strange paradoxical war. The more one army controls the battle, {{the more likely it is}} to lose.

The periodic sampling by mist netting capture program provided the quantitative basis for this project. Reserves of varied sizes (1 and 10 hectare) within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments project site were sampled with transects of tethered mist nets once every three or four weeks.
