50|$|The {{damage caused}} to forums is {{classified}} in several areas: first, and foremost, the admin time {{to clean the}} forum. Second, the server bandwidth to accommodate the spam postings, third, the storage requirements at the <b>forum</b> <b>server</b> for the spam messages that are devoid of content, fourth, the alienation and irritation about seeing spam by the forum community, fifth, the offense to innocent forum members if their posts are mistaken as spam or their accounts suspended in error for suspected spamming, and sixth {{but perhaps the most}} important, the lowering of the information-to-noise ratio of the forum, which diminishes the value of the forum, skewing usage/active user statistics used to determine advertising rates.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Internet forums {{provide a}} varied and graceful stage {{for those who}} have hobbies or {{interests}} in common and want to share their contents of interest with each other. Traditionally they use Client-Server (CS) model. A distinct characteristic of a Internet forum is that some registered nodes 1 periodically visit the forum. It implies that those nodes are regular visitors and can be considered relatively stable for some duration of time. The efficient use of these relatively stable nodes is very useful in a P 2 P network design, especially when the <b>forum</b> <b>server</b> is with limited bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a hybrid P 2 P network structure which is targeted for Internet forums. In the proposed system, the <b>forum</b> <b>server</b> maintains a list of registered nodes and classifies some nodes that are regularly visiting the forum with high prob-ability as stable nodes. The P 2 P network created by these stable nodes is triggered when the <b>forum</b> <b>server</b> is highly demanded due to a special event. To resolve the bandwidth shortage problem, the <b>forum</b> <b>server</b> selects stable nodes in advance, according to each node’s activity history. For the stable P 2 P node selection, we consider two types of mechanisms; a time period mechanism and a valid date window (VDW) mechanism, according to the considered time period. Then, we confirm that our proposed P 2 P model outperforms the traditional CS model through simulations. I...|$|E

5000|$|On May 12, 2009, AVSIM was {{attacked}} by a hacker, resulting in a catastrophic loss of data of the website. Tom Allensworth, CEO and Publisher of AVSIM, explained that the site used two servers to back-up the site's data, but that the hacker deleted the content of both, destroying {{the ability to use}} one server to restore the data of the other. The site had not established an external backup system. After AVSIM went offline, Allensworth issued the following announcement: “We regret to inform the flight simulation community that on Tuesday, May 12, AVSIM was hacked and effectively destroyed. The method of the hack makes recovery difficult, if not impossible, to recover from. Both servers, that was the library / email and web site / <b>forum</b> <b>servers</b> were attacked. AVSIM is totally offline at this time and we expect to be so for some time to come. We are not able to predict when we will be back online, if we can come back at all.

50|$|Around early February Garena merged all servers {{into one}} server and banned duping, however {{continued}} commerce reputation exploiting continued on the IGG servers and any ban was never enforced. This caused outrage in the <b>forums.</b> Freesky <b>servers</b> in Garena were announced to be closing {{at the beginning}} of March, on March 29 the merged super-server was moved to IGG. Compensation included bonuses for Garena's new game Dark Orbit. The game was then reduced to a single server, Athena, with the large majority of players having left. Many accounts were still active however as alternate accounts for those exploiting the commerce bugs in the game to cheat. In spring 2011 IGG announced the discontinuation of the game due to many bugs that would take too long to fix. The last server, Athena was shut down in July,2011.|$|R

25|$|On July 20, 2003, the spam {{filtering}} organization Spam Prevention Early Warning System (SPEWS) {{added an}} entire class-B subnet with the Cogent ISP to their spammer list, since Cogent was hosting a known spammer that SPEWS found difficult to block. Something Awful {{was added to}} the list in the process, disrupting its ability to communicate with its customers who were using SPEWS. Upon appeal, SPEWS initially refused to delist SA. The Something Awful administrators responded by telling their users to post their support in the Usenet newsgroup news.admin.net-abuse.blocklisting. However, that group and news.admin.net-abuse.email were flooded with off-topic posts and trolls from Something Awful users, incensing SPEWS advocates. The SA administrators claimed that SPEWS was attempting to hack the Something Awful <b>server.</b> <b>Forum</b> users responded by threatening to perform a distributed denial of service attack on SPEWS, although this type of behavior was strongly discouraged by Kyanka and assistant editor Zack Parsons.|$|R
40|$|We {{offered an}} {{experimental}} graduate course {{built around a}} World Wide Web-based collaborative learning experience; five graduate students participated. The World Wide Web served as the primary platform on which knowledge was compiled, shared, and synthesized. We built a WWW-based annotated bibliography and synthesized information from several disciplines. Net Forum-based discussions included student responses to questions posed by the instructors and by other students. The Web was valued most {{as a tool for}} information dispersal. As a result, students learned more from their peers than they had in other courses. However, students found brainstorming and 2 ̆ 2 conversation 2 ̆ 2 using Net <b>Forum,</b> a list <b>server,</b> and electronic mail cumbersome and intimidating. Participants noted a need for personal contact to develop the sense of community critical to fruitful collaboration. Complex issues were brought to closure in several face-to-face meetings. In future offerings, we envision an extended course that begins with community-building meetings (live or video) before migrating to intense WEb-based collaboration. We will use the Web 2 ̆ 7 s text and image capabilities for sharing complex information over long distances and time periods, and we will downplay the expectation of immediate response and focus instead on considered response. We will use Web-based conferencing technology for brainstorming and real-time interaction among participants.

40|$|Most new {{technologies}} are extensions {{of ideas and}} concepts of the past. e-Learning using the World Wide Web is no exception, as early versions imitated either the page turning of books, or the instructor controlled classrooms of modern schooling. Only now, a decade and half after {{the invention of the}} Web have new forms of learning and teaching emerged that use the unique possibilities of networked communications, sharing and collaboration. These new forms of education and training are possible because of the qualities of the network, and are likely to change teaching and learning forever. Microsoft SharePoint is software developed for business environments that excels in the management of communications, sharing and collaboration. Because of that, it has great potential as the core technology for new ways of learning. This paper explores these possibilities, and shows how SharePoint, in conjunction with a robust learning management system, can be a “whole product ” in regards to the changes that are now occurring in the field of education and training. From “Page Turner ” to Complexity The Internet started as a way for messages to be transferred from one computer at a university or research lab to another computer in the network. E-mail and file transfer were the original educational applications as academics learned that they could distribute their digital documents to others without using paper. Rudimentary discussion <b>forums</b> and list <b>servers</b> were based on early e-mail protocols. The idea of computer-based education first emerged in the late 1950 s with proposals for building “teaching machines”. In the 1960 s, Donald L. Bitzer started the PLATO system (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operation), which was expanded and develope...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} interview, Dr. Yunlong Xia (email: mailto:yxia@icipe. org xia@icipe. org), Head of the Information Technology and Bioinformatics Department at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) in Kenya, {{provided}} {{an overview of}} the status of and trends in the use of ICTs in the field of IPM in developing countries. In what ways are ICTs helping to control pests? As a systems approach to pest control, IPM has benefited significantly {{from a wide range of}} ICT applications. In a [URL] recent review, Andrew Bartlett, Senior IPM Programme Development Officer at the FAO, categorized the various fields of IPM in which ICTs are being applied. These fields can be grouped as follows: IPM policy making and extension services; pest identification; IPM information dissemination and sharing; Internet-based decision support tools; and ICT-supported training. Can you describe these fields? By facilitating international communications and the sharing of resources and information, Internet-based networks have enhanced both the development of IPM policies and the effectiveness of IPM extension services. Initiatives such as the [URL] Africa IPM Forum at ICIPE, the www. fao. org/globalipmfacility/ Global IPM Facility at FAO, the CGIAR´s www. cgiar. org/spipm/ System-wide IPM Programme and many other [URL] online resources have helped decision makers and regional agricultural officers become more aware of the benefits of IPM approaches, and have contributed to the adoption and successful implementation of IPM policies in many developing countries. What´s more, these networks have enabled many extension services to improve their outreach, and with the assistance of ICTs in farm field schools and telecentres, many farmers in developing countries are now practising IPM techniques. ICT applications such as CD-ROMs and web-based tools for pest identification have been developed for a wide range of users, from farmers to students and researchers. Examples include the FAO´s www. ecoport. org EcoPort initiative, CABI´s Crop Protection Compendium and [URL] PEST CABWeb, Cornell University´s www. nysaes. cornell. edu/ent/hortcrops/ Global Crop Pest Identification and Information Services, and the pest identification software and CD-ROMs produced by the www. cbit. uq. edu. au/ Centre of Biological Information Technology. Information dissemination and sharing have contributed to the implementation of IPM solutions for a wide range of pest problems. For example, initiatives such as www. IPMnet. org IPMNet, www. ag. vt. edu/ail/ Africa IPM a and www. ag. vt. edu/ipmcrsp/ IPM CRSP have developed a variety of effective ICT channels for disseminating information, such as websites, online databases and discussion <b>forums,</b> email list <b>servers</b> and multimedia CD-ROMs. In particular, the [URL] IPM Communications Workshop for Eastern/Southern Africa (ICWESA) in 1998 led to the establishment of regional online IPM collaborative networks for information sharing, including the Africa IPM Forum and Africa IPM a listserver. Internet-based decision support systems provide users with all the information they need to select the most appropriate pest control strategy, including means of pest identification, pest life cycles, sampling and decision-making criteria, sampling threshold calculations, and pest distribution models aed to weather monitoring systems. They also offer details of environmentally friendly biocontrol methods, as well as of available pesticides and their safety risks and environmental impacts. These applications could be further improved with the addition of ´intelligent´ functions such as [URL] e-learning tools and dynamic simulations of crop ecosystems. IPM training materials for many crop systems are available on [URL] CD-ROM or online. ICTs have also provided convenient ways to offer training via www. ent. iastate. edu/list/online_courses. html virtual campuses or distance learning courses tailored to the needs of the scientific community or farmers and extensionists. Many of the training materials can be used as reference materials by users in ACP countries, or have even been specifically developed for individual developing countries. What are some of the trends in IPM? With the growing range of mobile ICT applications, such as web-capable mobile phones, handheld computers and global positioning systems (GPS), IPM practitioners will be able to access relevant information anywhere, at any time. This may inspire insect informatics experts to create IPM information and products that are relevant for specific locations at particular times. As a result, I believe that in the future more web-based intelligent information systems will be developed that will allow users to access real-time online information that is relevant to their needs, rather than the technology-driven products that are currently available.
