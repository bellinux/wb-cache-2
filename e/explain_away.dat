25|$|Unable {{to either}} reduce or explain the {{evolution}} of the higher elements of our world, naturalism is left to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> the higher elements as mere illusions. In doing this, naturalism condemns us to a scepticism in the both epistemology and ethics. It is worth noting, that while Schiller's work has been largely neglected since his death, Schiller's arguments against a naturalistic account of evolution have been recently cited by advocates of intelligent design to establish the existence of a longer history for the view due to legal concerns in the United States (See: Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District).|$|E
25|$|Questions {{surfaced}} {{about the}} value of the instruments he had donated to the Smithsonian and the NJSO. Although the instruments were all old and valuable, several unnamed experts determined them not to be the instruments he represented them as, and not to be as valuable as he claimed. He was said to have invented histories for the instruments to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> doubts or to increase their worth. On April 13, 2004, Axelrod was indicted in federal court in New Jersey, accused of funnelling millions of dollars into Swiss bank accounts over 20 years without paying taxes. The following April 21, he failed to appear for his arraignment, having fled to Cuba. He was arrested in Berlin on June 15, 2004 as he got off a plane from Switzerland, and then extradited to the United States. On March 21, 2005 he was sentenced in U.S. court to 18 months in prison for tax fraud.|$|E
25|$|Austin {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on WWE programming in a year at WrestleMania 21 where he was confronted by Roddy Piper in Piper's Pit, until Carlito interrupted to insult both. This resulted in Carlito receiving a stunner from Austin and Piper throwing {{him out of the}} ring. The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a Stone Cold Stunner as well. Austin was involved in the concluding segment at ECW One Night Stand in which he had a beer bash with the ECW locker room and brawled with the anti-ECW invaders, led by Eric Bischoff. He returned at Raw Homecoming, delivering Stone Cold Stunners to Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, Stephanie McMahon and Linda McMahon. An angle including Jim Ross being fired led to a match in which Austin agreed to face Jonathan Coachman at Taboo Tuesday, with the stipulation of Ross regaining his announcing job had Austin won and Austin losing his own job had he lost. Austin hurt his back prior to the match and could not wrestle unless he was heavily medicated, so the match was cancelled. To <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> his failure to appear at Taboo Tuesday, Vince McMahon said on Raw that Austin had been involved in an accident, thus preventing him from competing. Batista substituted for Austin, defeating Coachman along with Vader and Goldust. The stipulation was dropped due to Austin not competing.|$|E

25|$|May 2002 {{also saw}} the revelation that the new public works minister, Don Boudria, had spent the weekend of March 16–17, 2002 at an estate owned by Claude Boulay, the {{president}} of Groupe Everest advertising firm that head received $55million in contracts from the public works ministry, apparently for free. Only after the story of Boudria's stay at the Boulay estate broke in May did Boulay cash an $800 cheque from Boudria that was dated March 16, 2002; many found this to be too convenient, and opposition critics suggested that the cheque had been post-dated to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> what {{would otherwise have been}} a major ethical violation on the part of Boudria. Boudria was forced to resign on 26 May, to be replaced with Ralph Goodale. An additional scandal broke later in May 2002 when it was revealed that the Defence Minister Art Eggleton had rewarded a contract worth $36, 500 to research mental illness amongst former soldiers to his former lover Maggie Maier without tender {{while at the same time}} the Defence Ministry had already hired a team of experts to research the same subject. As Eggleton was a Paul Martin supporter, Chrétien promptly fired him on May 27, 2002, following a ruling from Howard Wilson that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules. Some such as the columnist Don Martin believed that Wilson's swift running against the Martinista Eggleton was suspicious with Martin writing Wilson had within a day ruled that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules while Martin wrote: “But what would you call the prime minister’s chat with a Crown corporation banker to bail out a hotel linked to a golf course he may still have an interest in? Funny, ethics counsellor Howard Wilson was in a “see no evil” monkey mode on that score”.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn {{argued that it}} was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical. Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> failures by claiming that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research, and so [...] "they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise." [...] While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.|$|E

In 2007, former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game's staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence; [...] "there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game". Williams explained that the game [...] "just made us all feel icky. It was all about the violence, and it was realistic violence. We all knew there was no way we could <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> that game. There was no way to rationalize it. We were crossing a line." ...|$|E

[...] The strip's title character, The Baron, was an impoverished English nobleman, a tramp inspired by Charles Dickens and Charlie Chaplin. [...] He and his valet Grimes would plot ways to get by. [...] Herriman later introduced the main characters' wives, and after a run as a domestic strip, with occasional appearances of characters from Krazy Kat's world, it ended in January 1919.

500|$|The inquest {{was unable}} to {{determine}} Cancellor's exact cause of death, but noted several inconsistencies in Hopley's explanation of events. He had failed to summon a doctor immediately and, upon questioning, had given outlandish excuses for his failure to do so. Hopley attempted to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> {{the blood on the}} candlestick by attributing it to a broken blister on his hand, but did not offer an explanation for Cancellor's injuries. Hopley aroused further suspicion when he asked journalists present at the inquest not to include details of the corporal punishment in their stories, [...] "in order to spare the feelings of the deceased family as of my own". Cancellor's family was deeply affected by the case, as they had been [...] "disinclined" [...] to see Cancellor beaten; his father died shortly after the inquest of a [...] "broken heart".|$|E
500|$|Detzner made {{attempts}} to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> specific ambiguities, contradictions, and errors. In 1915, he said, {{he lost his}} surveying instruments while eluding an Australian patrol, which explained why many of his assertions were vague and inconclusive, and his calculations inaccurate. [...] This was true, the Australians did find a box of Detzner's equipment in the location where the missionary Johann Flierl's oldest son, Wilhelm, had kept (or stored) his small canoe. [...] Although Wilhelm denied helping Detzner and his men, the Australians arrested him. The event coincided with one of Detzner's narrow escapes from Australian patrols in 1915 and was inadvertently corroborated in 1919 by the angry letter to The Argus's editor. [...] Some of Detzner's assertions could be sustained through observable physical evidence: he had reportedly wasted to a mere [...] while roaming in the bush, which should not have happened, some supporters claimed, if he had indeed been {{under the protection of}} Keyser and Thiele. On the other hand, this weight loss could also have been due to his debilitating illness in 1917.|$|E

500|$|Doug Pratt, a DVD {{reviewer}} and Rolling Stone contributor, {{thought the}} episode's story was [...] "nicely composed, so you don't {{have to recognize}} the Citizen Kane references to appreciate the effort, but it adds to the fun." [...] He also noted that it begins the exploration of Mr. Burns [...] "in earnest, {{the first of many}} characters who will receive elaborate coverage as the series advances." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk thought both Lisa's [...] "tremendous intellect" [...] and Marge's [...] "moral compass" [...] were [...] "probed" [...] in the episode, and he thought one [...] "clear highlight" [...] of the episode was Burns's attempts to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> Blinky's mutation by turning to an actor portraying Charles Darwin who proceeds to give a speech suggesting that Blinky is merely advanced. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "The episode took an unusual approach for an early show, as it focused largely on a secondary character. One could argue that season one’s 'Krusty Gets Busted' did the same, but 'Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish' provided a heavier emphasis on Burns than that prior program did Krusty. This helped make it a fairly good episode. It fleshed out Burns’ character a little better and gave us a reasonably entertaining experience. The episode fell short of greatness, but it worked nicely for the most part." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "masterful".|$|E

Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> those special cases where it does appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties.

2500|$|While {{constructing}} original fantasy worlds {{with detailed}} histories, geographies and political landscapes {{had been a}} part of the genre from the time of L. Frank Baum, Tolkien's influence greatly popularized the notion. This led to a subsequent decline of such devices as dream frames to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> the fantastical nature of the setting. [...] This stemmed not only from his example, but from his literary criticism; his [...] "On Fairy Stories", in which he termed such settings [...] "secondary worlds," [...] was a formative work of fantasy criticism.|$|E
2500|$|In his Harmony of the Gospels, Augustine of Hippo {{produced}} a 5th-century attempt to <b>explain</b> <b>away</b> {{all of the}} apparent contradictions he was aware of.

Writer and Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat has gone further, arguing that [...] "a television series which embraces both the ideas of parallel universes {{and the concept of}} changing time can't have a continuity error – it's impossible for Doctor Who to get it wrong, because we can just say 'he changed time'".|$|E
