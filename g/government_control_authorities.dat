50|$|The {{administrative}} {{system of the}} Kingdom was firstly drawn by a law on June 8, 1805. The state was divided, following the French system, in 14 départements, the twelve ones inherited from the republican era plus Adda (Sondrio) and Adige (Verona). The chief of the department, the prefect, was the State's representative in each province, improved the administrative decisions of the central <b>government,</b> <b>controlled</b> the local <b>authorities,</b> led of the police and, differently from the republican era, had all the executive powers in its territory.

5000|$|At that time, {{there was}} no <b>{{government}}</b> and central <b>controlling</b> <b>authority</b> in Swat [...] Wali Ahmad wanted a united government of Swat to eliminate {{the influence of the}} Nawab of neighboring Dir. The Khans of Swat supported him. The people of upper Swat, under the command of Sandakai Mullah, defeated the Nawab in 1914, which made the former a political leader. [...] Sandakai Mullah was desirous f having a centralized organization Swat. Thus,Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah of Sithanah was made ruler of Swat in 1915. [...] But he could not managed to protect Swat from the attacks of Nawab of Dir. Sandakai Mullah, who had first brought and made Abdul Jabbar Shah [...] as king in Swat, drove him out and enthroned Miangul Abdul Wadud as the ruler of Swat, thus playing the role of king maker and king breaker.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{exchange}} rate model as solution of a disutility based drift control problem. Assuming the exchange rate {{is a function of}} the fundamental, we suppose that <b>Government</b> <b>Authorities</b> <b>control</b> the fundamental's dynamics aimed at minimizing the discounted expected disutility derived by the distance between the fundamental and some specific stochastic target. The theoretical model is solved using the dynamic programming approach and introducing the concept of viscosity solution. We contribute to research on exchange rate control policies by deriving the optimal interventions aimed at stabilizing the exchange rate and preserving macroeconomic stability. We also show that, under particular conditions, it is possible to derive the optimal width of the currency band. ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, the {{government}} declared a State of Emergency. This consisted of allowing security forces to detain people up to 56 days without trial, confiscating the property of communities allegedly in retaliation for acts of violence, and restricting the right to assembly and movement. A 'prohibited zone' was created along the Somali border, and the death penalty was made mandatory for unauthorised possession of firearms. [...] "Special courts" [...] without guarantee of due process were also created. The northeast—declared a [...] "special district" [...] - was subject to nearly unfettered <b>government</b> <b>control,</b> including the <b>authority</b> to detain, arrest or forcibly move individuals or groups, as well as confiscate possessions and land. However, as part of its effort to reassure the public, the Voice of Kenya was warned not to refer to the conflict as a [...] "border dispute", while a special government committee decided to refer to the rebels as [...] "shiftas" [...] to minimise the political nature of the war.|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{the effects}} of {{ownership}} structure on efficiency has received considerable attention in the aviation management literature. Commercialization has been widely employed both in developing and developed countries {{as a means of}} increasing operational efficiency. Since airports and seaports are operationally similar, this paper examines the literature and methods used to assess {{the effects of}} privatization in both types of infrastructure. We observe that the impact of privatization on performance depends not only on the degree of privatization but on the competition in the market. Following a 4 -level specification commonly employed in the seaport literature that captures degrees of privatization, we estimate a stochastic frontier model for airport efficiency as a function of ownership. We conclude that airport authorities in the United States are equally as efficient as fully privatized airports elsewhere, due to a high degree of competition and fiscal independence from the other governmental entities. Additionally, while privatization may be an effective mechanism of introducing corporatization into infrastructures that are characterized by poor competition and direct <b>government</b> <b>control,</b> the airport <b>authority</b> appears to achieve the benefits of privatization in operation without actual transfer of ownership...|$|R

40|$|In the article, {{the author}} has proven that state <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> had an {{important}} function in the organizational structure of the government authorities of our country. The author also drives {{attention to the fact}} that, in the Soviet period, government leaders implemented the idea of a system of <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> that were to a substantial extent composed of blue collars. An extensive network of <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> operating on location was active in the 80 ies of the 20 th century. The historical experience of regional <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> is considered in article, and Moscow <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> are taken as an example. The author demonstrates that the Moscow City Committee, regional committees, groups and posts of people's control organized at enterprises and other organizations drove particular attention to the issues of construction, the building industry as a whole and to the accomplishments of the municipal economy; they also supervised over the implementation of ecological and nature protection actions, monitored the condition and repairs of public health service buildings; they resolved the issues of education, culture, available housing, housing preparation for the winter season, etc. Actions taken in the aftermath of inspections held by people's <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> were aimed at the improvement of the ecological condition of Moscow, and they resolved the problems of urban construction. Multiple assignments performed by people's <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> made it possible to substantially improve the quality of their inspections and to combine the controlling efforts {{within the framework of the}} municipal economy. Coordination of combined inspections promoted reduction in the overall number of inspections. The present-day building sector of the Russian capital can benefit from the experience of Moscow people's <b>control</b> <b>authorities,</b> their well-coordinated <b>controlling</b> activities within the construction industry and the prior accomplishments of the municipal economy.

We then show that a “passive ” agent can provide no guarantees on performance beyond what is afforded by the priors, and that an “omnipotent ” agent, capable of infinite <b>control</b> <b>authority,</b> can achieve arbitrarily good performance (asymptotically).
