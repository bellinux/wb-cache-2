Objectives: Summary of theoretical knowledge of the rotator cuff conditions and their treatment using physical therapy. Case study of a patient diagnosed with rotator cuff syndrome. Methods: The general part covers conditions of the rotator cuff, the impingement syndrome and physiotherapy methods used in pathology of the subacromial space. It also includes anatomy, kinesiology and biomechanics of the shoulder <b>girdle.</b> <b>Case</b> study of a patient with diagnosed with rotator cuff syndrome is described in the special part. Therapy plan was determined {{on the basis of}} history and input kinesiology analysis and the effect of therapy was evaluated after individual therapies and output kinesiology analysis. Results: Motion in the patient's shoulder joint is painfree. Range of motion is increased in both flexion and abduction, and muscle strength is increased too. The patient was advised to continue physical therapy. Keywords: shoulder joint, impingement syndrome, rotator cuff, shoulder arthroscopy, physiotherap...|$|E
50|$|The appendicular {{skeleton}} is {{the portion}} of the skeleton of vertebrates consisting of the bones or cartilage that support the appendages. Appendages appeared as fins in early fish, and subsequently evolved into the limbs of tetrapods. The appendicular skeleton includes the skeletal elements within the limbs, as well as supporting pectoral and pelvic <b>girdles</b> in the <b>case</b> of tetrapods (these are lacking in fish). The word appendicular is the adjective of the noun appendage, which itself means a part that is joined to something larger.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the etiopathogenesis, {{symptoms}} and treatment of thoracic outlet syn-drome (TOS). In 80 % of the treated cases, patients suffered from pain in their compressed shoulder plexus. Both conservative treatment and systematic rehabilitation therapy are successful and lessen the above symp-toms, which leads to regression of the above symptoms from the side of the shoulder plexus. Herewith are presented some considerations on early diagnosis and treatment of a vascular form of thoracic outlet syndrome. The emphasis has been put on the long-term results of the operation treatment. The case has been presented that when TOS appears together with recurrent vascular complications, condi-tions develop which may result in the loss of a limb or lead to invalidism. The only possible treatment in such a case appears to be resection of the first rib providing there is no incorrect anatomy in the area of the shoulder <b>girdle.</b> In <b>case</b> of acute thrombosis, endovascular treatment is applied together with operative pro-cedure of decompression. Such treatment and therapy make it possible for the patients to make a full and speedy recovery from their illness.

40|$|The {{content of}} the {{following}} thesis {{was to determine whether}} locomotion through the shoulder <b>girdle</b> in our <b>case,</b> kayaking and paddling simulator, made the same timing of muscle involvement. Muscle loops run in a diagonal character and chaining muscle groups depending on the imposition of puncta fixa, proximal or distal. Locomotion research provided through the shoulder girdle will be made at kayaking, which is typical for this locomotion. Movement is carried trunk muscles, shoulders and upper limbs. There is, however, also activate the muscles of the lower limbs, motion pattern is becoming global and it also serves to link with the ship. The research objective was to determine the {{content of the}} kinesiology of movement while the frame forward to kayaking gear, and its comparison with other types of locomotion made through the shoulder girdle. According to the timing of muscle involvement can specify a "reference framework map of coordinating locomotion. Successive order to evaluate differences in timing of muscle involvement in different types of activities and determine the effectiveness of their use as training resources for performance paddlers. Electromyographycaly we watched the activity of selected muscles in repeated actions: typical human locomotion braiding shoulder, while kayaking and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The sensorial {{function}} of the girdle of the Polyplacophora Carmen Salas 1, Antonio G. Checa 2, 3, Michael J. Vendrasco 2 1 Depto. Biología Animal, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Málaga, 29071 Málaga, Spain; 2 Departamento de Estratigrafía y Paleontología, Universidad de Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain, 3 Instituto Andaluz de Ciencias de la Tierra, CSIC-Universidad de Granada, 18100 Armilla, Spain. The polyplacophorans or chitons are characterized {{by the presence of}} eight dorsal overlapping shell plates that are embedded in a thick mantle tissue and surrounded by the girdle (also called perinotum). In chitons, the hard layers of plates consist of the uppermost tegmentum, the articulamentum whose projections form the sutural laminae and insertion plates, and the underlying hypostracum. The tegmentum, which is the visible layer of the chiton shell in life, is infiltrated with a complex, tissue-filled canal system that opens at the dorsal valve surface as sensory or secretory organs known as aesthetes. Structures secreted by the epidermis of the girdle have been mainly described as ornamentation or armature, such as numerous calcareous spines, scales, hairs or bristles, but other studies suggest that the girdle epidermis has other functions such as sensorial (Leise and Cloney, 1982; Leise, 1988). In chitons, epidermal sensory receptors have been mainly found around the mouth, on the subradular organ, in the buccal cavity, in the pallial grooves and in the shell. During a study of the formation of the cuticle in the mantle girdle of several species of chitons (Lepidozona pectinulata, Ischnochiton rissoi, Lepidochitona cinerea, Leptochiton algesirensis, Lepidopleurus cajetanus), we have observed several sensory structures in the mantle <b>girdle.</b> In the <b>case</b> of fully-grown scales and marginal spines, a group of cells differentiated from the papilla constitutes a stalked body or nodule, which progressively elevates and pushes the spine until it finally, pierces through the cuticle surface. The stalked nodules are more conspicuous in L. cinerea and L. pectinulata than in L. cajetanus. These projections arise from epidermal papillae and have been considered mechanoreceptors. Lens-like structures have been observed inside some stalked nodules in L. cinerea and L. algesirensis. The stalked nodules show dendritic structures underlying the lens-like structure, which point to a photoreception ability. The lens-like structure found in the nodule of L. cinerea seems to be a rigid, possibly mineralized structure. Aragonite lenses have been found in Acanthopleura granulata by Speiser et al. (2011). In L. algesirensis we have observed groups of long microvilli in the top margin of the papillae and in contact with the spines that we consider as mechanoreceptors. As in other chitons, dendritic processes are frequently found in association mainly with dorsal spicules, although not every spine is innervated. Universidad de Málaga.
