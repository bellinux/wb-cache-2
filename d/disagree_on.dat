All {{seem to agree}} on his graduation from William and Mary in 1806 and admission to the bar in 1807. Sources <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> matriculation and graduation dates, as well as Crittenden's age and the duration of his studies at the other institutions.|$|E
5|$|E. : ForaDeJogo and the Portuguese League for Professional Football <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> {{who came}} on as a {{substitute}} in the match against Sporting Covilhã. ForaDeJogo says that Mendes played in the match, meaning he played in 5 league matches for Aves in the 2008–09 season. However, the Portuguese League for Professional Football does not.|$|E
5|$|Historians <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> {{the year}} of Ajtony's defeat; it may have {{occurred}} in 1002, 1008 or between 1027 and 1030. His ethnicity is also a subject of historical debate; {{he may have been}} Hungarian, Kabar, Pecheneg or Romanian. In Romanian historiography Ajtony is viewed as the last member of a Romanian ruling family founded by Glad, lord of Banat around 900 according to the Gesta Hungarorum.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that out of 39,000 Jews in the country only 9,000 survived; the rest were either killed or deported to Germany, both by the local authorities and the German Army itself. Croatian and Serbian sources <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> the exact figures.|$|E
5|$|Sources <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> {{the timing}} of the {{dispatching}} of the various vessels. A number of sources (Frothingham and A Documentary History of Chelsea among them) claim that Diana, Britannia, and the barges were all dispatched together; Nelson and Ketchum, possibly on the basis of more recent research, claim the account as told above.|$|E

Sources <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> {{the total number of}} fatalities in the Gospić massacre, with estimates ranging from nearly 100 to 120 killed. The official figures indicate that a total of 123 persons went missing in the area of Gospić between 1991–95.|$|E

He and Gardner often <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> what makes a good trade, which can lead to minor conflicts between the two and the shop's other employees.|$|E
5|$|Yates and Warren {{also named}} Dvinosauria, a clade of small aquatic temnospondyls from the Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic. They placed Dvinosauria within Limnarchia, but more recent studies <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> their position. For example, a 2007 study places {{them even more}} basal than euskelians, while a 2008 study keeps them as basal limnarchians.|$|E
5|$|Art historians <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> {{when and}} why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian {{architecture}}. Byzantine churches and {{the architecture of}} Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles.|$|E

5|$|Critics <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> Tristano's {{importance}} in jazz history. Max Harrison {{indicated that the}} pianist had limited influence outside his own group of affiliated musicians; Robert Palmer, who pointed out that only one of Tristano's albums was in print {{at the time of}} his death, suggested that he was pivotal in the change from 1940s modern jazz to the freer styles of subsequent decades; and Thomas Albright similarly believed that his improvising prepared and developed new ground in the history of the music.|$|E
5|$|During the turmoil, Harald {{was arrested}} and imprisoned, but the sources <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> the grounds. The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, {{as well as for}} {{requesting}} marriage with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe, called Maria (his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress because she wanted to marry Harald herself). William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor. The sources also <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape {{in the midst of the}} revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).|$|E
5|$|Following a career-ending {{illness or}} injury (the sources <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> the cause), which {{left him in}} {{constant}} pain, Barbette returned to Texas but continued {{to work as a}} consultant for motion pictures as well as training and choreographing aerial acts for a number of circuses. After years of dealing with chronic pain, Barbette committed suicide on August 5, 1973. Both in life and following his death, Barbette served as an inspiration to a number of artists, including Jean Cocteau and Man Ray.|$|E

5|$|Scholars <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> the {{possible}} {{period of the}} church's construction; assessments range from the 11th–12th, through the 12th–13th, to the 13th–14th century. In {{an article in the}} Bulgarian Church Review magazine from 1898, the local priest Mihal Popov was cited as saying that a stone from the church altar was unearthed during excavations. The priest believed that the stone, which reportedly had the date 1160 inscribed on it, was sent to the National Archaeological Museum in the capital Sofia.|$|E
5|$|Sources <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> the house's initial {{construction}} date, and {{no records}} survive of its construction. There is some archaeological evidence dating {{parts of the}} building to the 15th century; William Robinson's History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham (1840) suggests a date of about 1514, although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late 16th century. Nikolaus Pevsner speculates the front may have formed part of a courtyard house of which the remainder has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and <b>disagree</b> <b>on</b> others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E
