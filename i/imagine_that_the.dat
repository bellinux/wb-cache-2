We might <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> colors along such a line are all perceived as having the same hue. In reality, this does not hold true, and a hue shift is perceived. Correspondingly, if we plot colors that are perceived as having the same hue (and only differing in purity) we will obtain a curved line.|$|E
25|$|One {{might at}} first <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> economy of {{argument}} {{involved with the}} Kurgan solution should oblige us to accept it outright. But critics do exist and their objections can be summarized quite simply– {{almost all of the}} arguments for invasion and cultural transformations are far better explained without reference to Kurgan expansions, and most of the evidence so far presented is either totally contradicted by other evidence or is the result of gross misinterpretation of the cultural history of Eastern, Central, and Northern Europe.|$|E

The {{president of the company}} should be able to access the formula when needed, but in an emergency any 3 of the 12 board members would be able to unlock the secret formula together. This can be accomplished by a secret sharing scheme with t = 3 and n = 15, where 3 shares are given to the president, and 1 is given to each board member.|$|E

The Guardian Danny Leigh has compared the script's reputation among film fans to those of Sergei Eisenstein's unproduced adaptation of An American Tragedy and Michael Powell's [...] unmade adaptation of The Tempest. Leigh recalled having read a photocopied version of the script in the early 1990s, and felt that it [...] "might have aged far better than Wild at Heart". Film-maker Jonathan Caouette has expressed interest in reviving the project, though he believes Lynch will [...] "do it someday".|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} practical {{obstacle to}} a completely democratically elected and representative UNPA is that, {{in contrast to}} the situation in which the European Parliament functions, a significant number of UN members, including populous countries such as China are not electoral democracies. In the past, bodies such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights were criticized for being dominated by abusive regimes. If UNPA representatives were to be drawn from member nations' parliaments, it could create legitimacy concerns since some national legislatures are regarded as a rubber stamp for the rulers' decrees. Some global parliament proponents, such as Prof. Lucio Levi, propose starting a federation limited to democracies: [...] "Though the democratization of states all over the world hasn’t been completed, this does not preclude starting the democratization of the UN. Six Western European countries founded the European Community, starting its democratization without waiting for the democratization of the institutions of all the European states." [...] UNA-USA's Jeff Laurenti notes the problems associated with excluding undemocratic countries from membership: [...] "It is one thing to deny membership to a few small [...] "rogue" [...] dictatorships. It is quite another to exclude China, the vast majority of Arab countries, and two-thirds of Africa, and <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resulting body can have a formal consultative or oversight role with United Nations agencies, be part of UN-sponsored negotiations on multilateral conventions (the real work of international legislating), or pass on the resolutions of UN political bodies." ...|$|E
