50|$|Although we {{have come}} into the modern society, in Shaxi, an old street still {{remained}} almost perfect. The old street {{is parallel to the}} Qipu Lake and it is 1.5 kilometers long. At each side, the constructions display quaint and elegant style. Whether the roofs, the windows or the doors, they all have fine carved patterns. The space between houses and houses constitutes a long narrow lane.In recent days, on account of the investigation by the town <b>government,</b> some <b>bronze</b> persons who have different gestures are standing in the street. Almost every tour group coming here will choose to take photos with these vivid bronze persons. Nowadays, this old street has become a symbol of Shaxi without doubt.|$|R

5000|$|Following Scott's {{death in}} 1866, {{veterans}} and other citizens began lobbying for {{a monument to}} honor the general. On March 3, 1867, Congress authorized $35,000 for the erection of an equestrian statue. [...] The monument was reauthorized by Congress on July 15, 1870, and on June 10, 1872. [...] The artist selected was Henry Kirke Brown (1814 - 1886), a sculptor from New York whose 1856 equestrian statue of George Washington in Union Square, Manhattan, had been well received by critics. His other works in Washington, D.C. include Major General Nathanael Greene in Stanton Park and busts of Vice Presidents George Clinton and John C. Breckinridge, poet William Cullen Bryant, Major General Philip Kearny, and Senators Henry Clay and Richard Stockton.The model of the statue was completed around 1872. [...] The federal <b>government</b> contributed <b>bronze</b> cannons captured by Scott during the Mexican-American War to use for casting the statue. [...] Before the casting began, descendants of Scott saw the model and protested the design. Brown had designed the horse {{to be a small}} mare, which Scott preferred to ride, instead of a stallion. The descendants argued that no other general had been portrayed riding a mare and that a horse with flared nostrils and arched neck would be more suitable. Brown was annoyed by the requests and only made minimal modifications to the design, resulting in Scott, a tall and heavy man measuring 6.5 ft and weighing 300 lb, riding a small mare with the external genitalia of a stallion. [...] The statue was founded by Robert Wood & Company, whose other works in Washington, D.C. include Major General Nathanael Greene, Major General James B. McPherson and General John A. Rawlins.|$|R
500|$|In 119 BC, the <b>government</b> {{issued the}} <b>bronze</b> wushu (五銖) coin {{weighing}} the coin remained the standard currency in China until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). During the brief interruptive Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) of Wang Mang (45 BC– 23 AD), the government introduced several new denominations in 7, 9, 10, and 14 AD. These new units (including bronze knife money, gold, silver, tortoise, and cowry shell currencies) often had a market price unequal to their weight and debased {{the value of}} coin currency. Once the widespread civil wars following Wang's overthrow abated, the wushu coin was reintroduced by Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25–57 AD) in 40 AD at the instigation of Ma Yuan (14 BC– 49 AD). Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight, the central government closed all commandery mints in 113 BC and granted the central government's Superintendent of Waterways and Parks the exclusive right to mint coins. Although the issue of central government coinage {{was transferred to the}} office of the Minister of Finance (one of Nine Ministers of the central government) by the beginning of Eastern Han, the central government's monopoly over the issue of coinage persisted.|$|R
