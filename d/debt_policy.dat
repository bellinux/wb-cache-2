40|$|Several studies, {{using data}} from recent years have shown that firms with large boards have lower market valuations. The {{results of this study}} {{indicate}} that this held true even during the Great Depression years. On investigating the investment and <b>debt</b> <b>policies</b> during this period, I find that firms with larger boards made greater investments during the Depression. Further, the results show that firms with large boards had less than average leverage before the Depression and more than average leverage during the Depression. Finally, I find that the investment and <b>debt</b> <b>policies</b> followed by large boards had a negative impact on the firm’s profitability. The results from this study are in line with agency theory, although there may be other explanations for the results.

Finally, we derive closed-form solutions for equity betas, which differ from the formulas that have traditionally been used to lever and unlever equity betas. ...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the simultaneity of corporate hedging and <b>debt</b> <b>policies.</b> Using a pooled sample of Indonesian non-financial listed firms covering the periods of 1996 - 2001, the present study finds evidence that corporate hedging and <b>debt</b> <b>policies</b> are simultaneously determined. That is, the use of debts motivate firms to hedge; but simultaneously, hedging increases debt capacity and induces firms to borrow more in order to take advantage of the tax benefits arising from additional debt capacity. Another important finding is that financially distressed firms –as indicated by their debt restructuring programs– are less motivated to hedge, because such firms will see that the option values of their equity will increase as their cash-flow volatilities increase. Therefore, financially distressed firms tend not to hedge; or at least, hedge lesser compared to those of firms that do not experience financial distress...|$|R

We then examine the appropriate <b>debt</b> management <b>policy</b> for the consolidated government. We argue that traditional considerations favoring longer-term debt may be overstated, and suggest that there are several advantages to issuing greater quantities of short-term debt. Under current institutional arrangements, neither the Federal Reserve nor the Treasury is caused to view <b>debt</b> management <b>policy</b> {{on the basis of the}} overall national interest.
