40|$|The spinal reflex {{depressant}} {{mechanism of}} tolperisone {{and some of}} its structural analogs with central muscle relaxant action was investigated. Tolperisone (50 – 400 M), eperisone, lanperisone, <b>inaperisone,</b> and silperisone (25 – 200 M) dose dependently depressed the ventral root potential of isolated hemisected spinal cord of 6 -day-old rats. The local anesthetic lidocaine (100 – 800 M) produced qualitatively similar depres-sion of spinal functions in the hemicord preparation, whereas its blocking effect on afferent nerve conduction was clearly stronger. In vivo, tolperisone and silperisone as well as lido-caine (10 mg/kg intravenously) depressed ventral root reflexes and excitability of motoneurons. However, in contrast with li-docaine, the muscle relaxant drugs seemed to have a more pronounced action on the synaptic responses than on th...|$|E
