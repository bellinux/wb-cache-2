50|$|Chronic <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> is more usually {{associated}} with denture wearing (see denture-related stomatitis).|$|E
50|$|Erythematous (atrophic) {{candidiasis}} is {{when the}} condition appears as a red, raw-looking lesion. Some sources consider denture-related stomatitis, angular stomatitis, median rhombiod glossitis, and antiobiotic-induced stomatitis as subtypes of <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> since these lesions are commonly erythematous/atrophic. It may precede {{the formation of a}} pseudomembrane, be left when the membrane is removed, or arise without prior pseudomembranes. Some sources state that <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> accounts for 60% of oral candidiasis cases. Where it is associated with inhalation steroids (often used for treatment of asthma), <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> commonly appears on the palate or the dorsum of the tongue. On the tongue, there is loss of the lingual papillae (depapillation), leaving a smooth area.|$|E
5000|$|Inhaled {{corticosteroids}} (e.g., {{for treatment}} of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), are {{not intended to be}} administered topically in the mouth, but inevitably there is contact with the oral and oropharyngeal mucousa as it is inhaled. In asthmatics treated with inhaled steroids, clinically detectable oral candidiasis may occur in about 5-10% of adults and 1% of children. Where inhaled steroids are the cause, the candidal lesions are usually of the <b>erythematous</b> variety. <b>Candidiasis</b> appears at the sites where the steroid has contacted the mucosa, typically the dorsum of the tongue (median rhomboid glossitis) and sometimes also on the palate. Candidal lesions on both sites are sometimes termed [...] "kissing lesions" [...] because they approximate when the tongue is in contact with the palate.|$|R
5000|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} are {{dependent upon the}} type of oral candidiasis. Often, apart from {{the appearance of the}} lesions, there are usually no other signs or symptoms. Most types of oral candidiasis are painless, but a burning sensation may occur in some cases. Candidiasis can therefore sometimes be misdiagnosed as burning mouth syndrome. A burning sensation is more likely with <b>erythematous</b> (atrophic) <b>candidiasis,</b> whilst hyperplastic candidiasis is normally entirely asymptomatic. Acute atrophic candidiasis may feel like the mouth has been scalded with a hot liquid. Another potential symptom is a metallic, acidic, salty or bitter taste in the mouth. The pseudomembranous type rarely causes any symptoms apart from possibly some discomfort or bad taste due to the presence of the membranes. Sometimes the patient describes the raised pseudomembranes as [...] "blisters." [...] Occasionally there can be dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), which indicates that the candidiasis involves the oropharynx or the esophagus, as well as the mouth. The trachea and the larynx may also be involved where there is oral candidiasis, and this may cause hoarseness of the voice.|$|R
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} can typically be {{made from}} the clinical appearance alone, but not always. As candidiasis can be variable in appearance, and present with white, red or combined white and red lesions, the differential diagnosis can be extensive. In pseudomembraneous candidiasis, the membranous slough can be wiped away to reveal an erythematous surface underneath. This is helpful in distinguishing pseudomembraneous candidiasis from other white lesions in the mouth that cannot be wiped away, such as lichen planus, oral hairy leukoplakia. <b>Erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> can mimic geographic tongue. <b>Erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> usually has a diffuse border that helps distinguish it from erythroplakia, which normally has a sharply defined border.|$|E
50|$|Predisposing {{factors include}} smoking, denture wearing, use of {{corticosteroid}} sprays or inhalers and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection. Candida species even in healthy people mainly colonizes the posterior dorsal tongue. Median rhombiod glossitis {{is thought to be}} a type of chronic atrophic (or <b>erythematous)</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> Microbiological culture of the lesion usually shows Candida mixed with bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Candidiasis can be {{a marker}} for {{underlying}} disease, so the overall prognosis may also be dependent upon this. For example, a transient <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> that developed after antiobiotic therapy usually resolves after antibiotics are stopped (but not always immediately), and therefore carries an excellent prognosis—but candidiasis may occasionally be a herald of a more sinister undiagnosed pathology, such as HIV/AIDS or leukemia.|$|E
5000|$|Acute <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> usually {{occurs on}} the dorsum {{of the tongue}} in persons taking long term {{corticosteroids}} or antibiotics, but occasionally it can occur {{after only a few}} days of using a topical antibiotic. This is usually termed [...] "antibiotic sore mouth", [...] "antibiotic sore tongue", or [...] "antibiotic-induced stomatitis" [...] because it is commonly painful as well as red.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{characterized}} by a coating or individual patches of pseudomembranous white slough that can be easily wiped away to reveal erythematous (reddened), and sometimes minimally bleeding, mucosa beneath. These areas of pseudomembrane are sometimes described as [...] "curdled milk", or [...] "cottage cheese". The white material is made up of debris, fibrin, and desquamated epithelium that has been invaded by yeast cells and hyphae that invade to the depth of the stratum spinosum. Due to the fact that an erythematous surface is revealed beneath the pseudomembranes, some consider pseudomembranous candidiasis and <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> stages of the same entity. Some sources state that if there is bleeding when the pseudomembrane is removed, then the mucosa has likely been affected by an underlying process such as lichen planus or chemotherapy. Pseudomembraneous candidiasis can involve any part of the mouth, but usually it appears on the tongue, buccal mucosae or palate.|$|E

To {{investigate}} the temporal {{changes in the}} prevalence of oral candidiasis in a cohort of Spanish human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected individuals, {{before and after the}} introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Study design. Retrospective analysis of a clinical database from "Carlos Haya" Hospital, Málaga, Spain, from 1995 to 2000. The prevalence of oral candidiasis was assessed in 807 HIV/AIDS patients and the temporal progression of its major variants evaluated using a linear regression model. Results. Overall oral candidiasis was prevalent in 30. 0 % to 48. 3 % of the cohort throughout and no significant variation in its incidence was noted during the study period. Prevalence of <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> increased from 24. 5 % (1995) to 45. 0 % (2000) and pseudomembranous candidiasis decreased from 22. 4 % (1995) to 5. 2 % (2000) (P<. 05).

40|$|SummaryThe {{management}} of dry mouth {{is essential for}} patients with Sjögren's syndrome. The symptomatic treatment has included using air humidifiers, rinsing the mouth with water or mouthwash, {{the application of a}} salivary substitute and administration of secretagogues. There are three secretagogues suitable for the alleviation of dry mouth in Sjögren's syndrome patients in Japan; cevimeline hydrochloride hydrate (cevimeline), pilocarpine hydrochloride, and anetholtrithione. A relationship between the effect of cevimeline on saliva secretion and the degree of salivary gland destruction evaluated by sialography and histopathological findings in the labial minor salivary glands has been reported. These diagnostic approaches could provide useful prognostic information on the efficacy of cevimeline in Sjögren's syndrome patients. Concomitantly, a bite guard was suggested as an effective lubricating device because it maintains the lubricants in the proper location. In addition, the {{management of}} the complications of dry mouth, such as tooth caries, periodontitis and oral candidiasis, which all lead to a reduction in the QOL, is also important. Both the prevention and treatment of <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> is especially important in the management of Sjögren's syndrome...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 32 HIV-infected, {{predominantly}} ethnic Chinese individuals from Hong Kong were examined for oral mucosal lesions {{over a period}} of 1 year. The commonest oral lesion found was minor aphthous ulceration (27. 4 %), while xerostomia (17. 8 %), ulceration NOS (not otherwise specified; 12. 3 %), hairy leukoplakia (11. 0 %) and <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (6. 9 %) were less frequent; Kaposi's sarcoma was notable for its absence. When the relationship between the number of oral lesions with age, risk group, medication taken, CDC staging and CD 4 + count of the study group was investigated, a significantly higher number of oral lesions was associated with use of AZT, homosexuals and CDC IV; in contrast, a smaller number of lesions was found in those on antiparasitics and multivitamins (all P< 0. 05). When compared with studies {{from other parts of the}} world, the frequency of oral lesions appeared to be less common in the current study group.

40|$|Linear gingival {{erythema}} (LGE) is an oral lesion {{recognized as}} an HIV-associated gingivo-parodontal change. Four patient groups were recruited for this study: 20 seropositive HIV patients with LGE, 20 seropositive HIV patients with neither parodontal disease nor LGE, 20 patients seronegative for HIV with gingivitis, and 20 patients seronegative for HIV without gingivitis. For all patient groups, three parameters were measured: the plaque index, the presence of candida species in oral rinse solution and sulcus fluid, {{and the number of}} CD 4 + lymphocytes in the patient groups seropositive for HIV. In HIV positive patients, the plaque index was significantly higher in patients with LGE (2. 0 vs. 1. 3 without LGE). In seronegative patients, this was also the case for patients with gingivitis (1. 6 vs. 0. 4) (p< 0. 0001). In the HIV positive patient groups the number of CD 4 + lymphocytes was lower in the group with LGE (80 /µl vs. 132 /µl). These findings were however, not significant (p< 0. 29). Candida species could be demonstrated in the oral rinse of all patient groups, primarily candida albicans. The pathogen load was significantly higher in patients seropositve for HIV (p= 0. 0065).

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{diagnosis}} oral lesions related to HIV infection in individuals followed in the General Hospital of the School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The presence of oral lesions was correlated with gender, age, smoking habit, levels of CD 4 lymphocytes, HIV load, time of HIV seropositivity, AIDS condition, use of removable dental prosthesis, and use of HAART. Materials and Methods: 340 HIV infected individuals were selected for this study, all participants of the study were examined by only one practiced dentist which performed anamnesis, peribuccal and oral examination. Results: Oral lesions were observed in 113 of 340 (33. 2 %) HIV infected individuals. These oral lesions included: oral candidiasis (17. 7 %) of pseudomembranous (10. 8 %) and of erythematous types (6. 9 %), angular cheilitis (13. 9 %), hairy leukoplakia (11. 8 %), and oral ulcers (2. 1 %). Oral candidiasis lesions were more frequently observed in women (p. 033). Smoking addict participants presented a high frequency of tongue hairy leukoplakia (p. 038) and a reduced frequency of oral ulcers (p. 018). Hairy leukoplakia and pseudomembranous candidiasis were inversely correlated to CD 4 + L levels and directly correlated with HIV load, behaving as immune depression markers. Hairy leukoplakia and pseudomembranous candidiasis also showed an inverse correlation with HAART use (p <. 0001). Patients using mobile dental prosthesis presented a high frequency of <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (p. 003).

40|$|Considering {{the changes}} {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) {{has brought to}} the treatment of HIV infection, the current clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV/AIDS individuals referred to oral health centers are crucially important in instructing dentists about the oral health management of these patients. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV-infected individuals referred to a clinic for patients with special needs between 2005 and 2012 by retrospectively analyzing their dental records. A total of 97 records of HIV patients referred to the School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, were analyzed. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the associations between mean CD 4 + counts, mean viral load, and the presence of HIV-related oral lesions (HIV-OL). Most of the patients were male, and their mean age was 38. 3 years. Eighty-nine (92 %) patients were on regular ART, 77 (79. 4 %) had a CD 4 + count higher than 200 cells/mm 3, and 63 (64. 9 %) had an undetectable viral load. Twenty patients (20. 6 %) presented with some HIV-OL, including pseudomembranous and/or <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> and angular cheilitis, which were correlated with a low CD 4 + count and with an undetectable viral load (p < 0. 05). Among the branches of dentistry, periodontics, followed by surgery and restorative dentistry, was the most sought-after specialty, and no intercurrent events were observed during the dental treatment. It may be concluded that there are no restrictions on the dental treatment of patients on regular ART, It is important, though, that the treatment be based on local characteristics and on the prevention of oral diseases. </p...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions strongly associated with HIV infection and to assess the oral health behaviour among patients attending Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Maseru. The objectives were: (i) to determine the prevalence of group 1 lesions in HIV-positive patients according to the ECC/WHO classification; (ii) assess the oral hygiene practices of these patients; and (iii) make recommendations based on the findings. METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire was administered by an interviewer to a sample of 270 patients with a serological diagnosis of HIV infection to assess their oral health behaviour; they were then examined for oral manifestations. The assessment of oral health behaviour involved determining the regularity and frequency of oral hygiene practices, and use of mouth wash, interdental and other adjunct cleaning aids. The presumptive criteria as defined by the ECC/WHO classification were used for diagnosis of the oral mucosal lesions. Results were entered and analysed using Epi info- 6 statistical software RESULTS: The prevalence of specific oral mucosal lesions in order of occurrence was pseudomembranous candidiasis 27 %, <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> 26 %, angular cheilitis 14 %, hairy leukoplakia 12 %, ulcerations 12 %, necrotising gingivitis 5 %, linear gingival erythema 3 %, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma less than 1 %. This pattern reflects the findings in other regional studies where pseudomembranous candidiasis is often the most common lesion found. Nearly all patients reported cleaning their mouths; 82 % did it every day. Mouth wash and interdental cleaning aids were not often used. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence (73 %) of oral mucosal lesions was found. Oral candidiasis was the most common group of lesions (54 %).

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether opportunistic oral infections associated to HIV infection (OOI-HIV) {{are found in}} HIV+/AIDS patients with immune reconstitution related to {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART). Methods. From among 1100 HIV+/AIDS patients (Service of Internal Medicine, Carlos Haya Hospital, Malaga, Spain) subjected to review of the oral cavity between January 1996 and May 2007, we identified those examined in 1996 and which were again examined between 1997 and 2007, and were moreover receiving HAART. The following data were collected: age, gender, form of contagion, antiretroviral therapy at the time of review, number of CD 4 + lymphocytes/ml, and viral load (from 1997 onwards). We identified those subjects with an increase in CD 4 + lymphocytes/ ml associated to HAART, and classified them as subjects with quantitative evidence of immune reconstitution (QEIR). Among these individuals with QEIR we moreover identified those with undetectable viral loads (QEIR+VL), and differentiated those patients with an increase in CD 4 + lymphocytes > 500 /ml (QEIRm+VL). In each group we determined the prevalence of OOI-HIV, following the diagnostic recommendations of the EC-Clearinghouse (CDC-Atlanta, USA - WHO). In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of OOI-HIV in the different groups in relation to the duration of HAART. Results. A total of 86 subjects were included (44 females and 42 males; 19 heterosexuals, 34 male homosexuals, and 33 intravenous drug abusers). Forty-two patients showed QEIR: 21 belonged to the QEIR+VL group, and 17 conformed the QEIRm+VL group. The prevalence of OOI-HIV per group was as follows: QEIR = 54. 8 %; QEIR+VL = 33 %; QEIRm+VL = 35 %. The most prevalent lesion in all groups was <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> OOI-HIV increased with the duration of HAART (p= 0. 008), and were seen to be dependent upon late appearance of the mycotic lesions (after 24 months under HAART).

40|$|Many studies include oral HIV-related {{endpoints}} {{that may}} be diagnosed by non-oral-health specialists (non-OHS) like nurses or physicians. Our objective {{was to assess the}} accuracy of clinical diagnoses of HIV-related oral lesions made by non-OHS compared to diagnoses made by OHS. A 5254, a cross-sectional study conducted by the Oral HIV/AIDS Research Alliance within the AIDS Clinical Trial Group, enrolled HIV- 1 -infected adults participants from six clinical trial units (CTU) in the US (San Francisco, New York, Chapel Hill, Cleveland, Atlanta) and Haiti. CTU examiners (non-OHS) received standardized training on how to perform an oral examination and make clinical diagnoses of specific oral disease endpoints. Diagnoses by calibrated non-OHS were compared to those made by calibrated OHS, and sensitivity and specificity computed. Among 324 participants, the majority were black (73 %), men (66 %), and the median CD 4 + cell count 138 cells/mm(3). The overall frequency of oral mucosal disease diagnosed by OHS was 43 % in US sites, and 90 % in Haiti. Oral candidiasis (OC) was detected in 153 (47 %) by OHS, with <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (EC) the most common type (39 %) followed by pseudomembranous candidiasis (PC; 26 %). The highest prevalence of OC (79 %) was among participants in Haiti, and among those with CD 4 + cell count ≤ 200 cells/mm(3) and HIV- 1 RNA > 1000 copies/mL (71 %). The sensitivity and specificity of OC diagnoses by non-OHS were 90 % and 92 % (for EC: 81 % and 94 %; PC: 82 % and 95 %). Sensitivity and specificity were also high for KS (87 % and 94 %, respectively), but sensitivity was < 60 % for HL and oral warts in all sites combined. The Candida culture confirmation of OC clinical diagnoses (as defined by ≥ 1 colony forming unit per mL of oral/throat rinse) was ≥ 93 % for both PC and EC. Trained non-OHS showed high accuracy of clinical diagnoses of OC in comparison with OHS, suggesting their usefulness in studies in resource-poor settings, but detection of less common lesions may require OHS...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the pattern and frequency of oral lesions and to compare the prevalence of HIV-related oral lesions in paediatric Nigerian patients on HAART with those not on HAART. Materials and Methods: All patients aged 15 years and below attending the Infectious Disease Clinic of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital with a diagnosis of HIV were consecutively examined in a cross-sectional study over a 2 -year period. Information was obtained by history, physical examinations, HIV testing, and enumeration of CD+ T cells. The results are presented. A P-value of < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 105 children comprising 63 males and 42 female who met the inclusion criteria participated in the study, mean age in months was 53. 3 ± 42. 2, with a mean of 3. 4 ± 2. 2 for male and 2. 8 ± 1. 8 for female respectively. Oral lesions occurred in 61. 9 % of the children Overall, 22 (21. 0 %) had at least one oral lesion, 43 (41. 0 %) had multiple lesion. The most common lesion was oral candidiasis (79. 1 %). The angular cheilitis (43. 8 %) variant was most frequent. The mean CD 4 counts were 1138 cells/mm [3], 913 cells/mm [3] and 629 cells/mm [3] for those without oral lesion, with single lesion and multiple oral lesions respectively. These differences were not statistically significant (ANOVA: F= 0. 185, df= 2, 80, 82, P= 0. 831. Patients on HAART comprised about 61. 9 % and these were found to have reduced risk for development of such oral lesions as angular cheilitis (OR= 0. 76; 95 % CI= 0. 56 - 1. 02; P= 0. 03), pseudomembranous candidiasis (OR= 0. 71; 95 % CI= 0. 54 - 0. 94; P= 0. 024) and HIV-gingivitis (OR= 0. 59; 95 % CI= 0. 46 - 0. 75; P= 0. 001). HAART had some beneficial but insignificant effect on development of HIV-periodonttitis (OR= 0. 60; 95 % CI= 0. 51 - 0. 70; P= 0. 09). The chances of occurrence of other oral lesions were not significantly reduced by HAART (Kaposi sarcoma, OR= 1. 24; 95 % CI= 0. 31 - 5. 01; P= 0. 47, <b>erythematous</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> OR= 1. 13; 95 % CI= 0. 62 - 2. 06). Conclusion: HIV-related Oral lesions are frequently seen in HIV-infected Nigerian children. Paediatric patients receiving HAART had significantly lower prevalence of oral lesions, particularly oral candidiasis and HIV-gingivitis...|$|E
