Belzer, however, {{fell to the floor}} unconscious and began to bleed profusely. His injury required eight stitches. Belzer later sued Hogan for $5million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E

The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered as of yet.

5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; {{this is part of}} cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 sacks {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a nerve in his arm that blocked the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E

25|$|In an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima {{and enters}} the media layer. The high {{pressure}} rips the tissue of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart. This can propagate {{along the length of}} the aorta for a variable distance forward or backwards. Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood)</b> are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood)</b> are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100mm of the aortic valve, so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a hemopericardium. Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{presented}} in the literature show that the electrical conductivity <b>of</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>blood</b> depends on flow velocity. The {{aim of this study}} is to extend the Maxwell-Fricke theory, developed for a dilute suspension of ellipsoidal particles in an electrolyte, to explain this <b>flow</b> dependency <b>of</b> the conductivity <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> for stationary laminar flow in a rigid cylindrical tube. Furthermore, these theoretical results are compared to earlier published measurement results. To develop the theory, we assumed that blood is a Newtonian fluid and that red blood cells can be represented by oblate ellipsoids. If blood flows through a cylindrical tube, shear stresses will deform and align the red blood cells with one of their long axes aligned parallel to the stream lines. The pathway of a low-frequency (< 1 MHz) alternating electrical current will be altered by this orientation and deformation <b>of</b> the red <b>blood</b> cells. Consequently, the electrical conductivity in the <b>flow</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> increases. The theoretically predicted <b>flow</b> dependency <b>of</b> the conductivity <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> corresponds well with experimental results.
