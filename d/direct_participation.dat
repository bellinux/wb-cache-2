5|$|Egyptian temples {{were built}} for the {{official}} worship of the gods and in commemoration of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals, the central functions of Egyptian religion: giving offerings to the gods, reenacting their mythological interactions through festivals, and warding off the forces of chaos. These rituals were seen as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold maat, the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for the gods were the obligations of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties {{to a host of}} priests, but most of the populace was excluded from <b>direct</b> <b>participation</b> in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to pray, give offerings, and seek oracular guidance from the god dwelling within.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of <b>direct</b> citizen <b>participation</b> at the local level of {{government}} in Serbia after 2000. In the first part, an attempt was made to define the concept of <b>direct</b> citizen <b>participation</b> and to analyze its main features. The second part contains the analysis of the achieved state of <b>direct</b> citizen <b>participation</b> at local level in Serbia. The primary goal of this research is to determine the key characteristics and the actual stage of development of the four levels of direct citizen participation: providing/acquiring information, consulting, proposing and participating in decision making. The main finding is that citizen participation in Serbia exists at a rudimentary level and that in this regard we are lagging behind most countries in Western Europe, but also in the Region...|$|R
5|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>participation</b> of {{the royal}} and viceroyal figures in areas of {{governance}} is limited. In practice, {{their use of the}} executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada (at present Justin Trudeau), the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus {{one of the most powerful}} institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of <b>direct</b> citizen <b>participation,</b> trust, and {{environmental}} literacy {{and its impact on}} the legitimacy of government institutions in the context of environmental governance in the U.

This paper addresses broadly the effects of <b>direct</b> citizen <b>participation,</b> citizen trust, and environmental literacy on government legitimacy. Findings indicate that citizens prefer government institutions over ordinary people on leading environmental governance. However, the preference was less clear when asked to choose between the government and businesses as to who should lead environmental governance.
