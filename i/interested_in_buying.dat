After playing in Wolves' opening pre-season friendly against Morecambe, he was invited to join them for their pre-season tour of Portugal.

He was recalled by York {{to take part in a}} pre-season friendly against Sunderland, although he refused to participate. Howarth told Dolan he did not want to play for the club, as any potential injury could have ended his proposed transfer. His proposed move to Wolves continued until August 2002, and late that month he trained with Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. He played in a practice match for Tottenham, but after they failed to follow up their interest in him Wolves made a bid to sign him on loan, which York rejected. After Marlon Beresford left York, and Howarth's proposed moves elsewhere fell through, he re-signed for the club in September 2002 on a week-to-week contract. Despite this, he spent two days on trial with Premier League club Newcastle United in late September 2002. Howarth's first appearance of 2002–03 came in a 4–3 away defeat to Lincoln City on 22 October 2002 in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round, after Fettis was rested due to injury.|$|E
