5|$|Krishna and his siblings' capital becomes Dvaravati. The Arjuna and Krishna {{interaction}} <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> <b>in</b> the Jataka version. A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow {{when his}} son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson. The Jataka tale also includes an internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by {{the hand of a}} hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to a frontier city. Mistaking Krishna for a pig, Jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet, causing Krishna great pain and then his death.|$|E
5|$|The biographies {{cover the}} {{emperors}} from Hadrian to Carinus and Numerian. A section covering the reigns of Philip the Arab, Decius, Trebonianus Gallus, Aemilian {{and all but}} {{the end of the}} reign of Valerian <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> <b>in</b> all the manuscripts, and {{it has been argued that}} biographies of Nerva and Trajan have also been lost at the beginning of the work, which may suggest the compilation might have been a direct continuation of Suetonius. It has been theorized that the mid-3rd-century lacuna might actually be a deliberate literary device of the author or authors, saving the labour of covering Emperors for whom little source material may have been available.|$|E

The commentary presents two theories on {{the duties of the}} four Varna in terms of ashrama dharmas of Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa. One theory allows only the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas to enter Brahmacharya and study the Vedas, and the other states that Shudras can also enter Brahmacharya.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{dreams that}} it is December 1944 and that Marge is a soldier in World War II. Due to Marge being taken {{suddenly}} for overseas deployment while buying a Christmas tree the previous year, Lisa has sworn to never see another Christmas tree until Marge returns home safely. However, during Christmas of 1944, the family gets a telegram saying that Marge <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> <b>in</b> action. After hearing the news, Lisa runs away {{to the place where}} she had last seen her mother, the Christmas Tree Farm. The owner of the place says that Marge paid for a tree the previous year but never picked it up. Lisa, believing the tree to be a symbol that Marge is alright, takes it home and decorates it together with Homer and Bart. Marge is then seen assassinating Adolf Hitler with an MP40 in a movie theater in France as he watches a propaganda film. When she walks away from the scene, the theater explodes behind her.|$|E

50|$|The comet <b>was</b> <b>missed</b> <b>in</b> 1862, and {{the next}} {{recovery}} was in 1868. A close approach to Jupiter shortened the period {{enough to make the}} comet visible in 1873. A very favorable apparition followed in 1879, allowing the comet to be observed for the longest time to date - four months. The comet <b>was</b> <b>missed</b> <b>in</b> 1884, due to observing circumstances, but <b>was</b> also <b>missed</b> <b>in</b> 1890, a favorable apparition. The next favorable apparition occurred in 1901, but searches did not locate the comet.|$|R

25|$|The role of Adam Klaus was {{originally}} cast to Anthony Head in 1997 {{in the pilot}} episode ("The Wrestler's Tomb"). However, after accepting the role of Rupert Giles on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Head was unable to play Adam Klaus in later episodes, leaving the way clear for Stuart Milligan {{to take over the}} role until the present. This explains why Adam Klaus <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> <b>in</b> episodes 2–5 of series 1.|$|E
25|$|The pedipalps {{have only}} six segments: the {{metatarsus}} <b>is</b> <b>missing.</b> <b>In</b> adult males, the tarsus of each palp {{is modified to}} carry an elaborate and often species-specific structure used for mating (variously called a palpal bulb, palpal organ or copulatory bulb). The basal segments of the pedipalps, the coxae, next to the mouth, are modified to assist with feeding, and are termed maxillae, although they are not homologous with the maxillae of mandibulate arthropods. In mesothele and mygalomorph spiders, the maxillae are only slightly modified; in araneomorph spiders, the anterior edge is often saw-like and is used in cutting up prey.|$|E

25|$|A {{potentially}} related issue {{involves the}} reference in the Synoptic Gospels to a three-hour period of darkness {{over the whole}} land {{on the day of}} the crucifixion (according to Luke 23:45 τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος - the sun was darkened). Although some scholars view this as a literary device common among ancient writers rather than a description of an actual event, other writers have attempted to identify a meteorological event or a datable astronomical phenomenon which this could have referred to. It could not have been a solar eclipse, since this could not take place during the crucifixion at Passover, and in any case solar eclipses take minutes, not hours. In 1983, astronomers Humphreys and Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse <b>is</b> <b>missing</b> <b>in</b> some versions of Luke and argued that the solar eclipse was a later faulty scribal amendment of what was actually the lunar eclipse of AD33. This is a claim which historian David Henige describes as 'undefended' and 'indefensible'. Humphreys and a number of scholars have alternatively argued for the sun's darkening to have been caused by a khamsin, i.e. a sand storm, which can occur between mid-March and May in the Middle East and which does typically last for several hours.|$|E

500|$|Codd {{indicated}} in his 1990 book The Relational Model for Database Management, Version 2 that the single Null {{mandated by the}} SQL standard was inadequate, and should be replaced by two separate Null-type markers to indicate the reason why data <b>is</b> <b>missing.</b> <b>In</b> Codd's book, these two Null-type markers {{are referred to as}} 'A-Values' and 'I-Values', representing 'Missing But Applicable' and 'Missing But Inapplicable', respectively. [...] Codd's recommendation would have required SQL's logic system be expanded to accommodate a four-valued logic system. [...] Because of this additional complexity, the idea of multiple Nulls with different definitions has not gained widespread acceptance in the database practitioners' domain. It remains an active field of research though, with numerous papers still being published.|$|E
