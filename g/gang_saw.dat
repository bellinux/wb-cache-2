40|$|AbstractDie {{separation}} {{processes for}} compound semiconductor devices are typically based on either diamond {{scribe and break}} techniques or on <b>ganged</b> <b>sawing</b> of the substrate using water-cooled saws. These mechanically dependent processes can suffer from several limitations, including overall throughput of the process (and throughput scalability as wafer sizes increase), physical damage to the dies incurred during the sawing or scribing operation, and the real estate cost of needing large scribe lines or streets for relatively small devices like LEDs. A plasma etch process has been developed for compound semiconductor device die separation, eliminating the real estate penalty, physical damage caused by mechanical processes, and has no scaling issues associated with larger wafer diameters [...] This article will report on the overall benefits of the plasma etch die separation processes, offer some cost of ownership comparisons, and show results from work performed for LED die separation using plasma etch...|$|R
50|$|Gibson {{immediately}} began to improve and expand the operation. He enlarged the mill pond by putting a chain of piers across the river above an existing dam, and built more dams {{in order to improve}} the flow of logs to his sawmills. He also renovated the mills, outfitting them with double <b>gang</b> <b>saws,</b> and brought in experienced workers from Lepreau to run them. In the spring of 1863 the mills began sawing 3 inch planks, called deals, which were floated to a log boom {{at the mouth of the}} Nashwaak. They were then taken on lighters or rafts down the Saint John River to the port of Saint John, New Brunswick, and thence to the British or American markets. Eventually Gibson also shipped wood to South America, Australia, and the West Indies. At times his wood production accounted for more than half of the goods exported annually from the port of Saint John.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of granulometric analyses of sawdust of thermally modified oak wood and unmodified oak wood sawed on narrow-kerf sash <b>gang</b> <b>saw.</b> Sawdust of dry thermally modified oak,produced during the sawing process on the frame sawing machine PRW 15 –M with the feed speed of 0. 36 and 1. 67 m·min- 1, consists of chip granularity in the range from 0. 0412 mm to 3. 6 mm, whereas the unmodified oak wood sawdust consists of chips in the granularity range from 0. 0448 mm to 12. 1 mm. In both cases polydispersive fibrils with a strong extension in one dimension were observed.

40|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is a key}} component for the natural stone industry. In recent years, multiwire machines have been overtaking stone <b>gang</b> <b>saw</b> cutting technology. The advantages of these new cutting-edge technologies are high efficiency and performance, flexibility of use, high quality of the cut surfaces, very low environmental impact (low energy consumption, lowest concentration of heavy metals in the sludge, less waste) and lowest noise levels. There are many studies on the separation and recovery of sludge from cutting with the <b>gang</b> <b>saw,</b> but very few on diamond cutting sludges. In accordance with the European Commission's Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste (EC raw material strategies), {{it is important to}} perform a correct characterization of sludge from cutting with the new technologies, in order to investigate its possible recovery. This paper presents a preliminary investigation of the sludge resulting from different types of silicatic stones with the aim of their valorization. The investigation was conducted on sludge from cutting with diamond wire, diamond saw blades, and mixed sludge resulting from the filter press. The following tests have been performed to characterize the sludge properties: chemical analysis on the solid fraction of sludge, particle size distribution, evaluation of the metals content through image analysis for each particle size, and leaching tests. To assess the possible recovery of the sludge, wet magnetic separation tests with a high gradient magnetic separator were performed in order to obtain two types of secondary materials, namely the mineral fraction and metals fraction. The separation efficiency has been evaluated through DRX and SEM analysis on the two fractions. The results obtained for the different particle size classes have been compared. The magnetic separation of the size class < 0. 038 mm has a low separation efficiency because of the phenomenon of grain capture by metallic granules: for this reason the metallic fraction of this class must be further processed {{if it is to be}} considered as a secondary raw material. On the other hand, the magnetic separation of the other granulometric classes is characterized by good separation efficiency. A good efficiency of the process is a key factor in order to optimize the recovery process and to increase the economic advantages. The study performed is useful for evaluating the possible reuse of both the metal and the mineral parts, through the implementation of a proactive {{waste management}} strategy in order to avoid a subsequent environmental degradation...|$|E
50|$|The mill was chiefly fed pine logs {{which were}} cut {{upstream}} in the Chippewa valley and floated down in spring log drives. They were held {{floating in the}} mill's booms until they could be sawed. Early on, the mill used circle <b>saws</b> and <b>gang</b> <b>saws.</b> Later some of these were replaced by a band saw. There was also a shingle mill, a planing mill, trimmers, edgers, kilns, and drying sheds. In the early years, most of the output - lumber, shingles and lath - was floated down the Chippewa to Northwestern's lumberyard in Hannibal, Missouri. In 1883 the Chicago, Milwaukee & St Paul Railroad built a line through Porter's Mills, and began shipping products west by rail, to places like Minnesota and South Dakota. By 1873 Porter's Mills provided thirty-two houses for married employees. Other employees owned their own homes in town. The town was dry like many company towns. Relations were generally good between company and employees. For example, when millworkers in Eau Claire went on strike for a ten-hour workday in 1881, the workers at Porter's Mills outside of town didn't join the strike. The town suffered various floods and fires, but people pulled together and the town grew.|$|R
