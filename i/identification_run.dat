40|$|Synchronous motors {{are used}} mainly in large drives, {{for example in}} ship {{propulsion}} systems and in steel factories' rolling mills because of their high efficiency, high overload capacity and good performance in the field weakening range. This, however, requires an extremely good torque control system. A fast torque response and a torque accuracy are basic requirements for such a drive. For large power, high dynamic performance drives the commonly known principle of field oriented vector control has been used solely hitherto, but nowadays {{it is not the}} only way to implement such a drive. A new control method Direct Torque Control (DTC) has also emerged. The performance of such a high quality torque control as DTC in dynamically demanding industrial applications is mainly based on the accurate estimate of the various flux linkages' space vectors. Nowadays industrial motor control systems are real time applications with restricted calculation capacity. At the same time the control system requires a simple, fast calculable and reasonably accurate motor model. In this work a method to handle these problems in a Direct Torque Controlled (DTC) salient pole synchronous motor drive is proposed. A motor model which combines the induction law based "voltage model" and motor inductance parameters based "current model" is presented. The voltage model operates as a main model and is calculated at a very fast sampling rate (for example 40 kHz). The stator flux linkage calculated via integration from the stator voltages is corrected using the stator flux linkage computed from the current model. The current model acts as a supervisor that prevents only the motor stator flux linkage from drifting erroneous during longer time intervals. At very low speeds the role of the current model is emphasised but, nevertheless, the voltage model always stays the main model. At higher speeds the function of the current model correction is to act as a stabiliser of the control system. The current model contains a set of inductance parameters which must be known. The validation of the current model in steady state is not self evident. It depends on the accuracy of the saturated value of the inductances. Parameter measurement of the motor model where the supply inverter is used as a measurement signal generator is presented. This so called <b>identification</b> <b>run</b> can be performed prior to delivery or during drive commissioning. A derivation method for the inductance models used for the representation of the saturation effects is proposed. The performance of the electrically excited synchronous motor supplied with the DTC inverter is proven with experimental results. It is shown that it is possible to obtain a good static accuracy of the DTC's torque controller for an electrically excited synchronous motor. The dynamic response is fast and a new operation point is achieved without oscillation. The operation is stable throughout the speed range. The modelling of the magnetising inductance saturation is essential and cross saturation has to be considered as well. The effect of cross saturation is very significant. A DTC inverter can be used as a measuring equipment and the parameters needed for the motor model can be defined by the inverter itself. The main advantage is that the parameters defined are measured in similar magnetic operation conditions and no disagreement between the parameters will exist. The inductance models generated are adequate to meet the requirements of dynamically demanding drives...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the complex}} nature of the excitation, and the {{inherent}} dynamics characteristics of restoring force of the base isolation systems, the response of base-isolated structures subject to strong earthquakes often experiences excursion into the inelastic range. Therefore, in designing base-isolated structures, the nonlinear hysteretic restoring force model of the base isolation system is frequently used to predict structural response and to evaluate structural safety. In this paper, the prediction error method system identification technique is {{used in conjunction with}} nonlinear state-space models for identification of a base-isolated structure. Using a variety of nonlinear restoring force models and bidirectional recorded seismic responses, several <b>identification</b> <b>runs</b> are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the selected models. Several nonlinear restoring force models are utilized for the base-isolation system, including a multiple shear spring (MSS) model.

40|$|Previous {{studies using}} {{explicit}} semantic tasks, such as category or similarity judgments, have revealed considerable neuroanatomical overlap between processing {{of the meaning}} of words and pictures. This result may have been influenced by the semantic executive control required by such tasks. We examined the degree of overlap while minimizing semantic executive demands. In a first fMRI experiment (n = 28), we titrated word (35. 3 ms, SD = 9. 6) and picture presentation duration (50. 7 ms, SD = 15. 8) such that conscious stimulus identification became a stochastic process, with a 50 % chance of success. Subjects had to indicate by key press whether or not they had been able to identify the stimulus. In a second fMRI experiment (n = 19), the <b>identification</b> <b>runs</b> were followed by a surprise forced-choice recognition task and events were sorted on the basis of subsequent memory retrieval success rather than a subjective consciousness report. For both words and pictures, when stimulus processing exceeded the conscious identification threshold, the left occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), intraparietal sulcus, inferior frontal junction, and middle third of the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS) were more active than when subjects had been unable to identify the stimulus. For both words and pictures, activity in two of these regions, IFS and OTS, predicted subsequent memory retrieval success. A Bayesian comparison revealed that the effective connectivity between IFS and the word- or picture-specific systems was mainly mediated via its connections with OTS. The amodal nature of left OTS and IFS involvement in word and picture processing extends to tasks with minimal semantic executive demands...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{importance}} {{and power of}} isotope-based metabolic flux analysis and its {{contribution to understanding the}} metabolic network is increasingly recognized. Its application is, however, still limited partly due to computational inefficiency. 13 C metabolic flux analysis aims to compute in vivo metabolic fluxes in terms of metabolite balancing extended by carbon isotopomer balances and involves a nonlinear least-squares problem. To solve the problem more efficiently, improved numerical optimization techniques are necessary. Results For flux computation, we developed a gradient-based hybrid optimization algorithm. Here, independent flux variables were compactified into [0, 1) -ranged variables using a single transformation rule. The compactified parameters could be discriminated between non-identifiable and identifiable variables after model linearization. The developed hybrid algorithm was applied to the central metabolism of Bacillus subtilis with only succinate and glutamate as carbon sources. This creates difficulties caused by symmetry of succinate leading to limited introduction of 13 C labeling information into the system. The algorithm was found to be superior to its parent algorithms and to global optimization methods both in accuracy and speed. The hybrid optimization with tolerance adjustment quickly converged to the minimum with close to zero deviation and exactly re-estimated flux variables. In the metabolic network studied, some fluxes were found to be either non-identifiable or nonlinearly correlated. The non-identifiable fluxes could correctly be predicted a priori using the model identification method applied, whereas the nonlinear flux correlation was revealed only by <b>identification</b> <b>runs</b> using different starting values a posteriori. Conclusion This fast, robust and accurate optimization method is useful for high-throughput metabolic flux analysis, a posteriori identification of possible parameter correlations, and also for Monte Carlo simulations to obtain statistical qualities for flux estimates. In this way, it contributes to future quantitative studies of central metabolic networks in the framework of systems biology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: In the {{analysis}} of differential peptide peak intensities (i. e. abundance measures), LC-MS analyses with poor quality peptide abundance data can bias downstream statistical analyses and hence the biological interpretation for an otherwise high-quality dataset. Although considerable effort {{has been placed on}} assuring the quality of the peptide identification with respect to spectral processing, to date quality assessment of the subsequent peptide abundance data matrix has been limited to a subjective visual inspection of run-by-run correlation or individual peptide components. Identifying statistical outliers is a critical step in the processing of proteomics data as many of the downstream statistical analyses [e. g. analysis of variance (ANOVA) ] rely upon accurate estimates of sample variance, and their results are influenced by extreme values. Results: We describe a novel multivariate statistical strategy for the <b>identification</b> of LC-MS <b>runs</b> with extreme peptide abundance distributions. Comparison with current method (run-by-run correlation) demonstrates a significantly better rate of <b>identification</b> of outlier <b>runs</b> by the multivariate strategy.

40|$|Abstract — Performance of an {{application}} {{can be improved}} through augmenting the processor with Application specific Functional Units (AFUs). Usually a cluster of operations identified from the application forms the behavior of an AFU. Several researchers studied the impact of Input and Output (I/O) constraints for a legal operation cluster on the overall achievable speedup. The general observation is that the speedup potential grows with the relaxation of I/O constraints. Going further, in this paper, we investigate the speedup potential of AFUs {{in the absence of}} I/O constraints. Design challenge in the absence of I/O constraints is addressed in a very practical manner, through the identification of maximal convex subgraphs. Usually the available register ports are few but the number of inputs/outputs of the identified patterns are likely to be large. We solve the register port limitation by the design of distributed I/O functional units, in which the operands are communicated in multiple cycles. The experimental results show that selection of maximal clusters achieves average 50 % higher speedup than selecting I/O constrained operation clusters. Also, our <b>identification</b> algorithm <b>runs</b> 2 to 3 orders faster than an exhaustive identification approach. I...|$|R
