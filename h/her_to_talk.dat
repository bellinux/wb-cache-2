Two of Cook's men ambush them in the motel room, and kill Blanche before the Driver manages to kill them both.|$|E
25|$|Respect, but not familiarity. Not {{to permit}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about matters of his ministry. What {{you say to}} a servant should {{not be able to}} be said to other women. She must avoid excesses of language, and he must not trust in her age or her piety too easily. She is not to enter the bedroom when he is in bed, except in case of illnesses.|$|E
25|$|What, {{excepting}} torture, {{would produce}} insanity quicker than this treatment? Here is {{a class of}} women sent to be cured. I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> or move during these hours, give her no reading and let her know nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see {{how long it will}} take to make her insane. Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.|$|E

He is then instructed to torture her until she answers his questions. Sayid discovers that the woman is Nadia (Andrea Gabriel), a childhood friend.

500|$|Pryzwarra is {{impressed}} with Doug's detective expertise, and asks {{him to join}} a newly formed governmental detective unit whose first case is to investigate the bombing. Led by Dr. Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg), they investigate the events before the explosion by using a program called [...] "Snow White", which enables them {{to look into the}} past (4 days, 6 hours, 3 minutes, 45 seconds, 14.5 nanoseconds) in detail by (according to Pryzwarra) using several satellites to form a triangulated image of events. The system is limited in that they can only see past events once; there is no fast forwarding or rewinding, although they can record everything in the process. Convinced that Claire is a vital link, Doug persuades them to focus on her. While the team observes Claire's past through [...] "Snow White", the bomber calls <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the SUV that she advertised for sale. He doesn't buy her car, but the [...] "Snow White" [...] team now knows exactly where and when he was during the call.|$|E

[...] She is escorted by Lun Tha, a scholar who has come to copy a design for a temple, and the two are secretly in love. [...] Tuptim, left alone, declares that the King may own her, but not her heart ("My Lord and Master"). [...] The King gives Anna her first audience.

[...] They are interested in her, and she tells them of her late husband, Tom ("Hello, Young Lovers"). [...] The King presents her new pupils; Anna is to teach those of his children whose mothers are in favor with him – several dozen – and is to teach their mothers as well.

2500|$|Ming-Ming Duckling (voiced by Danica Lee in the U.S.) is an overconfident young {{duck and}} the {{youngest}} of the three. As a superhero, she wears a leather pilot's helmet with goggles and a green cape. Unlike the other Wonder Pets, she can fly. She can also speak [...] "bird", allowing <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to other birds that the Wonder Pets encounter. Ming-Ming also believes that her great-grandfather was an eagle. Ming-Ming sometimes tries to take on big problems by herself and in one episode ("Save the Duckling") she even becomes the animal that needed rescuing. Ming-Ming often provides comic relief in the show, and is the Wonder Pet mostly likely to use irony and mild sarcasm. In [...] "Kalamazoo!", during school holiday she visits her Aunt Eleanora at a local petting zoo. Ming-Ming is voiced by Danica Lee in the United States version. When Lee auditioned for the role, she changes the words from [...] "R" [...] to [...] "W" [...] sounds like a child would speak (as in [...] "This is Se-wious!"). The producers said that Lee's speech impediment had an endearing quality and that young children commonly mispronounce certain sounds. Danica Lee has been nominated twice, in 2007 and 2008, for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program.|$|E
2500|$|In season 3, Peyton {{learns that}} she was adopted, and that Ellie really is her {{biological}} mother. Lucas witnesses Ellie purchasing drugs, but he learns {{that she was}} buying them for medical reasons; she has breast cancer. Meanwhile, Peyton is angry with Haley because she left Tree Hill to go on tour, but soon they make amends, and Peyton reveals that her hostility toward Haley was {{because she was the}} only one that came back out of all the people who have left her. Peyton soon grows close to Ellie, and they collaborate on a CD called Friends with Benefit, which benefits breast cancer research; there will also be a concert for it at TRIC and Haley is one of the performers. Unfortunately, Ellie dies before she sees the CD or the concert, leaving Peyton devastated. A school shooting breaks out later in the season ("With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept"), where Peyton is left fighting for her life after being the one shot.Lucas and Nathan run inside the building to save Peyton and Haley; Lucas finds Peyton bleeding out of her leg inside the school's library. She cannot walk due to the injury, so escaping is out of the question. Lucas and Peyton stay in hiding, and Lucas wraps her leg, hoping to help the bleeding and pain subside. As Peyton is falling in and out of consciousness, he forces <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a fun day she once had.
