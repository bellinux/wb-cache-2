5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (<b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp)</b> apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|E

25|$|Historically, Vilayet {{produced}} millet. It {{was also}} a major wine producer. Both wine and brandy were made in small amounts. The vilayet also produced <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp.</b> Van also had a major sheep herding industry. As of 1906, there were over 3 million sheep in the vilayet. As of 1920, those numbers were reduced. Beekeeping was done by peasants, with honey being frozen and sold. The area also produced coal, lead, copper and borax, orpiment, gas, granite, lime, chalk, gypsum, gold, and salt.|$|E

Russia's Peter the Great saw the strategic importance of the Baltic and decided to found his new capital, Saint Petersburg, {{at the mouth of}} the Neva river at the east end of the Gulf of Finland. There was much trading not just within the Baltic region but also with the North Sea region, especially eastern England and the Netherlands: their fleets needed the Baltic timber, tar, <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp.</b>|$|E
500|$|From the 8th century on, the Slavs in Poland {{increasingly}} organized {{themselves in}} larger structures known as [...] "great tribes," [...] either through voluntary or forced association. The population was primarily involved in agricultural pursuits. Fields were cultivated {{as well as}} gardens within settlements. Plowing was done using oxen and wooden plows reinforced with iron. Forest burning was used to increase the arable area, but also to provide fertilizer, as the ashes lasted in that capacity for several seasons. Rotation of crops was practiced {{as well as the}} winter/spring crop system. After several seasons of exploitation, the land was being left idle to regain fertility. Wheat, millet and rye were most important crops; other cultivated plant species included oat, barley, pea, broad bean, lentil, <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp,</b> as well as apple, pear, plum, peach and cherry trees in fruit orchards. Beginning in the 8th century, swine gradually became economically more important than cattle; sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, chickens, geese and ducks were also kept. The agricultural practices of the Slavs are known from archeological research, which documents progressive increases over time in arable area and resulting deforestation, and from written reports provided by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, a 10th-century Jewish traveler. Ibrahim described also other features of Slavic life, for example the use of steam baths. The existence of bath structures has been confirmed by archeology. An anonymous Arab writer from the turn of the 10th century mentions that the Slavic people made an alcoholic beverage out of honey and their celebrations were accompanied by music played on the lute, tambourines and wind instruments.|$|E

50|$|Bowstrings {{have been}} {{constructed}} of many materials throughout history, including fibres such as <b>flax,</b> silk, <b>and</b> <b>hemp.</b> Other materials used were animal guts, animal sinews, and rawhide. Modern fibres such as Dacron or Kevlar are now used in commercial bowstring construction, as well as steel wires in some compound bows. Compound bows have a mechanical system of pulley cams over which the bowstring is wound. Nylon is useful only in emergency situations, as it stretches too much.|$|R
2500|$|Around {{the year}} 2000, the {{production}} quantity of <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp</b> pulp total 25000-30000 tons per year, having been produced from approximately 37000-45000 tonnes fibers. Up to 80% of the produced pulp {{is used for}} specialty papers (including 95% of cigarette paper). Only about 20% hemp fiber input goes into the standard pulp area and are here mostly in lower quality (untreated oakum high shive content added) wood pulps. With hemp pulp alone, the proportion of specialty papers probably [...] at about 99%. The market is considered saturated {{with little or no}} growth in this area.|$|E
2500|$|Pliny the Elder {{describes}} {{the production of}} linen from <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp.</b> After harvesting, the plant stems were retted to loosen the outer layers and internal fibres, stripped, pounded and then smoothed. Following this, the materials were woven. Flax, like wool, came in various speciality grades and qualities. In Pliny's opinion, the whitest (and best) was imported from Spanish Saetabis; at double the price, the strongest and most long-lasting was from Retovium. The whitest and softest was produced in Latium, Falerii and Paelignium. Natural linen was a [...] "greyish brown" [...] that faded to off-white through repeated laundering and exposure to sunlight. It did not readily absorb the dyes in use at the time, and was generally bleached, or used in its raw, undyed state.|$|E
60|$|It must needs be, therefore, a great {{addition}} to the Clergy's grief, that such an assembly as the present House of Commons; should now, with an expedition more than usual, agree to a bill for encouraging the linen manufacture; with a clause, whereby the Church is to lose two parts in three, of the legal tithe in <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp.</b>|$|E
50|$|Of {{industrial}} value {{are four}} animal fibers, wool, silk, camel hair, and angora {{as well as}} four plant fibers, cotton, <b>flax,</b> <b>hemp,</b> <b>and</b> jute. Dominant in terms of scale of production and use is cotton for textiles.|$|R
50|$|As Kirkcaldy {{entered into}} the 19th century, {{the arrival of the}} Kirkcaldy and District Railway, later {{to become part of the}} North British Railway, saw the town develop into the {{industrial}} heart of Fife—reviving the use of Kirkcaldy port, which had a severe setback during the mid-17th century.The harbour was catering for the growing trade of imports of <b>flax,</b> timber <b>and</b> <b>hemp</b> <b>and</b> exports of coal, salt and linen cloth, when a decision was made to build a new wet dock and pier from 1843-46.

50|$|Through many millennia, various suture {{materials}} were used, debated, and remained largely unchanged. Needles {{were made of}} bone or metals such as silver, copper, and aluminium bronze wire. Sutures were made of plant materials (<b>flax,</b> <b>hemp</b> <b>and</b> cotton) or animal material (hair, tendons, arteries, muscle strips and nerves, silk, and catgut).|$|R
60|$|The great {{end of this}} Bill is, by proper {{encouragement}} to extend the linen manufacture into those counties where it hath hitherto been little cultivated: But this encouragement of lessening the tithe of <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp</b> is one of such a kind as, {{it is to be}} feared, will have a directly contrary effect. Because, if I am rightly informed, no set of men hath for their number and fortunes been more industrious and successful than the Clergy, in introducing that manufacture into places which were unacquainted with it; by persuading their people to sow <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp,</b> by procuring seed for them and by having them instructed in the management thereof; and this they did not without reasonable hopes of increasing the value of their parishes after some time, as well as of promoting the benefit of the public. But if this Modus should take place, the Clergy will be so far from gaining that they will become losers by any extraordinary care, by having their best arable lands turned to <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp,</b> which are reckoned great impoverishers of land: They cannot therefore be blamed, if they should shew as much zeal to prevent its being introduced or improved in their parishes as they hitherto have shewed in the introducing and improving of it. This, I am told, some of them have already declared at least so far as to resolve not to give themselves any more trouble than other men about promoting a manufacture by the success of which, they only of all men are to be sufferers. Perhaps the giving them even a further encouragement than the law doth, as it now stands, to a set of men who might on many accounts be so useful to this purpose, would be no bad method of having the great end of the Bill more effectually answered: But this is what they are far from desiring; all they petition for is no more than to continue on the same footing with the rest of their fellow-subjects.|$|E
60|$|If this Modus {{of paying}} by the acre be to pass into a law, {{it were to}} be wished that the same law would appoint one or more sworn {{surveyors}} in each parish to measure the lands on which <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp</b> are sown, as also would settle the price of surveying, and determine whether the incumbent or farmer is to pay for each annual survey. Without something of this kind, there must constantly be disputes between them, and the neighbouring justices of peace must be teazed as often as those disputes happen.|$|E
60|$|One terrible {{circumstance}} in this Bill, is, that {{of turning}} the tithe of <b>flax</b> <b>and</b> <b>hemp</b> into what the lawyers call a Modus, or a certain sum {{in lieu of a}} tenth part of the product. And by this practice of claiming a Modus in many parishes by ancient custom, the Clergy in both kingdoms have been almost incredible sufferers. Thus, in the present case, the tithe of a tolerable acre of flax, which by a medium is worth twelve shillings, is by the present Bill reduced to four shillings. Neither is this the worst part in a Modus; every determinate sum must in process of time sink from a fourth to a four-and-twentieth part, or a great deal lower, by that necessary fall attending the value of money, which is now at least nine tenths lower all over Europe than it was four hundred years ago, by a gradual decline; and even a third part at least within our own memories, in purchasing almost everything required for the necessities or conveniencies of life; as any gentleman can attest, who hath kept house for twenty years past. And this will equally affect poor countries as well as rich. For, although, I look upon it as an impossibility that this kingdom should ever thrive under its present disadvantages, which without a miracle must still increase; yet, when the whole cash of the nation shall sink to fifty thousand pounds; we must in all our traffic abroad, either of import or export, go by the general rate at which money is valued in those countries that enjoy the common privileges of human kind. For this reason, no corporation, (if the Clergy may presume to call themselves one) should by any means grant away their properties in perpetuity upon any consideration whatsoever; Which is a rock that many corporations have split upon, to their great impoverishment, and sometimes to their utter undoing. Because they are supposed to subsist for ever; and because no determination of money is of any certain perpetual intrinsic value. This is known enough in England, where estates let for ever, some hundred years ago, by several ancient noble families, do not at this present pay their posterity a twentieth part of what they are now worth at an easy rate.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 19th century, {{the main}} {{industries}} in the town were <b>flax</b> spinning <b>and</b> linen weaving. To cope with increasing imports of <b>flax,</b> timber <b>and</b> <b>hemp,</b> <b>and</b> exports of coal, salt and linen, between 1843 and 1846 a new wet dock and pier was built at the harbour. In 1847 a canvas manufacturer, Michael Nairn, took out a licence on Frederick Walton's patent {{for the production of}} floorcloth, and opened a factory in nearby Pathhead. When the patent expired in 1876, Nairn and other floorcloth manufacturers began the manufacture of linoleum. Production of both floorcloth and linoleum occupied seven factories in the town by 1883, employing 1,300. A further expansion of the harbour was completed between 1906 and 1908, for another increase in linoleum and coal.|$|R
