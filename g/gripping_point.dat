The industrial applications are fully automated feeding systems, commonly known as bin-picking. The proposed method for object detection is a generic approach to detect {{6 degrees of freedom}} of any solid objects with arbitrary geometry. The proposed method is using 3 D range data and is based on a heuristic tree search using a 6 D pose voting scheme. For <b>gripping</b> <b>point</b> determination the object removal is simulated using the range data and a CAD model of the gripper in order to avoid any kind of collisions. During long-term operations in different use-cases, the method showed its usability regarding the crucial requirements, such as robustness, accuracy, portability and speed...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{grasping}} an unknown 2 - 1 2 D object with constant horizontal cross section using three types of robot hands. We consider a three fingered hand, a two fingered hand and a standard parallel jaw gripper and equip these with distance and angle sensors that are located at the fingers or jaws. The sensors used are simple, provide only limited information, but allow us to reactively find a good grasp on an unknown convex object. When grasped the forces applied will be normal to the object boundary. Furthermore the object is not disturbed as the grasping points are being sought. 1 Introduction In the past, the usual approach to grasping has been to assume an accurate model of the object to be grasped and from such a model, an off-line geometric algorithm determines a set of <b>grip</b> <b>points,</b> where the fingers are then placed.

40|$|Bin-Picking is {{a complex}} subject. Attempts of {{industrial}} realizations are often too slow or too unreliable. Many approaches strongly focus on detecting the pose of objects inside the bin. While this {{is an essential part}} of bin-picking, industrial realizations also need to have a robust strategy to pick the detected objects out of the bin, even in complex situations. We address this issue by separating the object pose detection from the task of finding an appropriate gripping position. Our goal is to find a suitable position for the gripper and avoid collisions with the bin or other objects. This collision-free and fast <b>gripping</b> <b>point</b> determination will be presented in this paper. The basic idea is to generate several potential gripping configurations and to rate them, primarily based on the probability of collisions with any obstacles inside the sensor point cloud.

40|$|Fatigue {{failure of}} base metal solder joints are an unsolved problem and {{information}} relating to the fatigue strength of solder joints is rarely provided. The purpose of this report is to test the application of Vera solder for use with the base metals of Verabond II and Minalux {{and its effect on}} fatigue behavior of these joints. Fifteen cast and 12 soldered joint specimens were made of each alloy. The thermal cycles required for oxidation, opaque, dentin and glazing were performed. Rotating, bending and cantilever fatigue tests were performed with a 2880 rpm (ASTM Rotating bending fatigue testing of metals JIsz 22 74; 1078). All soldered specimens except two in each group fractured at soldered joints. All of the specimens from intact Verabond II and Minalux fractured at the <b>gripping</b> <b>point</b> of machine except two Minalux specimens that fractured at the midpoint. Under equal load, the number of loading cycles to cause fracture in intact Verabond II is greater than in intact Minalux. In soldered Verabond II the fatigue limit was 20 MPa higher than in soldered Minalux. With probability of 90 % and with Confidence Interval (CI) of 90 % the fatigue limit of soldered Minalux is 194. 65 MPa and for soldered Verabond 2, {{it is not possible to}} give a probability. The Fatigue Ratio of soldered Verabond 2 is 0. 57 and Minalux 0. 50. Due to the influences of several parameters, with use of the gas-oxygen torch, the resulting solder especially in base metal alloy is not reliable. As a result, Vera solder alloy by gas-oxygen torch is not recommended for Verabond II and Minalux...|$|E

The criterion leads to the formulation of an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints that is easy to implement.

40|$|International audienceDemand {{for more}} {{versatile}} assembly and handling systems to facilitate customised production is gaining in importance. A new handling principle {{has been developed}} as a cost-effective approach to adapt to component-dependent tasks. It {{is based upon the}} gripping and movement of objects by multiple arms within a parallel kinematic structure. This structure combines the advantages of a system of co-operating robots with a simplified drive concept, in which the number of drives used is sharply reduced. On this basis, a modular assembly platform is being developed which, in addition to the kinematic units, also facilitates the integration of measurement, testing and joining modules. The modular concept also creates the conditions for a versatile, demand-driven layout of multiple kinematic units. This facilitates not only cooperative handling of large components using several <b>gripping</b> <b>points,</b> but also the transfer of objects handled between the individual units.

However, when picking up objects of unknown lengths, orientations and <b>gripping</b> <b>points,</b> the overall kinematics of a robot in the teleoperation system becomes uncertain. Therefore, new controllers are required that can guarantee {{the stability and}} motion tracking performance of the system {{in the presence of}} both dynamic and kinematic uncertainties in the master and the slave robots. In this paper, first the uncertain dynamics of the human operator and the environment are incorporated into the dynamics of the master and the slave, respectively. Then, for a teleoperation system with uncertain dynamics and kinematics, nonlinear adaptive controllers are designed for both the master and the slave. The controllers do not need exact knowledge of the dynamics of the master, the slave, the operator, or the environment, or of the kinematics of the master or the slave. The stability and position tracking convergence of the entire teleoperation system are studied. The validity of the theoretical results is verified by simulations. T I...|$|R
