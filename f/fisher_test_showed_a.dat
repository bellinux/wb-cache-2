Tecidos destes caninos foram analisados através de histologia e imuno-histoquímica. Aumento das placas de Peyer do intestino delgado e hiperemia da mucosa e serosa {{intestinal}} foram os achados macroscópicos mais observados. Microscopicamente, foi visualizada enterite necrótica em 77 % dos cães. Em 17, 7 % as alterações histológicas do intestino delgado ficaram prejudicadas pela autólise, dificultando a interpretação. O teste de imuno-histoquímica em cortes de intestino delgado, linfonodo mesentérico, timo, baço, tonsila, língua e medula óssea de todos os 96 casos, foi positivo em 91, 6 % (88 / 96) dos casos. O intestino delgado demonstrou o melhor resultado, obtendo-se marcações em 77 % (74 / 96) dos casos. A análise final do exame paramétrico de Fisher demonstrou uma fraca associação entre autólise intestinal e resultado positivo da imuno-histoquímica onde as chances de um intestino delgado autolisado histologicamente apresentar resultado positivo na imuno-histoquímica é 0, 33 vezes menor (OR= 0, 33; 95 %IC: 0, 10 - 1, 17) quando comparada a um intestino delgado não autolisado. Ninety-six {{dogs with}} gross lesions suggestive of canine parvovirus infection were selected and necropsied in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, between March 2005 and November 2006. The main gross lesions were {{enlargement of the}} Peyer's patches in the small intestine and hyperemia in the intestinal mucosa and serosa. Microscopically, the small intestine showed necrotizing enteritis in 77 % (74 / 96) of the dogs examined. However, in 17. 7 % of the histological evaluation in the small intestine were damaged due to autolytic changes {{making it difficult to}} obtain an appropriate interpretation. The immunohistochemistry test was performed in tissues of small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, tonsils, tongue, and bone marrow in all the 96 selected cases. Parvovirus antigen was detected in 91. 6 % (88 / 96) of the dogs necropsied. The best result of the IHC test was seen in samples of small intestine which was positive in 77 % (74 / 96) of the cases.

40|$|Background: Some {{patients}} {{present an}} unusual association of both action tremor (AT) and rest tremor (RT) making {{the differential diagnosis}} between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) difficult. Aim: To investigate this particular clinical picture {{trying to focus on}} possible peculiar clinical inferences. Patients and Methods: Twenty-three patients with atypical tremor syndrome were selected for the study. They underwent neurological examination, neuroimaging study, and brain DaTSCAN single-photon emission computed tomography. Results: Twenty-three patients were evaluated; 17 presented mixed-tremor syndrome, while six patients showed only isolated AT or RT. DaTSCAN was pathological in 19 patients and normal in 3 patients. The emerging statistical data highlighted a positive correlation between disease duration and DaTSCAN abnormalities; <b>Fisher's</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> marked difference in evolution toward a dysfunction of dopaminergic pathways in patients with both AT and RT phenotype.

Our clinical survey has not led to absolute considerations; however, it seeks to highlight the clinical markers that might arouse the suspicion of extrapyramidal disease in patients with atypical tremor syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Synurbic {{populations are}} ecologically and ethologically {{different}} from populations inhabiting natural sites. The differences include factors which {{could affect the}} genetic diversity of population- more sedentary life style, decreasing proportion of breeding individuals, high re-occupation rate, higher longevity or lower natural selection. Additionally, urban populations can be isolated from rural ones and thus suffer from genetic drift and inbreeding resulting in low level of genetic variability. This report is based on preliminary results, obtained from analysis of three microsatellite loci in Kestrels inhabiting two areas of Warsaw: city centre {{of the city and}} outskirts. Two hypotheses were tested: (i) genetic variability of birds inhibiting the centre of Warsaw is lower than that of birds from the outskirts due to a stronger isolation of the centre population from wild conspecifics; (ii) indices of genetic variability reach similar values in populations from the centre and from the outskirts of Warsaw. While mean allelic diversity is slightly higher at the outskirts, the mean heterozygosity reached a higher value in the population from the centre of Warsaw. The differences in frequency of particular alleles between the studied areas were observed and the <b>Fisher</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> highly significant genetic differentiation between investigated groups of Kestrel for each locus.

As inadequate dialysis is considered a risk factor leading to higher morbidity and mortality, determination of adequacy of dialysis is necessary. This study was conducted to determine adequacy of dialysis in continuous hemodialysis patients in Kamkar and Hazrat Vali Asr Hospitals in the state of Qom, Iran. Methods This cross sectional descriptive-analytic study was conducted in 2006. The study variables were age, gender, height, weight and duration of dialysis. Data were collected by a questionnaire and URR, dKt/V, eKt/V and pKt/V were calculated. For statistical analysis, t-test, <b>Fisher’s</b> exact <b>test</b> and Pearson correlation were employed. Results Of 238 patients, 51. 7 % and 48. 3 % were males and females respectively. The average age was 55. 27 ± 16. 79 years. Mean values of dKt/V, eKt/V, pKt/V and URR were 1. 03 ± 0. 232, 0. 89 ± 0. 196, 1. 18 ± 0. 254, and 57. 46 ± 8. 42 respectively. The percent of adequate dialysis in eKt/V, pKt/V and URR were 26. 5 %, 44. 5 % and 21 % respectively.

40|$|Objetivou-se nesta pesquisa quantificar as reações vacinais em carcaças de animais da espécie bovina e raça Nelore de diferentes idades e sexos, provenientes de sistemas extensivos de criação. Foram avaliados 850 animais abatidos em frigorífico do município de Sinop/MT. A detecção e retirada das lesões foi realizada na linha I de inspeção de rotina de carcaça. O ensaio estatístico foi conduzido no delineamento inteiramente casualizado com tratamentos dispostos em arranjo fatorial 2 x 4 (dois sexos e quatro grupos de idades). A avaliação do peso foi feita por análise de variância, seguido de teste de médias com utilização do teste de Student-Newman-Keuls. O teste de Fisher mostrou uma interação entre idade e sexo. Nos machos não houve diferença entre os grupos de diferentes idades, entretanto, nas fêmeas, o grupo acima de cinco anos foi estatisticamente {{inferior}} em relação aos outros grupos. Na comparação entre machos e fêmeas apenas nos animais acima de cinco anos foi encontrada diferença significativa, e as fêmeas apresentaram maior peso da amostra que os machos. O peso médio das porções retiradas foi de 1, 28 kg/animal, o que representa uma perda econômica de US$ 1, 68 /animal, superior nas fêmeas (1, 30 kg) em relação aos machos (1, 24 kg). Os resultados revelaram alta incidência de lesões vacinais nas carcaças dos animais em todas as categorias analisadas, o que leva à redução da sua qualidade e valor, e mostra a importância da melhoria dos manejos de vacinação para minimizar os prejuízos do produtor.

40|$|Background: Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{is a major}} clinical {{problem because}} of its large contribution to mortality. The genetic bases of this disease have been widely studied {{in recent years to}} find a clear association with some genetic markers that increase the risk of its occurrence. In the present investigation, the correlation between MI and the C 3 complement polymorphism was analyzed using a case–control study. Methods: Our study ported on one hundred seventy survived myocardial infarction patients and ninety five healthy controls. The C 3 allele identification was investigated using the amplification refractory mutation system PCR to determine the C 3 *S and the C 3 *F alleles of the C 3 polymorphism. Results: Frequencies of C 3 *S and C 3 *F in patients are 0. 59 and 0. 41 respectively. <b>Fisher</b> <b>test</b> results <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> significant increase of C 3 *F allele in the sample of patients (0. 41; odds ratio: 2. 616; C.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAccording to the Helmholtz {{theory of}} {{accommodation}} {{the loss of}} accommodation amplitude {{is caused by the}} growing sclerosis of the crystalline lens, whereas the ciliary muscle and the lens capsule are mainly uneffected by age. A permanent treatment method for presbyopia which offers a dynamic accommodation ability is a recent field of study. The concept followed in this paper uses femtosecond laser pulses to potentially overcome the loss of deformation ability of the crystalline lens by creating gliding planes inside the lens tissue to improve its flexibility. MethodsThe aim of the study is to show that the flexibility of human donor lenses can be increased by applying tightly focused near infrared femtosecond laser pulses into the lens tissue. Thereby the tissue is separated by the photodisruption effect. A certain pattern of gliding planes is cut inside the tissue of 41 human donor lenses and the deformation ability of the lenses are compared using the <b>Fisher</b> spinning <b>test</b> before and after laser treatment. ResultsThe laser treatment results in an increased deformation ability of the crystalline lens. The lens a–p thickness increases on average by 97 μm± 14 μm after the treatment. The <b>Fisher</b> spinning <b>test</b> <b>shows</b> <b>an</b> increase of 16 % in deformation ability of the lens at a rotational speed of 1620 rpm. ConclusionThe creation of gliding planes with a fs laser inside the crystalline lens tissue can change the deformation ability of the lens.

40|$|PURPOSE: Adequate {{preparation}} of abutment teeth for removable partial denture (RPD) rest seats allows appropriate masticatory force transmission, retention, {{and stability of}} supporting structures. It follows that careful preparation will be important for the longevity of the rehabilitation. The present study aimed to clinically evaluate rest seats and undercut areas of abutment teeth in RPD wearers after 2 years of use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 193 occlusal, incisal, and cingulum rest seats were evaluated in terms of shape, rest adaptation, wear, caries, fractures, and surface type (enamel, composite resin, or amalgam). Two hundred and fourteen undercut areas were evaluated in terms of surface type (enamel or restoration) and integrity. This study {{was approved by the}} Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, resolution 196 / 1996, protocol number 11 / 05. RESULTS: Intact preparations accounted for 92. 2 % of the total. Application of the Pearson test (p= 0. 289) found no statistically significant differences among the materials on which the rest seats were prepared. For the undercut areas, 20. 7 % of those obtained on restorative material were nonintact. In addition, <b>Fisher's</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> statistically significant difference (p= 0. 001) in surface type; enamel surfaces were shown to be 14 times more stable than restored surfaces.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the CT features of reperfusion (presence/absence) in non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI) and their prognostic value {{in an emergency}} setting. Methods: A revision was undertaken of imaging from 20 patients (16 males/ 4 females) with a dismissal summary of NOMI. All patients had previously undergone aminimum of one multidetector CT examination, and consequently underwent surgery (n= 8), autopsy (n= 2), angiography (n= 1) or endoscopy (n= 9). An evaluation of the CT scans was conducted to determine vessels, mesentery, bowel and peritoneal cavity features. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) average diameter of NOMI cases were compared with 30 controlled cases. Kappa, Kolmogorov' Smirnov (K-S) and <b>Fisher's</b> exact <b>tests</b> were used for statistical analysis. Results: A mean SMA diameter significantly smaller {{than that of the}} controlled cases was found for patients with NOMI (K-S test: D= 0. 75, p= 3. 7 × 10 - 08). <b>Fisher's</b> exact <b>tests</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> strong connection between the presence of reperfusion and mesenteric fat stranding (p= 0. 026), bowel wall thickening (p= 3. 2 × 10 - 05) and a high attenuation of the bowel wall on unenhanced CT images (p= 2. 8 × 10 - 04). A reduction in mortality was significantly linked to the combination of normal mesenteric vessels and wall thickening (p= 0. 034). Conclusion: Analysis of not only vessels findings but also mesentery and bowel CT features will support the identification of NOMI with or without a reperfusion event in an emergency setting. A strong correlation between some CT features and lower mortality exists. Advances in knowledge: CT features of NOMI with or without reperfusion are demonstrated. Correctly assessing the presence of reperfusion in NOMI, may allow better management of these conditions in the emergency setting...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{studies on}} animal models have shown {{positive}} effects of Kelussia odoratissima on different health problem cases including digestive disorders. However, {{there has been no}} research on the effectiveness of Kelussia odoratissima on peptic ulcers in humans. In this study, "the effect of Kelussia odoratissima on the rate of improvement in patients with peptic ulcer" has been investigated. Methods: The present study was a Randomized clinical trial which is done in March- September, 2015 in Amir Al-Momenin Hospital in Arak, Iran. The subjects were 60 patients with peptic ulcer, selected by simple random sampling and acquiring their informed consents. After taking written informed consent, they were divided into two groups randomly: the control group (administering prescribed medicines) and the intervention group (administering medicines along with Kelussia odoratissima powder). One month after intervention, the types of peptic ulcers were determined by follow-up endoscopy. Finally, the data was analyzed using SPSS v. 16 and statistical independent samples t-test and <b>Fisher’s</b> exact <b>test.</b> Results: The two groups were homogenous in terms of demographic features. The findings showed that the groups were not significantly different regarding the type of peptic ulcers (p= 0. 91) before intervention; but one month after intervention, the highest frequency in the control group was related to the ulcers Type II and III, and the lowest frequency to the ulcers Type I, while the highest frequency in the intervention group was related to the ulcers Type I and the lowest frequency to the ulcers Type III and higher.

40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{prevention of}} thrombosis after surgical arterial injury {{is still an}} open question. In the present study, a recently developed model of carotid endarterectomy in rats {{was used to assess}} the effectiveness of heparin, prostacyclin (PGI 2), and OKY- 1581, a selective thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) synthetase inhibitor, in preventing thrombus formation. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: A [...] controls (no treatment), B [...] tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris) -HCl buffer (vehicle of PGI 2), C [...] heparin (100 IU/kg), D [...] OKY- 1581 (100 microns/kg/minute), E [...] low dose PGI 2 (10 ng/kg/minute), F [...] high dose PGI 2 (50 ng/kg/minute). The animals were killed by in vivo perfusion-fixation 15 minutes after recirculation. The endarterectomized vessels were submitted to scanning electron microscopy examination and were evaluated blindly according to the following scale: 1, (almost) normal appearance of the endarterectomized surface; 2, moderately abnormal appearance; and 3, definitely abnormal appearance. The results in terms of thrombus prevention were as follows: controls congruent to Tris-HCl buffer less than OKY- 1581 congruent to low dose PGI 2 less than high dose PGI 2 less than heparin. When combined, the two control groups did significantly worse than all four treated groups (P greater than 0. 05). <b>Fisher's</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> statistically significant difference between controls and the heparin group (P = 0. 01) and between controls and high dose PGI 2 -treated rats (P less than 0. 05), but not between controls and low dose PGI 2 -(P less than 0. 16) or OKY- 1581 -treated animals (P less than 0. 16).

40|$|BACKGROUND Tumor {{characteristics}} affect surgical {{complexity and}} outcomes of partial nephrectomy (PN). OBJECTIVE To develop an Arterial Based Complexity (ABC) scoring system to predict morbidity of PN. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Four readers independently scored contrast-enhanced computed tomography images of 179 patients who underwent PN. INTERVENTION Renal cortical masses were categorized by {{the order of}} vessels needed to be transected/dissected during PN. Scores of 1, 2, 3 S, or 3 H were assigned to tumors requiring transection of interlobular and arcuate arteries, interlobar arteries, segmental arteries, or in close proximity of the renal hilum, respectively during PN. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Interobserver variability was assessed with kappa values and percentage of exact matches between each pairwise combination of readers. Linear regression {{was used to evaluate}} the association between reference scores and ischemia time, estimated blood loss, and estimated glomerular filtration rates at 6 wk and 6 mo after surgery adjusted for baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate. <b>Fisher's</b> exact <b>test</b> was used to test for differences in risk of urinary fistula formation by reference category assignment. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Pairwise comparisons of readers' score assignments were significantly correlated (all p< 0. 0001); average kappa = 0. 545 across all reader pairs. The average proportion of exact matches was 69 %. Linear regression between the complexity score system and surgical outcomes showed significant associations between reference category assignments and ischemia time (p< 0. 0001) and estimated blood loss (p= 0. 049). <b>Fisher's</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> significant difference in risk of urinary fistula formation with higher reference category assignments (p= 0. 028). Limitations include use of a single institutional cohort to evaluate our system. CONCLUSIONS The ABC scoring system for PN is intuitive, easy to use, and demonstrated good correlation with perioperative morbidity.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} in an Italian cohort {{the incidence}} of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in pregnancies after assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Setting: Thrombosis and Haemostasis Unit at I. R. C. C. S. 'Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza', S. Giovanni Rotondo. Participants: A prospective cohort of 998 women advised to undergo ART was referred by local fertility clinics from April 2002 to July 2011. Follow-up information was obtained during the check-up and/or by phone interviews. In a cohort of women who consecutively gave birth (n= 3339) after spontaneous conception in our Institution, information on the diagnoses of pregnancy-related venous thromboses was obtained by linkage to a patient administrative register. Primary and secondary outcome measures: We calculated {{the incidence of}} VTE and superficial venous thrombosis in successful ART cycles and compared it {{with that of the}} general population conceiving spontaneously. Results: Overall, 684 ART cycles were carried out by 234 women, who achieved a clinical pregnancy; in case of more than one successful cycle, only the first pregnancy was considered. Three vein thromboses (two VTE and one superficial vein thrombosis) were recorded. An antithrombotic prophylaxis with LMWH alone or combined with low-dose aspirin was prescribed in 23 / 234 (9. 8 %) women. In the reference cohort of 3339 women, a total of 11 vein thromboses were observed: six VTE and five SVT. The two-tailed <b>Fisher</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> trend towards statistical significance (p: 0. 06, OR: 3. 9, 95 % CI 0. 87 to 15. 3). After the exclusion of superficial thromboses in both the groups, we found that the incidence of VTE in our population of women who had undergone ART was 2 / 234 pregnancies (8. 5 %), whereas that in our reference population was 6 / 3339 (1. 8 %) (p: 0. 09).

40|$|Objectives: Although organ-preserving {{radiotherapy}} or chemoradiotherapy {{has offered}} good locoregional control, many patients still experience recurrent disease requiring salvage laryngectomy. The pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) {{is a common}} and troublesome complication in the early post-operative period after laryngectomy. Here, we evaluated the cause of PCF after laryngectomy, with special emphasis on radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Patients and methods: A total of 63 consecutive patients undergoing salvage total laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx at Kanazawa University Hospital from 1990 to 2005 were reviewed. Forty of the 63 had received primary total laryngectomy (PL). Ten patients underwent radiotherapy alone (SL-RT) and 13 patients underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (SL-CRT) followed by salvage laryngectomy. Results: Overall, 17 of the 63 patients (27. 0 %) developed PCF after laryngectomy. <b>Fisher's</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> significant increase of PCF formation in SL-CRT (7 / 13, 53. 8 %) compared with PL (7 / 40, 17. 5 %) (p = 0. 0252). There were non-significant increases of PCF formation both in SL-CRT (7 / 13, 53. 8 %) compared with SL-RT (3 / 10, 30. 0 %) (p = 0. 4015), and also in SL-RT (3 / 10, 30. 0 %) compared with PL (7 / 40, 17. 5 %) (p = 0. 3969). The Mann-Whitney U-test showed that the duration of PCF was significantly longer for SL-CRT PCF (121. 2 ± 95. 0 days) compared with those for PL (39. 0 ± 55. 3 days) (p = 0. 0298) or SL-RT (28. 0 ± 16. 2 days) (p = 0. 0325). However, {{we did not find}} {{a significant difference in the}} duration of PCF with respect to PL (39. 0 ± 55. 3 days) and SL-RT (28. 0 ± 16. 2 days) (p = 0. 4367). Conclusions: Although radiotherapy or chemotherapy has only a limited impact on PCF formation, concurrent chemoradiotherapy significantly increases PCF formation. The addition of chemotherapy to irradiation delays PCF closure. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The role {{of media}} in the {{organizing}} of events which create awareness has contributed immensely in raising awareness about breast cancer (Komen, 2016). One in eight women {{is a victim of}} the disease (Puntoni, 2011). With increasing awareness, health has become a significant area of focus for Corporate Social Responsibility, which includes the various initiatives taken by corporations to contribute to their social, environmental and ethical responsibilities. This encourages health promotion efforts, such as breast cancer awareness advertisements and empowers consumers with improved lifestyle choices and social consciousness (Moreira, 2014) (WHO, 2008). Aim: To analyze the content of breast cancer awareness advertisements by brands to study the messages communicated and understand the level of health appeal by various brand categories. Methods: Breast cancer awareness advertisements from October 2015 and October 2016 on internet platforms belonging to men and women’s wear brand categories were selected. Out of the sixty (60) advertisements collected, a content analysis was conducted on thirty-five (35) of the advertisements. These were coded for basic characteristics and important themes such as mention of the brand’s products in text or image, health related appeal, information related to breast cancer, prevention measures, use of donations and gender oriented approach. Results: Most of the awareness advertisements (94 %, n= 33) promoted the brand’s products through text, image or both. Only 23 % (n= 8) of the advertisements contained breast cancer related information and majority of the advertisements (83 %, n= 29) were gender oriented towards femininity. The <b>Fisher’s</b> Exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> statistically significant association between the different brand categories (makeup, jewelry, lingerie, athletics, others) and the level of health appeal in the advertisements (p- value 0. 0062).

40|$|Background: Chylothorax {{is a rare}} but serious {{postoperative}} {{condition with}} {{a high rate of}} morbidity and may lead to the mortality of children undergoing congenital heart disease (CHD) surgery. This study evaluated the specific surgical procedures associated with the higher risk of postoperative chylothorax. Methods: W e assessed 435 cases undergoing CHD surgery between April 2003 and May 2006. We detected postoperative chylothorax in 6 patients. The diagnosis of chylothorax was established based on the presence of an odorless fluid with the characteristic milky appearance of the fluid (except when the patients were fasting in the immediate postoperative period), a triglyceride level greater than 110 mg/dL or between 50 and 110 mg/dL with a pleural fluid white cell count greater than 1000, and more than 80 % lymphocytes on differential when the pleural fluid was not chylous. Results: Over a 37 -month period, 435 (mean age = 51. 6 months; 232 males) patients underwent various types of surgical procedures for CHD; 6 patients developed chylothorax after the Fontan operation; one patient died due to severe chylothorax; 3 patients were managed by nutritional modifications, diuretics, and thoracocentesis; and   2 patients required thoracic duct ligation.

Objectives This study examined the parenting attitudes, general health, and some other related factors in mothers {{of children}} with ADHD. Materials and Methods Sixty mothers {{of children with}} ADHD who referred to psychiatric outpatient clinic of Ahvaz Golestan Hospital were selected by convenience sampling method. The parenting attitude, general health, and demographic data questionnaires were used. Results Forty two (70 %) mothers were healthy and 18 (30 %) were unhealthy. The Pierson coefficient and the <b>Fisher’s</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> only <b>a</b> significant relationship in maternal age with the total score of general health questionnaire (GHQ) (r = - 0. 350, P = 0. 05) and the score of anxiety subscale (r = - 0. 429, P = 0. 05). The scores of different attitudes were 29. 45 ± 5. 71 for dominating, 29. 13 ± 6. 08 for ignoring, and 27. 8 ± 5. 8 for possessive attitudes. Mothers with elementary school education level had fewer possessive attitude than higher educated mothers (P = 0. 017). The ignoring attitude was significantly higher in staff members than others (P = 0. 043). Logistic regression model also showed that the GHQ score was significantly related to maternal age (P = 0. 027) and number of children (P = 0. 011). Conclusions Dominating, ignoring and possessive attitudes are frequent in mothers of children with ADHD.

40|$|BACKGROUND : The {{measure of}} anaemia status using {{packed cell volume}} (PCV) can be a {{reliable}} indicator of African trypanosomosis (AT) {{in the absence of}} other anaemia-causing conditions. However, studies that have estimated prevalence of anaemia in cattle from AT endemic areas have rarely reported the prevalence of the disease in the anaemic cattle. Therefore we investigated the prevalence of AT in anaemic cattle at sites that had recently reported the disease in Itezhi tezhi district of central Zambia. METHODS : During a survey, blood samples were collected from 564 randomly selected cattle for anaemia determination from seven crush pens (Mutenda, Kapulwe, Banachoongo, Itumbi, Iyanda, New Ngoma and Shinampamba). At a PCV- value cut off of 26 %, all samples positive for anaemia were subjected to both parasitological examination on thick and thin blood smears and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for detection of trypanosome DNA. <b>Fisher’s</b> exact <b>test</b> and a mixed effect logistic regression analyses were used to determine and measures associations, respectively. RESULTS : Of 564 cattle screened, 58 (10. 3 %; 95 % CI: 7. 8 – 12. 8 %) had anaemia. PCR-RFLP results showed that 17 (29. 3 %; 95 % CI; 17. 2 – 41. 4 %) anaemic cattle were positive for pathogenic trypanosomes compared to 1 (1. 7 %; 95 % CI: 0. 0 – 5. 2 %) on parasitological examination using thick smears. The infections were caused by Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax. <b>Fisher’s</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> strong association between PCV and pathogenic trypanosome infection (P = 0. 004). A mixed effect multivariate logistic regression <b>showed</b> that <b>a</b> one unit increase in PCV reduced the likelihood of detecting AT with PCR-RFLP by 24. 7 % (95 % CI: 4. 6 – 40. 6 %; P = 0. 019) in anaemic cattle, taking into account their age and sex, with random effects for crush pen. CONCLUSION : These results suggest that T. congolense and T. vivax could be important causes of anaemia in cattle reared in AT endemic areas of Itezhi tezhi in Central Zambia. This also suggests that even though pathogenic trypanosomal infection was strongly associated with PCV, it could only account for up to 41 % of the anaemia in cattle. Therefore further investigation to ascertain other factors responsible for anaemia in AT endemic areas of Itezhi tezhi in Central Zambia is needed.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{experiences}} and perceptions of counsellors and patients towards a new counselling model for HIV-positive pregnant women on Option B+ at an antenatal clinic in South Africa and to describe the cohort of HIV-positive pregnant women who experienced the new counselling model. Methods: A mixed methods study design was employed. The quantitative data collection involved using retrospective cohort quantitative data of women that were initiated on Option B+ during the period of 1 October 2013 to 30 June 2014. The variables of interest included: age, gravidity, antiretroviral therapy initiation date, viral load result and number of counselling sessions completed. These were obtained from patient folders and from the Department of Health patient electronic health record. The data was analysed using STATA 12. The qualitative data involved semi-structured interviews of patients and counsellors who had experienced the counselling model. Results: The number of women who completed a total of 1, 2, 3 or 4 counselling sessions was 25 %, 26 %, 48 % and 1 % respectively. The percentage of women that were retained in care for more than 8 weeks postnatal was 53 %. Of the women with VL results, 92 % were virally suppressed. The <b>Fisher's</b> exact <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> P-value of 0. 05 at a level of significance of P ≤ 0. 05. Therefore there is sufficient evidence to show that there is a positive association between the number of counselling sessions completed and number of postnatal days in care. The study also found that from the counselling, the women gained social support, knowledge about: antiretroviral therapy, HIV, drug side effects and infant feeding. Conclusion: The poor uptake of the counselling intervention includes poor communication, service delivery challenges and social factors. The main motivation for initiating ART and maintaining adherence to treatment was to protect the baby and as a result, some women maintained adherence despite not completing the counselling. Women valued the education that they received during the counselling sessions and this influenced their adherence. Psychosocial support from the counsellors and peers was found to be vital to the women and this highlighted the need to incorporate a support group for the pregnant women, as part of the intervention. The findings also suggest that when offering counselling interventions to pregnant women, a balance between psychosocial support, practical support and patient education needs to be struck. Finally, education of the community on the importance of counselling is important in order to improve the uptake of the counselling because interventions aimed at mothers do not always take into account the influence of the social environment on the uptake of the intervention...|$|R
40|$|Nestin (a {{neuronal}} stem cell/progenitor cell {{marker of}} {{central nervous system}} development), vimentin (which is ubiquitously expressed in mesenchymal cells), and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, which {{is involved in the}} immune response, cell proliferation, and apoptosis) have been shown to interact in embryonic and undifferentiated tissues in modulating cell proliferation. In recent years, expression of nestin has shown to be associated with general proliferation of progenitor cell populations within neoplasms. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse nestin, vimentin and GR expression in tumour tissue (melanoma), and their association with clinicopathological variables, to evaluate any effect on tumour progression. There is no reported study addressing nestin expression in T 4 breast cancer patients. Thus, the aim of the present study was also to investigate, through immunohistochemistry, the expression and distribution of nestin in T 4 breast cancer, in order to determine its association with clinical and pathological parameters as well as with patients’ outcome. Immunohistochemistry, double label immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy were performed on biopsy specimens of cutaneous melanoma from 81 patients and in breast carcinomas from 53 patients. In melanoma, <b>Fisher’s</b> and Pearson’s <b>tests</b> <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> correlation between nestin, vimentin and subcellular GR location (P = 0. 008). Their concomitant expression also correlated with Clark level and thickness (P = 0. 02 and P = 0. 029, respectively). Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed a poorer outcome for stage III and IV patients with associated expression of nestin, vimentin and cytoplasmic GR in tumour tissue (P = 0. 02). Nestin was detectable in tumoral cells and in endothelial cells of blood microvessels, and it is significantly expressed in triple-negative and in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) subgroups of T 4 breast tumours. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the presence of nestin in tumoral cells significantly predicted poor prognosis at 5 years survival (P= 0. 02) and with borderline significance at 10 -years of survival (P= 0. 05) in T 4 breast cancer patients. These results suggest the presence in melanoma of growth mechanisms involving nestin, vimentin, and GR, similarly to that occurring in embryonic and undifferentiated cells, and may help in understanding tumour biology to provide a molecular basis for clinical therapies. In breast cancer the presence of nestin in tumoral cells and vessels suggest that this protein may be considered an important factor that leads to a poor prognosis. On the basis of these observations, we speculate that the stem cell marker nestin may characterize tumours with an aggressive clinical behavior...|$|R
