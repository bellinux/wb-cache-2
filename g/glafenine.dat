40|$|B-cell chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent B-cell malignancy in adults. Despite advances in treatment, the disease remains incurable, warranting further efforts to identify novel molecular targets and inhibitors. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) plays a pivotal role for B-lymphocyte development and maturation in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway and hence represents a potential therapeutic target for CLL. The present study is directed towards finding novel inhibitors of SYK through ligand based virtual screening. The co-crystal structure of SYK was investigated to locate active site residues (Glu- 449, Ala- 451 Arg- 498, Asn- 499, Ser- 511, and Asp- 512). Five SYK specific published inhibitors (Gleevec, staurosporine, Bay 61 - 3606, R- 406 and p 5 c) were explored against {{more than one million}} entries of the Ligand. Info metadatabase to create an in-house library of 1957 structural analogs. Ligand dataset was prepared using LigPrep and filtered based on Lipinski&#x 2019;s rule of five and reactive group constraints. Docking using Computational Glide v 5. 5 from lesser to higher stringency towards minor steric classes were applied subsequently to the prepared ligand dataset against a grid around the centroid of the SYK active site. Fifteen lead molecules with good binding affinity to SYK were identified and compared with binding affinities and orientations of five published inhibitors. Apigenin (- 10. 05 Kcal/mol) and <b>Glafenine</b> (- 9. 72 Kcal/mol) endeavored better binding affinities, hydrogen bonding network and Van der Waal interactions with active site residues compared to published inhibitors. Thus, Apigenin and <b>Glafenine</b> would be valuable for designing a novel inhibitor against CLL, if synthesized and tested in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Beside their {{analgesic}} properties, opiates exert {{beneficial effects}} on the intestinal wound healing response. In this study, we investigated the role of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling on the unfolded protein response (UPR) using a novel zebrafish model of NSAID-induced intestinal injury. The NSAID <b>glafenine</b> was administered to zebrafish larvae at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) for up to 24 hours in {{the presence or absence}} of the MOR-specific agonist DALDA. By analysis with histology, transmission electron microscopy and vital dye staining, glafenine-treated zebrafish showed evidence of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress, with disrupted intestinal architecture and halted cell stress responses, alongside accumulation of apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells in the lumen. Although the early UPR marker BiP was induced with glafenine-induced injury, downstream atf 6 and s-xbp 1 expression were paradoxically not increased, explaining the halted cell stress responses. The μ-opioid agonist DALDA protected against glafenine-induced injury through induction of atf 6 -dependent UPR. Our findings show that DALDA prevents glafenine-induced epithelial damage through induction of effective UPR...|$|E
40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drugs and}} certain food or drug additives {{are known to}} induce acute bronchospasms, angioneurotic edema, and urticaria in susceptible patients. Thirty-four patients (17 with asthma and 17 with urticaria), whose case history suggested such intolerance, were challenged orally with increasing doses of seven compounds: acetylsalicylic acid, <b>glafenine,</b> sodium benzoate, sulfur dioxide, potassium sorbate, sodium glutamate, and tartrazine. Among 162 oral provocation tests, 38 were positive (20 % decrease in peak flow rate or appearance of acute urticaria/angioneurotic edema). Twenty-four of the 34 patients (nine with asthma and 15 with urticaria) were intolerant {{to at least one}} compound. However, no serious reaction was observed. In 20 of these 24 patients (six with asthma and 14 with urticaria), a diet free of additives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs resulted, within 5 days, in a marked improvement of symptoms, which persisted 8 to 14 mo after starting the diet. Age, prevalence of IgE-mediated allergy, and nasal polyposis were similar in patients with or without reactions of intolerance. Under the conditions used, oral provocation tests proved to be feasible, safe, and useful in many patients not helped by existing methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] A {{complete}} general unknown {{screening procedure}} was developed using liquid chromatography-mass pectrometry (LC-MS), a coupling that {{can increase the}} range of compounds amenable to MS. Sample preparation was by solid. phase extraction on a mixed-mode support in parallel with serum deproteination in order to recover the most hydrophilic compounds. Chromatography employed a reversed-phase narrow. bore column (150 x l-ram i. d.) and a 50 -min gradient elution at low flow-rate (50 pUmin), compatible with the electrospray source used without splitting nor heating. The single quadrupole LC-MS instrument used was operated in the 100 to 1100 u mass range in both {{the positive and negative}} modes, with two different, alternated collision-induced dissociation voltages in the source, in order to obtain the molecular or pseudo-molecular ions as well as fragments for the compounds analyzed. The addition of spectra obtained at low and high fragmentation voltages gave reconstructed spectra for each polarity, representing library entries. Finally, a program was created in order to detect the peaks of interest in the chromatographic noise using a very efficient signal processing algorithm, compute their relative retention time with respect to the internal standard (<b>glafenine),</b> draw their reconstructed spectra, search them in the libraries, and edit a report...|$|E
