The FEQ is a parent report measure designed to provide an assessment of individual differences in parental practices that are representative among the parents of preschool children in the given cultural community. Factor analysis of the 63 items reliably recovered a four-component solution in both, maternal and paternal self-reports indicating the following broad-band parenting practices: Authoritative Parenting, <b>Ineffective</b> Control, <b>Power</b> Assertion, and Stimulation. Variables loading high on more than one component and those that did not load on the same factor obtained from maternal and paternal data were excluded from further analyses. The 51 items that were retained and corresponded to the four factors demonstrate adequate internal consistency for both samples of respondents. In addition, parental stimulation was positively linked to authoritative parenting, while it was negatively related to <b>ineffective</b> control and <b>power</b> assertion. The mothers perceived themselves to be more authoritative and stimulative than did fathers, who described themselves as more <b>power</b> assertive and <b>ineffective</b> in control.

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1888, a media furor arose over a series of deaths caused by pole-mounted {{high-voltage}} AC lines in New York City and around the country, attributed to the greed and callousness of the local AC-based lighting companies. In June of that year a New York electrical engineer named Harold P.

Brown's campaign immediately gained the assistance of Edison and his company, aiding Brown in his public electrocution of animals with AC, trying to claim that AC was more dangerous than DC. Historians noted, and documents from the period seem to show, that there grew to be collusion between the Edison company and Brown in their parallel attempts to limit the use of AC: assisting Brown's attempt to push through legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an <b>ineffective</b> <b>power</b> delivery system), providing technical assistance in Brown's tests to show AC would be the best current to power the new electric chair, and colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.|$|E

The effect of the fiber orientation at the scaffold surface was evaluated by investigating C 2 C 12 and L 6 proliferation (via SEM analysis and alamarBlue test) and differentiation (via RT-PCR analysis and MHC immunostaining). We demonstrated that highly orientated elastomeric microfibrous DegraPol scaffolds enable skeletal myogenesis in vitro by aiding in (a) myoblast adhesion, (b) myotube alignment, and (c) noncoplanar arrangement of cells, by providing the necessary directional cues along with architectural and mechanical support. status: publishe...|$|R

This study was designed to examine the pain-relieving effect of LLLT and possible microcirculatory changes measured by thermography in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Materials and Methods: Patients with mild or moderate KOA were randomized to receive either LLLT or placebo LLLT. Treatments were delivered twice a week over a period of 4 [*]wk with a diode laser (wavelength 830 [*]nm, continuous wave, power 50 [*]mW) in skin contact at a dose of 6 [*]J/point. The placebo control group was treated with an <b>ineffective</b> probe (<b>power</b> 0. 5 [*]mW) of the same appearance. Before examinations and immediately, 2 [*]wk, and 2 mo after completing the therapy, thermography was performed (bilateral comparative thermograph by AGA infrared camera); joint flexion, circumference, and pressure sensitivity were measured; and the visual analogue scale was recorded. Results: In the group treated with active LLLT, a significant improvement was found in pain (before treatment [BT]: 5. 75; 2 mo after treatment: 1. 18); circumference (BT: 40. 45; AT: 39. 86); pressure sensitivity (BT: 2. 33; AT: 0. 77); and flexion (BT: 105. 83; AT: 122. 94). In the placebo group, changes in joint flexion and pain were not significant. Thermographic measurements showed at least a 0. 5 °C increase in temperature—and thus an improvement in circulation compared to the initial values. In the placebo group, these changes did not occur.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Low-level {{laser therapy}} (LLLT) {{is thought to}} have {{analgesic}} and biomodulatory effects. Our objective was to assess the pain-relieving effect of LLLT and possible changes in joint stiffness and disability of patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and compare it to the more commonly used modality; therapeutic ultrasound(US). METHODS: 37 patients with mild or moderate KOA were randomized to receive either LLLT, placebo LLLT or US. All patients received a common treatment including acetaminophen (up to 2 gr/d) and medical advices for lifestyle modification and exercise. Treatments were delivered 5 times a week over a period of 2 weeks. Active laser group was treated with a diode laser (wavelength 880 nm, continuous wave, power 50 mW) at a dose of 6 J/point (24 J/knee). The placebo control group was treated with an <b>ineffective</b> probe (<b>power</b> 0 mW) of the same appearance. The third group received pulsed ultrasound with an intensity of 1. 5 - 2 w/cm 2, and for 5 minutes per knee. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Western Ontario MacMaster (WOMAC) questionnaires were used for data gathering before, 1 and 3 months after completing the therapy. RESULTS: Pain reduced in all 3 groups but laser was superior in comparison. Stiffness improved 1 mo after therapy in the laser group but not in the others. Disability decreased in both laser and US groups (more significantly in the laser group) but not in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Our results show that LLLT reduces pain, joint stiffness and disability in KOA and is superior to placebo and US. </p...|$|R

The aim of this in vitro study is to compare both wavelengths in terms of irradiation dose required for microbial inactivation, to quantify these irradiation doses and to investigate the influence of certain (laser) parameters on the antimicrobial efficacy. Agar plates containing a uniform layer of Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans or Propionibacterium acnes were mounted perpendicularly underneath the laser handpieces (5 mm spot). The Er:YAG laser was operated in single-pulse mode. Pulse energies of 40 - 400 mJ and pulse lengths of 100, 300, 600, and 1, 000 mu s were tested. After incubation at 37 A degrees C for 48 h, growth on the plates was scored. The pulse energy yielding complete absence of growth over the entire spot area was taken as the total inhibition threshold (TIT). TITs were determined for every species and pulse length. The Nd:YAG laser was operated with pulse trains because single pulses were <b>ineffective.</b> Output <b>power</b> was 15 W and frequency was 100 Hz. Spots were irradiated for 5 - 120 s. After incubation, the diameters of the inhibition zones were measured. For the Er:YAG laser, TITs varied between 100 and 210 mJ, and differed significantly between species and pulse lengths. Using Nd:YAG irradiation, TITs were around 5, 300 J/cm(2) for C. albicans and 7, 100 J/cm(2) for P. acnes. No inhibition was observed for E. faecalis.

40|$|Variable {{tail rotor}} speed is {{investigated}} {{as a method}} for reducing tail rotor power, and improving helicopter performance. A helicopter model able to predict the main rotor and tail rotor powers is presented, and the flight test data of the UH- 60 A helicopter is used for validation. The predictions of the main and tail rotor powers are generally in good agreement with flight tests, which justifies {{the use of the}} present method in analyzing main and tail rotors. Reducing the main rotor speed can result in lower main rotor power at certain flight conditions. However, it increases the main rotor torque and the corresponding required tail rotor thrust to trim, which then decreases the yaw control margin of the tail rotor. In hover, the tail rotor {{may not be able to}} provide enough thrust to counter the main rotor torque, if it is slowed to follow the main rotor speed. The main rotor speed corresponding to the minimum main rotor power increases, if the change of tail rotor power in hover is considered. As a helicopter translated to cruise, the induced power decreases, and the profile power increases, with the profile power dominating the tail rotor. Reducing the tail rotor speed in cruise reduces the profile power to give a 37 % reduction in total tail rotor power and a 1. 4 % reduction to total helicopter power. In high speed flight, varying the tail rotor speed is <b>ineffective</b> for <b>power</b> reduction. The power reduction obtained by the variable tail rotor speed is reduced for increased helicopter weight...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{relates the}} {{financial}} and monetary dimensions of the contemporary economic crisis to working-class agency via a central concern of classical political economy: the distribution of surplus between the chief factors of production.

This paper argues that the punctuated pattern of the development validates the regulation theoretical narrative of an epochal shift from Fordism to finance-led accumulation. Furthermore, synthesising econometric studies supports a class-centred explanation. In the last instance, the falling wage share is due to successful transnational class rule {{in the form of}} a neoliberal hegemonic paradigm. Crucially, such class rule restructured the environment of trade unions, rendering increasingly <b>ineffective</b> its relational <b>power</b> resources.

In particular, recent studies examined their feasibility through hardware and software experiments [1]–[6]. Homogeneity enables the system to adapt itself to the external environment by changing its configuration. It can also re-pair itself if some part becomes faulty or damaged, as any module can function as any part in the system. This paper focuses on a micro-sized model of a self-reconfigurable homogeneous modular robot, which opens up many applications, such as inspection robots in hazardous environments or micro-scale simple manipulators. One example of an application is a micro-robot that moves around inside pipes in nuclear or chemical plants by changing its shape, and reorganizes itself as a manipu-lator to execute repairing tasks when it detects some fault as illustrated in Fig. 1. Other applications include a robot that searches for survivors through narrow spaces in buildings destroyed by natu-ral disasters, and also space applications like micro-size planetary exploring robots, solar panels, or satellite antennas.

A meta-analysis of evidence-based ADHD treatment in children further supports this, as researchers found wide variability in how PMT was carried out across previous studies. This analysis also noted that the clinicians involved in these studies often modified the training based on the needs of the family.

In the Introduction a brief explanation of the terms vitalism and mortalism is given. In Chapter 1 poems of the anthology Verzen are discussed. The speaker expresses his feeling for vitalism in cosmic terms and strives for the ultimate individuality. The poems about the cities are in the style of Expressionism. In Chapter 2 the poems of the anthology Paradise Regained are discussed. The speaker strives for a perfect relationship with his lover in order to protect him from death. This union appears to be <b>ineffective</b> against the <b>powers</b> of the night, darkness and death. In Chapter 3 the poems of the anthology Witte Vrouwen are discussed. The art of poetry is used in shielding against the attack from the forces of death in the funereal poems of this anthology. In Chapter 4 where the poems of the anthology Porta Nigra are discussed, a revival of vitalism occurs, but now in earthly terms. Death is then also seen as a portal to a new life.

40|$|Here I seek {{to explore}} the {{cosmopolitan}} foundations {{of the idea of}} human rights. The argument begins by considering the popularity of the idea of human rights in a globalized and fast-moving commodified and digital culture. At this point I consider whether the idea of human rights might be considered to be a modern utopia similar to the role that art and nature played in the Romantic movements of the 19 th century. Further, I defend human rights against those who simply see it as a form of neoliberalism or as largely <b>ineffective</b> against the <b>power</b> of the state. At this point I investigate some of the Durkheimian work within cultural sociology that has sought to investigate human rights as a form of moral community. The main problem with this view is that it has little to say about human freedom. However, viewed through a cultural lens, the global spread of human rights is connected to the idea of human dignity. While there is never likely to be a global consensus on this term, it does retain an important philosophical anchoring in Kantian ideas. More recently this debate has been revived by the critical reception of the work of Agamben and his idea of ‘bare life’. If human rights can indeed be connected to the struggle for a dignified and meaningful life, then the idea of ‘bare life’ remains an important conceptual advance. However, by considering the work and legacy of Du Bois, Gilroy and others, we can also see how the term dignity might take on other meanings in different settings. Finally, I argue that the idea of dignity and human rights could yet provide an important focus for resistance against the imperatives of capital and state in these neoliberal times...|$|R

Catholic practice, including charity and the activities of numerous fraternities - not hitherto noticed in Guernsey - engendered social cohesion. Any major changes in the island's religious life threatened this traditional polity. When religious alterations loomed in the wake of Henrician and Edwardian changes in England, the Guernsey authorities chose to conceal religious revenues and subvert English intentions. Traditional practices and institutions predominated until the reign of Elizabeth -a finding which contradicts previous studies. In the fifteen-sixties, however, the English Government appointed a series of commissions to seize Catholic dues and close down traditional institutions. The commissioners favoured local Protestants materially, and in 1565 elevated some of them to the Royal Court. The possibilities offered by a Calvinist system of social control appealed to the island's elite group. Calvinist organisation facilitated the enforcement of discipline, Catholic revenues were turned to private and secular purposes, and the elite retained power. The new Church depended on the secular authorities for its survival; it needed magistrates to allow foreign ministers to settle, to educate local ones, and to fend off the threat of an imposed settlement in line with the English settlement of 1559. The Church also repeatedly requested the Court to enact legislation in line with Calvinist principles, which it did. Although the records do not lend themselves to quantitative analysis, it is clear however that the Court often neglected to enforce such legislation. The Church's own remedies frequently were inadequate and <b>ineffective.</b> The secular <b>power</b> responded more positively in other areas. The Church's role in succouring the poor was encouraged, and the elite itself benefited materially as a consequence of Calvinist ideas. But the price paid for the retention of the elite's control and the material advantages it gained was the failure of the Calvinist dream and increased cultural differentiation in the community...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of female {{body in the}} paintings of Zora Petrovic anticipate the feminist theories that originated during the 70 ’s and 80 ’s of the 20 th century, which suggested androcentrism and absence of the female perspective {{and the necessity of}} re-evaluation on the concept of body. Through the expression of female body, in the traditional painter’s act, Zora Petrovic flirts with the social constructions of body and gender, intuitively pushing the boundaries towards the spiritual realm while treating body not only as an physical object but also as the bearer of the subjectivism and the point where personal and sexual identity, cultural and social stereotypes and relations between power and domination interconnect. The Act (1956 / 1957) represents an artistic deliberation on the social position of female body in the patriarchal capitalism with the elements of her own fictitious projections in search of the artist’s personal female and artistic identity, including her own intuitive artistic indication and conjecture on the feminist theories that had followed. The painting of this act depicts an act of self-identification, while the object of observation becomes the perspective of beholder who detaches the perspective of an observer while rendering his (male) absolute <b>power</b> <b>ineffective.</b> The naked body brings disarray by an indication of an erotic promise while dismissing an illusion of the absolute capitulation. The developed artistic form of ambiguous sexualised body that is revealed to the male voyeuristic observation transitions into the sensual dreaming of the model about own erotic and exhibitionistic body seductiveness which is, in fact, a provocation to the observer by its revealing eroticised position while encouraging a voyeuristic enjoyment that becomes an outcome of creation and observation of self-admired body, and in the process transposing the artist and the model into the voyeuristic roles. The innate understanding of eroticism, in the process of development of a new form of female act, in Zora Petrovic’s paintings, faces us with an array of ideological presumptions and stereotypes that are conceptualised around the perception of body as an object and as a bearer of subjectivism while allowing an opportunity to question own interpretations and boundaries of personal and social discourse on the subjects of body, gender and sensuality.
