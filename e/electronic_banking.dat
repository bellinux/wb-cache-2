5|$|The first {{changes to}} the {{gameplay}} of the Monopoly game itself occurred {{with the publication of}} both the Monopoly Here & Now <b>Electronic</b> <b>Banking</b> Edition by Hasbro UK and Monopoly: The Mega Edition by Winning Moves Games in 2006. The <b>Electronic</b> <b>Banking</b> Edition uses VISA-branded debit cards and a debit card reader for monetary transactions, instead of paper bills. This edition is available in the UK, Germany, France, Australia and Ireland. A version was released in the U.S. in 2007, albeit without the co-branding by Visa. An electronic counter had been featured in the Stock Exchange editions released in Europe in the early 2000s (decade), and is also a feature of the Monopoly City board game released in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Currently printed {{denominations}} are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Notes {{above the}} $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime; {{it was the}} latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of <b>electronic</b> <b>banking,</b> they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details. With {{the exception of the}} $100,000 bill (which was only issued as a Series 1934 Gold Certificate and was never publicly circulated; thus it is illegal to own), these notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Chemical {{initiated}} the first personal computer based banking system when it launched a pilot <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> program called Pronto. [...] Chemical had spent $20 million {{to develop the}} software for Pronto. [...] The system, which worked with the ATARI console, began in New York and served 200 Chemical Bank customers. Pronto was an extension of other <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> services offered by Chemical that [...] included a corporate cash-management system and its growing ATM network {{and was one of}} the largest early forays by a bank into home computer based banking. [...] However, a year after launching Pronto only 21,000 of Chemical's 1.15 million customers were using the system, in large part due to the high monthly subscription costs that Chemical charged customers to use it. [...] By 1985, it was clear that Pronto, which was heavily promoted by Chemical, was growing much slower than anticipated.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Chemical and BankAmerica, another {{pioneer in}} <b>electronic</b> <b>banking,</b> {{entered into a}} joint venture with AT Corporation and Time Inc., known as Covidea, to market banking and {{discount}} stock-brokerage services to computer-equipped households. [...] By combining resources and sharing costs, the four firms hoped {{to reduce the risk of}} large and protracted losses. [...] Eventually Chemical discontinued its efforts in 1989 at a loss of nearly $30 million.|$|E

500|$|Chemical {{was among}} the pioneers of {{electronic}} online banking. [...] On September 2, 1969, Chemical installed the first automated teller machine (ATM) at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York. [...] The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card. [...] A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted [...] "On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again." [...] Chemical's ATM, initially known as a Docuteller, was designed by Donald Wetzel and his company Docutel. [...] Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> transition given {{the high cost of}} the early machines. [...] Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.|$|E
2500|$|Monetary {{values are}} multiplied by 10,000 (e.g., one {{collects}} $2,000,000 instead of $200 for passing GO and pays that much for Income Tax (or 10% of their total, as this edition was launched prior to 2008), each player starts with $15,000,000 instead of $1,500, etc.). Also, the Chance and Community Chest cards are updated, the Railroads {{are replaced by}} Airports (Chicago O'Hare, Los Angeles International, New York City's JFK, and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson), and the Utilities (Electric Company and Water Works) are replaced by Service Providers (Internet Service Provider and Cell Phone Service Provider). The houses and hotels are blue and silver, not green and red as in most editions of Monopoly. [...] The board uses the traditional U.S. layout; the cheapest properties are purple, not brown, and [...] "Interest on Credit Card Debt" [...] replaces [...] "Luxury Tax". Despite the updated Luxury Tax space, and the Income Tax space no longer using the 10% option, this edition uses paper Monopoly money, and not an <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> unit like the Here and Now World Edition. However, a similar edition of Monopoly, the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Banking</b> edition, does feature an <b>electronic</b> <b>banking</b> unit and bank cards, {{as well as a}} different set of tokens.
