5|$|In 1929, E.V. Ramasamy {{announced}} the deletion of his caste title Naicker from his {{name at the}} First Provincial Self-Respect Conference of Chenggalpattu. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> three Dravidian languages: Kannada, Telugu and Tamil.|$|E
5|$|After {{the riot}} in Chicago and the {{subsequent}} trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> more directly to the American public.|$|E
5|$|Waldron married {{twice and}} had seven {{children}} – two {{with his first}} wife and five with the second. Billie Holiday was godmother to his first daughter. Waldron's first wife, Elaine, occasionally sang on his recordings. His second wife was Japanese, and they owned and let several apartments in Japan. Combining birthday celebrations with a tour, Waldron took both families – ex-wife, wife, seven children and two grandchildren – on his three-week tour of Japan that coincided with his seventieth birthday. Waldron's mother died in 1979. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> English, French, German, and Japanese.|$|E
50|$|English: He was so startled, that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak.</b>|$|R
60|$|Frank {{turned his}} head from the offered glass. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak.</b>|$|R
60|$|Judkins mumbled thanks that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak</b> fluently, and {{his eyes}} flashed.|$|R
5|$|After John Sigismund died in 1571, the Diet of Transylvania elected Stephen Báthory voivode (or ruler) in 1571. Stephen {{adopted the}} title of prince of Transylvania after he was elected king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania in 1575. The childless king decided {{to take charge of}} his nephew's {{education}} and ordered him to come to Poland in late 1578. Andrew studied at the Jesuit college in Pułtusk. His fellow-students were mainly young Protestant noblemen from Transylvania or Royal Hungary, but Polish, Lithuanian, German and Italian noblemen and commoners were also chosen to study together with him. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> Latin, Italian, Polish and German {{by the end of his}} studies.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, Krueger {{attended}} {{and graduated}} from the Infantry-Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. This {{was followed by the}} Command and General Staff College in 1907. He then joined the 23rd Infantry at Fort Ontario, New York. After a second tour in the Philippines, he returned to the United States in June 1909, and was assigned to Department of Languages at Fort Leavenworth as an instructor in Spanish, French and German, which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> fluently. He also taught National Guard officers at Camp Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, and Pine Camp, New York. He published translations of several German military texts, most notably William Balck's Tactics. The book attracted the attention of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, Major General Leonard Wood, and was widely read.|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Merrill merely {{nodded his}} head in assent. Still <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak.</b>|$|R
60|$|Charnock {{looked at}} the messenger. His relief was {{overwhelming}} and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak.</b>|$|R
60|$|Daniel was {{determined}} not to let the tears come, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak.</b>|$|R
5|$|In May 1914, {{two months}} before war broke out, Lody was {{approached}} by German naval intelligence officials. He agreed to their proposal to employ him as a peacetime spy in southern France, but {{the outbreak of the}} First World War on 28 July 1914 resulted in a change of plans. In late August, he was sent to the United Kingdom with orders to spy on the Royal Navy. He posed as an American — <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> English fluently, with an American accent — using a genuine U.S. passport purloined from an American citizen in Germany. Over the course of a month, Lody travelled around Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth observing naval movements and coastal defences. By the end of September 1914, he was becoming increasingly worried for his safety as a rising spy panic in Britain led to foreigners coming under suspicion. He travelled to Ireland, where he intended to keep a low profile until he could make his escape from the UK.|$|E
25|$|He was of German descent which assimilated into Polish {{from his}} father line, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> German fluently. He was a married man with a family.|$|E
25|$|Schell was top billed in {{a number}} of Nazi-era themed films, as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> both English and German. Among those were two films for which he {{received}} Oscar nominations: The Man in the Glass Booth (1975; best actor), where he played a character with two identities, and Julia (1977; best supporting actor), where he helps the underground in Nazi Germany.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to <b>speaking</b> Turkish, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>speak</b> in the Arabic and French languages.|$|R
60|$|Norman's lips quivered, and {{his face}} was pale--he seemed as if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>speak</b> {{next day}} as he shook {{hands at the}} station with his friend.|$|R
25|$|Johnson {{knew the}} game intimately; in his speeches declaiming against {{the evils of}} the {{streetcar}} barons, he always pointed out that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> with authority, because {{he was one of}} them himself. In Cleveland, he came into conflict early with Mark Hanna, the powerful local businessman who by 1894 would be the leading power broker of the Republican Party, the man credited with putting fellow Ohioan William McKinley in the White House.|$|E
25|$|Not {{finishing}} his normal education, Bonifacio enriched his natural intelligence with self-education. He read {{books about the}} French Revolution, biographies of the Presidents of the United States, books about contemporary Philippine penal and civil codes, and novels such as Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, Eugène Sue's Le Juif errant and José Rizal's Noli Me Tángere and El Filibusterismo. Aside from Tagalog and Spanish, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> and understand English, which he learned while working at J.M. Fleming and Co.|$|E
25|$|In the luncheon, {{the acting}} mayor of Ballarat J. Harrison criticised Bodyline {{and hoped that}} it would not continue. In response, the England captain Douglas Jardine defended his team and his leading fast bowler Harold Larwood. The England manager Plum Warner said von Moltke could speak seven {{languages}} and be silent in all of them. Warner said that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> one language and preferred to remain silent in it. Warner congratulated the Ballarat Cricket Association {{on the state of the}} ground and on its teams play that morning.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>speak.</b> <b>He</b> {{was afraid}} {{for a moment}} {{that he was going to}} cry.|$|R
60|$|George's {{heart was}} thundering against his ribs. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>speak.</b> <b>He</b> contrived to emit a No.|$|R
50|$|Moncado spoke 11 {{languages}} fluently. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> also <b>speak</b> {{and understand}} 2 Filipino regional languages; Hiligaynon and Tagalog.|$|R
25|$|Harvey and Bryant's {{father were}} now dead, {{and he became}} {{increasingly}} lonely. From 1993 to late 1995, he visited various overseas countries fourteen times and a summary of his domestic airline travel filled three pages. He hated the destinations he travelled to, as he found that people there avoided him {{just as they did}} in Tasmania. However, he enjoyed the flights, as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> to the people sitting adjacent to him who {{had no choice but to}} be polite. Bryant later took great joy in describing some of the more successful conversations he had with fellow passengers.|$|E
25|$|Also in {{this early}} period, {{he made an}} uncredited {{appearance}} in Laurence Olivier's film version of Hamlet (1948), as a spear carrier (his later co-star and close friend Peter Cushing played Osric). A few years later, he appeared in Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N. (1951) as a Spanish captain. He was cast when the director asked him if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> Spanish and fence, which {{he was able to}} do. Lee appeared uncredited in the American epic Quo Vadis (also 1951), which was shot in Rome, playing a chariot driver and was injured when he was thrown from it at one point during the shoot.|$|E
25|$|The future scholar {{also had}} a younger sister, Elena (Eliana). According to Gane, she and Udriște were the most educated of Radu's children, being taught {{to read and write}} in Church Slavonic and Koine Greek, and being {{introduced}} to art and history. Their father also displayed an interest in Renaissance literature; he had confiscated or bought a copy of Thomas à Kempis' The Imitation of Christ, in the Latin, while fighting a war in Moldavia. Helped by a private tutor, Udriște used that same book to learn Latin, which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> to perfection. In addition to Latin, Slavonic and Greek, Udriște was fluent in Russian. Some authors have suggested that Năsturel also attended school in Kiev Voivodeship, but this is not attested by any contemporary source.|$|E
60|$|It was old Simon Grieve, very tired, and so {{much out}} of breath that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>speak.</b>|$|R
60|$|Hodder nodded. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak....</b> The woman {{seemed to}} be living over again that scene, in her imagination.|$|R
60|$|Mordaunt smiled. It {{looked as}} if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak,</b> and while Carrie wiped Jim's face Jake beckoned Dick.|$|R
25|$|In July 1944, Marjoribanks {{was sent}} as Political Representative and Consul to Bucharest, Romania, where he added the Romanian {{language}} {{to the long}} list of languages <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> fluently. At that time, King Michael I of Romania had ousted the pro-Nazi dictator Ion Antonescu and Romania had become one of countries on the Allied side fighting the Axis. The Russians entered the country and imposed their own communist puppet regime under Petru Groza. In 1945, Marjoribanks gave the ousted head of the government, General Nicolae Rădescu sanctuary in the British legation and got him out of the country. Marjoribanks thus acquired knowledge of the way the Soviets work. This helped him in his next posting to the Council of Foreign Ministers, where the new European boundaries were being decided.|$|E
500|$|Feynman {{wrote about}} his {{experiences}} teaching physics undergraduates in Brazil. The students' study habits and the Portuguese language textbooks were so bad that they were not, in his opinion, learning physics at all. At {{the end of the}} year, he was invited [...] to give a lecture on his teaching experiences, and he agreed to do so, provided <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> frankly and didn't pull any punches.|$|E
500|$|Gian Gastone was tutored by Cardinal Henry Noris, {{whose company}} the prince hardly left. The Tuscan prince {{was an avid}} intellectual, being an antiquarian, a {{botanist}} and an amateur scientist. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>speak</b> English, among other languages. However, it was these traits that earned Gian Gastone the disdain {{of his father and}} of his elder brother, Grand Prince Ferdinando; Gian Gastone was thus granted a scant allowance by his father and therefore could not enjoy the [...] "dissipations" [...] of court.|$|E
60|$|Kit understood, {{and nodded}} because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>speak,</b> and Adam, {{giving him a}} quiet smile, went to sleep again.|$|R
