40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, {{mechanical}} heating and cooling is used to regulate <b>indoor</b> <b>climates,</b> with the aim of maintaining a uniform temperature. Achieving this is energy-intensive, since large indoor spaces must be constantly heated or cooled, and the difference to the outdoor temperature is large. This paper starts from the premise that comfort is not delivered to us by the indoor environment, but is instead something that is pursued as a normal part of daily life, through a variety of means. Based on a detailed study of four university students over several months, we explore how Ubicomp technologies can help create a more sustainable reality where people are more active in pursuing and maintaining their thermal comfort, and environments are less tightly controlled and less energy-intensive, and we outline areas for future research in this domain...|$|R
40|$|According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it {{is clear}} that the {{buildings}} sector presents the biggest potential for deep and fast [CO. sup. 2] emission reductions on a cost-effective basis. Interestingly, this assessment was premised exclusively on technical (engineering) measures, but ignored completely the behavioural and lifestyle dimensions of energy consumption in the buildings sector. Behavioural change in buildings, however, can deliver even faster and zero-cost improvements in energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (ghg) emission reductions. With this in mind, designers are beginning to shift their attention to how they can widen the range of opportunities available in a building to provide comfort for the occupants, both in new-build and retrofit contexts. This in turn has re-awakened an interest in the role of natural ventilation in the provision of comfort. This discussion about adaptive comfort raises several questions, including the following: How can we shift occupants' comfort expectations away from the static <b>indoor</b> <b>climates</b> of the past towards the more variable thermal regimes found in naturally ventilated buildings? Are building occupants 'addicted' to static environments, i. e. air-conditioning (AC) ? If so, how tolerant or compliant will they be when the thermally constant conditions provided by AC are replaced by the thermally variable conditions that characterize naturally ventilated spaces? Does the frequency of prior exposure to AC bias building occupants' thermal expectations and, if so, what are the implications of this bias for their acceptance of naturally ventilated <b>indoor</b> <b>climates?</b> Does prior exposure to AC lead building occupants to actually prefer AC over natural ventilation? This article addresses these questions in the context of a large field study of building occupants in a hot and humid climate zone in Brazil (Maceio). The temperature preferences registered on 975 questionnaires in naturally ventilated buildings are statistically analysed in relation to occupants' prior exposure to AC in their workplaces. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractVarious {{techniques}} {{for creating a}} comfortable thermal environment and saving energy have been proposed and employed in residential buildings in many countries, including Japan. For these techniques to be introduced, existing houses should be renovated. Among the techniques available, installation of additional inner windows is effective in creating a comfortable and energy-efficient living environment. In the present research, the effect of additional inner windows on the thermal environment and energy saving was investigated by measuring <b>indoor</b> <b>climates.</b> Windows were renovated in two rooms {{on the fourth floor}} of a four-story reinforced concrete building. Air temperatures, the humidity, the global solar radiation on horizontal and vertical surfaces, radiant temperatures, and the electricity consumption of air-conditioners were measured. A comparison of these values before and after the installation of inner-windows showed that the thermal environment and energy saving had improved. Results obtained from a thermal model agreed well with measured results by changing the value of solar transmittance and heat transmission coefficient of the glazing following renovation. Furthermore, in a questionnaire survey conducted in summer, {{more than half of the}} occupants answered “comfortable” to a question on the overall thermal comfort...|$|R
40|$|Creating {{comfortable}} <b>indoor</b> <b>climates</b> {{is one of}} funda-mental {{functions of}} buildings and buildings use {{a large amount of}} energy to fulfill their function.

This paper reports the results from a longitudinal field investigation, which has been conducted to reveal the comfort temperatures of occupants in open plan offices in summer, autumn and winter in Seoul, Korea and to identify the environ-mental factors that could affect comfort temperatures. The survey results confirm that comfort temperature would vary with seasons. This research provides the evidence to link the indoor and outdoor temperatures along with past thermal experience with comfort temperatures. An adaptive comfort model has been developed by this study for building occupants in Seoul, Korea based on the field investigation. Comparisons between the new adaptive comfort model and existing models have been also made. The establishment of an adaptive thermal comfort model for Seoul would have a significant impact on energy saving and for setting of thermal comfort standard for office buildings in Korea...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} turbulent thermal convection, which {{occurs in a}} wide range of geophysical and engineering situations, such as the atmosphere, the sun, the earth's mantle, <b>indoor</b> <b>climates</b> etc. The first part of the thesis comprises a fundamental study of Rayleigh-BÉnard convection in a domain with aspect-ratio four. An ensemble of independent realizations, obtained by direct simulation, is processed with symmetry-accounted ensemble-averaging in order to distinguish the 'wind' from the fluctuations. Using this decomposition, the role of the wind and the behavior of the boundary layers is studied in detail. The second part is a study of the Leray-alpha model for wall-bounded flows. It is shown that the Leray-alpha model does not guarantee the filtered velocity field to be divergence-free in the presence of no-slip boundary conditions. Then, the Leray-alpha model is validated for three generic wall-bounded flows, i. e. plane channel flow, Rayleigh-BÉnard convection and the side-heated vertical channel. In the last part, the effects of truncation errors of finite difference approximations are included as low-pass filter operations in the Navier-Stokes equations. The resulting modified equations of the "numerical" fluid are studied to quantify the effect of discretizations on the turbulent energy spectrum. Applied Science...|$|R
