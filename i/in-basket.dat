40|$|Results {{supporting}} the predictive validity of assessment centres (e. g., Gaugler, Rosenthal, Thornton 2 ̆ 6 Bentson, 1987) {{are at odds}} with widely reported findings that behavioural consistency among assessment centre exercises is low (e. g., Sackett 2 ̆ 6 Dreher, 1982). Lack of behavioural consistency raises doubts as to how assessment centres work. Drawing from principles of person-situation interactionism, a trait activation hypothesis is proposed to help explain the conflicting findings and direct development of valid simulation exercises. The hypothesis holds that the behavioural expression of a trait requires arousal of that trait by trait-relevant situational cues. Cross-situational consistency in behaviour is thereby conceived to be largely a function of consistency in trait-arousing cues.;Two studies were conducted to test the hypothesis. In Study 1, 123 undergraduates completed personality scales representing aspects of task and person orientations, and an <b>in-basket</b> exercise designed to elicit task- and person-related behaviours. Half the participants completed the <b>in-basket</b> under directions to 2 ̆ 2 get the job done 2 ̆ 2 (i. e., task-emphasis condition) and the other half, under directions to 2 ̆ 2 show concern for workers 2 ̆ 2 (i. e., person-emphasis condition). Based on the trait activation hypothesis, trait-behaviour correlations were expected to be stronger in the more trait-relevant condition (i. e., task-related traits with task-related behaviours in the task-emphasis condition, person-related traits with person-related behaviours in the person-emphasis condition). Moderated regression analysis suggested that linkages were stronger in the person-emphasis condition regardless of the type of trait (i. e., task- vs. person-related). Thus, support for trait activation was limited. Study 2 (N = 124) paralleled Study 1 except that (a) the task- versus person-emphasis manipulation was strengthened, and (b) a broader array of task- and person-related traits was considered. Results were more supportive of trait activation as originally conceived: task-related traits generally showed stronger positive relations with task-related behaviours in the task-emphasis condition. Evidence regarding person-related traits was weaker, possibly due to the <b>in-basket</b> exercise being less relevant to such traits.;Results, although modest, have important implications regarding cross-situational consistency (a) within simulation exercises as a form of reliability, (b) between exercises as evidence regarding the construct validity of assessment centres, (c) between testing and job settings as a basis for predictive validity, and (d) among job settings as a basis for the differential validity of trait measures. Subsidiary findings are that (a) task and person orientations warrant consideration as broad personality traits, (b) reliability in coding <b>in-basket</b> responses is itself replicable, (c) cross-situational consistency within an <b>in-basket</b> exercise is replicable and increases with behavioural aggregation within situations, and (d) <b>in-basket</b> responses are multidimensional...|$|E

40|$|Two {{experimental}} studies {{were conducted to}} examine whether the stress-buffering effects of behavioral control on work task responses varied {{as a function of}} procedural information. Study 1 manipulated low and high levels of task demands, behavioral control, and procedural information for 128 introductory psychology students completing an <b>in-basket</b> activity. ANOVA procedures revealed a significant three-way interaction among these variables in the prediction of subjective task performance and task satisfaction. It was found that procedural information buffered the negative effects of task demands on ratings of performance and satisfaction only under conditions of low behavioral control. This pattern of results suggests that procedural information may have a compensatory effect when the work environment is characterized by a combination of high task demands and low behavioral control. Study 2 (N = 256) utilized simple and complex versions of the <b>in-basket</b> activity to examine {{the extent to which the}} interactive relationship among task demands, behavioral control, and procedural information varied as a function of task complexity. There was further support for the stress-buffering role of procedural information on work task responses under conditions of low behavioral control.

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons why an {{applicant}} may retake a selection test, whether it’s due to reasons outside of their control or perhaps their first test administration was unsuccessful. Research has shown that scores generally increase when applicants retake a test. However, research on situational judgment tests and <b>in-basket</b> simulations have been overshadowed by research on admissions tests, cognitive ability tests, and personality tests. Further, much {{research has focused on}} retesting effects during the initial selection process, but the current research aims to shed light on retesting effects during the promotional process. The literature shows conflicting findings regarding time between tests. While some literature says that more time between tests results in larger score increases, other research says that less time between tests results in larger score increases. The current study aims to clarify this conflicting history of research while closing the gap on types of assessments examined in the retesting literature. Results showed that more time between tests resulted in larger score gains for both the SJT and in the <b>in-basket</b> simulation. This is probably {{due to the nature of}} the test.

This study described, analyzed and assessed the effectiveness of four selection variables (interview, <b>in-basket</b> exercise, group discussion and the Principles of Adult Learning Scale (PALS)) of a pre-employment assessment process. It examined the relationship between teaching performance of part-time faculty in an allied health degree completion program (as measured by the Faculty Assessment Form (FAF)) and the results of the pre-employment assessment process of selection. Fifty faculty were purposefully selected {{to participate in the study}} and 306 students completed 1, 430 Faculty Assessment Forms. Factor analysis performed on PALS and FAF indicated that both were bifactorial and homogeneous among the sample studied. The Cronbach alpha analysis indicated a strong reliability and internal consistency in both PALS and FAF. Four research hypotheses were tested using multiple statistical procedures. Rejection or acceptance of the null hypothesis was measured at the 0. 05 level of significance unless otherwise stated. Null hypothesis one showed no significant difference between the degree of support for the collaborative mode by full-and part-time faculty and Conti's comparative sample. Null hypothesis two indicated the relationship between the degree of faculty support for the collaborative mode and student assessment of full and part-time faculty was significantly positive. Faculty who practiced adult learning principles in the collaborative mode displayed more functionality of role behaviors than those who used a non-collaborative mode. Null hypothesis three, the <b>in-basket</b> exercise and the PALS, showed a strong positive correlation with FAF. The interview and group discussion showed a low correlation between them and the FAF. Null hypothesis four tested the relationship between four selection variables and eight faculty assessment variables. Two selection variables (the <b>in-basket</b> exercise and the PALS) and eight of the faculty assessment variables had strong positive associations. Concluding evidence supported the use of four prediction variables in the pre-employment assessment.

Conclusions were based upon the findings of the study, on the literature and research reviewed as a part of the study, and on the experiences of the writer in designing and testing the simulation materials developed as a part of the study. 1. The simulated <b>in-basket</b> problems have potential value for orienting pre-service secondary school administrators to current problems of practicing secondary school administrators in the State of Indiana. 2. The simulation materials have limited potential value for creating an understanding of the need for additional professional preparation prior to assuming the secondary school principalship. 3. Utilization of the background materials as reference sources for the <b>in-basket</b> problems has potential value for orienting students to the contents of legal, procedural, and regulatory reference materials commonly used by practicing secondary school administrators in Indiana. 4. Both pre-service and in-service educational administrators enthusiastically support the use of stimulation materials as an instructional device. Students using simulation materials readily become involved in simulation activities and do perceive such activities as being of considerable instructional value. 5. Educational administration students do perceive simulated administrative problems as representing authentic problems of practicing school administrators. 6. Individual and group problem-solving simulation activities do induce educational administration students to develop alternative strategies for problem solutions. 7. Simulation materials and utilization procedures representing authentic educational administration problems, which will be perceived as moderately realistic administrative experiences by students using such materials, can be inexpensively developed and tested. Recommendations for further study were based upon the findings of the study, upon the literature and research reviewed as a part of the study, and upon the experiences of the writer in designing and testing the simulation materials. 1.

These teams offer great potential for high performance, but the cultural diversity presents barriers to productive interaction, and multicultural teams tend to perform worse than their homogenous counterparts. The goals of this research were to {{develop an understanding of}} effective interaction and performance in multicultural groups, and to investigate whether groups could be trained to improve their ability to interact productively.;A model of multicultural group performance was developed, which emphasizes the importance of effective communication and explicit agreement on norms for interaction, both requiring understanding of group members 2 ̆ 7 cultural orientations. Measures were developed and pretested for cultural orientations (based on Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck, 1961), communication preconditions (based on Blakar, 1985), synergistic integration processes, and group outcomes (based on Hackman, 1987). Propositions derived from the model were tested in a quasi-experiment, in which 73 groups of four to six people worked together to complete an <b>in-basket</b> simulation based on a real-life complex international management situation. Measures of cultural orientations and individual preconditions were collected prior to the group 2 ̆ 7 s interaction, and group-level variables were measured after the interaction. Group 2 ̆ 7 s <b>in-basket</b> responses were compared with an expert solution to obtain a measure of output quality. Half of the groups participated in a twelve-hour training intervention prior to completing the task, designed to increase their ability to integrate culturally diverse perspectives.;Regression and multivariate analysis of variance were used to test the hypotheses. Overall support was found for the conceptual model, and training had a positive effect on process and outcome variables. It was concluded that the model developed provides a good understanding of integration processes in multicultural groups and, together with previous related research, provides a good understanding of performance in these teams. The training results offer encouragement to managers that barriers to integration in multicultural teams can be overcome...|$|E
