500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For how <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend {{is included in the}} memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E

500|$|The Nexus7 {{comes with}} many {{applications}} by default, including Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Calendar, Google+, Google Wallet, and Currents. According to Barra, Google emphasized {{the integration of}} Google Play across Android 4.1 on the device: [...] "Google Play is Nexus7 and Nexus7 is Google Play. So which one <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are selling?...Well, it's really both." [...] According to Andy Rubin, the emphasis of Google Play arose after Google learned that customers buy into an application [...] "ecosystem" [...] when purchasing tablets, unlike phones where hardware is the primary determining factor. The Nexus7 is intended {{to take advantage of}} the different media formats available through the application store, including e-books, movies, music, games, magazines, and television programs. [...] Several updates to Android were released in subsequent months, including Android 4.2 in November 2012, Android 4.3 in July 2013, and Android 4.4 ("KitKat") in November 2013. Android 5.0 ("Lollipop") was released for the Nexus7 WiFi edition in November 2014, although users reported that the update rendered the tablet very slow. Some of the issues with Android 5.0 have reportedly been addressed in an Android 5.0.2 update. In March 2015, the Nexus 7 was upgraded to Android 5.1, which fixes the lagging issues. But some users reported that the update did not fix performance problems.|$|E
500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, {{and was one of the}} reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E
2500|$|The prologue {{opens with}} {{an account of}} Diamond's {{conversation}} with Yali, a New Guinean politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the Europeans who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term [...] "cargo" [...] for inventions and manufactured goods, [...] "Why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> white people developed so much cargo {{and brought it to}} New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?"

2500|$|He faced media {{scrutiny}} in May 2001, when {{he refused}} to help a veteran in his riding whom he suspected of having voted for a rival candidate in the previous election.

[...] The letter was released to the media, and Wappel's remarks were widely criticized by journalists and MPs from all parties. [...] Chrétien reprimanded Wappel, and required him to issue an apology. [...] Wappel later described the letter as a [...] "stupid mistake", and called for voters to forgive him.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{you will}} say, [...] "I see {{something}} else, how <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> assert that I receive the Body of Christ?" ... Let us prove {{that this is}} not what nature made, but what the blessing consecrated, and the power of blessing is greater than that of nature, because by blessing nature itself is changed. ... For that sacrament which you receive is made what it is by the word of Christ. But if the word of Elijah had such power as to bring down fire from heaven, shall not the word of Christ have power to change the nature of the elements? ... Why do you seek the order of nature in the Body of Christ, seeing that the Lord Jesus Himself was born of a Virgin, not according to nature? It is the true Flesh of Christ which was crucified and buried, this is then truly the Sacrament of His Body. The Lord Jesus Himself proclaims: [...] "This Is My Body." [...] Before the blessing of the heavenly words another nature is spoken of, after the consecration the Body is signified. He Himself speaks of His Blood. Before the consecration it has another name, after it is called Blood. And you say, Amen, that is, It is true. Let the heart within confess what the mouth utters, let the soul feel what the voice speaks." ...|$|E

2500|$|Palm Beach {{was to be}} the {{terminus}} of the Flagler railroad, {{but during}} 1894 and 1895, severe freezes hit all of Central Florida, whereas the Miami area remained unaffected, causing Flagler to rethink his original decision not to move the railroad south of Palm Beach. The fable that Julia Tuttle, one of two main landowners in the Miami area along with the Brickell family, sent orange blossoms to Flagler to prove to him that Miami, unlike the rest of the state, was unaffected by the frost is untrue. The fact is, that Mrs. Tuttle wired Mr. Flagler to advise him that [...] "the region around the shores of Biscayne Bay is untouched by the freezes." [...] Mr. Flagler sent his two now famous in Florida history lieutenants, James E. Ingraham and Joseph R. Parrott, to investigate and they brought boxes of truck (produce) and citrus back to Mr. Flagler, who then wired Mrs. Tuttle, asking, [...] "Madam, what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> propose?" [...] To convince Flagler to continue the railroad to Miami, both Julia Tuttle and William Brickell offered half of their holdings north and south of the Miami River to Mr. Flagler. [...] Mrs. Tuttle added [...] for shops and yards if Mr. Flagler would extend his railroad to the shores of Biscayne Bay and build one of his great hotels. [...] An agreement was made and contracts were signed. On September 7, 1895, the name of Flagler's system was changed from the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway Company to the Florida East Coast Railway Company and incorporated. On April 15, 1896, track reached Biscayne Bay, the site of present-day downtown Miami. At the time, it was a small settlement of less than 50 inhabitants. When the town incorporated, on July 28, 1896, its citizens wanted to honor the man responsible for the city's development by naming it Flagler. He declined the honor, persuading them to retain its old Indian name, Miami. The area was actually previously known as Fort Dallas after the fort built there in 1836 during the Second Seminole War. To further develop the area surrounding the Miami railroad station, Flagler dredged a channel, built streets and The Royal Palm Hotel, instituted the first water and power systems, and financed the town's first newspaper, the Metropolis. Flagler was a great visionary and he can be credited {{for the development of the}} entire east coast of Florida. Yet he lacked vision on at least one issue: he felt that Miami would never be more than a fishing village.|$|E
