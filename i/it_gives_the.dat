5|$|Price {{elasticity}} of demand (PED or Ed) {{is a measure}} used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded of a good or service {{to a change in}} its price, ceteris paribus. More precisely, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price (ceteris paribus).|$|E
5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|Ports use Makefile to {{automatically}} fetch the desired application's source code, either {{from a local}} or remote repository, unpack it on the system, apply patches to it and compile it. Depending {{on the size of}} the source code, compiling can take a long time, but <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> user more control over the process and its result. Most ports also have package counterparts (i.e. pre-compiled binaries), giving the user a choice. Although this method is faster, the user has fewer customisation options.|$|E

5|$|The wave-like {{nature of}} the {{electron}} allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as {{would be the case}} for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the absolute value of this function is squared, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.|$|E
5|$|While {{incorporating}} action role-playing {{elements from}} the prior {{games in the}} series, such as real-time battles, Legend of Mana has its own distinct style of gameplay. Most notably, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> player the ability to shape the world's structure through the Land Make system, generating regions and quests in a non-linear gameplay system rather than a strong main plotline. Legend of Mana was directed by series creator Koichi Ishii, designed by Akihiko Matsui, and produced by veteran Square director and producer Akitoshi Kawazu.|$|E
5|$|In Polistes exclamans, equal {{sex ratio}} is {{obtained}} when only 46.3% of investment {{is devoted to}} females as female wasps are 1.16 times larger than male wasps. In a study done by Strassmann, {{it was found that}} sexual investment is female biased, especially during years of high predation and when nests are generally less successful. It has been seen that in Polistes exclamans, females are produced before males. This female investment bias may result from the ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive (this is more adaptive for the nest as <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success) or because females provide the colony with greater nest defense. Furthermore, even when the original queen is no longer present, the sexual investment is still biased towards females, which is not expected given the genetic implications of a new queen.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> reader.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
