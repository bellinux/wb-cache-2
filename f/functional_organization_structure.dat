40|$|Federal Manufacturing & Technologies/New Mexico (FM&T/NM) of AlliedSignal is an {{organization}} of approximately 300 associates providing operations support, engineering, and other technical services for DOE, New Mexico`s National Laboratories, etc. Work performed is primarily project-oriented and ranges from executing a major long-term contract for retrofitting and maintaining a large fleet of escort vehicles to creating a single, small, prototype electronic device for measuring radiation in a unique environment. FM&T/NM is functionally organized and operates in a classic matrix format with functional departments providing personnel with technical expertise, necessary physical resources, and administrative support to several project-based groups. Like most matrix-based organizations that provide support to diverse customers, FM&T/NM has encountered problems that occur {{when a group of}} project managers is expected to work together in using and scheduling a shared set of limited resources {{for the good of the}} organization as a whole. The framework for managing projects that we present focuses on developing, understanding, and managing the relationships between the <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> <b>structure,</b> the system of work processes, and the management of projects. FM&T/NM retains its functional structure which primarily assigns personnel to work processes. The evolving role of the process leader focuses primarily on designing, managing, and improving the process, and the interactions among the subprocesses. The project manager is responsible for (1) translating customer requirements into product specifications, (2) determining the sequence of activities needed to meet project goals, (3) scheduling the required work processes, (4) monitoring project progress, (5) providing liaison between the customer and process leaders, and (6) having the desired product and/or service delivered to a satisfied customer in a timely manner...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, my main {{objective}} is the presentation {{and evaluation of}} several versions of a thought experiment that are offered for supporting a functionalist thesis concerning the generation of conscious phenomenal experiences. These versions depict replacement scenarios that describe an imaginary process for creating functional duplicates of the brains of conscious beings. It is assumed that the brain of a conscious person implements a determinate <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> or <b>structure,</b> which can be initially understood as the abstract pattern of interaction between the {{different parts of the}} brain. The replacement process begins by adopting a certain level of <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> by identifying a number of basic components in the brain that perform a certain function inside it. These basic components are then replaced by entities that may not share the same physiochemical composition of the original elements but that perform the same function inside the brain. When the replacement process is finished, the resulting system is a functional isomorph of the original system at the level initially determined. In this thesis, I will concentrate on two versions of the replacement thought experiment: the neural version and the interchange version. My first main claim is that the neural version of the replacement thought experiment, as presented in this thesis, gives adequate support to the thesis that the generation of conscious phenomenal experiences naturally supervenes on the property of instantiating the <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> of the brain at a neural level. My second main claim is that a different version of the replacement thought experiment, which I call the interchange version, ultimately fails in supporting the thesis that the generation of conscious phenomenal experiences logically supervenes on the property of instantiating the <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> of the brain...|$|R

40|$|How does {{cellular}} metabolism respond to environmental changes and genetic perturbations? And can we use perturbation studies {{to uncover the}} functions and organization of metabolic networks at a cellular level? We address these questions by performing large-scale computer experiments of single and double enzyme gene deletions, based on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) [1]. Through the comparison of model predictions and experimental data for single gene deletions in E. coli, {{we found that the}} perturbed networks can deviate significantly from the optimal growth capacity approached by the wild type. In fact, mutants may be better described by assuming a minimal redistribution of fluxes with respect to the unperturbed cell [2]. The study of the combined effect (epistasis) of double gene deletions allowed us to analyze the <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> and modular <b>structure</b> of biochemical networks. In a system-level analysis of the yeast S. cerevisiae we identified pairs of genes whose combined deletion affects growth significantly more (synergistic), or significantly less (buffering) than what expected based on the single deletions. We found that the ensuing network of epistatic interactions can be organized hierarchically into function-enriched modules that interact "monochromatically, " i. e. with purely synergistic or purely buffering links [3]. This property extends epistasis from single genes to functional units, and provides a novel definition of biological modularity, which emphasizes interactions between, rather than within, functional modules.

40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss the {{experimental}} advantages that the vibrissal motor system offers for analysis of motor control and the specializations of this system related to the unique characteristics of whisker movements. Whisker movements are often rhythmic, fast, and bilateral. Movements of individual whiskers have simple characteristics, whereas, movements of the entire vibrissae array are complex and sophisticated. In the last few years, powerful methods for high precision tracking of whisker movements have become available. The whisker musculature is arranged to permit forward movements of individual whiskers and consists−depending on the species−mainly or exclusively of fast contracting, fast fatigable muscle fibers. Whisker motor neurons {{are located in the}} lateral facial nucleus and their cellular properties might contribute to the rhythmicity of whisking. Numerous structures provide input to the lateral facial nucleus, the most mysterious and important one being the putative central pattern generator (CPG). Although recent studies identified candidate structures for the CPG, the precise identity and the <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> of this <b>structure</b> remains uncertain. The vibrissa motor cortex (VMC) is the largest motor representation in the rodent brain, and recent work has clarified its localization, subdivisions, cytoarchitectonics, and connectivity. Single−cell stimulation experiments in VMC allow determining the cellular basis of cortical motor control with unprecedented precision.

40|$|The {{research}} {{explores the}} relationship between uncertainty, flexibility and Life Cycle Design {{in the design of}} complex systems, in general, and in the particular case of the design of building systems. In the architectural-engineering works, conceived as activities aimed at generating new systems, the comparison with the uncertainty is inevitable. There is a wide range of types of uncertainty; a possible simplification is to consider two types of causes of uncertainty, the presence of the internal or external uncertainties to the system. That is the variability of demand (unknowns about the social and economic context) or the variability of technological market (unknowns about the performance of the system), in other words the functional obsolescence and the technological obsolescence. If flexibility is the ability of a system to be easily modified and to respond to changes in the environment in a timely and convenient, then the flexibility can be considered the antidote to obsolescence, or the characteristic of the system that guarantees slippage over time. It’s that property that makes the system resilient able to absorb the shock and/or disturbance without undergoing major alterations in its <b>functional</b> <b>organization,</b> in its <b>structure</b> and in its identity characteristics. In the paper, the flexibility is therefore seen as a fundamental property for designing a generally complex system, and particularly in architectural design, through the identification of design criteria for the implementation of this requirement, that influence on architecture (form more technology) of the system...|$|R

Due to lack of coordination amongst different professionals in design stage, information inconsistency (e. g. clash) amongst different disciplines (e. g. architecture, structure engineering) results in delay and cost overrun in construction stage. How to design project <b>organization</b> <b>structure</b> in design team in order to improve design coordination performance is concerned. Structural contingency theory argues that there is no best <b>organization</b> <b>structure.</b> The effect of <b>organization</b> <b>structure</b> on performance depends on task uncertainty. However, <b>organization</b> <b>structure</b> does not react sensitively to contingency change. But project <b>organization</b> <b>structure,</b> as a temporary <b>organization</b> <b>structure</b> is much easier to be adjusted. Coordination is an information processing activity to deal with task uncertainty. It is postulated that project <b>organization</b> <b>structure</b> affect project performance by facilitating or prohibiting information processing to reduce task uncertainty. Incorporating structure-conduct-performance perspective into traditional structural contingency theory, an advanced structural contingency framework is developed to investigate the relationship between project <b>organization</b> <b>structure</b> and project performance. It is postulated that, when task uncertainty changes its level, performance restores by organization structure-conduct adapting to fit new information processing requirement.

We show here that an absence of early retinal waves in mice lacking the β 2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is associated with both gain and loss of <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Anatomical studies show normal gross retinotopy in the β 2 −/− dLGN but suggest reduced topographic precision in the retinogeniculate projection. Physiological recordings reveal normal topography in the dorsoventral visual axis but a lack of fine-scale mapping in the nasotemporal visual plane. In contrast, unlike wild-type mice, on- and off-center cells in the β 2 −/− dLGN are spatially segregated. The presence of the β 2 subunit of the nAChR in the CNS is therefore important for normal <b>functional</b> <b>organization</b> in the retinogeniculate projection...|$|R
