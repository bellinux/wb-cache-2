5|$|Burston was {{a member}} of the Adelaide Club, South Australian Cricket Association and the Melbourne Club.

A tall man at , he was awarded the Royal <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> of Australasia's Bronze Medal for saving the life of a youth caught in the rip while surfing at Victor Harbor, South Australia in 1927. He had three children: Samuel Gerald Wood (Sam) Burston became a grazier; Robin Archibald (Bob) Burston became a physician like his father; and Helen Elizabeth (Betty), who married Chris Sangster, an Adelaide physician on 12 January 1939. Both sons and son in law would serve in the Army during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his trap-shooting career, Bain {{developed}} an appreciation for nature. He bought an ownership share of the Portage Country Club, on the Delta Marsh near the south shore of Lake Manitoba, and later donated the land to Ducks Unlimited. Bain built the Mallard Lodge as a personal retreat on land adjacent to the club. He strictly enforced his privacy, even building a road to his lodge that he allowed no one else to use; members of the Portage Country Club were required to take a different route. Bain intended to donate his lodge to the government of Manitoba for preservation, though he died before he could do so. The lodge passed into the control of the government regardless, and was donated to the University of Manitoba as a research facility in 1966 that remains active today. Bain was {{also a member of the}} Manitoba Game and Fish Association and the Winnipeg <b>Humane</b> <b>Society.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electricians had power {{restored}} to the Freeport area by {{the day after the}} storm, and had power {{restored to}} most of the western portion of the island within three weeks after the hurricane. Work crews quickly removed road debris and tree limbs, and by the day after the passage of Wilma most roads were cleared. The passage of the hurricane left 1,000–4,000people and hundreds of animals homeless. In response, the Grand Bahama <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> distributed about 340kg (750lb) of dog food and treated or euthanized injured animals, depending on their condition. The earlier effects of Wilma on Mexico left many tourist areas in that country closed, leading to a 10% increase in tourism in the Bahamas in December 2005. By about three weeks after the hurricane, the airport on Grand Bahama Island was reopened, and all but one resort were also reopened; the remaining resort was reopened about two months after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E

5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond <b>Humane</b> <b>Society,</b> an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} had traditionally {{paid little attention}} to the poor, but {{in the wake of the}} Industrial Revolution attitudes towards the accomplishments of the lower classes were changing. The growth of the railways, the mechanisation of agriculture and the need for labour in the new inner-city factories had broken the traditional feudal economy and caused the rapid growth of cities, while increasing literacy rates led to a greater interest in the media and current affairs among ordinary workers. In 1856 the first military honour for bravery open to all ranks, the Victoria Cross, had been instituted, while in 1866 the Albert Medal, the first official honour open to civilians of all classes, was introduced. Additionally, a number of private and charitable organisations dedicated to lifesaving, most prominently the Royal <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> (1776) and Royal National Lifeboat Institution (1824), were increasing in activity and prominence, and gave awards and medals as a means of publicising their activities and lifesaving advice.|$|E

The following year, Alderson served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, fighting at the battles of Kassassin and Tel-el-Kebir. Two years later, Alderson {{was attached to the}} Mounted Camel Regiment during the failed expedition to relieve Khartoum and rescue General Gordon. During this campaign, Alderson was presented with the Bronze Medal of the Royal <b>Humane</b> <b>Society</b> after diving into the Nile to rescue a drowning soldier. For his service in these campaigns, Alderson was promoted to Captain and was stationed at Aldershot with the European Mounted Infantry Depot. The same year he married the daughter of the vicar of Syresham, Northamptonshire, a Miss Alice Mary Sergeant.|$|E
