2500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} written and performed by Jim Weatherly {{under the title}} [...] "Midnight Plane to Houston", which he recorded on Jimmy Bowen's Amos Records. [...] "It {{was based on a}} conversation I had with somebody... about taking a midnight plane to Houston," [...] Weatherly recalls. [...] "I wrote {{it as a kind of}} a country song. Then we sent the song to a guy named Sonny Limbo in Atlanta and he wanted to cut it with Cissy Houston... <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> minded if he changed the title to [...] "Midnight Train to Georgia". And I said, 'I don't mind. Just don't change the rest of the song.'" [...] Weatherly, in an interview with Gary James, stated that the phone conversation was with Farrah Fawcett and he used Fawcett and his friend Lee Majors, whom she had just started dating, [...] "as kind of like characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parks moved, but {{toward the}} window seat; she did not get up {{to move to the}} redesignated colored section. Parks later said about being asked to move {{to the rear of the}} bus, [...] "I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back." [...] Blake said, [...] "Why don't you stand up?" [...] Parks responded, [...] "I don't think I should have to stand up." [...] Blake called the police to arrest Parks. When recalling the {{incident}} for Eyes on the Prize, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, [...] "When he saw me still sitting, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was going to stand up, and I said, 'No, I'm not.' And he said, 'Well, if you don't stand up, I'm going to have to call the police and have you arrested.' I said, 'You may do that.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{produced}} the Black Crowes, and Jimmy joined {{them for a}} run of live dates in 1999. I saw the show in New York, and then I went to California and recorded the shows, took the tapes away, and fixed them up a little and mixed them. I did Live at the Greek without any input from anyone, as it wasn't originally {{going to be an}} official release. But I think everyone was impressed with it; certainly Jimmy said he was. Then, when Jimmy decided to do a new [...] DVD, he started looking for someone familiar with the modern applications necessary for surround sound mixing. If you listen to the Royal Albert Hall [...] opening in 5.1, you can see Jimmy had this audio concept really early on of giving people a sense of the band going onstage and the audience swells around you. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements needed for the DVD project audio, and afterward, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would be interested in ‘helping’ him.|$|E

2500|$|While Lynch {{was working}} on the first few episodes of Twin Peaks, his friend Monty Montgomery [...] "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would maybe be {{executive}} producer or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." [...] The book was Barry Gifford's novel Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula, which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was [...] "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [...] With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into a film called Wild at Heart, a crime and road movie starring Nicolas Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula. Describing his plot as a [...] "strange blend" [...] of [...] "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch altered much from the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to the classic film The Wizard of Oz. Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.|$|E

When he sat down again he took me on his knee, and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was fond of him, and I said, 'Yes, I am,' and he kissed me again, and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had come to stay with him and keep him company. I forgot what you wanted me to say," [...] Kitty acknowledged, {{addressing}} Mrs. Presty; [...] "so I made it up out of my own head." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{reader will}} understand, therefore, that a question, or query, {{from such a}} Friend {{was not to be}} put lightly aside. When <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{believed}} in Spiritualism I answered with perfect courtesy: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>asked,</b> by-and-by, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{would not}} rather run to my companions than sit there? I said, no; I felt {{content to be}} where <b>he</b> was. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> whether, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were his sister, I should always be content to stay with a brother such as he. I said, I {{believed}} I should; and I felt it. Again, he inquired whether, {{if he were to}} leave Villette, and go far away, I should be sorry; and I dropped Corneille, and made no reply.|$|R

6000|$|... "Having {{got as far}} as this, Midwinter put the {{question}} which I felt must come sooner or later. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> objected to our engagement being mentioned, in the strictest secrecy, to his friend.|$|E
6000|$|My brother {{never again}} {{alluded to the}} {{narrative}} which he had confided to me, until the later time when I was sitting by his deathbed. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> still remembered the story of Jeromette. [...] "Tell it to others," [...] he said, [...] "as I have told it to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|In trading remarks {{concerning}} our ages I {{confessed to}} forty-two and Hay to forty. Then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had begun to}} write my autobiography, and I said I hadn't. He said that I ought to begin at once, and that I had already lost two years. Then he said in substance this: ...|$|E
60|$|His sensitiveness--that peculiar, apprehensive, detective {{faculty of}} his--felt {{in a moment}} the unspoken complaint--the scarce-thought reproach. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> quietly <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was offended. I shook my head as {{implying}} a negative.|$|R

60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen}} its Chief, a certain Umslopogaas or Bulalio. I answered, Yes, that I {{had met him}} there {{for the first time}} and thought him a very {{remarkable}} man.|$|R
60|$|My heart {{gave one}} great leap in me, and broke into vehement throbbings, {{which made it}} {{impossible}} for me to say a word more. I reined up my horse, and fixed my eyes on Michael. He was startled; <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> felt faint. I could only sign to him that I was waiting to hear more.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked with}} me. My {{way back to}} the Vicarage was his {{way back to the}} inn. He had come to our parts, he told me, for the quiet and {{retirement}} as much as for the fishing. He had noticed me once or twice from the window of his room at the inn. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were not the vicar's daughter.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had said}} thus he comes upstairs, and I was by that time {{come out of my}} room; so he tells me the {{minister}} was below, and that he had talked with him, and that upon showing him the license, he was free to marry us with all his heart, 'but he asks to see you'; so <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would let him come up.|$|E
6000|$|At night, when I {{had gone}} to bed, Joe came into my room, {{as he had done}} all through my recovery. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> felt sure that I was {{as well as in the}} morning? ...|$|R
60|$|CHR. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had a family? And I told him. But, said I, I am so loaden {{with the}} burden {{that is on}} my back, that I cannot take {{pleasure}} in them as formerly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes,' said Merry. 'But I {{told the}} wretch--my dear Mr Chuzzlewit, I told him when <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> me--that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever did marry him, it {{should only be}} that I might hate and tease him all my life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I met Bulstrode at Balliol last night, and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew {{of any one}} (a perfect gentleman he must be, {{that matters}} more than scholarship) who would take a tutorship in a Hungarian count's family. Two little boys, who live like princes, tutor the same, salary {{anything}} you like to ask. It is somewhere in the mountains, a feudal castle, with capital sport." ...|$|E
60|$|He pointed peremptorily {{to me to}} go back to {{my former}} place, but did not return to his own chair. As I obeyed, I saw him unlock the door of the {{bookcase}} against which he had been leaning, and place his hand on one of the books inside. Without withdrawing it from its place, without turning or looking towards me, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had anything more to say to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Basta! basta!" [...] He {{turned to}} me apologetically. [...] "We have agreed to speak Italian; in that way I keep up the language; {{astonishing}} the {{number of things that}} dog will understand!" [...] I was about to take my leave, when <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would walk a little way with him--"If you are free, that is." [...] We went up the street with Freda {{on the far side of}} her master.|$|E
6000|$|I {{told him}} I would do so, {{with all the}} {{interest}} and curiosity that his preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers [...] "at it?" ...|$|R
60|$|In reply, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{would take}} it {{for a piece of}} sincerity, if, after a trial, he should tell me his mind, and would not be displeased if he {{declined}} speaking his thoughts till he had talked with them.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Campbell, the {{minister}} of Essendean, {{was waiting for me}} by the garden gate, good man! <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had breakfasted; and hearing that I lacked for nothing, he took my hand in both of his and clapped it kindly under his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said Eugene, [...] "but {{the man in}} the gold-laced hat {{has been}} {{speaking}} with him. Palmer says it is Mrs. Dove's husband, and he is going to take Lively Tom and Brown Bet and the two other colts to London. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should like to ride a-cockhorse there with him. 'Dearly,' I said, and then he laughed and said it was not my turn, but he should take Miss Aurelia instead." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{first words}} {{showed that he}} was acting under orders. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had found the young lady; and he next {{informed}} me that his master had revived some hours since, and [...] "bore no malice." [...] This outrageous assertion suddenly fired me with suspicion. I believed that the Cur had been acting a part when he threatened me with his pistol, {{and that he was}} answerable for the disappearance of Cristel. My first impulse now was to get the help of a lawyer.|$|E
6000|$|Feb. 28.--On Sunday, Sir George Lewis {{called on}} me, and said my [...] office {{had been offered}} him. This was after being refused by [...] Cardwell and Baring. He asked my advice as to {{accepting}} it. This I [...] told him I could not give. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would assist him with [...] information in case of his accepting. I answered that he might [...] command me precisely as if instead of resigning I had only removed [...] to another department. I then went {{over some of the}} matters needful [...] to be made known. On Tuesday he came again, acquainted me with his [...] acceptance, and told me he had been mainly influenced by my [...] promise.[344] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he {{answered}} with {{no loss of}} promptness, [...] "is what even Chad himself asked me last night. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't mind the loss--well, the loss of an opulent future. Which moreover," [...] he hastened to add, [...] "was a perfectly natural question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you, Sylvanus? I'm very poorly." [...] He came closer, {{and lowered}} his voice: [...] "Why did you get me to make that settlement? I must have been mad. I've had a man called Ventnor--I didn't like his manner. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew a Mrs. Larne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were {{standing}} with him, {{in front of}} the little house, when I save you yesterday. His name was Redbrook.
