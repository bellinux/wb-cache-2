25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), the <b>electronic</b> <b>switching</b> of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined}} with the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} optical network designs using relatively few switch nodes at which wavelength conversion and electronic regeneration is possible. A simple heuristic for placing the fewest such nodes to reach a given blocking probability {{is based on the}} ranked frequency of shortest-path routes transiting each node. This strategy is found to be efficient in designing a “translucent ” optical network with sparse <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> placement that performs very close in blocking to that of an “opaque ” optical network. In addition, we apply a new 2 -D Dijkstra’s algorithm for routing and wavelength assignment in the resultant translucent optical network. Simulation results indicate that a translucent optical network with sparse <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> placement based on the heuristic has much lower blocking than a fully transparent optical network when the constraint of the maximum transparent distance before regeneration is also considered. Moreover by placing the switches according to the heuristic, lightpath blocking can approach that of a fully opaque network with significantly fewer <b>electronic</b> <b>switches</b> in total. In our results, lightpath blocking as low as the fully opaque network case was obtained with <b>electronic</b> <b>switches</b> selectively placed at approximately 1 node in 3 on average. The heuristic also performs well against random searching for an effective subset of <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> nodes and performs better than a prior optima...|$|R
