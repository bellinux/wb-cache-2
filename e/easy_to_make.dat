5|$|In 62 BC, Pompey {{returned}} victorious from Asia. The Senate, elated by its successes against Catiline, {{refused to}} ratify the arrangements that Pompey had made. Pompey, in effect, became powerless. Thus, when Julius Caesar returned from a governorship in Spain in 61 BC, he found it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, {{now known as the}} First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements would be ratified. Caesar would be elected consul in 59 BC, and would then serve as governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was promised a future consulship.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistake was}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> Le Culot was located nearby. Sint-Truiden housed the 48th Fighter Group and 404th Fighter Group. The 492nd Fighter Squadron was readying {{to take off}} at 09:20. JG 4 hit the {{airfield}} at 09:15. Several P-47s taxiing out were abandoned by pilots and strafed to destruction. The small-scale attack by JG had achieved considerable damage. Total American losses were 10 destroyed and 31 damaged. The Germans lost eight fighters, including seven Bf 109s, and three damaged. No damage was done at Le Culot airfield.|$|E

McCartney also had to push his June US dates to October, as part of his doctor's order to take it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a full recovery. However, he resumed the tour with a high-energy three hour appearance in Albany, New York, on 5 July 2014. On 14 August 2014, McCartney performed the final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California before its demolition. It was the same venue that the Beatles played their final concert in 1966.|$|E

25|$|This technique, {{known as}} radio {{direction}} finding (RDF), is useful but only moderately accurate.

Opponents of peer review counter that the sparcity of successful challenges is indicative of how widespread the problem is and how difficult these actions are to win.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, a labiaplasty surgeon {{can earn}} up to $250,000 a month. Simone Weil Davis, {{professor}} of American studies, told Shameless magazine in 2005 that surgeons are perpetuating {{the idea that}} there is a right way for women's genitalia to look; because most women see only their own vaginas or pornographic images, it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them doubt themselves. The feminist organization, the New View Campaign, has spoken out against the existence of unregulated cosmetic surgery clinics as business enterprises, which it says trade on women's sexuality by appealing to their low self-esteem, thereby creating health risks.|$|E
25|$|Umlikaaq (or Umlikaq ~ Umlikqaq) or Ungllekaq (ungllik'ar in Nunivak Cup'ig) {{is fresh}} boiled fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except for the {{entrails}} are used to prepare umlikqaq. Fresh fish that have been dead {{for less than a}} day make the best umlikqaq because the meat is still firm. If a freshwater fish is caught with a hook, it is best to kill the fish by hitting its head soon after capture so the meat will stay firm for cooking. The main ingredients of umlikqaq are cut-up fish, water, and salt which are boiled for about 29 minutes. This is a preferred food for elders because it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> and is not strongly seasoned. First heads are good prepared as umlikqaq. Also, Ungelkaaq is fish steak cut transversely.|$|E

25|$|Many {{aboriginal}} Australian languages have {{a series}} of three or four lateral approximants, as do various dialects of Irish. Rarer lateral consonants include the retroflex laterals that can be found in many languages of India and in some Swedish dialects, and the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative , found in many Native North American languages, Welsh and Zulu. In Adyghe and some Athabaskan languages like Hän, both voiceless and voiced alveolar lateral fricatives occur, but there is no approximant. Many of these languages also have lateral affricates. Some languages have palatal or velar voiceless lateral fricatives or affricates, such as Dahalo and Zulu, but the IPA has no symbols for such sounds. However, appropriate symbols are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> by adding a lateral-fricative belt to the symbol for the corresponding lateral approximant (see below). Also, a devoicing diacritic may be added to the approximant.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Poole, a {{nineteenth century}} writer, wrote that all 2024 {{passengers}} boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days {{to cross the}} Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits {{were one of the}} many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they traveled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.|$|E
