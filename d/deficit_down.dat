Buffalo responded with a drive to the Dolphins 27, but this time their defense was up to the task and Kelly was intercepted by safety Jarvis Williams on the 2. However, Miami could not pick up a first down pinned deep in their own territory.

Faced with fourth down on the Vikings 17-yard line, Atlanta managed to fool the Minnesota defense with a fake field goal play. Backup quarterback Mike Moroski, the holder on field goal plays, took the snap and started run right, but then pitched the ball to kicker Mick Luckhurst, who raced 17 {{yards for a touchdown}} (the only rush attempt of his career) to give his team a 14-13 lead. The situation got even better for Atlanta just two minutes later when safety Bob Glazebrook intercepted Kramer's pass and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown.

The Dolphins later scored on an 80-yard drive, with quarterback Dan Marino completing passes to Bruce Hardy for 12 yards and Mark Duper for 18 before finding tight end Dan Johnson {{in the end zone}} with an 11-yard touchdown pass. But New England responded on a 66-yard possession, featuring a 45-yard run from Robert Weathers, to score on quarterback Tony Eason's 4-yard touchdown to Tony Collins, giving the Pats a 10–7 lead. On Miami's next drive, Marino fumbled the ball and nose tackle Lester Williams recovered for New England on the Dolphins 36-yard line. Patriots running back Craig James then rushed for 23 yards on three carries and Eason completed a 12-yard pass to Stanley Morgan on the 1-yard line before throwing a 1-yard touchdown toss to tight end Derrick Ramsey, giving the Patriots a 17–7 lead. Just before halftime Miami missed the chance to cut the <b>deficit</b> <b>down</b> to three points when tight end Dan Johnson dropped a pass from Marino in the end zone on a first and 10 from the Patriots' 16. As the next two plays fell short of a first down, Miami settled for a field goal from the Patriots' 14 yard-line, but Fuad Reveiz' kick sailed wide to the right after a badly taken snap.|$|E

40|$|Balanced budget {{requirements}} lead to substantial pro-cyclicality {{in state}} government spending outside of safety-net programs. At {{the beginnings of}} recessions, states tend to experience unexpected deficits. While all states ultimately pay these <b>deficits</b> <b>down,</b> differences in the stringency of their balanced budget requirements dictate the pace at which they adjust. States with strict rules enact large rescissions to their budgets during the years in which adverse shocks occur; states with weak rules {{make up the difference}} during the following years. We use this variation to identify the impact of mid-year budget cuts on state income and employment. Our baseline estimates imply i) a state-spending multiplier of 1. 7 and ii) that avoiding $ 25, 000 in mid-year cuts preserves one job. These cuts are associated with shifts in the timing of government expenditures rather than differences in total spending {{over the course of the}} business cycle. Consequently, our results are informative about the potential gains from smoothing the path of state government spending. They imply that states could reduce the amplitude of business-cycle fluctuations by 15 % if they completely smoothed their capital spending and service provision outside of safety-net programs. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} particulate and dissolved {{organic carbon}} (POC and DOC), chlorophyll, oxygen, partial pressure of CO 2, pH, total alkalinity (TAlk) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) during a late summer cruise in the eutrophic Loire estuary. These parameters reveal an intense mineralisation of organic matter in the estuarine maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) that results in oxygen <b>deficits</b> (<b>down</b> to 20 % of the saturation level) and high CO 2 oversaturations (pCO 2 up to 2900 µatm). Several facts revealed the occurrence of carbonate dissolution in the Loire MTZ: large amounts of alkalinity were produced in the upper estuary, increasing its transfer to the ocean by 30 %; the calculated saturation index showed a net undersaturation for aragonite and a slight undersaturation for calcite in the MTZ; and PIC decreased from 2. 1 % (% dry weight) in riverine suspension to 0. 4 % in the MTZ. A stoichiometric approach is {{used to assess the}} coupling between aerobic respiration and carbonate dissolution, where apparent oxygen utilisation, excess CO 2, TAlk and dissolved inorganic carbon are compared quantitatively. About 20 % of the CO 2 generated by respiration was involved in carbonate dissolution. The loss of PIC at the river-estuary transition quantitatively corresponds to the amount of authigenic calcite precipitated upstream in the highly eutrophic river. This suggests that CO 2 exchange with the atmosphere along the eutrophic river-estuary continuum is buffered by carbonate precipitation in the autotrophic river and its dissolution in the heterotrophic estuary...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe first indisputable {{evidence}} for very early differentiation of the silicate Earth {{came from the}} extinct 146 Sm- 142 Nd chronometer. 142 Nd excesses measured in 3. 7 -billion-year (Gyr) -old rocks from Isua 1, 2 (southwest Greenland) relative to modern terrestrial samples imply their derivation from a depleted mantle formed in the Hadean eon (about 4, 570 - 4, 000 [*]Gyr ago). As dictated by mass balance, the differentiation event responsible {{for the formation of}} the Isua early-depleted reservoir must also have formed a complementary enriched component. However, considerable efforts to find early-enriched mantle components in Isua have so far been unsuccessful 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Here we show that the signature of the Hadean enriched reservoir, complementary to the depleted reservoir in Isua, is recorded in 3. 4 -Gyr-old mafic dykes intruding into the Early Archaean rocks. Five out of seven dykes carry 142 Nd deficits compared to the terrestrial Nd standard, with three samples yielding resolvable <b>deficits</b> <b>down</b> to − 10. 6 parts per million. The enriched component that we report here could have been a mantle reservoir that differentiated owing to the crystallization of a magma ocean, or could represent a mafic proto-crust that separated from the mantle more than 4. 47 [*]Gyr ago. Our results testify to the existence of an enriched component in the Hadean, and may suggest that the southwest Greenland mantle preserved early-formed heterogeneities until at least 3. 4 [*]Gyr ago...|$|R
