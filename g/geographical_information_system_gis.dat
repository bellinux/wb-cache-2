40|$|Abstract: The last 10 {{years have}} seen a sudden rise in {{interest}} {{in the use of}} <b>Geographical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> (<b>GIS)</b> in historical research. This has led to a fi eld that has become known as ‘historical GIS’. This development started in the more quantitative ends of the discipline but has spread to encompass qualitative research as well. Interest in historical GIS is not restricted to researchers who would previously have regarded themselves as historical geographers, but has in fact led to an increased awareness of the importance of geography from across the discipline of history. This paper introduces historical GIS and critically evaluates how it is affecting the practice of historical geography. Key words: <b>geographical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>GIS,</b> historical geography, historical GIS, spatiotemporal analysis. I Introducing historical GIS Writing about the state of historical geography in 1997, Ogborn (1999) made no mention of the use of <b>Geographical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> (<b>GIS)</b> in the discipline.
