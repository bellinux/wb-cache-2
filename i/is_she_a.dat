In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>a</b> star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{took the}} role because of Rachel's characterization, and explained, [...] "Not only <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>a</b> singer, {{but she has}} so much heart—I think it's what we need on TV.

[...] Michele {{described}} the first thirteen episodes of the series as [...] "Rachel's journey of finding herself within the Glee club", and said that [...] "she's learning {{how to be a}} team player and work within this group.

500|$|Samus' reveal in the {{original}} Metroid, which UGO.com called {{the original}} [...] "jaw-dropping moment" [...] in gaming, was named as the greatest twist in video games by Game Informer in 2007 and as the greatest moment in Nintendo's history by GameDaily in 2008. The Irish Times found it refreshing {{to learn that the}} series' protagonist, who is [...] "well disguised under the suit of heavy armour", is female, but Rupert Goodwins of The Independent wrote that the [...] "Transformer-like suit she wears could just as easily contain a large centipede; it's hardly a breakthrough for feminism." [...] According to the 2007 book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century: Literate Connections, Samus was perhaps the most nonsexualized female video game character ever, a belief shared by Steve Rabin in Introduction to Game Development, which also considered Samus as one of Nintendo's most popular video game mascots. In 2002, Justin Hoeger of The Sacramento Bee opined that [...] "unlike most other female video game characters, Samus isn't some husky-voiced bimbo in tight leather included only for sex appeal. Samus is tough, silent, heavily armed and spends most of her time in a bulky suit of high-tech Power Armor." [...] That same year, however, an article in the Toronto Star retorted that the [...] "sexual politics" [...] surrounding Samus and the Metroid series needed to stop, arguing that the original [...] "big crazy shock to the gaming public" [...] was [...] "some seriously misspent energy" [...] as she [...] "is not a woman {{for the benefit of the}} sweaty/excited crowd, and neither <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>a</b> standard-bearer nor a courageous leader in the struggle for video game civil rights. She is a supremely talented action figure, and in the closeups on her helmet you can kind of see that she wears mascara, but that is all." [...] UGO.com included Samus' one-piece bathing swimsuit on the list of the best alternate costumes and IGN chose [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] by Aerosmith as Samus' theme song because she [...] "spends her time running around in a manly battle suit blasting first and taking names later." [...] Featuring her in their 2004 list of [...] "top ten forces of good" [...] (one section on their list of top 50 [...] "retro" [...] game characters), Retro Gamer opined she has remained [...] "a distinct female character, not relying on cheap thrills to capture the attention of gamers, which is more than can be said for some." ...|$|E

Or <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>a</b> legitimate chanteuse wrapped in the hyper feminine, yet innately American (and admittedly well-curated) image she's projected in videos for such tracks as 'Video Games' and 'Blue Jeans'?"
