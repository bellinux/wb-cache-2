25|$|I {{would be}} a traitor to these poor burned bodies <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people {{of the public and}} we have found you wanting. The old Inquisition had its rack and its {{thumbscrews}} and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|E
500|$|With Singer busy {{preparing}} X2, Confessions was rejuvenated with Clooney {{taking over}} as director. Miramax Films agreed to cover distribution duties and co-finance the film. In the end, funding for Confessions came from Miramax, Clooney's own Section Eight Productions, Village Roadshow Pictures, producer Andrew Lazar's Mad Chance, Allied Filmmakers, and The Kushner-Locke Company. Clooney explained, [...] "I thought <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> on board as a director, for scale, {{and was able}} to bring everybody else on inexpensively, if I could get the film back down to $30 million, then I {{was going to be able}} to get the film made. That was a big part of my pitch to Harvey Weinstein at Miramax." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to his immense {{popularity}} {{during his}} lifetime, Holmes was {{often called upon}} to produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once wrote that he was [...] "a florist in verse, and what would people say / <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to a banquet without my bouquet?" [...] As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, [...] "very little... survives the occasions that produced it". Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, as well as one who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be [...] "a poet of sentiment and passion. Those who know him only as a comic lyricist, as the libellous laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, would be surprised at the clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions".|$|E

500|$|As the character's storyline progressed, {{he became}} [...] "one {{of the most}} devious {{characters}} on daytime" [...] {{as part of a}} Gothic plot in which Adam secretly torments Ashley, Victor's love interest, to get revenge on his father. The story called for Adam to be blind, with uncertainty whether his condition is genuine. Engen told Julie McElwain of Soaps In Depth that he was not sure how to portray the blindness. He said, [...] "I didn't want to nail it on the head completely with the blindness, because I wasn't sure if the blindness was real. Signy [...] won awards for her portrayal of retinitis pigmentosa, and I {{thought it would be a}} dishonor to that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> too close to the mark." [...] Engen said that he thought that former executive producers, Maria Arena Bell and Paul Rauch, and the writers [...] "know what they're doing, and right now it would seem like Adam is instigating more...drama." [...] The actor worried whether the character's actions might lead to him becoming [...] "irredeemable", but also said he took it as a challenge to make what Adam does [...] "interesting and human".|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … because when I was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead I promised myself that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{out of this}} subhuman land I would tender my thanks to God. I hesitate {{to call it a}} vow, it was rather a promise to myself but later I used to think that it was my obligation …" ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeking to musically express Raekwon's {{blend of}} Five Percenter creed and inner-city experience, {{producer}} RZA worked intensively on a polished sound, slower and more layered {{than that of}} Wu-Tang's previous efforts, using strings, piano loops and vocal samples from Kung Fu movies, and Mafia films. Due to Raekwon's storytelling, mobster-minded approach, the producer set up Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... to play like scenes in a crime movie. RZA has cited soul musician Isaac Hayes as an influence on his orchestral approach to several of the album's tracks. He also later revealed {{that several of the}} album's beats, such as [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces," [...] were originally intended for Wu-Tang member GZA's Liquid Swords album, but because of Raekwon's timely writing approach, were used last minute for Cuban Linx. In regard to this, Raekwon clarified [...] "RZA's house was more or less like a candy store. You come in and have all kinds of shit to choose from. I would take stuff that I felt would suit my album correctly; others would take their own beats too. The beats were like a grab bag. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> in and heard a beat that someone already claimed, then I just had to fall back. We almost never fought over beats or nothing. I'd tell RZA if I liked a certain beat, and he'd see if it would fit me or not." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{told him}} that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> at all the rank really did not matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} coldly; [...] "the rock is loose. Besides, the ledge is narrow, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> down heavily, we might both fall over." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{went off}} and Carrie sat down. [...] "Looks as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> along when I was needed. The fellow talked in hints. What did he mean?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, bowing, [...] "that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{to claim}} the reward, I should ask for more even {{that you would be}} {{inclined}} to give." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is certain}} {{therefore}} that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> near to them I should be dragged down as wood is dragged of an eddy, nor would Egypt see me any more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's what I'm {{going to}} do," [...] was the reply. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> across any {{game on the}} way I want the chance to bring it down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You won't mind <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{down to see}} {{you some}} time, will you?" [...] {{questioned}} the man. [...] "I want your teachers to know how brave you have been." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Only {{the master}} of the Preceptory," [...] went on Acour, {{changing}} his tone somewhat, [...] "might take fright and think I wished to violate his sanctuary <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> there with thirty spears at my back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't mind <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to see {{you once}} in a while, will you?" [...] asked Peter as he {{prepared}} to start on again for the dear Old Briar-patch.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I'm very sorry. Indeed I am, Grandfather Frog," [...] said Peter very humbly. [...] "Will {{you tell}} me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> again some time when you are not so sleepy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, good-bye,' Murdoch said. 'I am off by {{the boat}} to-morrow. I will look you up <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back this way, and let you know how I have got on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was afraid}} {{there would be}} interviewers and boring people {{generally}} to meet me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> by the boat by which I was expected, so I got into another, and I've arrived a day before my time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Jordan gravely, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} I'm much obliged to him. But before I go there's {{something}} I want to ask: {{would it be}} a liberty <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back here with him some day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|FERRAND. [With faint eagerness.] My breakfast. I was in poverty-- veree bad off. You gave me ten francs. I thought I had {{a little}} the right [WELLWYN makes a {{movement}} of disconcertion] seeing you said that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to England---- ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Sir Richard arose. [...] "I cannot stay later, good friends," [...] said he, [...] "for my lady will wax anxious <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> not home; so I crave {{leave to}} depart." ...|$|R
