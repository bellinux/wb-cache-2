40|$|From an {{industrial}} point of view, <b>joining</b> <b>technologies</b> {{play a key}} role nowadays, due to the continuously increasing applications of multi-material-design. The different properties of the used materials lower the number of possible (suitable) <b>joining</b> <b>technologies.</b> Fiber-Reinforced-Plastics (FRPs) make it even more difficult to choose the right technology because of their anisotropic behavior. Bonding is currently the most common <b>technology</b> for <b>joining</b> FRPs. Furthermore, hybrid joining processes are applied in order to combine the positive properties of other <b>joining</b> <b>technologies</b> with bonding. Nevertheless a blatant disadvantage of bonding FRPs is the fact, that there are no fibers in the direct area of the join which leads to a weakened structure and lower mechanical properties. Friction Stir Welding can avoid this disadvantage when joining short fiber-reinforced thermoplastics by stirring fibers into the joining area. To be able to apply the Friction Stir Welding technology to thermoplastic materials, certain changes in the process parameters are necessary because the technology has its origin in the metallurgy...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Wide spread use of {{sandwich}} structures is still inhibited {{by the lack}} of a consistent <b>joining</b> <b>technology</b> one which is easy to work with, quantifiable and not dependent on special knowledge about manufacturing processes. A mechanical tech-nology for joining sandwiches as developed in this article shall achieve these goals. The developing process follows the design methodology according to Pahl et al. [1]. The resulting systematic approach to the problem facilitated the generation of a complete solution field. This approach led to 18 promising concepts of 783 possible original solutions. Prototypes of those concepts showed that a reliable mechanical technology for joining sandwich elements is feasible.

40|$|Abstract. Sophisticated {{materials}} {{like high}} strength steel or even multi phase steel as well as aluminum require more efforts within the manufacturing process than conventional steel sheets {{as they have been}} used in the body in white recently. The manufacturing process itself as well as engineering of the parts, material of the forming tools as well as cold and warm <b>joining</b> <b>technologies</b> must be regarded separately. For forming tools coated steel inserts or sometimes even cooling is essential in terms of high-volume car series production. In mixed material solutions using steel in combination with aluminum, the common used resistance spot welding process does not work any more. To maintain high process stability of cold <b>joining</b> <b>technologies</b> combined with adhesive bonding a new process must have been developed. Other items for weight and cost savings are tailored rolled blanks or sophisticated <b>joining</b> <b>technologies.</b> Regarding the manufacturing costs, a cost effective combination of the mentioned high-sophisticated alloys with conventional material should be achieved. Developing a design concept due to crash, stiffness and driving performance, basic requirements have to be considered. This aims to check the high potential of cost intensive materials wherever high functional benefit is necessary under commercial aspects...|$|R
40|$|Current product {{development}} showing an ever shrinking physical volume {{is asking for}} new, reliable <b>joining</b> <b>technologies.</b> Laser beam technologies conceal innovative solutions to overcome limitations of conventional <b>joining</b> <b>technologies.</b> Laser beam welding of thermoplastics offers several process technical advantages. The joining energy is fed contact-less into the joining area, avoiding mechanical stress and thermal load to the joining partners. The energy is supplied spatially (seam width {{on the order of}} 100 µm) and timely (interaction time on the order of ms) very well defined. Different process strategies are possible leading to flexibility, product adapted irradiation, short process times and high quality weld seams as well as to high integration abilities and automation potentials. During the joining process no vibration, no thermal stress, no particle release takes place. Therefore, destruction of mechanically and electronically highly sensitive components, such as microelectronics, is avoided. The work place pollution is neglectable compared to other <b>joining</b> <b>technologies,</b> such as gluing (fume) or ultrasonic welding (noise, pieces of fluff). Not only micro-components can be welded in a reproducible way but also macro-components while obtaining a hermetic sealing with good optical appearance.
