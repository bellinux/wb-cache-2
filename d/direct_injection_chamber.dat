40|$|The {{effect of}} {{dehydrated}} ethanol and rapeseed methyl ester additives to diesel fuel on engine fuel consumption has been experimentally investigated. The used average capacity (18 kW) tractor {{was driven by}} unmodified <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> (combustion <b>chamber</b> consists of a dished piston) four cylinder, two-cycle diesel engine D 21 A 1. Multicomponent fuel blends were prepared by adding 5 and 10 % (v/v) of ethanol as well as 30 and 50 % (v/v) of biodiesel (RME) to diesel fuel obtained from Mazeikiu Nafta Petroleum Refinery Company (Lithuania). During the on-farm tests tractor’s fuel consumption data range varied at {{the margin of error}} depending on the used type of fuel. In order to solve this problem the decision was taken to attempt to find the optimum number of test drives by using of statistical modeling {{on the basis of the}} mathematical theory of experiment.

40|$|Spark-less jet {{ignition}} pre-chambers are enablers of high efficiencies and load control by quantity of fuel injected when coupled with <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> of main <b>chamber</b> fuel, thus permitting always lean burn bulk stratified combustion. Towards {{the end of}} the compression stroke, a small quantity of hydrogen is injected within the pre-chamber, where it mixes with the air entering from the main chamber. Combustion of the air and fuel mixture then starts within the pre-chamber because of the high temperature of the hot glow plug, and then jets of partially combusted hot gases enter the main chamber igniting there in the bulk, over multiple ignition points, lean stratified mixtures of air and fuel. The paper describes the operation of the spark-less {{jet ignition}} pre-chamber coupling CFD and CAE engine simulations to allow component selection and engine performance evaluation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Injection {{pultrusion}} is {{a continuous}} process for manufacturing composite materials. To produce good quality parts {{it is essential}} that complete wet out of the reinforcement fibers is achieved in the <b>injection</b> <b>chamber.</b> To achieve good wet out of the fibers, the magnitude of the resin injection pressure is extremely important. The present study is focused on the effects of pull speed, fiber volume fraction, resin viscosity and compression ratio (taper) of the <b>injection</b> <b>chamber</b> on resin fiber wet out within the <b>injection</b> <b>chamber</b> for polyester–glass roving composites. The recommended injection pressures for complete wet out are predicted for a wide and comprehensive variety of processing variables; this work is novel in that it has new and comprehensive results not available in the existing literature.

50|$|In non-diesel {{internal}} combustion engines, gasoline <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> (GDI), {{also known as}} petrol <b>direct</b> <b>injection,</b> <b>direct</b> petrol <b>injection,</b> spark-ignited <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> (SIDI) and fuel-stratified injection (FSI), is a variant of fuel injection employed in modern two-stroke and four-stroke gasoline engines. The gasoline is highly pressurized, and injected via a common rail fuel line directly into the combustion chamber of each cylinder, as opposed to conventional multipoint fuel injection that injects fuel into the intake tract or cylinder port. Directly injecting fuel into the combustion <b>chamber</b> requires high-pressure <b>injection,</b> whereas low pressure is used injecting into the intake tract or cylinder port.|$|R
30|$|Concerns about {{environmental}} pollution and energy shortages have increased worldwide. One approach to reduce CO 2 emissions from gasoline engines {{is to achieve}} stratified charge combustion with various injection ratios using port fuel <b>injection</b> (PFI) and <b>direct</b> <b>injection.</b> The combustion and emission characteristics of a 4 -valve <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> spark ignition (DISI) engine equipped with a dual injection system were investigated while the injection ratio was varied. When the <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> ratio increased, the lean limit A/F was extended. This suggests that the dual injection gasoline engine with both PFI and <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> can meet severe vehicle emission and fuel economy requirements. The dual injection system had higher combustion pressure than that of either a conventional or <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> systems. Therefore, the engine power of a dual injection DISI engine would be {{higher than that of}} a single injection DISI engine. However, NO emissions increased compared with the emission levels in both PFI and DISI systems.|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{systems for}} <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> of plant {{protection}} products (PPP) did not satisfy the requirements of practical farming because of time lag between dosing of PPP and its application and because of cleaning problems.

This prototype has three separate nozzle lines, {{each with its own}} <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> unit capable of preloading with individual spray mixture so that no time lag occurs in application. Calculated were the theoretically achievable working widths possible with the applied <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> dosing pumps. Test stand measurements were carried out to determine dosing precision. The results show that good dosing precision is achieved in the different settings. Hereby, attention should be paid to the working range of the dosing pumps. The results show that practically-applicable systems for <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> without time lag based on the developed prototype are possible offering the ability to apply PPP more precisely and site-specifically...|$|R

50|$|In 2013, a {{research}} by TÜV NORD found that although gasoline <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> engines dramatically reduce CO2 emissions, they release about 1,000 times more particles classified by the World Health Organization as harmful than traditional petrol engines and 10 {{times more than}} new diesel engines.
