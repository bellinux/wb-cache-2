5|$|After the September 11 attacks, the Park Blocks <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> candlelight vigil and a {{memorial}} concert by the Oregon Symphony, which was {{free in the}} Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall and was also broadcast into the blocks.|$|E
5|$|Atop the whale's skull is {{positioned}} a large complex of organs <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> liquid mixture of fats and waxes called spermaceti. The {{purpose of this}} complex is to generate powerful and focused clicking sounds, which the sperm whale uses for echolocation and communication.|$|E
5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes. A carcass was {{so named because}} the iron cage was thought to resemble the ribs of a body. A carcass was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> highly flammable mixture. Carcasses {{were used for the}} first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E

5|$|Another {{removable}} roadblocking {{system used}} mines. The extant remains of such systems superficially {{resemble those of}} hedgehog or hairpin, but the pits are shallow: just deep enough to take an anti-tank mine. When not in use, the sockets were <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wooden plug allowing traffic to pass normally.|$|E
5|$|Best {{remembered the}} Indra {{as being a}} {{depressing}} place that was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller, a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 Grosse Freiheit. After {{the closure of the}} Indra because of complaints about the noise, the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller, starting on 4 October 1960.|$|E
5|$|Lisa finds Homer's {{note and}} alerts the family. They hurry {{to the bridge}} to save him, but they are almost {{run over by a}} {{speeding}} truck. Homer pulls them to safety just in time, and he is suddenly <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new reason to live: to place a stop sign at the dangerous intersection. After successfully petitioning the city council, Homer embarks on a public safety crusade that involves placing speed bumps and warning signs throughout the town.|$|E

5|$|Salkin {{had noted}} that its {{tropical}} position might mean that B.dentata {{was a key}} species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> phenolic compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll.|$|E
5|$|Stocking of {{the lake}} with fish began before the {{reservoir}} was <b>filled,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small rearing pond being placed {{on the bottom of}} the valley. The lake has several species of freshwater fish; largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, crappie, rainbow trout, striped bass, channel catfish, and shad. It is considered one of the best fisheries in California.|$|E

5|$|The Table Rocks {{offer an}} example of {{inverted}} relief, in which previous topographic lows are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> resistant rock and become new topographic highs after {{the erosion of the}} surrounding region. Each plateau is shaped roughly like a horseshoe because the lava followed the meanders of the Ancestral Rogue River.|$|E
5|$|The body is {{the main}} part of the cloth, and is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of patterns. The body can be divided into two {{alternating}} patterns and colours called pagi-sore ('dawn-dusk'). Brighter pattern are shown during the day, while darker pattern are shown in the evening. The alternating colours give the impression of two batik sets.|$|E
5|$|The game is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} puzzles {{that must be}} solved to advance the story. These include memory games and mazes. Others involve {{competing}} against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in {{a limited number of}} moves, operating mechanisms, or using an inventory item. Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to move through game areas and work on different challenges.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{bearing structure}} is described {{which includes a}} permanently magnetized porous body <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interstitial magnetic lubricant for extending the operational life of self-lubricating bearings. The bearing structure {{is characterized by a}} permanently magnetized retainer formed of a porous material and <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interstitial magnetic lubricant, whereby the pores serve as lubricant reservoirs from which the lubricant continuously is delivered to a film disposed between contiguous bearing surfaces...|$|R

5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mix of water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E

5|$|From 2004 until 2007, Asashōryū was sumo's sole yokozuna, and {{was criticized}} at {{times by the}} media and the Japan Sumo Association for not {{upholding}} the standards of behaviour expected of a holder of such a prestigious rank. He became the first yokozuna in history to be suspended from competition in August 2007 when he participated in a charity soccer match in his home country despite having withdrawn from a regional sumo tour claiming injury. After a career <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> multitude of other controversies, {{both on and off the}} dohyō, his career was cut short when he retired from sumo in February 2010 after allegations that he assaulted a man outside a Tokyo nightclub.|$|E
5|$|Spores are broadly {{ellipsoid}} in shape, amyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of either 8–10 by 6–7µm or 10–14 by 6.7–8.5µm {{depending on whether}} they originated from four-or two-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), respectively. There are abundant cheilocystidia on the gill edges. They measure 30–50 by 7–12µm, and are fusoid-ventricose, with tips that are broadly rounded. They are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> purplish sap and have granular contents. The cap tissue comprises a well-differentiated cuticle, a distinct hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body. Clamp connections in the hyphae are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
