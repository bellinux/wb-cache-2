500|$|At {{the time}} of the 50th anniversary of the flag, the government—held by the Conservative Party—was criticized for the lack of {{official}} ceremony dedicated to the date; accusations of partisanship were levelled. Minister of Canadian Heritage Shelly Glover denied the charges and others, including Liberal Members of Parliament, pointed to community events taking place around the country. Governor General David Johnston did, though, preside at an official ceremony at Confederation Park in Ottawa, integrated with Winterlude. He said [...] "he National Flag of Canada is so embedded in our national life and so emblematic of our national purpose that we simply cannot imagine our country without it." [...] Queen Elizabeth II stated: [...] "On this, the 50th anniversary of the National Flag of Canada, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> join with all Canadians in the celebration of this unique and cherished symbol of our country and identity." [...] A commemorative stamp and coin were issued by Canada Post and the Royal Canadian Mint, respectively.|$|E
500|$|According to numismatic {{historian}} Roger Burdette, [...] "Chapman's letter {{caused some}} consternation at the White House". [...] The President prepared a reply {{in which he}} expressed himself strongly to Chapman, but Bigelow persuaded him to substitute a milder letter over Bigelow's signature, defending the new coins. [...] Bigelow's letter replied to Chapman's complaint about the Indian, [...] "The answer to {{this is that the}} head was taken from a recent photograph of an Indian whose health was excellent. [...] Perhaps Mr. Chapman has in mind the fatter but less characteristic type of Indian sometimes seen on the reservations." [...] Chapman wrote again, and had the correspondence published in the numismatic press, but no one at the lame duck Roosevelt White House bothered to reply, according to Burdette, [...] "the new coins were issued and would remain as they were for twenty-five years, or until Congress ordered them changed". [...] Leach wrote to Bigelow on January 2, 1909, [...] "I was somewhat amused by their savage attack, and should have liked to have been in a position to reply to this unjust criticism. [...] However, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> say that adverse criticism of the coins is an exception. [...] I feel very well pleased with the result." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 2012, the Vatican {{announced}} that Pope Benedict XVI had joined social networking website Twitter, under the handle @Pontifex.

Kim Singleton was ultimately selected for the seat; in a statement, the SLP {{said that he could}} not contest the election due to [...] "personal and contractual commitments".

2500|$|India is {{currently}} the world's largest cutting & polishing centre for diamonds. Both countries have agreed to streamline their bilateral trade in diamonds through reductions in regulations and tariffs. Indian Prime Minister Modi stated in an interview, [...] "I made three proposals to President Putin. First, I would like Alrosa to have direct long-term contracts with more Indian companies. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> {{know that they are}} moving in this direction. Second, I want Alrosa and others to trade directly on our diamond bourse. We have decided to create a Special Notified Zone where mining companies can trade diamonds on consignment basis and re-export unsold ones. Third, I asked to reform regulation so that Russia can send rough diamonds to India and reimport polished diamonds without extra duties". Analysts predict through streamlined procedures and initiatives bilateral trade in this area will significantly increase.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a one-year}} break {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} Alias, her wedding to Affleck, {{and the birth of}} her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: [...] "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never [...] "been lovelier or more affecting." [...] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007). She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke. In late 2007 and early 2008, Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as [...] "captivating": [...] " [...] Ms. Garner, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... speaks Anthony Burgess’s peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she’s a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable." [...] The New Yorkers theater critic was impressed by her [...] "feistiness" [...] and [...] " [...] lightness of comic touch". The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.|$|E
