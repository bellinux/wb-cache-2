60|$|So {{much for}} the case {{of those who are}} able and willing to work. There remain still the uncounted {{thousands}} who by accident or illness, age or infirmity, are unable to maintain themselves. For these people, under the older dispensation, there was nothing but the poorhouse, the jail or starvation by the roadside. The narrow individualism of the nineteenth century refused to recognize the social duty of supporting somebody else's grandmother. Such charity began, and ended, at home. But even with the passing of the nineteenth century an awakened sense of the collective responsibility of society towards its weaker members began to impress itself upon public policy. Old age pension laws and national insurance against illness and accident were already being built into the legislative codes of the democratic countries. The experience of the war has enormously increased this sense of social solidarity. It is clear now that our fortunes are not in our <b>individual</b> <b>keeping.</b> We stand or fall as a nation. And the nation which neglects the aged and infirm, or which leaves a family to be shipwrecked {{as the result of a}} single accident to a breadwinner, cannot survive as against a nation in which the welfare of each is regarded as contributory to the safety of all. Even the purest selfishness would dictate a policy of social insurance.|$|E

50|$|Hauptstadt was to {{take the}} idea of the city to a brand new level in its {{relation}} to the <b>individual.</b> <b>Keeping</b> in the style of Le Corbusier, the plan was designed such that there would be separate pedestrian and automobile corridors, allowing for a greater sense of connectivity in that any individual will never experience the same thing more than once, shying away from automation of life. This space was meant to be experienced, giving its inhabitants a greater chance to encounter new and exciting things through its ease of use overall. By separating the sidewalk from the road, people could move freely on foot without fear of vehicles and vice versa for drivers. Escalators were to be used to access the pedestrian corridor from the street level. This dual-layer technique was meant to emphasize remnants of the city on the upper level, while still keeping with the new structures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGAs) are {{approximation}} {{techniques to}} solve multi-objective optimization problems. Since MOGAs search {{a wide variety}} of pareto optimal solutions at the same time, MOGAs require large computation power. In order to solve practical sizes of the multi objective optimization problems, it is desirable to design and develop a hardware implementation method for MOGAs with high search efficiency and calculation speed. In this paper, we propose a new method to easily implement MOGAs as high performance hardware circuits. In the proposed method, we adopt simple Minimal Generation Gap (MGG) model as the generation model, because it is easy to be pipelined. In order to preserve diversity of individuals, we need a special selection mechanism such as the niching method which takes large computation time to repeatedly compare superiority among all individuals in the population. In the proposed method, we developed a new selection mechanism which greatly reduces the number of comparisons among <b>individuals,</b> <b>keeping</b> diversity of <b>individuals.</b> Our method also includes a parallel execution architecture based on Island GA which is scalable to the number of concurrent pipelines and effective to keep diversity of individuals.

50|$|In economics, {{it usually}} refers to private <b>individuals</b> <b>keeping</b> unusually high stocks of goods {{for their own}} use, {{rather than relying on}} the market. They may see this as a way of {{attaining}} food security in a high-risk situation. Hoarding has been perceived to be extremely important in wartime and in famine situations, where it can lead to significant amounts of food and other products being removed from the market, so that people cannot buy them at a time when enough exists to supply the market at the normal price. In hyperinflation situations, they may hoard any non-perishable goods in the belief that they will {{no longer be able to}} buy them at future prices. Less dramatically, people may hoard sugar, say, if there is a rumour that the supermarkets are running out of, with the effect that the supermarkets, which keep low stocks, do in fact run out for a week or two. Governments frequently launch anti-hoarding campaigns in such circumstances, suggesting that hoarding is unnecessary, unpatriotic, or anti-social, so the word has emotional overtones. There is often an implication that hoarding occurs because individuals do not believe that the market will operate efficiently in current or expected conditions.|$|R

40|$|Paedomorphosis, the {{presence}} of ancestral larval and juvenile traits that occur at the descendent adult stage, is an evolutionary phenomenon that shaped morphological evolution in many vertebrate lineages, including tailed amphibians. Among salamandrid species, paedomorphic and metamorphic phenotypes can be observed within single populations (facultative paedomorphosis). Despite wide interest in facultative paedomorphosis and polymorphism produced by heterochronic changes (heterochronic polymorphism), the studies that investigate intraspecific morphological variation in facultative paedomorphic species are largely missing. By quantifying the cranium size and development (bone development and remodeling), we investigated the variation at multiple levels (i. e., between sexes, populations and species) of two facultatively paedomorphic European newt species: the alpine and the smooth newt. The pattern of variation between paedomorphs (<b>individuals</b> <b>keeping</b> larval traits at the adult stage) and metamorphs (metamorphosed adult individuals) varied between species and among populations within a single species. The patterns of variation in size and skull formation {{appear to be more}} uniform in the alpine than in the smooth newt, indicating that developmental constraints differed between species (more pronounced in alpine than in smooth newt). Our study shows that the cranial skeleton provides detailed insight in the pattern of variation and divergence in heterochronic polymorphism within and between species and open new questions related to heterochronic polymorphism and evolution of cranial skeleton.

40|$|Many {{infectious}} diseases are spread through interactions between susceptible and infectious <b>individuals.</b> <b>Keeping</b> track of where each {{exposure to the}} disease took place, when it took place, and which individuals {{were involved in the}} exposure can give public health officials important information that they may use to formulate their interventions. Further, knowing which individuals in the population are at the highest risk of becoming infected with the disease may prove to be a useful tool for public health officials trying to curtail the spread of the disease. Epidemiological models are needed to allow epidemiologists to study the population dynamics of transmission of infectious agents and the potential impact of infectious disease control programs. While many agent-based computational epidemiological models exist in the literature, they focus on the spread of disease rather than exposure risk. These models are designed to simulate very large populations, representing individuals as agents, and using random experiments and probabilities in an attempt to more realistically guide the course of the modeled disease outbreak. The work presented in this thesis focuses on tracking exposure risk to chickenpox in an elementary school setting. This setting is chosen due to the high level of detailed information realistically available to school administrators regarding individuals' schedules and movements. Using an agent-based approach, contacts between individuals are tracked and analyzed with respect to both individuals and locations. The results are then analyzed using a combination of tools from computer science and geographic information science...|$|R
