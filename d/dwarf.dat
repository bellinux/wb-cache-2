5|$|A plutoid or ice <b>dwarf</b> is a trans-Neptunian <b>dwarf</b> planet, i.e. a body {{orbiting}} beyond Neptune that is massive {{enough to}} be rounded in shape. The term plutoid {{was adopted by the}} International Astronomical Union (IAU) working group Committee on Small Bodies Nomenclature, but was rejected by the IAU working group Planetary System Nomenclature. The term plutoid is not widely used by astronomers, though ice <b>dwarf</b> is not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|A slow-rotating white <b>dwarf</b> star can {{not exceed}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white <b>dwarf</b> reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white <b>dwarf</b> is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white <b>dwarf</b> to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|A white <b>dwarf,</b> {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} <b>dwarf,</b> is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white <b>dwarf</b> is very dense: its mass {{is comparable to}} that of the Sun, while its volume is {{comparable to that of}} Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white <b>dwarf</b> wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white <b>dwarf</b> is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white <b>dwarf</b> was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E

5000|$|In {{many ways}} {{they are the}} antithesis of the <b>Dwarfs</b> that remained. Where <b>Dwarfs</b> shun most magic except for Runic magic (which is unique to them) Chaos <b>Dwarves</b> have embraced it; where <b>Dwarfs</b> worship their Ancestor Gods, Chaos <b>Dwarfs</b> worship [...] "Hashut, Father of Darkness". <b>Dwarfs</b> abhor slavery and hate the [...] "Greenskin" [...] races (Goblins, Orcs and the like) but the Chaos <b>Dwarfs</b> rely on slaves and are allied with or are overlords of many Greenskin tribes, most of them Hobgoblins. The Chaos <b>Dwarfs</b> are even {{responsible}} for the creation of the Black Orcs.|$|R
5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white <b>dwarf.</b> The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a white <b>dwarf</b> conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a white <b>dwarf</b> with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white <b>dwarf</b> is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Compression {{of a white}} <b>dwarf</b> will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this {{will increase}} the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white <b>dwarf</b> against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white <b>dwarf</b> is much greater than that of a low-mass white <b>dwarf</b> and that the radius of a white <b>dwarf</b> decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|However if {{the white}} <b>dwarf</b> merges with another white <b>dwarf</b> (a very rare event), it will {{momentarily}} exceed the limit and begin to collapse, again raising its temperature past the nuclear fusion ignition point. Within {{a few seconds of}} initiation of nuclear fusion, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white <b>dwarf</b> undergoes a runaway reaction, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion.|$|E

5|$|In {{the poem}} Alvíssmál, Thor tricks a <b>dwarf,</b> Alvíss, to his doom upon finding that {{he seeks to}} wed his {{daughter}} (unnamed, possibly Þrúðr).

In a long question and answer session, Alvíss does exactly that; he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world, and gives an amount of cosmological lore.|$|E

For a uniformly rotating white <b>dwarf,</b> the limiting mass increases only slightly. If the star is allowed to rotate nonuniformly, and viscosity is neglected, then, as was pointed out by Fred Hoyle in 1947, there is no limit to the mass for which it is possible for a model white <b>dwarf</b> to be in static equilibrium. Not all of these model stars will be dynamically stable.|$|E

5|$|A white <b>dwarf</b> is {{very hot}} when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool.
