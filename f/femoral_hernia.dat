25|$|A Cooper's hernia is a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> {{with two}} sacs, the first {{being in the}} femoral canal, and the second passing through a defect in the {{superficial}} fascia and appearing almost immediately beneath the skin.|$|E
50|$|A {{reducible}} <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> {{occurs when}} a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> can be pushed back into the abdomen, either spontaneously or with manipulation, but most likely, spontaneously. This {{is the most common}} type of <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> and is usually painless.|$|E
50|$|An {{irreducible}} <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> {{occurs when}} a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> becomes stuck in the femoral canal. This can cause pain {{and a feeling of}} illness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> occur {{just below}} the {{inguinal}} ligament, when abdominal contents pass through a naturally occurring weakness called the <b>femoral</b> canal. <b>Femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> are a relatively uncommon type, accounting for only 3% of all <b>hernias.</b> While <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> can occur in both males and females, {{almost all of them}} develop in women because of the wider bone structure of the female pelvis. <b>Femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> are more common in adults than in children. Those that do occur in children {{are more likely to be}} associated with a connective tissue disorder or with conditions that increase intra-abdominal pressure. Seventy percent of pediatric cases of <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> occur in infants under the age of one.|$|R
25|$|<b>Femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> occur {{just below}} the {{inguinal}} ligament, when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the femoral canal. They {{can be hard to}} distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias.</b> The incidence of strangulation in <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> is high. Repair techniques are similar for <b>femoral</b> and inguinal <b>hernia.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Femoral</b> <b>hernias,</b> {{like most}} other hernias, usually need {{operative}} intervention. This should ideally be done as an elective (non-emergency) procedure. However, {{because of the high}} incidence of complications, <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> often need emergency surgery.|$|R
5000|$|De Garengeot's hernia {{is a rare}} subtype of an incarcerated <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia.</b> This eponym {{may be used to}} {{describe}} the incarceration of the vermiform appendix within a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Béclard's hernia: A <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> {{through the}} opening of the saphenous vein.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} to the femoral canal is the femoral ring, through which bowel can sometimes enter, causing a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at springerlink. comTension-free herniorraphies were carried out using either the Mesh Plug repair (M-P) or Perfix plug technique (P-P) in four patients with cirrhosis. Three patients had a lateral inguinal hernia, and the other had bilateral inguinal and <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias.</b> The patients’ ages ranged from 55 to 80 years. The Child-Pugh classifications showed that one was A, two were B, and one was C. The main complaint in two patients was a difficult reduction and the others had discomfort. An M-P was performed in the three patients with inguinal hernias and an M-P was performed for the <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> and a P-P for the inguinal hernias in the patient with both inguinal and <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias.</b> Two patients had fluid collection under the incision {{and one of them}} required a single puncture. However, the others had no related complications after the operation. One patient died due to liver failure without recurrence of the groin hernias 31 months after the operation. The others had no recurrence and no related symptoms from 5 to 52 months after the operation...|$|R
50|$|Similar as {{with the}} {{situation}} of an Amyand's hernia, {{the true nature of}} the incarcerated tissue is rarely diagnosed preoperatively. Patients present clinically similar to other incarcerated <b>femoral</b> <b>herniae.</b> Treatment consists of an appendicectomy and hernia repair. Laparoscopic options are described.|$|R
40|$|Virtually all nonemergency primary {{inguinal}} <b>hernias</b> and <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> (with some modification) {{in adults}} can be successfully repaired using the Lichtenstein tension free technique. Following, quotations (in bold letters) from the European Hernia Guidelines are our reasons for continuing to prefer the Lichtenstein operation...|$|R
50|$|A <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> may {{be either}} {{reducible}} or irreducible, and each type can also present as either (or both) obstructed or strangulated.|$|E
5000|$|A strangulated <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> {{occurs when}} a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> blocks blood supply to part of the bowel - the loop of bowel loses its blood supply. Strangulation can happen in all hernias, but {{is more common in}} femoral and {{inguinal}} hernias due to their narrow [...] "necks". Nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain may occur with a strangulated hernia. This is a medical emergency. A strangulated intestine can result in necrosis (tissue death) followed by gangrene (tissue decay). This is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate surgery.|$|E
5000|$|Grigoryants {{designed}} the operative technique of {{closure of the}} <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> defect. Grigoryants is also credited with developing a method of musculo-aponeurotic surgical suture on the Abdominal cavity ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> {{are more}} common in {{multiparous}} females which results from elevated intra-abdominal pressure that dilates the femoral vein and which in turn stretches femoral ring. Such a constant pressure causes preperitoneal fat to insinuate in the femoral ring consequence of which is development of femoral peritoneal sac.|$|R
40|$|During A Period Of Ten Years, 20 Children With <b>Femoral</b> <b>Hernias</b> Were Treated At Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, England. Unfamiliarity With The Occurrence Of <b>Femoral</b> <b>Hernias</b> In Children Resulted In A Correct Diagnosis In Only Three (15 %) Of The 20 Cases By The Referring Physician And In Only 13 (65 %) Of The Cases By The First Surgeon To See The Child. Misdiagnosis Included Inguinal Hernia (Four Cases), Lymphadenitis (Two Cases), And Lymphangioma (One Case). In Two Cases, Misdiagnosis Resulted In Mistreatment; One Child Had The Wrong Operation Performed, And Delay In Surgery In Another Resulted In Strangulation Of The Omentum In The Hernial Sac. Treatment Is By Operation, Which, Despite The Wide Variety Of Procedures Employed, Was Successful In 18 Of The 20 Cases. The Two Recurrences Were Due To The Performance Of Inadequate Operations; Recurrence Was Really Persistent, As The Femoral Pad Of Fat Was Removed But The Sac Was Missed. The Positive Identification Of The Hernial Sac Is Imperative. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} 12 <b>femoral</b> <b>herniae</b> in {{children}} is presented. Nine were misdiagnosed, eight as inguinal hernia. Nine were reducible. The sex incidence, M:F was 7 : 5 and nine presented {{between the ages}} of 8 and 10 years. One presented as intestinal obstruction due to a Richter's hernia and two had had a previous ipsilateral inguinal hernia repaired. All but one were repaired by herniorrhaphy...|$|R
50|$|The obvious {{finding may}} be a lump in the groin. Cough impulse is often absent {{and should not be}} relied on solely when making a {{diagnosis}} of <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia.</b> The lump is more globular than the pear shaped lump of the inguinal hernia. The bulk of a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> lies below an imaginary line drawn between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle (which essentially represents the inguinal ligament) whereas an inguinal hernia starts above this line. Nonetheless, it is often impossible to distinguish the two preoperatively.|$|E
50|$|A Cooper's hernia is a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> {{with two}} sacs, the first {{being in the}} femoral canal, and the second passing through a defect in the {{superficial}} fascia and appearing almost immediately beneath the skin.|$|E
50|$|An {{obstructed}} <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> {{occurs when}} {{a part of the}} intestine becomes intertwined with the hernia, causing an intestinal obstruction. The obstruction may grow and the hernia can become increasingly painful. Vomiting may also result.|$|E
40|$|An {{experience}} with 216 bilateral hernias in female patients is reviewed. The condition is rare, occurring {{only once in}} every 250 patients admitted for a hernia repair. Bilateral primary indirect inguinal hernias were the most frequent type. Bilateral primary <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> were quite rare while bilateral primary direct inguinal hernias were even more uncommon. Other rare bilateral combinations are briefly described. The incidence in children is given...|$|R
40|$|Prosthetic mesh in {{the form}} of a plug has been used {{extensively}} in the United States for hernia repair. It has been popular for all types of <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> and for the majority of recurrent inguinal hernias. It follows the basic principle of 'tension-free' repair and permits unrestricted postoperative physical activity. The method has resulted in a long-term success rate better than the many modifications of the Bassini repair...|$|R
40|$|Several {{strains of}} {{transgenic}} mice derived from an inbred FVB/NHsd colony developed large masses on 1 or both flanks. Although originally suspected to be a phenotypic anomaly related to genetic modifications, nontransgenic littermates subsequently were affected with equal frequency, inculpating the FVB/NHsd founder colony. The masses were subcutaneous, soft, and exophytic and appeared {{over the course}} of a few weeks. Female mice were affected more frequently than males. Gross examination revealed the masses to consist of uni- or bilateral hernias of variable size, occasionally containing small or large intestine (or both), cecum, mesenteric adipose tissue, male reproductive organs, and ureters. All hernial sacs pouched through the femoral triangle laterally to the femoral vessels and therefore were classified as lateral <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias.</b> Lateral <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> have not previously been described in the veterinary literature and have never been described as background lesions in a strain of mice. Our findings suggest likely genetic drift in this strain of FVB/NHsd mice, causing a background lesion that confounded phenotypic analyses of transgenic mice derived from this strain...|$|R
5000|$|The term incarcerated <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> is {{sometimes}} used, but {{may have different}} meanings to different authors and physicians. For example: [...] "Sometimes the hernia can get stuck in the canal and is called an irreducible or incarcerated femoral hernia." [...] "The term 'incarcerated' {{is sometimes}} used to describe an obstructed hernia that is irreducible but not strangulated. Thus, an irreducible, obstructed hernia can also be called an incarcerated one." [...] "Incarcerated hernia: a hernia that cannot be reduced. May lead to bowel obstruction but is not associated with vascular compromise." [...] However, the term [...] "incarcerated" [...] seems to always imply that the <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> is at least irreducible.|$|E
50|$|Inguinal hernias, in turn, {{belong to}} groin hernias, which also {{includes}} femoral hernias. A <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> is not via the inguinal canal, but via the femoral canal, which normally allows passage of the common femoral artery and vein from the pelvis to the leg.|$|E
50|$|The lacunar {{ligament}} is {{the only}} boundary of the femoral canal that can be cut during surgery to release a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia.</b> Care must be taken when doing so as up to 25% of people have an aberrant obturator artery (corona mortis) which can cause significant bleeding.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 197 {{patients}} with inguinal or <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> {{were randomly assigned}} to laparoscopic hernioplasty with either staples (n = 98) or fibrin glue (n = 99) used to fix the prosthesis. The primary outcome measure was occurrence of neuralgia. The fibrin glue group showed a significantly lower mean pain score (P < 0. 05) and significantly shorter recovery time (7. 9 vs. 9. 1 days, P < 0. 001) with respect to the staples group...|$|R
50|$|Groin hernias that do {{not cause}} {{symptoms}} in males {{do not need to}} be repaired. Repair, however, is generally recommended in females due to the higher rate of <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias</b> which have more complications. If strangulation occurs immediate surgery is required. Repair may be done by open surgery or by laparoscopic surgery. Open surgery has the benefit of possibly being done under local anesthesia rather than general anesthesia. Laparoscopic surgery generally has less pain following the procedure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vascular}} lacuna (Latin: lacuna vasorum) is {{the medial}} compartment beneath the inguinal ligament, for the {{passage to the}} femoral vessels, lymph node, [...] Medial to lateral these are: Cloquet's node, femoral vein, femoral artery, and femoral branch of genitofemoral nerve. It is separated from the muscular lacuna by the iliopectineal arch. Its boundaries are therefore the iliopectineal arch, the inguinal ligament, lacunar ligament and superior border of the pubis. The lacunar ligament can be a site of entrapment for <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias.</b>|$|R
50|$|The femoral ring is {{the base}} of the femoral canal. It is {{directed}} upward and is oval in form, its long diameter being directed transversely and measuring about 1.25 cm. Part of the intestine can sometimes pass through the femoral ring into the femoral canal causing a <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lockwood {{is remembered}} for his {{surgical}} work with femoral and inguinal hernias. He developed an infra-inguinal approach for <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> operations {{that is known}} today as the [...] "low approach" [...] or [...] "Lockwood's operation". In 1893, he published an important book titled [...] "Radical Cure of Femoral and Inguinal Hernia".|$|E
50|$|The {{floor of}} the canal is {{reinforced}} by approximating the transversus abdominal aponeurosis and transverse fascia to pectineal (Cooper's) ligament medially from the pubic tubercle to the femoral vein. Lateral to this the floor is restored by approximating the femoral sheath to the inguinal ligament. It is also used in <b>femoral</b> <b>hernia</b> repairs.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonography (USG) is an {{accepted}} and reliable {{tool for the}} assessment of groin hernias. However, USG of the groin is operator dependent and challenging. The anatomy of this region is complex and the normal sonographic findings can be difficult to interpret. We describe the relevant normal anatomy of the groin relating to inguinal and <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias,</b> and describe a straightforward, reliable technique for identifying and assessing the integrity of the inguinal and femoral canals. The inferior epigastric vessels are a critical landmark for assessment of the inguinal canal and deep inguinal ring...|$|R
50|$|The femoral canal {{is located}} below the {{inguinal}} ligament on the lateral {{aspect of the}} pubic tubercle. It is bounded by the inguinal ligament anteriorly, pectineal ligament posteriorly, lacunar ligament medially, and the femoral vein laterally. It normally contains a few lymphatics, loose areolar tissue and occasionally a lymph node called Cloquet's node. The function of this canal appears to be to allow the femoral vein to expand when necessary to accommodate increased venous return from the leg during periods of activity. <b>Femoral</b> <b>herniae</b> are more common in females than in males.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on 15, 000 hernia repairs {{performed}} by the author at the Shouldice Hospital, Toronto. Experience with more than 75, 000 consecutive herniorrhaphies performed in this hospital from 1945 to 1970 is reviewed in four parts — statistics, including recurrence rates; {{the management of the}} patient with a primary uncomplicated hernia, emphasizing in particular the preoperative phase, the sedation given, the local anesthetic used in 95 % of cases and the postoperative phase; the technique of repair of a primary inguinal hernia; and a review of experience with primary and recurrent <b>femoral</b> <b>hernias,</b> emphasizing the different problems in men and women, and describing the technique of femoral repair...|$|R
