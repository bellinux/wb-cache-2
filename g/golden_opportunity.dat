The UN forces had gained strong control over most of the area, with the remaining Chinese defenders trapped in tunnels under the UN positions. Despite the initial setbacks, Deng Hua, acting commander of the PVA, considered the situation a <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> to bleed the US military white. In the strategy meeting held on the evening of October 25, the 15th Corps was ordered to retake the two hills regardless of the cost.|$|E

25|$|While Major General George B. McClellan's 87,000-man Army of the Potomac {{was moving}} to {{intercept}} Lee, a Union soldier discovered a mislaid copy of the detailed battle plans of Lee's army. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically (to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland), thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail if McClellan could move quickly enough. McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding {{to take advantage of}} this intelligence and position his forces based on it, thus endangering a <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> to defeat Lee decisively.|$|E
25|$|The {{drug policy}} of the Netherlands is marked by its {{distinguishing}} between so called soft and hard drugs. An often used argument is that alcohol, which is claimed by some scientists as a hard drug, is legal and a soft drug can't be more dangerous to society if it's controlled. This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol. Prohibition created a <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> for organized crime syndicates to smuggle alcohol, {{and as a result}} the syndicates were able to gain considerable power in some major cities.|$|E

By this time, however, Baird's division had reached Negley's, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position just east of the crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman's men skirmished with Baird's rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force.|$|E

25|$|Indo-USA {{relations}} got strategic {{content in}} the early 1960s. The rise of the People's Republic of China worried the policymakers in Washington. Chinese assertion in Tibet, {{its role in the}} Korean War and other such acts concerned Washington. As the relations between India and China were heated during the late fifties, the Americans found a <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to take advantage of this}} situation to promote India as a counterweight to China. But any unidimensional alliance is bound to be short-lived and this alliance was no exception to this general rule. As China ceased to be a headache for the American policymakers by the late sixties, this unidimensional alliance disappeared into thin air.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 23, Warren and Hancock {{approached}} the North Anna. There were no significant fortifications to their front. Lee had misjudged Grant's plan, assuming any advance against the North Anna would be a mere diversion, while {{the main body of}} Grant's army continued its flanking march to the east. At the Chesterfield Bridge crossing the Telegraph Road, a small South Carolina brigade under Col. John W. Henagan had created a dirt redoubt, and there was a small party guarding the railroad bridge downstream, but all the other river crossings were left undefended.

25|$|The {{imperial}} couple {{would not}} hold their capital for long. In July 1261, Alexios Strategopoulos, a general of Nicaea, was sent {{with a small}} advance force of 800 soldiers, most of them Cumans, to keep a watch on the Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins. When the Byzantine force reached the village of Selymbria, they learned from independent local farmers (thelematarioi) that the entire Latin garrison, and the Venetian fleet, were absent conducting a raid against the Nicaean island of Daphnousia. Although initially hesitant, due to both {{the small size of}} his force, which might be fatal if the Latin army returned, and because he would exceed his orders, Strategopoulos eventually decided not to lose such a <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> to retake the city.|$|E

25|$|Thirty years before, Henry III had deposed three claimants to the papacy, {{and thereby}} {{rendered}} an acknowledged {{service to the}} Church. When Henry IV tried to copy this procedure he was less successful, as he lacked {{the support of the}} people. In Germany there was a rapid and general feeling in favor of Gregory, and the princes took the opportunity to carry out their anti-regal policy under the cloak of respect for the papal decision. When at Whitsun the king proposed to discuss the measures to be taken against Gregory VII in a council of his nobles, only a few made their appearance; the Saxons snatched at the <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> for renewing their rebellion, and the anti-royalist party grew in strength from month to month.|$|E

With WCW steadily making money and firmly dominating the ratings battle, the PPV could have been a devastating blow to the WWF's comeback. However, WCW proved it was no different in alienating its fan base than the WWF. Even though the buy rate for Starrcade '97 was the largest WCW had ever seen for a PPV, it was the turning point in the Monday Night Wars and the WWF would soon be on the rise.|$|E
25|$|With {{the capture}} of Mannheim, Pichegru had a <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> to seize Clerfayt's main supply base at Heidelberg. Clerfayt's army was too far north to save the supply base, while Wurmser's army {{was still in the}} process of assembling. However, Pichegru fumbled by sending only two {{divisions}} to seize Heidelberg. Worse, the French forces were split by the Neckar River. The 6th Division of General of Division Jean-Jacques Ambert moved on the south bank of the river while the 7th Division of General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour advanced on the north bank. Dufour was in overall command of the 12,000 French soldiers. Generals of Brigade Louis Joseph Cavrois and Pierre Vidalot du Sirat led the brigades in Dufour's division while General of Brigade Louis-Nicolas Davout and Adjutant-General Bertrand headed brigades in Ambert's division. Other than the division and brigade commanders, the French order of battle is not known exactly.|$|E

25|$|In 1598, a {{cessation}} of hostilities was arranged and a formal pardon granted to O'Neill by Elizabeth. Within two months he was again in the field, and on 14 August he destroyed an English army {{at the battle of}} the Yellow Ford on the Blackwater river, in which engagement the English Commander, Henry Bagenal, was killed. It was the greatest of all setbacks to English arms in Ireland. If the Earl had been capable of driving home his advantage, he might have successfully upset English power in country, as discontent had broken out in every part — and especially in the south, where James Fitzthomas Fitzgerald with O'Neill's support was asserting his claim to the earldom of Desmond {{at the head of a}} formidable army of Geraldine clansmen — discontent broke into open rebellion.

The match which was {{supposed}} to be played up at Queensland's home ground Suncorp Stadium but it was moved to Sydney because of a concert by the '80s band The Police. Recent matches against the roar, had all been mostly uneventful affairs, including a 0–0 draw a couple of weeks beforehand, and it was the same again. Both sides had few chances during the 1st half, but Queensland's Brazilian import Reinaldo missed a <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> when he air-swinged a cross in the opening 10minutes.

25|$|A few Hyderabads {{fell back}} to the next {{battalion}} (Lt.Col.Cecil Deakin's 5/2nd Punjab Regiment) alerting the Punjabis to the tanks heading towards their position. Shimada lost his two leading tanks to land mines and Boys anti-tank rifles {{in front of the}} more experienced Punjabi position. The Punjabis then managed to set fire to another tank with Molotov cocktails, effectively blocking the road and leaving the Japanese column stacked up, almost bumper to bumper. If the British artillery (who were not contacted due to the communication lines being cut) had been called in {{at this point in the}} battle, Shimada's column could have been easily stopped due to their stacked up and vulnerable position, surrounded by thick jungle on the narrow road. This <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the British was lost and Shimada's infantry were able to push through Deakin's Punjabis, while the tanks found an unguarded loop road that enabled them to by-pass the destroyed tanks. The Punjabis had held Shimada until around 6 am in heavy fighting. Deakin and a handful of his remaining Punjabis managed to escape across the Slim River, but most of his battalion were mopped up by the 42nd Regiment.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary chroniclers are of {{the opinion}} that since Purandar Singha had passed his {{childhood}} through economic hardships during his father’s exile in Bengal, he was very much attracted to money and wealth. This explains the accusations which he had faced during both of his reigns. During his first reign, Purandar Singha and his father Brajanath Gohain, after being defeated by Burmese, fled to Guwahati taking all the valuables from the Royal treasury worth 3.5 million rupees, due to which the next ruler Chandrakanta Singha faced economic hardships in gathering mercenaries and maintaining the army to fight Burmese. During his second reign, as tributary prince under British, it was found that Purandar Singha was busy gathering personal wealth, instead of taking care of administration, which resulted in the growth of corruption among his officials. Some historians also stated his character as stubborn and firm from the fact that he refused to accept any pensions or grants from British Government. His son, Kameswar Singha also refused to accept pension from the British Government. Some sources said that it was actually Maniram Dewan who advised both father and son, not to accept any pension, as it might weaken their petition to restore their kingdom. After the fall of Ahom kingdom by Burmese invasion and subsequently by British occupation, Purandar Singha got an <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> to restore Ahom rule in Upper Assam, but he ruined the chance by failing to pay the annual tribute of 50,000 rupees, resulted in the annexation of his kingdom by British, putting an end of 600 years of rule by Ahom dynasty.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched {{with a large}} army {{against the}} Albanians and their leader, Skenderbeg, who had long {{resisted}} the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy. For the Albanians, {{the outbreak of the}} Ottoman–Venetian War offered a <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reassert their independence; for the Venetians, the Albanians provided a useful cover to the Venetian coastal holdings of Durazzo and Scutari. The major result of this campaign was the construction of the fortress of Elbasan, allegedly within just 25 days. This strategically sited fortress, at the lowlands {{near the end of the}} old Via Egnatia, cut Albania effectively in half, isolating Skenderbeg's base in the northern highlands from the Venetian holdings in the south. However, following the Sultan's withdrawal Skanderbeg himself spent the winter in Italy, seeking aid. On his return in early 1467, his forces sallied from the highlands, defeated Ballaban Pasha, and lifted the siege of the fortress of Croia (Krujë); they also attacked Elbasan but failed to capture it. Mehmed II responded by marching again against Albania. He energetically pursued the attacks against the Albanian strongholds, while sending detachments to raid the Venetian possessions to keep them isolated. The Ottomans failed again to take Croia, and they failed to subjugate the country. However, the winter brought an outbreak of plague, which would recur annually and sap the strength of the local resistance. Skanderbeg himself died of malaria in the Venetian stronghold of Lissus (Lezhë), ending the ability of Venice to use the Albanian lords for its own advantage. The Albanians were left to their own devices and were gradually subdued over the next decade.|$|E
