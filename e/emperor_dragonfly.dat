5|$|This motion {{camouflage}} {{strategy was}} discovered and modelled as algorithms in 1995 by M. V. Srinivasan and M. Davey {{while they were}} studying mating behaviour in hoverflies. The male hoverfly appeared to be using the tracking technique to approach prospective mates. Motion camouflage has been observed in high-speed territorial battles between dragonflies, where males of the Australian <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly,</b> Hemianax papuensis were seen to choose their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals in 6 of 15 encounters. They made use of both real-point and infinity-point strategies.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{not having}} many large {{wetlands}} dragonflies abound on Menorca. Seventeen {{species have been}} recorded including the <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|They {{frequently}} fly high up {{into the}} sky in search of prey, which includes butterflies, other Odonata and tadpoles; small prey is eaten while flying. They breed in a variety of aquatic habitats from large ponds to dykes, but they require a plentiful supply of vegetation in the water. The females lay the eggs into plants such as pondweed, and always lay alone. The larvae are very aggressive and are likely to influence the native species composition of colonized freshwater ecosystems. The adult male is highly territorial, and difficult to approach. In the summer months <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonflies</b> are frequent visitors to gardens, being especially prevalent in the southern counties of Great Britain.|$|R

50|$|The reserve {{supports}} {{large numbers}} of fly, snail, spider and beetle species. Damselflies found here include the emerald, azure, large red, red-eyed, variable and common blue; together with dragonflies such as the southern and brown hawkers, <b>emperor,</b> hairy <b>dragonfly</b> and black-tailed skimmer. The Lepidoptera fauna is very rich also, especially the moths, with over 1000 species. The nationally rare reed leopard moth is common at the site. Other local moths include cream-bordered green pea, yellow-legged clearwing and emperor. China-mark moths such as the small, brown and ringed are also seen here. Local butterflies include the green hairstreak, brown argus, speckled wood and brimstone. There are a range of freshwater and land snails including the Red Data Book species Desmoulin's whorl snail.|$|R
50|$|The <b>emperor</b> <b>{{dragonfly}}</b> or blue emperor (Anax imperator) {{is a large}} {{species of}} hawker dragonfly of the family Aeshnidae, averaging 78 mm in length.|$|E
5000|$|Anax (from Ancient Greek [...] , [...] "lord, master, king") is a genus of dragonflies in {{the family}} Aeshnidae. It {{includes}} species like the <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly,</b> Anax imperator.|$|E
50|$|A {{relatively}} {{large number of}} species of dragonfly and damselfly are recorded, as well as good populations of southern aeshna, common sympetrum and common blue damselfly. The <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly</b> visits occasionally. Patches of nettle and thistle attract many butterflies and teasel attracts brimstones and encourages goldfinches.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} lakes and three small pools frequented by dragonflies. The <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly,</b> migrant hawker, black-tailed skimmer and red-eyed {{damselfly}} are amongst other breeding species. Freshwater molluscs are represented and the site is the only known one in Gloucestershire for the tiny 'pea mussel'.|$|E
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, large red damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, small red-eyed damselfly, azure damselfly, common blue damselfly, blue-tailed damselfly, migrant hawker, southern hawker, brown hawker, <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly,</b> four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, black-tailed skimmer, keeled skimmer, common darter, ruddy darter, common hawker, Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|E
50|$|The Woorgreens {{reserve is}} {{considered}} to be the Forest of Dean's best dragonfly site, and over seventeen species have been recorded. Some of the species are scarce and breeding colonies in this area are important. They are supported by the network of other ponds and ditches in the area, such as Kensley pond. Breeding populations recorded include blue-tailed damselfly, large red damselfly, azure damselfly, southern hawker, ruddy sympetrum, broad-bodied chaser and the <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{wetlands}} and ponds in Britain have become polluted or have disappeared, leaving {{the plants and}} animals that like wet conditions with fewer places to live. The Dragonfly Pond was built to encourage dragonflies and damselflies, and many other plants and animals such as frogs, toads and newts can be found there too. In the summer months the blue and green <b>Emperor</b> <b>Dragonfly,</b> the largest dragonfly in Britain, can be found there.|$|E
50|$|Pluck Lake is a lake to {{the east}} of Swansea city centre in the Morfa area north of Kilvey Hill. It forms part of Kilvey Community Woodland. Pluck Lake, is a refuge for blue-tailed {{damselfly}} and the <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly.</b> In April 2008 a crocodile was supposedly sighted in the waters of the lake attracting some attention from the media and members from The Centre for Fortean Zoology and was nicknamed the Morfadile or Pluck Ness Monster.|$|E
50|$|It has {{the largest}} reed-bed in England and {{supports}} rare waterweeds such as the holly-leaved naiad and three rare species of stonewort. Amongst the rare insects is the swallowtail butterfly which feeds on milk-parsley (Peucedanum palustre), the Norfolk hawker Aeshna isosceles and <b>Emperor</b> <b>dragonfly.</b> Birds that visit the reserve during the winter include cranes, goldeneyes, shovelers and teals, while bitterns, marsh harriers, pochards, water rails and Cetti's warblers stay {{for most of the}} year. There is a waymarked walk around the broad.|$|E

50|$|The {{site has}} good {{views of the}} North Downs in one {{direction}} and the town of Ashford in the other as well as Boys Hall, the house that gives the site its name. The site is characterised by oak and hazel as well as other mature tree species. A variety of dragonflies and damselflies have been seen at the site including <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly,</b> ruddy darter and blue-tailed damselfly. There is a pedestrian bridge over High Speed 1, linking this site with Boys Hall Moat. Adjacent to the bridge is an area of reedbed. On the Church Road side of Boys Hall, the site is more formal with mature trees such as turkey oak, providing a pleasant buffer zone between housing and the Southern Orbital road.|$|E
5000|$|A. mixta {{is a small}} aeshna {{which appears}} dark in flight. It is similar in {{appearance}} to other aeshnas but has a characteristic [...] "golf-tee" [...] shaped mark on the second segment of the abdommen (S2) which is diagnostic. In flight {{it looks like a}} small <b>Emperor</b> <b>dragonfly</b> with a blue abdomen which, when seen from the side, curves down. The main identification problem in the field is distinguishing this species from A. affinis where the two species fly together. The markings {{on the side of the}} thorax are different in A. affinis and A. mixta. In A. affinis the sides of the thorax are greeny yellow with fine black lines along the sutures. In A. mixta the sides of the thorax are similar in colour but the yellow is separated by dark brown areas so it gives the appearance of having two broad yellow stripes.|$|E
50|$|Mammals:The {{following}} {{descriptions of}} mammals of the Ammiq wetlands {{have all been}} recorded by A Rocha personnel in the Aammiq region from 1997 onwards. The region covered includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the slopes of Mount Barouk. In addition to these, other mammal species are probably present but {{have not yet been}} positively identified. One mammal of interest is the European otter Lutra lutra which was reported in the Aammiq wetlands prior to 1975; its reappearance was confirmed in June 2003. Water buffalos were introduced to the swamp {{in order to maintain the}} health of the vegetation cover and the swamp itself, since buffalo graze wetlands in a more efficient way than other herbivores. The mammals recorded in the region include: southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), wild boar (Sus scrofa). The area was probably also the home of some extinct mammals from Lebanon such as the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), and the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus).Birds:Nearly 260 bird species have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. The Aammiq region includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the sometimes wooded rocky slopes of Mount Barouk.The listing of these birds does not give any idea of their abundance or status. While some of the birds recorded below are residents, others are passage migrants. Some of these, such as the white stork and the lesser spotted eagle, may pass over Aammiq in flocks of hundreds at a time. Other migrants fly over in far smaller numbers. Species include: pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common crane (Grus grus), rock pigeon (Columba livia).Amphibians and reptiles: The amphibians and reptiles listed below have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. As with the other species lists, the Aammiq region is here taken to include not just the valley floor wetlands, which are very rich in reptiles, but also the adjacent farmlands and the rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. Herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, is a specialised field and as yet there has been no systematic A Rocha herpetological survey of this area. Far more species are known to exist in the area than the ones reported. Species include: European green toad (Bufo viridis), Levantine frog (Rana bedriagae), Levant green lizard (Lacerta media), European worm snake (Typhlops vermicularis), Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina).Moths, butterflies, and dragonflies:As with many other groups, the moths of the Aammiq region are poorly known. The list below represents an incomplete and provisional list of species so far recorded, though the Aammiq region is rich in butterflies. A Rocha personnel recorded several new records of species since 1998 such as: Oriental marbled skipper (Carcharodus boeticus), swallowtail (Papilio machaon), scarce swallowtail (Iphiclides podalirius), false Apollo (Archon apollinus), large white (Pieris brassicae), plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), long-tailed blue (Lampides boeticus). Also the Aammiq region has a surprising diversity of dragonflies which can be divided into two groups, the Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (the insects commonly referred to as dragonflies), species include: azure damselfly (Coenagrion puella), blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura elegans), <b>emperor</b> <b>dragonfly</b> (Anax imperator), southern darter (Sympetrum meridionale), scarlet dragonfly (Crocothemis erythraea).|$|E
