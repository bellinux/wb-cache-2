5|$|In 1950 while {{teaching}} {{political science and}} serving as <b>dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> at Willamette, Hatfield began his political career by winning election to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican. He defeated six others for the seat {{at a time when}} state assembly elections were still determined by county-wide votes. He served for two terms representing Marion County and Salem in the lower chamber of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. At the time he was the youngest legislator in Oregon and still lived at his parents' home. Hatfield would teach early-morning classes and then walk {{across the street to the}} Capitol to legislate.|$|E
5|$|The Wreck {{experienced}} a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration. Since Reck Club had financially maintained {{the vehicle for}} so long and Reck Club fell under the <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>Students</b> rather than the Athletic Association, the vehicle was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987. The transaction further solidified Reck Club's responsibilities over the car but also made the car more than simply a football mascot. The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon.|$|E
5|$|The {{film crew}} {{recorded}} the students on campus, at home, {{with their friends}} and families, at medical appointments, and at transgender-related events. Some footage was recorded by the students themselves. In February 2005, the administration at Smith College prohibited the crew from continuing to film one of the documentary's subjects, Lucas Cheadle, on campus (except in his apartment). Cheadle asked the <b>dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> to reconsider, but his appeal was denied. Smith College has received considerable media attention about questions regarding transgender students.|$|E

Throughout the film, Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall to talk about his friends and give the audience advice on how to skip school. His parents believe him, though his sister Jeannie is not convinced. <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>Students</b> Edward R. Rooney suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him.

5|$|Roughly 30% of {{the student}} body belongs to a social {{fraternity}} or sorority, with additional students involved in professional, service, and honor fraternities. Many of the university's fraternities and sororities are residential, meaning they own or rent a house for their members to use; many of these houses are located on Rugby Road and the surrounding streets, just north of the university. Additionally, three social fraternities hold reserved rooms on the Lawn and the Range: Kappa Sigma in Room 46 East Lawn, Trigon Engineering Society in Room 17 West Lawn, and Pi Kappa Alpha in Room 47 West Range. Reflecting UVA's tradition of student self-governance, the system is currently governed by four Greek Councils consisting of student leaders; however, it is also overseen by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life in the university's Office of the <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>Students.</b>|$|E

25|$|The current rules {{surrounding}} {{possession of}} the bench were enacted after seniors from the class of 1966 showed the bench in chapel and were greeted by slashed tires and cut ignition wires in the parking lot. The bench was confiscated by the <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>Students</b> and mysteriously destroyed while under lock and key. A replica soon surfaced and the tradition was resurrected. Henceforth all bench activity has been limited to the junior and senior classes, the bench must remain within a one-mile (1.6km) radius of Blanchard Hall, half of the bench must be visible at all times, and the bench must be shown twice a year and never in chapel.|$|E
25|$|A student-formed {{group at}} the University of Virginia called “Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Team” (ADAPT) {{partners}} {{with a number of}} groups to promote protective drinking behavior and safe transportation options at the Foxfield Races. The group has coordinated student education programs at UVA to inform students how to minimize the risks of drinking and provide alternatives for getting home. In the past, the program has been held as a panel discussion made up of ADAPT members, the Foxfield Racing Association, local police and Alcoholic Beverage Control agents, the local commonwealth’s Attorney, the Rescue Squad, and the UVA <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>Students.</b> The Foxfield Racing Association funds a non-drinking driver program called “The Savvy Fox”.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{enriching}} aspects of student life in Río Piedras is the vast number of cultural and social events organized by the University. In addition to the usual academic conferences and lectures, there {{are a host of}} activities to choose from on any given day. Cultural Activities, run by the <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>Students,</b> is the central agency at Río Piedras that plans and sponsors major events on and off campus.

Additionally, there are indoor concerts by musical groups such as the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico, the Tuna of UPR-Río Piedras, and the voice emsambles of the campus, Coro de la Universidad de Puerto Rico (founded in 1936 by Augusto Rodríguez), and Coralia, the concert choir.|$|E
25|$|From 1909 to 1929, the {{university}} held a ban against fraternities and sororities, since Henry Marshall Tory, {{the first president}} of {{the university}}, ordered all secret societies, including Upsilon Upsilon and Pi Sigma Phi, to be disbanded. The drive to remove the ban begun in 1927, when students had formed the Athenian Club to lobby the university. During the same year, several men had formed the Rocky Mountain Goat Club, which was only official sanctioned {{due to the lack of}} any secret rituals or a written constitution. The ban on fraternities and sororities would end in 1929, with the departure of President Tory. Members of the Rocky Mountain Goat Club had later formed the nucleus of the university's first fraternities. The first fraternity was official recognized and chartered in 1930. Fraternities and sororities are recognized as student groups by the university and Students' Union and are supported by local alumni advisors, their international headquarters, and a fraternity and sorority advisor in the Office of the <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>Students.</b> In addition, the fraternities are also governed by the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council.|$|E
25|$|Between 1966 and 1968, Northwestern {{increased}} African American enrollments {{from less}} than 50 to 160. After the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, African American students on campus began expressing increasingly militant and separatist views demanding the administration increase recruitment activity and provide separate facilities for black students. After the university rejected their demands, on May 3, 1968 a group of 100 African American students identifying themselves as For Members Only and the Afro-American Student Union barricaded themselves the Bursar's Office and began a sit-in, demanding the university implement an admissions quota, increase financial aid, construct an all-black dorm and student center, create a Black Studies curriculum, and desegregate the university's real estate holdings in Evanston. In light of controversy surrounding the student protests at Columbia and Berkeley that spring, negotiations between <b>Dean</b> <b>of</b> <b>Students</b> Roland Hinz and AASU leader James Turner led to the sit-in dispersing peacefully after 38 hours. Although the administration rejected demands for racial preferences in admissions and financial aid, it made several concessions regarding desegregation, increasing student participation in policy matters, and developing a Department of African-American Studies.|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} the leadership behavior <b>of</b> the <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> {{in the four}} public universities of Kenya and their constituent colleges.

Fisher's least significant difference test, a multiple comparison procedure, was utilized to make all pairwise comparisons which were detected by the ANOVA to differ significantly from one-another among the respective mean ratings of the three groups surveyed. Twelve hypotheses were developed and tested, and the major findings included: There were significant differences among the perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> <b>students,</b> student affairs staff members, and student leaders regarding the real and ideal leadership behavior <b>of</b> the <b>deans</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> concerning initiating structure and consideration [...] the two leadership dimensions surveyed on the questionnaire...|$|R
