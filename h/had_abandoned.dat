How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an affirmation that they <b>had</b> <b>abandoned</b> their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E
