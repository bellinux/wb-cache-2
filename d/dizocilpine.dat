25|$|The S(+) and R(–) {{stereoisomers}} of ketamine bind to the <b>dizocilpine</b> {{site of the}} NMDA receptor {{with different}} affinities, the former showing approximately 2- to 3-fold greater affinity for the receptor than the latter.|$|E
25|$|Ketamine {{acts as a}} {{selective}} antagonist of the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. It binds specifically to the <b>dizocilpine</b> (MK-801) site of the NMDA receptor, near the channel pore, and is an uncompetitive antagonist. Ketamine may also interact with and inhibit the NMDAR via another allosteric site on the receptor. Its full mechanism of action is not well-understood as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline {{additionally}} {{acts as an}} antagonist or inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, the α1-adrenergic receptor, the histamine H1 and H2 receptors, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and as an agonist of the sigma σ1 receptor. It {{has also}} been shown to be a relatively weak NMDA receptor antagonist via the <b>dizocilpine</b> (MK-801)/phencyclidine (PCP) site. Amitriptyline inhibits sodium channels, L-type calcium channels, and Kv1.1, Kv7.2, and Kv7.3 voltage-gated potassium channels, and therefore acts as a sodium, calcium, and potassium channel blocker as well.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of partial agonism of the high-affinity state of the D2 receptor (and indirect/downstream activation of AMPA receptors), all of these actions are far weaker than ketamine's antagonism of the NMDA receptor (see table to the right; minimum of more than 10-fold selectivity for the NMDA receptor relative to the site with the next highest affinity). A binding study assessed ketamine at 56sites including neurotransmitter receptors and transporters and found that ketamine had Ki values of >10,000nM at all sites except the <b>dizocilpine</b> site of the NMDA receptor (Ki = 659nM), indicating a minimum of 15-fold selectivity for the NMDA receptor over any other site.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan's {{euphoric effects}} have {{sometimes}} {{been attributed to}} an increase in dopamine levels, since such an increase generally correlates with pleasurable responses to drug, as is observed with some clinical antidepressants, as well as some recreational drugs. However, the effects of dextrorphan and dextromethorphan, and other NMDA receptor antagonists, on dopamine levels is a disputed subject. Studies show that the NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine and PCP do raise dopamine levels, although other studies show that another NMDA receptor antagonist <b>dizocilpine</b> has no effect on dopamine levels. Some findings even suggest that dextromethorphan can actually counter the dopamine-increasing effect caused by morphine. Due to these conflicting results, the actual effect of dextromethorphan on dopamine levels remains undetermined.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dizocilpine</b> may be {{effective}} as a recreational drug. Little is known in this context about its effects, dosage, and risks. The high potency of <b>dizocilpine</b> makes its dosage more difficult to accurately control {{when compared to other}} similar drugs. As a result, the chances of overdosing are high. Users tend to report that the experience is not as enjoyable as other dissociative drugs, and it is often accompanied by strong auditory hallucinations. Also, <b>dizocilpine</b> is much longer-lasting than similar dissociative drugs such as ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP), and causes far worse amnesia and residual deficits in thinking, which have hindered its acceptance as a recreational drug.Several animal studies have demonstrated the addictive potential of <b>dizocilpine.</b> Rats learned to lever-press in order to obtain injections of <b>dizocilpine</b> into the nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex, however, when given a dopamine antagonist at the same time, the lever-pressing was not altered, which shows that the rewarding effect of <b>dizocilpine</b> is not dependent on dopamine. Intraperitoneal administration of <b>dizocilpine</b> also produced an enhancement in self-stimulation responding. Rhesus monkeys were trained to self-administer cocaine or phencyclidine, then were offered <b>dizocilpine</b> instead. None of the four monkeys who were used to cocaine chose to self-administer <b>dizocilpine</b> but three out of the four monkeys who had been using phencyclidine self-administered <b>dizocilpine,</b> suggesting again that <b>dizocilpine</b> has potential as a recreational drug for those seeking a dissociative anaesthetic type of experience. It was found that <b>dizocilpine</b> administration elicited conditioned place preference in animals, again demonstrating its reinforcing properties.|$|E
5000|$|As an antidepressant, {{positive}} results {{were found in}} animal models of depression. NMDA antagonists like <b>dizocilpine</b> have been shown in animal models to attenuate the hearing loss caused by aminoglycosides It is thought that aminoglycosides mimic endogenous polyamines at NMDA receptors and produce excitotoxic damage, leading to hair cell loss. Antagonizing NMDA receptors to reduce the excitotoxicity would prevent that hearing loss. <b>Dizocilpine</b> was found to block the development of kindled seizures, although {{it does not have}} any effect on completed kindled seizures. Oddly, it was discovered to decrease rabies virus production and {{is believed to be the}} first neurotransmitter antagonist to present with antiviral activity. Rat cortical neuron cells were infected with the rabies virus and those incubated with <b>dizocilpine</b> had virus produced reduced about 1000-fold. It is not known how MK-801 has this effect; the rabies virus suspension, without cells, was inoculated with <b>dizocilpine</b> and the drug failed to produce a virucidal effect, indicated that the mechanism of action is something other than direct killing of the virus. It was also tested against herpes simplex, vesicular stomatitis, poliovirus type I, and human immunodeficiency virus. It did not have activity against these other viruses, however. <b>Dizocilpine</b> was also shown to potentiate the ability of levodopa to ameliorate akinesia and muscular rigidity in a rodent model of parkinsonism. [...] When <b>dizocilpine</b> was administered to rats 15 minutes after a spinal trauma, the long-term neurological recovery of the trauma was improved. [...] However, NMDA antagonists like <b>dizocilpine</b> have largely failed to show safety in clinical trials, possibly due to inhibition of NMDA receptor function that is necessary for normal neuronal function. Since <b>dizocilpine</b> is a particularly strong NMDA receptor antagonist, this drug is particularly likely to have psychotomimetic side effects (such as hallucinations) that result from NMDA receptor blockade. <b>Dizocilpine</b> had a promising future as a neuroprotective agent until neurotoxic-like effects, called Olney's Lesions, were seen in certain brain regions of test rats. Merck, a drug company, promptly dropped development of <b>dizocilpine.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ibotenic acid is an agonist of glutamate, {{specifically}} {{at both the}} N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA and trans-ACPD receptor sites in a multiple of systems in the central nervous system.

50|$|<b>Dizocilpine,</b> {{along with}} other NMDA antagonists, induce the {{formation}} of brain lesions first discovered by John W. Olney in 1989. <b>Dizocilpine</b> leads {{to the development of}} neuronal vacuolization in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex. Other neurons in the area expressed an abnormal amount of heat shock protein as well as increased glucose metabolism in response to NMDA antagonist exposure. Vacuoles began to form within 30 minutes of a subcutaneous dose of <b>dizocilpine</b> 1 mg/kg. Neurons in this area necrotized and were accompanied by a glial response involving astrocytes and microglia.|$|E

50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>dizocilpine</b> at NMDA receptors {{are clear and}} significant. NMDA receptors are key in the {{progression}} of excitotoxicity (a process in which an excessive amount of extracellular glutamate overexcites glutamate receptors and harms neurons). Thus NMDA receptor antagonists including <b>dizocilpine</b> have been extensively studied for use in treatment of diseases with excitotoxic components, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. <b>Dizocilpine</b> has shown effectiveness in protecting neurons in cell culture and animal models of excitotoxic neurodegeneration. The administration of <b>dizocilpine</b> protected the hippocampus from ischemia-induced neurodegeneration in the gerbil. The ED50 (effective dose 50) for neuroprotection was 0.3 mg/kg {{and the majority of}} the animals were protected against the ischemia-induced damage at doses {{greater than or equal to}} 3 mg/kg, when <b>dizocilpine</b> was given one hour prior to the occlusion of the carotid arteries, although other studies have shown protection up to 24 hours post-insult. Excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate and aspartate, are released in toxic amounts when the brain is deprived of blood and oxygen and NMDA receptors are thought to prevent the neurodegeneration through the inhibition of these receptors.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dizocilpine</b> has a {{great deal}} of {{potential}} to be used in research in creating animal models of schizophrenia. Unlike dopaminergic agonists, which mimic only the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, a single injection of <b>dizocilpine</b> was successful in modelling both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Another study found that, although repeated low doses of <b>dizocilpine</b> were only successful in mimicking behavioral changes such as a slight hyperlocomotion and decreased prepulse inhibition, repeated administration of a higher dose mimicked both the above changes as well as the neurochemical alterations found in first-episode schizophrenic patients. Not only has temporary use been shown to mimic psychosis but chronic administration in laboratory animals resulted in similar neuropathological changes as in schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|Behavioural {{studies have}} shown that NMDA receptors are {{involved}} in the development of psychological dependence caused by chronic administration of morphine. <b>Dizocilpine</b> suppressed the morphine-induced rewarding effect. It is suggested that stimulating NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor and its associated kinases in the nucleus accumbens leads to the rewarding effect caused by morphine. Inhibition of this receptor and its kinases in the nucleus accumbens by co-treatment with NMDA antagonists prevents morphine-associated psychological dependence. An earlier study has shown that the prevention of morphine-associated psychological dependence was not due to state-dependency effects induced by <b>dizocilpine</b> but rather reflect the impairment of learning that is caused by NMDA antagonists. This is consistent with studies showing that <b>dizocilpine</b> potentiates the addictive potential of morphine and other drugs (see below).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dizocilpine</b> (INN), {{also known}} as MK-801, is an uncompetitive {{antagonist}} of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a glutamate receptor, discovered by a team at Merck in 1982. Glutamate is the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. The channel is normally blocked with a magnesium ion and requires depolarization of the neuron to remove the magnesium and allow the glutamate to open the channel, causing an influx of calcium, which then leads to subsequent depolarization. <b>Dizocilpine</b> binds inside the ion channel of the receptor at several of PCP's binding sites thus preventing the flow of ions, including calcium (Ca2+), through the channel. <b>Dizocilpine</b> blocks NMDA receptors in a use- and voltage-dependent manner, since the channel must open for the drug to bind inside it. [...] The drug acts as a potent anti-convulsant and likely has dissociative anesthetic properties, {{but it is not}} used clinically for this purpose due to the discovery of brain lesions, called Olney's lesions (see below), in test rats. <b>Dizocilpine</b> is also associated with a number of negative side effects, including cognitive disruption and psychotic-spectrum reactions. It also inhibited the induction of long term potentiation. Instead, the NMDA receptor pore-blocker ketamine is used as a dissociative anesthetic in human medical procedures. While ketamine may also trigger temporary psychosis in certain individuals, its short half-life and lower potency make it a much safer clinical option. However, <b>dizocilpine</b> is the most frequently used non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist in animal models to mimic psychosis for experimental purposes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dizocilpine</b> {{has also}} been found {{to act as a}} nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor antagonist. It has been shown to bind to and inhibit the serotonin and dopamine transporters as well.|$|E
50|$|Symptomatic {{treatment}} of PTX 251D poisoning include reducing the convulsions using carbamazepine. This drug targets the affected VGSCs. Phenobarbital also shows positive effects by {{interacting with the}} affected Ca2+ channels. Ineffective drugs include diazepam and <b>dizocilpine.</b>|$|E
50|$|AS-19 is a {{substance}} which {{acts as a}} potent agonist at the 5HT7 receptor, with an IC50 of 0.83nM. It reverses the amnesia induced by drugs such as scopolamine and <b>dizocilpine</b> and improves long term memory acquisition, but inhibits short term memory formation.|$|E
50|$|Psychotridine is an {{alkaloid}} {{found in}} some species of the Psychotria genus, namely Psychotria colorata, but also Psychotria forsteriana, Psychotria lyciiflora, Psychotria oleoides, and Psychotria beccarioides. Psychotridine has analgesic effects and dose-dependently inhibits <b>dizocilpine</b> binding to cortical membranes in vitro, suggesting that it acts as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Ro 04-6790 is a drug, {{developed}} by Hoffmann-La Roche, which has applications in scientific research. It {{acts as a}} potent and selective receptor antagonist for the 5-HT6 serotonin receptor subtype, {{with little or no}} affinity at other receptors. In common with other drugs of this class, Ro 04-6790 has nootropic effects in animals, and reduces the amnesia produced by memory-impairing drugs such as <b>dizocilpine</b> and scopolamine.|$|E
50|$|Ketamine and PCP were {{observed}} to produce significant similarities to schizophrenia. Ketamine produces more similar symptoms (hallucinations, withdrawal) without observed permanent effects (other than ketamine tolerance). Both arylcyclohexamines have some(uM) affinity to D2 and as triple reuptake inhibitors. PCP is representative symptomatically, but {{does appear to}} cause brain structure changes seen in schizophrenia. Although unconfirmed, <b>Dizocilpine</b> discovered by a team at Merck seems to model both {{the positive and negative}} effects in a manner very similar to schizophreniform disorders.|$|E
50|$|Phencyclidine {{and related}} {{drugs such as}} benocyclidine, tenocyclidine, ketamine, and <b>dizocilpine</b> (MK-801), {{have been shown to}} inhibit the reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters. They appear to exert their reuptake {{inhibition}} by binding to vaguely characterized allosteric sites on each of the respective monoamine transporters. Benztropine, mazindol, and vanoxerine also bind to these sites and have similar properties. In addition to their high affinity for the main site of the monoamine transporters, several competitive transporter substrates such as cocaine and indatraline have lower affinity for these allosteric sites as well.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies found}} that, like other NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists, phencyclidine {{can cause a}} kind of brain damage called Olney's lesions in rats. Studies conducted on rats showed that high doses of the NMDA receptor antagonist <b>dizocilpine</b> caused reversible vacuoles to form in certain regions of the rats' brains. All studies of Olney's lesions have only been performed on non-human animals and may not apply to humans. One unpublished study by Frank Sharp reportedly showed no damage by the NDMA antagonist, ketamine, a similar drug, far beyond recreational doses, but due to the study never having been published, its validity is controversial.|$|E

5000|$|In 1989, Olney et al. {{discovered}} that neuronal vacuolation and other cytotoxic changes ("lesions") occurred in brains of rats administered NMDA antagonists, including PCP, MK-801 (<b>dizocilpine)</b> and ketamine. [...] Examination of neurons in the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices by electron micrograph revealed apparent lytic breakdown of mitochondria {{in the large}} vacuoles which had become apparent 2 hours after administration of an NMDA antagonist. After administration of 1.0 (mg/kg sc) MK-801 to rats, these neurotoxic changes became more apparent until about 12 hours post-dose, but the morphology of most cells appeared normal by light microscope about 24 hours post-dose. With 10 (mg/kg sc) doses of MK-801, the vacuolation reaction was still visible by light microscope 48 hours post-dose. After repeated doses of the NMDA antagonists MK-801 and PCP, the vacuolation reaction appeared consistent with the reaction after a single dose, {{so there was no}} evidence of a cumulative neurotoxic effect or that the reaction proceeded to an irreversible stage with repeated doses. The lowest doses of ketamine and tiletamine that produced neurotoxic changes visible by light microscope 4 hours post dose were 40 (mg/kg sc) and 10 (mg/kg sc), respectively. The potency of the drugs in producing these neurotoxic changes corresponded with their potency as NMDA antagonists: i.e. MK-801 > PCP > tiletamine > ketamine.|$|E
50|$|In May 2016, a study {{published}} in the journal Nature determined that HNK, specifically (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, is responsible for the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in mice; administration of (2R,6R)-HNK demonstrated ketamine-type antidepressant-like effects, and preventing the metabolic conversion of ketamine into HNK blocked the antidepressant-like effects of the parent compound. As (2R,6R)-HNK, unlike ketamine, is not an NMDA receptor antagonist, and produces no dissociative or euphoric effects, it has consequently been concluded that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may in fact not be mediated via the NMDA receptor. This is tentative, as confirmation that the findings translate to humans is still needed, but it is notable that published human data show a positive association between the antidepressant responses of ketamine and plasma (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK levels. In accordance with the notion that the NMDA receptor is not responsible for the antidepressant effects of ketamine, <b>dizocilpine</b> (MK-801), which binds to and blocks the same site on the NMDA receptor that ketamine does, lacks antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, the findings would explain why other NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine, lanicemine, and traxoprodil have thus far failed to demonstrate ketamine-like antidepressant effects in human clinical trials. Instead of acting via blockade of the NMDA receptor, (2R,6R)-HNK increases activation of the AMPA receptor via a currently unknown/uncertain mechanism. The compound is now under active investigation by researchers at NIMH for potential clinical use, and is expected to mitigate the various concerns (such as abuse and dissociation) of using ketamine itself in the treatment of depression.|$|E
40|$|N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} blockade {{is thought}} to prevent the development of cocaine-induced sensitization. Moreover, when cocaine is administered daily along with <b>dizocilpine</b> infusion to previously sensitized rats, the extinction of sensitization occurs. We report here two sets of experiments: (1) Rats were infused with <b>dizocilpine</b> through a subcutaneous mini-pump (0. 1 mg/kg/day) during the induction of cocaine sensitization and, after 2 or 7 days of wash-out, were challenged with: cocaine, <b>dizocilpine</b> plus cocaine or 3 -((+/-) 2 -carboxypiperazin- 4 -yl) -propyl-L-phosphonic acid (CPP) plus cocaine. Cocaine induced stereotypy scores significantly lower than that produced by the two drug combinations. Animals infused with <b>dizocilpine</b> alone did not present stereotypies when challenged either with <b>dizocilpine</b> or with <b>dizocilpine</b> plus cocaine. (2) Rats previously sensitized to cocaine received <b>dizocilpine</b> by infusion and daily cocaine treatments for a week. During {{the first days of}} infusion, sensitization appeared to be significantly decreased, but it resumed the initial intensity on days 6 - 7. After 2 and 9 days of wash-out, the expression of sensitization could be retrieved only by <b>dizocilpine</b> plus cocaine. Two distinct forms of sensitization to cocaine thus seem to exist: one dependent on and the second independent of NMDA receptor activity...|$|E
40|$|Drugs with {{multiple}} actions can have complex discriminative-stimulus properties. An approach to studying such drugs is to train subjects to discriminate among drug combinations and individual {{drugs in the}} combination so {{that all of the}} complex discriminative stimuli are present during training. In the current experiments, a four-choice procedure was used to train pigeons to discriminate among <b>dizocilpine</b> (noncompetitive NMDA receptor blocker), pentobarbital (GABAA receptor agonist), a fixed-dose combination of these two drugs, and saline. Following extended training, low doses of pentobarbital or <b>dizocilpine</b> administered alone produced saline-appropriate responding. Higher doses of pentobarbital produced responding on the pentobarbital-appropriate key and higher doses of <b>dizocilpine</b> produced responding on the <b>dizocilpine</b> key. Administering the lowest doses of pentobarbital and <b>dizocilpine</b> together resulted in responding on the saline-appropriate key. Increasing the dose of pentobarbital in the presence of low doses of <b>dizocilpine</b> produced responding primarily on the pentobarbital-appropriate key; increasing the dose of <b>dizocilpine</b> {{in the presence of the}} lowest dose of pentobarbital produced responding primarily on the dizocilpine-appropriate key.

40|$|Previously we {{described}} the antinociceptive effect of magnesium sulfate and <b>dizocilpine</b> (MK- 801) in the visceral and somatic rat models of pain. In the somatic model of pain, we established {{the influence of}} selective inhibitors of neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase on the antihyperalgesic effects of magnesium sulfate and <b>dizocilpine.</b> Therefore, {{the objective of the}} present study was to determine in the rat model of visceral pain whether same mechanisms are involved in the antinociceptive action of magnesium sulfate and <b>dizocilpine.</b> Analgesic activity was assessed using the acetic acid-induced writhing test in rats. Subcutaneous injection of either magnesium sulfate (15 mg/kg) or <b>dizocilpine</b> (0. 01 mg/kg) decreased the number of writhes by about 60 and 70 %, respectively. The role of nitric oxide on the effects of magnesium sulfate and <b>dizocilpine</b> was evaluated using selective inhibitor of neuronal [N-ω-Propyl-L-arginine hydrochloride (L-NPA) ] and inducible [S-methylisothiourea (SMT) ] nitric oxide synthase, which per se did not affect the number of writhes. We observed that the antinociceptive effect of magnesium sulfate or <b>dizocilpine</b> did not change in the presence of L-NPA (2 and 10 mg/kg, i. p.) and SMT (0. 015 and 10 mg/kg, i. p.).

40|$|Glutamate antagonists {{limit the}} growth of human cancers in vitro. The {{mechanism}} of anticancer action of NMDA antagonists is not known, however. In this article, we report that the NMDA antagonist <b>dizocilpine</b> inhibits the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 pathway, an intracellular signaling cascade that is activated by growth factors and controls the proliferation of cancer cells. <b>Dizocilpine</b> reduces the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein, suppresses the expression of cyclin D 1, up-regulates the cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressor proteins p 21 and p 53, and increases the number of lung adenocarcinoma cells in the G 2 and S phases of the cell cycle. Silencing of the tumor suppressor protein p 21 abolishes antiproliferative action of <b>dizocilpine.</b> Consistent with inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 -signaling cascade, <b>dizocilpine</b> reverses the stimulation of proliferation induced by epidermal, insulin, and basic fibroblast growth factors in lung adenocarcinoma cells.

40|$|Although the dissociative {{anesthetic}} <b>dizocilpine</b> [(1) -MK- 801] inhibits nicotinic {{acetylcholine receptor}} (AChR) function in a noncompetitive manner, {{the location of the}} <b>dizocilpine</b> binding site(s) has yet to be clearly established. Thus, to characterize the binding site for <b>dizocilpine</b> on the AChR we examined 1) the dissociation constant (Kd) and stoichiometry of [3 H]dizocilpine binding; 2) the displacement of <b>dizocilpine</b> radioligand binding by noncompetitive inhibitors (NCIs) and conversely <b>dizocilpine</b> displacement of fluorescent and radiolabeled NCIs from their respective high-affinity binding sites on the AChR; and 3) pho-toaffinity labeling of the AChR using 125 I-dizocilpine. The results establish that one high-affinity (Kd 5 4. 8 mM) and several (3 – 6) low-affinity (Kd 5; 140 mM) binding sites exist for <b>dizocilpine</b> on the desensitized and resting AChR, respectively. The bind-ing of the fluorescent NCIs ethidium, quinacrine, and crystal violet as well as [3 H]thienylcyclohexylpiperidine was inhibited by <b>dizocilpine</b> on desensitized AChRs. However, Schild-type analyses indicate that only the inhibition of quinacrine in the desensitized state seems to be mediated by a mutually exclu-sive action. Photoaffinity labeling of the AChR by 125 I-dizo-cilpine was primarily restricted to the a 1 subunit and subse-quent mapping revealed that the principal sites of labeling are localized to the M 4 (; 70 %) and M 1 (30 %) transmembrane domains. Collectively, the data indicate that the high-affinity <b>dizocilpine</b> binding site is not located in the lumen of the ion channel but probably near the quinacrine binding locus at a nonluminal domain in the AChR desensitized state. The muscle-type {{nicotinic acetylcholine receptor}} (AChR) is the archetype of the ligand-gated ion channel receptor super-family.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} and compared {{the role of}} mesoaccumbens dopamine and the ventral pallidal region in the locomotor stimulatory action of the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist <b>dizocilpine</b> maleate and dopamine agonists. Intra-accumbens injections of both amphetamine (1, 5 and 25 nmol) and <b>dizocilpine</b> maleate (1, 5, 25 and 50 nmol) induced a dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity. The N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist was somewhat less effective than amphetamine. 6 -Hydroxydopamine dopamine-depleting lesions of the nucleus accumbens completely blocked locomotor stimulation induced by focal administrations of amphetamine (5 nmol), but were ineffective in altering the actions of <b>dizocilpine</b> maleate (50 nmol). Ibotenic acid lesions of the ventral pallidal region and muscimol injections into this area also prevented the stimulatory effects of systemic amphetamine (1 mg/kg), while having {{no effect on the}} locomotor-activating actions of systemic <b>dizocilpine</b> maleate (0. 3 mg/kg). Microdialysis studies revealed that systemically administered apomorphine (2 mg/kg) significantly decreased extracellular GABA in the pallidum, which was accompanied by substantial increases in locomotor output. Systemically administered <b>dizocilpine</b> maleate (0. 3 mg/kg), on the other hand, also increased locomotor activity without having any effect on pallidal GABA. These data, taken together, indicate that while the locomotor effects of dopamine agonists are dependent upon intact mesoaccumbens dopamine and involve GABAergic efferents from the nucleus accumbens to the ventral pallidum, <b>dizocilpine</b> maleate's stimulatory actions are independent of such mechanisms...|$|E
