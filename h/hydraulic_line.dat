5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{fire was}} caused by failure of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> which powered a {{conveyor}} belt supplying the cooker vat. When the original line developed a leak, a worker originally replaced it with new line and with new connections. Later the line, which was too long and created a tripping hazard, was shortened, {{but in the process}} the worker replaced the new end connector with the old fitting.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} rated to 3,000 psi (20,700kPa), while normal {{operating}} pressure never fluctuated higher than 1,500 psi (10,300kPa). When the line with a customized connector was brought up to {{normal operating pressure}}, it separated from the connector at between 800 and 1,500 psi (5,500–10,300kPa). Hydraulic fluid spattered onto the heating lines for the cooker and immediately vaporized. This vapor then went directly into the flame of the gas-fired cooker. The vapor had a relatively low flash point and erupted into a fireball. The ruptured <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> then pumped 50 to 55 US gallons (40–45imp.gal/190–210L) of hydraulic fluid into the fire before electrical failure shut it down.|$|E
25|$|In 1920 the French {{automobile}} and aircraft pioneer Gabriel Voisin experimented with systems that modulated the hydraulic braking pressure on his aircraft brakes {{to reduce the}} risk of tire slippage. These systems use a flywheel and valve attached to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> that feeds the brake cylinders. The flywheel is attached to a drum that runs at the same speed as the wheel. In normal braking, the drum and flywheel should spin at the same speed. However, when a wheel slows down, then the drum would do the same, leaving the flywheel spinning at a faster rate. This causes the valve to open, allowing a small amount of brake fluid to bypass the master cylinder into a local reservoir, lowering the pressure on the cylinder and releasing the brakes. The use of the drum and flywheel meant the valve only opened when the wheel was turning. In testing, a 30% improvement in braking performance was noted, because the pilots immediately applied full brakes instead of slowly increasing pressure in order to find the skid point. An additional benefit was the elimination of burned or burst tires.|$|E

500|$|During a {{training}} mission, an F-22 {{crashed to the}} east of Tyndall AFB, on 15 November 2012. The pilot ejected safely and no injuries were reported on the ground.

500|$|On {{the same}} day that the sealed {{atmosphere}} experiment was terminated, 24 April 1960, Triton experienced a major equipment failure. [...] In the after torpedo room, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> to the stern plane mechanism burst. [...] Through the prompt action by Torpedoman's Mate Third Class Allen W. Steele, aided by Engineman Third Class Arlan F. Martin, this potentially catastrophic event was successfully contained. Eventually, the main hydraulic system was restored with a control valve from the steering system, but the boat's steering controls remained on emergency mode {{for the rest of the}} voyage. It was subsequently determined that the pipe burst was caused by a fractured valve. [...] For his quick and decisive actions in handling this emergency, Steele was presented the Navy Commendation Medal.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 December 2000, a V-22 had {{a flight}} control error and crashed near Jacksonville, North Carolina, killing all four aboard. [...] A vibration-induced [...] from an {{adjacent}} wiring bundle caused a leak in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> which fed the primary side of the swashplate actuators {{to the right side}} rotor blade controls. [...] The leak caused a Primary Flight Control System (PFCS) alert. [...] A previously undiscovered error in the aircraft's control software caused it to decelerate in response to each of the pilot's eight attempts to reset the software {{as a result of the}} PFCS alert. The uncontrollable aircraft fell [...] and crashed in a forest. [...] The wiring harnesses and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> routing in the nacelles were subsequently modified. [...] This caused the Marine Corps to ground its fleet of eight V-22s, the second grounding in 2000.|$|E

2500|$|A brake {{overheat}} warning system should have warned the crew. However, [...] a brake {{overheat warning}} system was not required {{on the type of}} the aircraft, so the crew of Flight 420 did not know that a fire had developed.

2500|$|Some older designs, {{like the}} AMP and Mountain Cycles brakes, use a cable from lever to caliper, {{then use a}} master {{cylinder}} integrated into the piston.

[...] Likely cause was a ruptured <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> which led to [...] "hydraulic misting", and was ignited by an electrical source. [...] The fire was not detected by the crew in flight since {{it was more than}} 100 feet behind the nearest crew member and in an enclosed area. [...] The fire was not detected until after the aircraft had landed. [...] The captain declared an emergency with the Travis Ground Control, executed emergency shutdown procedures, and ordered an evacuation. [...] The fire continued to rage for almost an hour until it was extinguished by the fire department. The aircraft was later repaired but not used again for cargo flights.

2500|$|Longliners – use {{one or more}} long heavy fishing {{lines with}} a series of {{hundreds}} or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Hand operated longlining can be operated from boats of any size. The number of hooks and lines [...] handled depends on the size of vessel, the number of crew, and the level of mechanisation. Large purpose built longliners can be designed for single species fisheries such as tuna. On such larger vessels the bridge is usually placed aft, and the gear is hauled from the bow or from the side with mechanical or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>line</b> haulers. The lines are set over the stern. Automatic or semi-automatic systems are used to bait hooks and shoot and haul lines. These systems include rail rollers, line haulers, hook separators, dehookers and hook cleaners, and storage racks or drums. To avoid incidental catches of seabirds, an outboard setting funnel is used to guide the line from the setting position on the stern down to a depth of one or two metres. Small scale longliners handle the gear by hand. The line is stored into baskets or tubs, perhaps using a hand cranked line drum.|$|E

40|$|Experience {{has shown}} {{that one of the}} least {{reliable}} parts of an aircraft is the flight control system. The high pressure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lines</b> running throughout the aircraft often fail, resulting in loss of control. A new approach to aircraft controls would be to eliminate the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lines</b> and relocate the necessary hydraulic pumps, motors, reservoirs, etc., where they are needed. This approach requires that concentrated energy sources be located in relatively confined areas, resulting in operating temperatures much higher than previously experienced. This project is an analysis and evaluation of the thermal characteristics of this approach to aircraft flight controls. The results of this analysis shows that the most severe thermal conditions will cause the system operating temperature to rise to approximately 343 ??F, when using this new approach. It is necessary-to incorporate a cooling fan/heat exchanger to maintain satisfactory operating temperatures in normal operating conditions...|$|R
