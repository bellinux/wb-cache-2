5000|$|The <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Company Building is a {{historic}} structure located in Grinnell, Iowa, United States. [...] "The Iowa <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Association was the first statewide organization {{of its kind in}} the United States." [...] When it moved to Grinnell from Jefferson, Iowa in 1934 its name was changed to <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Company. It was still a relatively small operation at the time that required only simple rented upstairs quarters. The present building was first occupied in 1951, but only the first two floors were built. The top two floors were completed in 1957, and gave the building its present form. The company rented out the first floor to other commercial businesses. <b>Farmers</b> <b>Mutual</b> Reinsurance Company moved out of building in 1962 to a larger complex south of Grinnell, and at that time became known as the Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company. This building was sold to the General Telephone Company, which occupied the whole building until 1968.

40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>Loan</b> Guarantee Societies (MLGSs) {{are crucial}} players in credit markets of many European and non-European countries. In this paper we provide a theory to {{rationalize}} the raison d'e'tre of MLGSs. The basic intuition {{is that the}} foundation for MLGSs lies in the inefficiencies created by adverse selection, when borrowers {{do not have enough}} collateralizable wealth to satisfy collateral requirements and induce self-selecting contracts. In this setting, we view MLGSs as a wealth pooling mechanism that allows otherwise inefficiently rationed borrowers to obtain credit. We focus on the case of large, complex urban economies where potential entrepreneurs are numerous and possess no more information about each other than do banks. Despite our extreme assumption on information availability, we show that MLGSs can be characterized by assortative matching in which only safe borrowers have an incentive to join the mutual society. In the last section, we show that the available evidence on the structure and performance of MLGSs active in Italy is consistent with some implications of our theory concerning their diffusion, the average number of their associates and the average default rate on guaranteed loans in developed and backward regions. group information, <b>mutual</b> <b>loan</b> guarantee society, small business lending...|$|R
