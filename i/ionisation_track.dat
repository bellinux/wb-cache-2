50|$|There are {{numerous}} experiments worldwide attempting {{to detect the}} energy deposition {{that is expected to}} occur when a WIMP directly collides with an atom of ordinary matter. Ultra sensitive experiments are required to detect the low energy and extremely rare interaction that is predicted to occur between a WIMP and the nucleus of an atom in a target material. The DRIFT detectors vary from the majority of WIMP detectors in their use of a low pressure gas as a target material. The low pressure gas means that an interaction within the detector causes an <b>ionisation</b> <b>track</b> of measurable length compared to the point like interactions seen in detectors with solid or liquid target materials. Such ionisation tracks can be reconstructed in three dimensions to determine not only the type of particle that caused it, but from which direction the particle came. This directional sensitivity has the potential to prove the existence of WIMPs by their distinct directional signature.|$|E

It is also of relevance for understanding the moderation process of mu(+) in van der Waals solids like s-Ne, s-Ar or s-N- 2, which are the most suitable materials to generate epithermal mu(+) serving as a source for low-energy mu(+) (LE-mu(+)) beams. The LE-mu(+) beam at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) allows us to study the formation of Mu at low implantation energies (0. 5 - 30 keV) in insulators and semiconductors. These investigations may help to clarify the interaction between the mu(+) and the electrons of its <b>ionisation</b> <b>track</b> since the number of track electrons can be tuned by varying the implantation energy. We present the first results of LE-muSR investigations on thin van der Waals solids (s-Ar, s-Xe), fused quartz (SUPRASIL) and a quartz crystal, where the mu(+) and Mu fractions were measured as a function of the implantation energy.

40|$|The {{relative}} biological effectiveness (RBE) is {{an important}} parameter in heavy ion treatment planning. It {{is well known that}} the RBE does not only depend on the LET of a particle, but also on the ion sort [...] This {{can be explained by the}} difference in the local ionisation distribution for different kind of ions, expressed by LET and radial ionisation distribution. Our goal is to measure these parameters with high spatial resolution and compare the results with track structure data obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of Krämer [1]. The experimental method is based on a time projection chamber with optical readout (Optical Avalanche Chamber, OPAC). OPAC is able to measure the spatial ionisation pattern of a particle crossing the interaction volume. The chamber is operated with triethylamine (TEA) vapour at a pressure of typically 10 hPa. A description of the experimental setup can be found in [2, 3]. During the last year the detection system was modified for the experiments with heavy ions at the GSIfacilities. The data acquisition system had to be upgraded and the intensity dynamic of the recorded image was improved to 11 bit (instead of previously 8 bit). A new gating system of the image intensifier allows for selective capture of images from small slices of the 3 -dimensional <b>ionisation</b> <b>track</b> in the interaction volume. In summer 2002 measurements were performed at SIS at GSI with C-ions. Starting with an initial ion energy of 400 MeV/u tracks of carbon ions traversing the chamber parallel to the projection plane were recorded. By means of an adjustable water column the beam energy was stepwis...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the high}} LET and dense <b>ionisation</b> <b>tracks</b> {{associated}} with ions, microdosimetric approaches {{have been used in}} carbon ion therapy to assess field quality and calculate radiobiological quantities for a variety of cell lines.

Acetone, can also be used in radiobiology, as a radiosensitizer since the presence of ketones may modify the structures of DNA bases, which are sensitive to lowenergy interactions along <b>ionisation</b> <b>tracks</b> [2]. Electron interactions with organic compounds, such as acetone, are a powerful tool to determine elastic and inelastic differential cross sections, which can be used as input data in radiotherapy dose planning [3]. As such, in this joint theoretical and experimental study, we present comprehensive elastic differential cross sections for electron scattering from acetone in the 7 to 50 eV energy electron in the angular range 15 to 90 °. The experimental measurements have been obtained in an highresolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS) setup [7], while the theoretical calculations have been performed by the Independent Atom Model-Screening Corrected Additivity Rule (IAMSCAR) [4] and Schwinger Multichannel Methods [5, 6].

40|$|An {{integrated}} radiobiological {{model has}} been developed in this thesis using the Monte Carlo toolkit “Geant 4 ” to produce a radiobiological modelling software package. The result is a simulation capable of: (a) growing a simulated 3 D cell structure (i. e. tumour or mammalian tissue) composed of individual cells (with accurate chemical composition and geometry), (b) irradiating the cells and recording the microdosimetric track structure in each cell, (c) clustering spatially correlated ionisation events into DNA double strand breaks and then (d) predicting the likelihood that any given cell will survive. The novelty of this model {{is its ability to}} predict both the microscopic and macroscopic outcome of radiobiology experiments while varying input parameters such as cell line, radiation type, tumour geometry, dose etc. Previous research in this area has been limited to simple water volumes as representations of cells and none have been combined into an integrated radiobiological model. Model Development Cellular Growth Model The cellular growth model consists of two parts. The first part is a geometrical and chemical description of a single cell. The second is a cellular growth model describing the growth kinetics of a group of cells. When combined, they form a simulated macroscopic cell mass composed of individual microscopic cells. A template was first designed within Geant 4 for a single cell containing properties such as cell size, nucleus dimensions, and cytoplasm composition. Cellular dimensions and composition were obtained from previous publications. The cellular growth model is a mathematical model which attempts to replicate the growth characteristics of either regular or cancerous cells. The code populates a volume of specified dimension and shape with cells of random dimension, rotation and position governed by the characteristics of a given cell line. A general requirement for Geant 4 simulations is a non-overlapping geometry. A custom algorithm was developed in the current work to ensure that the cells in the tumour geometry did not overlap before importing into Geant 4. The time required to “grow” a tumour using this code is proportional to the number of cells in the volume. The time to produce a tumour containing approximately 10 ⁵ cells is typically less than 1 hour. However, the time required to complete the irradiation stage of the code is strongly dependant on the number of cells in the tumour. To produce results in a reasonable amount of time, we were limited to using tumours containing less than 10 ⁴ cells. The position, rotation and size of each tumour were then exported to a file in a format which could be imported by our custom Geant 4 simulation. Cellular Irradiation A method called parameterisation was used inside Geant 4 to combine the single cell structure and the spatial properties of the cells (generated by the cellular growth model) to produce a cellular mass which can be irradiated virtually. To our knowledge, Geant 4 has not been used to simulate particle interactions in such a large number of complex volumes. This achievement {{is the result of the}} efficiency of the unique parameterisation code developed in this thesis. The Geant 4 particle tracking tool kit enables the cells to be irradiated with different types of radiation (such as protons, electrons, photons) and records the positions of the ionisation damage in each cell. For high LET radiation (such as heavy ions), the primary cell damage mechanism is direct ionisation damage. By recording the position and energy deposited in each ionisation event, the probability of a cell surviving or dying can be calculated. The first two stages of the code were tested by predicting and quantifying the radiosensitisation effect of cells by gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles were introduced into the cellular geometries and the frequency of ionisation effects within the cells was measured. It was determined that the radiosensitisation effect of gold nanoparticles is proportional to the concentration of gold within the cell, inversely proportional to the energy of the incident photon and strongly dependant on position within the cell. When the cells were irradiated with 80 kVp x-rays, the damage to the cells was determined to be approximately 10 times that of cells irradiated without gold nanoparticles. When a typical 6 MV linear accelerator x-ray beam was used to irradiate the cells, the damage to the cells was only 1. 2 times higher that measured without gold nanoparticles. These results suggest that the primary dose enhancement effect is the result of the increase in photoelectric cross section caused by the local increase in the effective atomic number within the cell. Ionisation Clustering In order to predict the biological damage to the cells, the ionisation damage calculated in the previous two stages of the code needed to be clustered into DNA strand breakages. To cluster the ionisation events into double strand breaks, a hierarchical clustering algorithm was developed. Ionisation events are clustered into a DSB if the Euclidean distance from the centre of the DSB centroid ("centre of mass" of the cluster) is less than 3. 4 nm (length of 10 base pairs in DNA). A DSB is defined to be “simple” if the cluster contains two ionisation events. A DSB is “complex” if it contains three or more ionisation events. In typical radiotherapy treatments, several grays of radiation dose are delivered. Microscopically, this corresponds to billions or trillions of individual ionisation events. When simulated computationally, this has obvious storage and processing issues. The effects of this problem were minimised by considering only a small volume of cells (< 10 ³ cells). Even with such a small number of cells, the total number of ionisation events to process was in excess of 10 ⁷. In terms of computational time, this section of the code is highly efficient but at the expense of system resources. The large system RAM requirements mean that the code can only be executed on a 64 bit processor in its current form. DNA Repair Model The basis for the DNA repair model in the current work is the two lesion kinetics (TLK) model. In the current work we have expanded on the TLK model and implemented it as a method of describing the repair of the ionisation damages produced in Geant 4. The most notable improvement lies in implementing the model on a cell by cell basis instead of modelling the repair kinetics as an average of all cells in the volume (e. g. a tumour). The DNA repair model was calibrated and tested using experimental data for V 79 Chinese hamster cells irradiated with 0. 76 and 1. 9 MeV proton radiation. Once calibrated, the experimental and calculated values for cell survival were in good agreement (< 7 % difference). Cross Section Verification The validity and accuracy of the Geant 4 cross sectional data was tested by comparing simulated and experimental data. Geant 4 has been shown to be able to simulate radiation interactions of very low energy particles (to approximately ~ 1 eV (debated)). However, our investigation (and previous publications) has shown differences of up to ± 30 % (between simulated and experimental data) in the differential cross section of electrons and protons at energies below 100 eV. Our investigation also revealed a similar discrepancy with other comparable Monte Carlo packages including PARTRAC and RITRACKS. However, within the energy range we have investigated throughout this research, there is good agreement between both experimental data and data predicted by other MC packages. Effect of Indirect Radiation Damages on Cellular Survival To investigate the contribution from indirect damages in our previous studies, a MC software package called RITRACKS was used which is capable of simulating the production yields of free radical species due to the physical interactions of ionising radiation in water. Utilising the clustering algorithm and DNA repair model from our previous Geant 4 investigation, we attempted to quantify the cellular lethality of direct and indirect radiation damages. Our study has shown that for particles with LET ~ 1000 keV/μm (50 MeV/amu ⁵⁶Fe ions, the contribution to DNA damage from indirect damages is still approximately 50 %. Conclusion A comprehensive radiobiological simulation has been developed capable of predicting the complex <b>ionisation</b> <b>track</b> structure of ionising radiation (e. g. photons, protons and carbon ions) through individual cells. Subsequently, predicting the biological outcome within individual cells by tracking the formation and repair of DNA strand breaks.

40|$|The biggest {{question}} in astrophysics and cosmology today is identifying {{the composition of}} the Universe. Approximately 25 % is thought to be comprised of dark matter, particles that lie outside of the standard model of particle physics and have such a low cross section that they have to date evaded detection despite the substantial indirect observational evidence. DRIFT-II is one of about two dozen experiments designed to directly detect dark matter in the laboratory. Dark matter particles, through an elastic nuclear recoil, should create <b>ionisation</b> <b>tracks</b> in the detector. A positive signal would be the identification of a number of dark matter events that have an anisotropic distribution of recoil directions peaked in the direction of solar motion. The work presented here is a detailed analysis of the data from the DRIFT-lIb experiment and includes event discrimination and techniques for two and three dimensional track reconstruction. The expected dark matter event rate given the latest experimental results is calculated for this particular experiment with a result of 8. 6. 10 - 3 events per kgÃ‚Â·day. The lower energy resolution limit of the detector is measured as 1. 23 keV for an electron recoil and 3. 46 keV for a sulphur nucleus recoil. Simulations of the particle interactions expected in the detector are performed and applied to experimental data. A full analysis of the directional sensitivity of the detector is also presented.
