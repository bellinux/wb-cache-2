5|$|Four {{days later}} on 21 August at 08:30, Orizaba, {{traveling}} with Siboney, spotted a submarine {{in the act}} of submerging. Orizaba attempted to ram the sub and dropped depth charges, but there was no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attack was successful.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} of {{the chest}} wall is commonly among the first signs to appear that barotrauma, damage caused by excessive pressure, has occurred, {{and it is an}} <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lung was subjected to significant barotrauma. Thus the phenomenon may occur in diving injuries.|$|E

5|$|During {{the initial}} investigation, police had noted {{undisturbed}} human excrement {{in the elevator}} shaft, which Conley said he had left there before the murder. Use of the elevator on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> elevator {{could not have been}} used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.|$|E
5|$|Eva Longoria was {{announced}} {{as an executive}} producer on March 26. She had worked previously with Cherry on Desperate Housewives, and was hired to add perspective to the Latina roles. ABC Studios gave Cherry permission to start making senior staffing offers for the show on May 1, which was perceived as an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show would be picked up.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2009, a posting on the 4chan /b/ {{board said}} there would be a school {{shooting}} at St Eskils Gymnasium in Eskilstuna, Sweden, leading 1250 students and 50 teachers to be evacuated. A 21-year-old man was arrested after 4chan provided the police with the IP address of the poster. Police said that the suspect called it off as a joke, and they released him after they found no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> threat was serious.|$|E

5|$|The killer murders another woman, {{disposing}} {{of the body}} in a post office's dead letter office. Investigating, Black finds a human hair with a message etched into it—"hair today, gone tomorrow"—which he takes as an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as insignificant. Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E
5|$|There was no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems {{emergency}} parachute, {{designed to}} bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under visual flight rules (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before it hit the building.|$|E
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, and this may be an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, there is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such {{a small percentage of the}} electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
5|$|Breathing quality gases do not {{normally}} deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminium cylinders. Provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion, the stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within the allowed working range for the cylinder, usually below 65°C. If {{there is any}} doubt, a check of oxygen fraction will indicate whether the gas has changed (the other components are inert). Any unusual smells would be an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cylinder or gas was contaminated {{at the time of}} filling. However some authorities recommend releasing most of the contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of the shapes and sizes of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E

5|$|Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, {{in command}} of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm's arrival, knew by June 23 that a major British {{offensive}} was about to begin. He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie (part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders) on June 10, expecting him to return; {{the fact that the}} British held him was an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the British camp. Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th century on, the {{crossbow}} (called , tzangra in Greek) {{became increasingly}} important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made infrequent use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the land walls of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E

5|$|Kristen LaMoreaux, {{another student}} of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the {{emplacement}} of trachyte lava flows and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness {{may or may not}} be an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world, with a high population growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also burdened with high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045km2 (226,659sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism, the country {{is considered one of the}} world's most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September28, reports {{indicated}} that Juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal Category1 hurricane. Weather broadcasts {{up to that time}} gave every <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> storm would weaken prior to landfall. By 6 p.m. ADT (2100 UTC), additional warnings had been issued since Juan was expected to make landfall as a strong Category1 or weak Category2 hurricane. Most businesses in the areas affected were closed on Sundays, which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute. Although no large-scale evacuations were made, local evacuations for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of September 28. In all, several hundred people were affected by these evacuations. Utility workers also stood on standby before the storm hit, preparing for large-scale power outages.|$|E
