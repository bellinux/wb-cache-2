There is a stream or gully near: and {{now for the first}} time you can see clear sunshine through the stems; and see, too, something of the bank of foliage on the other side of the brook. You catch sight, it may be, of the head of a tree aloft, blazing with <b>golden</b> <b>trumpet</b> flowers, which is a Poui; and of another lower one covered with hoar-frost, perhaps a Croton; {137c} and of another, a giant covered with purple tassels. That is an Angelim. Another giant overtops even him.

60|$|The first curiosity had languished in {{the course}} of the long delay, but it was revived in its strongest force when the book itself appeared. A {{remarkable}} effect instantly followed. Before the Reflections was published the predominant sentiment in England had been one of mixed astonishment and sympathy. Pitt had expressed this common mood both in the House of Commons and in private. It was impossible for England not to be amazed at the uprising of a nation whom they had been accustomed to think of as willing slaves, and it was impossible for her, when the scene did not happen to be the American colonies or Ireland, not to profess good wishes for the cause of emancipation all over the world. Apart from the natural admiration of a free people for a neighbour struggling to be free, England saw no reason to lament a blow to a sovereign and a government who had interfered on the side of her insurgent colonies. To this easy state of mind Burke's book put an immediate end. At once, as contemporaries assure us, it divided the nation into two parties. On both sides it precipitated opinion. With a long-resounding blast on his <b>golden</b> <b>trumpet</b> Burke had unfurled a new flag, and half the nation hurried to rally to it--that half which had scouted his views on America, which had bitterly disliked his plan of Economic Reform, which had mocked his ideas on religious toleration, and which a moment before had hated and reviled him beyond all men living for his fierce tenacity in the impeachment of Warren Hastings. The king said to everybody who came near him that the book was a good book, a very good book, and every gentleman ought to read it. The universities began to think of offering the scarlet gown of their most honourable degree to the assailant of Price and the Dissenters. The great army of the indolent good, the people who lead excellent lives and never use their reason, took violent alarm. The timorous, the weak-minded, the bigoted, were suddenly awakened to a sense of what they owed to themselves. Burke gave them the key which enabled them to interpret the Revolution in harmony with their usual ideas and their temperament.|$|E

[...] High on the first, the mighty Homer shone;[78] [...] Eternal adamant composed his throne; [...] Father of verse! in holy fillets drest, [...] His silver beard waved gently o'er his breast; [...] 185 [...] Though blind, a boldness in his looks appears; [...] In years he seemed, but not impaired by years. [...] The wars of Troy were round the pillar seen: [...] Here fierce Tydides wounds the Cyprian queen; [...] Here Hector, glorious from Patroclus' fall, [...] 190 [...] Here dragged in triumph round the Trojan wall:[79] [...] Motion and life did ev'ry part inspire, [...] Bold was the work, and proved the master's fire; [...] A strong expression most he seemed t' affect, [...] And here and there disclosed a brave neglect. [...] 195 [...] A golden column next in rank appear'd, [...] On which a shrine of purest gold was rear'd; [...] Finished the whole, and laboured ev'ry part, [...] With patient touches of unwearied art: [...] The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate, [...] 200 [...] Composed his posture, and his looks sedate;[80] [...] On Homer still he fixed a rev'rent eye, [...] Great without pride, in modest majesty.[81] [...] In living sculpture[82] on the sides were spread [...] The Latian wars, and haughty Turnus dead; [...] 205 [...] Eliza stretched upon the fun'ral pyre, [...] Ãneas bending with his aged sire: [...] Troy flamed in burning gold, and o'er the throne [...] "Arms and the man" [...] in golden ciphers shone. [...] Four swans sustain a car of silver bright,[83] [...] 210 [...] With heads advanced, and pinions stretched for flight:[84] [...] Here, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode, [...] And seem'd to labour with th' inspiring god. [...] Across the harp a careless hand he flings, [...] And boldly sinks into the sounding strings.[85] [...] 215 [...] The figured games of Greece the column grace, [...] Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race. [...] The youths hang o'er the chariots as they run; [...] The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone; [...] The champions in distorted postures threat,[86] [...] 220 [...] And all appeared irregularly great. [...] Here happy Horace tuned th' Ausonian lyre [...] To sweeter sounds, and tempered Pindar's fire: [...] Pleased with AleÃ¦us' manly rage t'infuse [...] The softer spirit of the Sapphic muse.[87] [...] 225 [...] The polished pillar diff'rent sculptures grace; [...] A work outlasting monumental brass. [...] Here smiling loves and bacchanals appear, [...] The Julian star,[88] and great Augustus here. [...] The doves that round the infant poet spread [...] 230 [...] Myrtles and bays, hung hov'ring o'er his head. [...] Here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light, [...] Sat fixed in thought the mighty Stagirite; [...] His sacred head a radiant zodiac crowned,[89] [...] And various animals his sides surround;[90] [...] 235 [...] His piercing eyes, erect, appear to view [...] Superior worlds,[91] and look all nature through. [...] With equal rays immortal Tully shone, [...] The Roman rostra decked the consul's throne: [...] Gath'ring his flowing robe, he seemed to stand [...] 240 [...] In act to speak, and graceful stretched his hand.[92] [...] Behind, Rome's genius waits with civic crowns, [...] And the great father of his country owns. [...] These massy columns in a circle rise, [...] O'er which a pompous dome invades the skies:[93] [...] 245 [...] Scarce to the top I stretched my aching sight, [...] So large it spread, and swelled to such a height. [...] Full in the midst proud Fame's imperial seat[94] [...] With jewels blazed, magnificently great; [...] The vivid em'ralds there revive the eye, [...] 250 [...] The flaming rubies show their sanguine dye, [...] Bright azure rays from lively sapphires stream, [...] And lucid amber casts a golden gleam. [...] With various-coloured light the pavement shone, [...] And all on fire appeared the glowing throne; [...] 255 [...] The dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze, [...] And forms a rainbow of alternate rays. [...] When on the goddess first I cast my sight, [...] Scarce seemed her stature of a cubit's height;[95] [...] But swelled to larger size, the more I gazed, [...] 260 [...] Till to the roof her tow'ring front she raised. [...] With her, the temple ev'ry moment grew, [...] And ampler vistas opened to my view: [...] Upward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend, [...] And arches widen, and long aisles extend.[96] [...] 265 [...] Such was her form, as ancient bards have told, [...] Wings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold; [...] A thousand busy tongues the goddess bears, [...] And thousand open eyes, and thousand list'ning ears.[97] [...] Beneath, in order ranged, the tuneful Nine [...] 270 [...] (Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine.[98] [...] With eyes on Fame for ever fixed, they sing; [...] For Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string; [...] With time's first birth began the heav'nly lays, [...] And last, eternal, through the length of days. [...] 275 [...] Around these wonders as I cast a look, [...] The trumpet sounded, and the temple shook, [...] And all the nations, summoned at the call, [...] From diff'rent quarters fill the crowded hall: [...] Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard; [...] 280 [...] In various garbs promiscuous throngs appeared;[99] [...] Thick as the bees that with the spring renew [...] Their flow'ry toils, and sip the fragrant dew, [...] When the winged colonies first tempt the sky, [...] O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly, [...] 285 [...] Or settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield, [...] And a low murmur runs along the field.[100] [...] Millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend, [...] And all degrees before the goddess bend;[101] [...] The poor, the rich, the valiant, and the sage, [...] 290 [...] And boasting youth, and narrative old age.[102] [...] Their pleas were diff'rent, their request the same: [...] For good and bad alike are fond of fame. [...] Some she disgraced, and some with honours crowned;[103] [...] Unlike successes equal merits found.[104] [...] 295 [...] Thus her blind sister, fickle Fortune, reigns, [...] And, undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains. [...] First at the shrine the learned world appear, [...] And to the goddess thus prefer their prayer. [...] Long have we sought t' instruct and please mankind, [...] 300 [...] With studies pale, with midnight vigils blind; [...] But thanked by few, rewarded yet by none, [...] We here appeal to thy superior throne: [...] On wit and learning the just prize bestow, [...] For fame is all we must expect below. [...] 305 [...] The goddess heard, and bade the muses raise [...] The <b>golden</b> <b>trumpet</b> of eternal praise:[105] [...] From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound, [...] That fills the circuit of the world around; [...] Not all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud; [...] 310 [...] The notes at first were rather sweet than loud: [...] By just degrees they ev'ry moment rise, [...] Fill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies, [...] At ev'ry breath were balmy odours shed, [...] Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread;[106] [...] 315 [...] Less fragrant scents th' unfolding rose exhales, [...] Or spices breathing in Arabian gales. [...] Next these the good and just, an awful train, [...] Thus on their knees address the sacred fane. [...] Since living virtue is with envy cursed, [...] 320 [...] And the best men are treated like the worst, [...] Do thou, just goddess, call our merits forth, [...] And give each deed th' exact intrinsic worth.[107] [...] Not with bare justice shall your act be crowned, [...] (Said Fame,) but high above desert renowned:[108] [...] 325 [...] Let fuller notes th' applauding world amaze, [...] And the loud clarion labour in your praise. [...] This band dismissed, behold another crowd [...] Preferred the same request, and lowly bowed; [...] The constant tenour of whose well spent days [...] 330 [...] No less deserved a just return of praise. [...] But straight the direful trump of slander sounds; [...] Through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds; [...] Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies, [...] The dire report through ev'ry region flies, [...] 335 [...] In ev'ry ear incessant rumours rung, [...] And gath'ring scandals grew on ev'ry tongue. [...] From the black trumpet's rusty concave broke [...] Sulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke:[109] [...] The pois'nous vapour blots the purple skies, [...] 340 [...] And withers all before it as it flies. [...] A troop came next, who crowns and armour wore, [...] And proud defiance in their looks they bore: [...] For thee, (they cried,) amidst alarms and strife, [...] We sailed in tempests down the stream of life; [...] 345 [...] For thee whole nations filled with flames and blood, [...] And swam to empire through the purple flood. [...] Those ills we dared, thy inspiration own, [...] What virtue seemed, was done for thee alone. [...] Ambitious fools! (the queen replied, and frowned) [...] 350 [...] Be all your acts in dark oblivion drowned; [...] There sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone, [...] Your statues mouldered, and your names unknown![110] [...] A sudden cloud straight snatched them from my sight, [...] And each majestic phantom sunk in night. [...] 355 [...] Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen; [...] Plain was their dress, and modest was their mien. [...] Great idol of mankind! we neither claim [...] The praise of merit, nor aspire to fame! [...] But safe in deserts from th' applause of men, [...] 360 [...] Would die unheard of, as we lived unseen; [...] 'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight [...] Those acts of goodness, which themselves requite. [...] O let us still the secret joy partake, [...] To follow virtue ev'n for virtue's sake.[111] [...] 365 [...] And live there men, who slight immortal fame? [...] Who then with incense shall adore our name? [...] But, mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride [...] To blaze those virtues, which the good would hide. [...] Rise! muses, rise! add all your tuneful breath, [...] 370 [...] These must not sleep in darkness and in death. [...] She said: in air the trembling music floats, [...] And on the winds triumphant swell the notes:[112] [...] So soft, though high, so loud, and yet so clear,[113] [...] Ev'n list'ning angels leaned from heav'n to hear: [...] 375 [...] To farthest shores th' ambrosial spirit flies, [...] Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies. [...] Next these, a youthful train their vows expressed,[114] [...] With feathers crowned, with gay embroid'ry dress'd, [...] Hither, they cried, direct your eyes, and see [...] 380 [...] The men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry; [...] Ours is the place at banquets, balls, and plays, [...] Sprightly our nights, polite are all our days; [...] Courts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care [...] To pay due visits, and address the fair: [...] 385 [...] In fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade, [...] But still in fancy vanquished ev'ry maid; [...] Of unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell, [...] Yet, would the world believe us, all were well. [...] The joy let others have, and we the name, [...] 390 [...] And what we want in pleasure, grant in fame.[115] [...] The queen assents, the trumpet rends the skies, [...] And at each blast a lady's honour dies.[116] [...] Pleased with the strange success, vast numbers pressed [...] Around the shrine, and made the same request: [...] 395 [...] What! you (she cried) unlearn'd in arts to please, [...] Slaves to yourselves, and ev'n fatigued with ease,[117] [...] Who lose a length of undeserving days, [...] Would you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise? [...] To just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall, [...] 400 [...] The people's fable, and the scorn of all. [...] Straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound, [...] Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round, [...] Whispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud, [...] And scornful hisses run through all the crowd. [...] 405 [...] Last, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done, [...] Enslave their country, or usurp a throne;[118] [...] Or who their glory's dire foundation laid [...] On sov'reigns ruined, or on friends betrayed;[119] [...] Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix, [...] 410 [...] Of crooked counsels and dark politics; [...] Of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne, [...] And beg to make th' immortal treasons known. [...] The trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire, [...] With sparks, that seemed to set the world on fire. [...] 415 [...] At the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast, [...] And startled nature trembled with the blast. [...] This having heard and seen, some pow'r unknown [...] Straight changed the scene, and snatched me from the throne.[120] [...] Before my view appeared a structure fair, [...] 420 [...] Its site uncertain, if in earth or air; [...] With rapid motion turned the mansion round; [...] With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound; [...] Not less in number were the spacious doors, [...] Than leaves on trees, or sands upon the shores; [...] 425 [...] Which still unfolded stand, by night, by day, [...] Pervious to winds, and open ev'ry way. [...] As flames by nature to the skies ascend,[121] [...] As weighty bodies to the centre tend, [...] As to the sea returning rivers roll, [...] 430 [...] And the touched needle trembles to the pole; [...] Hither, as to their proper place, arise [...] All various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies, [...] Or spoke aloud, or whispered in the ear; [...] Nor ever silence, rest, or peace is here.

60|$|As we {{appeared}} {{there was}} a murmur through the vast crowd that went echoing away up the great dome, and we saw a visible blush of excitement grow on the thousands of faces, like a pink light on a stretch of pale cloud, and a very curious effect it was. On we passed down a lane cut {{through the heart of}} the human mass, till presently we stood upon the brazen patch of flooring to the east of the central altar, and immediately facing it. For some thirty feet around the golden-winged figures the space was roped off, and the multitudes stood outside the ropes. Within were a circle of white-robed gold-cinctured priests holding long <b>golden</b> <b>trumpets</b> in their hands, and immediately in front of us was our friend Agon, the High Priest, with his curious cap upon his head. His was the only covered head in that vast assemblage. We took our stand upon the brazen space, little knowing what was prepared for us beneath, but I noticed a curious hissing sound proceeding apparently from the floor for which I could not account. Then came a pause, and I looked around to see if {{there was a}}ny sign of the two Queens, Nyleptha and Sorais, but they were not there.

60|$|I {{will now}} {{pass on to}} the {{question}} of the Zu-Vendi religion, which is nothing more or less than sun-worship of a pronounced and highly developed character. Around this sun-worship is grouped the entire social system of the Zu-Vendi. It sends its roots through every institution and custom of the land. From the cradle to the grave the Zu-Vendi follows the sun in every sense of the saying. As an infant he is solemnly held up in its light and dedicated to 'the symbol of good, the expression of power, and the hope of Eternity', the ceremony answering to our baptism. Whilst still a tiny child, his parents point out the glorious orb as the presence of a visible and beneficent god, and he worships it at its up-rising and down-setting. Then when still quite small, he goes, holding fast to the pendent end of his mother's 'kaf' (toga), up to the temple of the Sun of the nearest city, and there, when at midday the bright beams strike down upon the golden central altar and beat back the fire that burns thereon, he hears the white-robed priests raise their solemn chant of praise and sees the people fall down to adore, and then, amidst the blowing of the <b>golden</b> <b>trumpets,</b> watches the sacrifice thrown into the fiery furnace beneath the altar. Here he comes again to be declared 'a man' by the priests, and consecrated to war and to good works; here before the solemn altar he leads his bride; and here too, if differences shall unhappily arise, he divorces her.|$|R
60|$|St. Francis, in praising all good, {{could be}} a more {{shouting}} optimist than Walt Whitman. St. Jerome, in denouncing all evil, could paint the world blacker than Schopenhauer. Both passions were free because both were kept in their place. The optimist could pour out all the praise he liked on the gay music of the march, the <b>golden</b> <b>trumpets,</b> and the purple banners going into battle. But he must not call the fight needless. The pessimist might draw as darkly as he chose the sickening marches or the sanguine wounds. But he must not call the fight hopeless. So it was {{with all the other}} moral problems, with pride, with protest, and with compassion. By defining its main doctrine, the Church not only kept seemingly inconsistent things side by side, but, what was more, allowed them to break out in a sort of artistic violence otherwise possible only to anarchists. Meekness grew more dramatic than madness. Historic Christianity rose into a high and strange COUP DE THEATRE of morality--things that are to virtue what the crimes of Nero are to vice. The spirits of indignation and of charity took terrible and attractive forms, ranging from that monkish fierceness that scourged like a dog the first and greatest of the Plantagenets, to the sublime pity of St. Catherine, who, in the official shambles, kissed the bloody head of the criminal. Poetry {{could be a}}cted as well as composed. This heroic and monumental manner in ethics has entirely vanished with supernatural religion. They, being humble, could parade themselves: but we are too proud to be prominent. Our ethical teachers write reasonably for prison reform; but we are not likely to see Mr. Cadbury, or any eminent philanthropist, go into Reading Gaol and embrace the strangled corpse before it is cast into the quicklime. Our ethical teachers write mildly against the power of millionaires; but we are not likely to see Mr. Rockefeller, or any modern tyrant, publicly whipped in Westminster Abbey.|$|R

60|$|Again, in {{the case}} of {{anonymous}} journalism I seem to have said a great deal without getting out the point very clearly. Anonymous journalism is dangerous, and is poisonous in our existing life simply because it is so rapidly becoming an anonymous life. That is the horrible thing about our contemporary atmosphere. Society is becoming a secret society. The modern tyrant is evil because of his elusiveness. He is more nameless than his slave. He is not more of a bully than the tyrants of the past; but he is more of a coward. The rich publisher may treat the poor poet better or worse than the old master workman treated the old apprentice. But the apprentice ran away and the master ran after him. Nowadays it is the poet who pursues and tries in vain to fix the fact of responsibility. It is the publisher who runs away. The clerk of Mr. Solomon gets the sack: the beautiful Greek slave of the Sultan Suliman also gets the sack; or the sack gets her. But though she is concealed under the black waves of the Bosphorus, at least her destroyer is not concealed. He goes behind <b>golden</b> <b>trumpets</b> riding on a white elephant. But {{in the case}} of the clerk it is almost as difficult to know where the dismissal comes from as to know where the clerk goes to. It may be Mr. Solomon or Mr. Solomon's manager, or Mr. Solomon's rich aunt in Cheltenham, or Mr. Soloman's rich creditor in Berlin. The elaborate machinery which was once used to make men responsible is now used solely in order to shift the responsibility. People talk about the pride of tyrants; but we in this age are not suffering from the pride of tyrants. We are suffering from the shyness of tyrants; from the shrinking modesty of tyrants. Therefore we must not encourage leader-writers to be shy; we must not inflame their already exaggerated modesty. Rather we must attempt to lure them to be vain and ostentatious; so that through ostentation they may at last find their way to honesty.|$|R
