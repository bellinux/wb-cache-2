40|$|Although the sad {{track record}} of the <b>EU</b> <b>Battlegroups</b> has {{attracted}} considerable scholarly attention, analyses have largely focused on obstacles related to the provision of the Battlegroup troops and to the consensus within the EU Council, hence taking a supply-side perspective. This article calls for complementing this perspective with {{an analysis of the}} demand for their deployment. That implies analysing whether and why the <b>EU</b> <b>Battlegroups</b> were (not) considered as an option by those actors taking the initiative to intervene in a particular crisis. Applying a rational-institutionalist approach, this article explains the absence of the Battlegroups from three recent crises: Libya (2011), Mali (2013) and the Central African Republic (2013 - 2014). Using data from document analysis and elite interviews, it shows that once a rapid military reaction became urgent, the <b>EU</b> <b>Battlegroups</b> were not even considered as an option by those initiating an international reaction. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis Duplication {{of rapid}} reaction forces: NATO and EU aims to clarify whether the NATO Response Forces and the European Union's <b>EU</b> <b>Battlegroups</b> are identical or not. After the Cold War ended these {{the two organizations}} began with the building of its own rapidly deployable military forces and because membership states are almost overlapping, the question arises, why should those states allocate their resources to identical concepts. Thesis first describes the change of security environment and the threats that result from them for NATO and the EU. These dangers have both actors responded by adopting a series of documents that defines the tools for their management and which demonstrated the need for rapid response forces. In subsequent chapters thesis describes the creation of both units and compared their essential characteristics and capabilities. Also is explained how these two organizations are fighting against duplication. The last chapter shows on {{the example of the}} Czech Republic (which is a member of NATO and the EU) how a member state deals with the force contribution to both concepts and whether Czechs consider them as duplicative. At the end of the thesis author claims that NATO Response Forces and <b>EU</b> <b>Battlegroups</b> are not identical, because they differ in various aspects. Powered [...] ...|$|R
