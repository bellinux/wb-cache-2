5|$|Labrador {{colouration}} {{is controlled}} by multiple genes. It is possible for recessive genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected pigmentation effects to {{different parts of the}} body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador can carry <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.|$|E

5|$|A {{review of}} {{evidence}} in 2005 suggested that PrP may have a normal function in maintenance of long-term memory. As well, a 2004 study found that mice lacking <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> normal cellular PrP protein show altered hippocampal long-term potentiation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> factor VIII {{is located}} on the X {{chromosome}} (Xq28). The <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> factor VIII presents an interesting primary structure, as another gene is embedded in one of its introns.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF), located on 11p14.1, has been proposed as a candidate <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> the obesity and excessive eating in a subset of WAGR patients. This strengthens {{the case for a}} role for BDNF in energy balance.|$|R
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent {{protein kinase}} (DNA-PKcs) {{has been proposed}} recently as a candidate <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> the mouse severe combined immune deficiency (scid) locus. We have used a partial cDNA clone for human DNA-PKcs to map the mouse homologue using a large interspecific backcross panel. We found that the mouse <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> DNA-PKcs does not recombine with scid, consistent with the hypothesis that scid is a mutation in the mouse <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> DNA-PKcs...|$|R
5|$|Breeding {{in order}} to correct {{pigmentation}} often lacks dependability. Because colour is determined by many genes, {{some of which are}} recessive, crossbreeding a pigmentation non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive <b>genes.</b> <b>For</b> similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided.|$|E
5|$|Communication in {{the form}} of quorum sensing plays a role in the {{regulation}} of luminescence in many species of bacteria. Small extracellularly secreted molecules stimulate the bacteria to turn on <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> light production when cell density, measured by concentration of the secreted molecules, is high.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, the CAS protein family {{contains}} four members: p130Cas/BCAR1, NEDD9/HEF1, EFS and CASS4. There are no paralogous <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> {{this family}} in acoelomates, pseudocoelomates, and nematodes, while a single ancestral member {{is found in}} Drosophila. Evolutionary divergence of the CAS proteins family members is discussed by Singh et al. in detail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> the LHCGR {{is found}} on {{chromosome}} 2 p21 in humans, {{close to the}} FSH receptor gene. It consists of 70 kbp (versus 54 kpb for the FSHR). The gene {{is similar to the}} <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> the FSH receptor and the TSH receptor.|$|R
40|$|A 6. 5 kb region {{from the}} genome of the {{cyanobacterium}} Spirulina platensis was cloned using as a probe the Escherichia coli <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> ribosomal protein S 2. Sequence analysis revealed, in this region, {{the presence of}} the <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> ribosomal protein S 2 and part of the <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> the elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts). The arrangement rpsB-spacer-tsf resembles that reported for E. coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of the platensis S 2 and EF-Ts show significant homology with the E. coli counterparts...|$|R
40|$|When {{thymidylate}} {{production is}} diminished by a mutation affecting dCTP deaminase, Escherichia coli {{is known to}} use an alternate pathway involving deoxycytidine as an intermediate. The pathway requires the <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> any of three nucleoside diphosphate kinases (ndk, pykA, or pykF) and the <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> a 5 ′-nucleotidase (yfbR) ...|$|R
5|$|Purebred Arabians never carry {{dilution}} genes. Therefore, purebreds {{cannot be}} colors such as dun, cremello, palomino or buckskin. However, there is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity. Nonetheless, purebred Arabians today do not carry <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> pinto or Leopard complex ("Appaloosa") spotting patterns, except for sabino.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C {{can be used}} by pathogens to activate infection-specific <b>genes.</b> <b>For</b> example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA to the green fluorescent protein gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37°C but not at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|A {{mitochondrion}} contains DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> redox proteins, {{such as those of}} the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome codes for some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure is also found in prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the mitochondrion was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E
5000|$|The LAG3 gene {{contains}} 8 exons. The sequence data, exon/intron organization, and chromosomal localization all {{indicate a}} close relationship of LAG3 to CD4. The <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> LAG-3 lies adjacent to the <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> CD4 on human chromosome 12 (12p13) and is approximately 20% identical to the CD4 gene ...|$|R
30|$|To {{assess the}} {{possible}} utility of a fungal <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) {{produced by a}} transgenic plant in phytoremediation, we transformed hybrid aspen with a chimeric <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> MnP. Our <b>gene</b> construct allowed expression of the <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> MnP in plants and relatively high MnP activity was detected in the hydroponic medium in which roots of plants that expressed the transgene had been cultured. Some of our transgenic plants were able to remove bisphenol A from the medium more efficiently than wild-type plants. Our results demonstrate that, without any modification of the coding sequence, a chimeric <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> fungal MnP can be expressed in a woody plant, with secretion of active MnP from roots into the rhizosphere. Our strategy suggests new options using woody plants for phytoremediation.|$|R

5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E
5|$|Female {{birds have}} sperm storage {{mechanisms}} that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> her offspring and insuring against {{the possibility of}} infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
5|$|Fruit flies (Drosophila), {{because of}} the large array of {{techniques}} available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics {{have been shown to be}} relevant to humans. The first biological clock <b>genes,</b> <b>for</b> example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well. Studies done on Drosophila, also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.|$|E

5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either directly or indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{confirms that}} the Coleoptera are monophyletic. Duane McKenna et al. (2015) used eight nuclear <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> 367 species from 172 of 183 Coleopteran families. They split the Adephaga into 2 clades, Hydradephaga and Geadephaga, broke up the Cucujoidea into 3 clades, and placed the Lymexyloidea within the Tenebrionoidea. The Polyphaga appear to date from the Triassic. Most extant beetle families appear to have arisen in the Cretaceous. The cladogram is based on McKenna (2015). The number of species in each group (mainly superfamilies) is shown in parentheses, and boldface if over 10,000. English names are given where possible. Dates of origin of major groups are shown in italics in {{millions of years ago}} (mya).|$|E
5|$|Polymorphisms (normal variations) in {{particular}} genes {{have been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as TNFα, mannan-binding lectin, CTLA4, TGFβ, DC-SIGN, PLCE1, and particular forms of human leukocyte antigen from gene variations of HLA-B. A common genetic abnormality, especially in Africans, known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, appears to increase the risk. Polymorphisms in the <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> the vitamin D receptor and FcγR seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.|$|E

5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) {{typically}} {{store their}} genomes {{on a single}} large, circular chromosome. Similarly, some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular chromosome with {{a small number of}} genes. Prokaryotes sometimes supplement their chromosome with additional small circles of DNA called plasmids, which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals. For example, the <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can be passed between individual cells, even those of different species, via horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|The RNA genome {{consists}} {{of at least}} seven structural landmarks (LTR, TAR, RRE, PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (gag, pol, and env, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu, and sometimes a tenth tev, which is a fusion of tat env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain information {{needed to make the}} structural proteins for new virus particles. For example, env codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu (or vpx in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory <b>genes</b> <b>for</b> proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.|$|E
40|$|To {{localize}} {{the structural}} <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> outer membrane protein e, mutants {{resistant to the}} protein e-specific phage TC 45 were isolated and characterized. Three classes of TC 45 -resistant strains were found: (i) mutants in phoB, a regulatory <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> protein e, (ii) mutants with an altered lipopolysaccharide, and (iii) mutants unaltered in the regulation of the pho regulon and producing an apparently normal lipopolysaccharide. Mutations in the latter class of mutants are probably altered in the structural <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> protein e and are cotransducible with proA,B at min 6 on the chromosomal map. As class (iii) includes mutants with an electrophoretically altered protein e, in both an nmpA and an nmpB background, we conclude that the structural <b>gene</b> <b>for</b> protein e, designated as phoE, is localized at min 6 on the chromosomal map, the gene order being phoE proA argF...|$|R
