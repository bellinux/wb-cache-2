50|$|The {{mass flow}} through the engine is {{determined}} by the rotation rate of the engine, multiplied by the displacement of the engine, and the density of the intake stream in the intake manifold. In most applications the rotation rate is set by the application (engine speed -RPM- in a vehicle or machinery speed in other applications). The displacement is dependent on the engine geometry, which is generally not adjustable while the engine is in use (although a handful of models do have this feature, see variable displacement). Restricting the <b>input</b> <b>flow</b> reduces the density (and hence pressure) in the intake manifold, reducing the amount of power produced. It is also a major source of engine drag (see engine braking), as the engine must pump material from the low-pressure intake manifold into the exhaust manifold (at ambient atmospheric pressure).|$|E

5000|$|With {{an area of}} 6,7 {{hectares}} {{and average}} depth of 1,5 metres (maximum 2,5 metres), Kyrkosjön contains 80,000 cubic metres of water and is supplied by a drainage area of 48 hectares.

The lake is surrounded {{by one of the}} biggest broadleaf forest in Stockholm rich in various species of birds, batrachians, and bats. Levels of phosphorus and nitrogen have decreased since the 1980s. Metal levels are low and the waters are moderately clear.

5000|$|Nozzles direct forceful, {{high-speed}} {{streams of}} water against a rotary series of spoon-shaped buckets, {{also known as}} impulse blades, which are mounted around the circumferential rim of a drive wheelalso called a runner (see photo, 'Old Pelton wheel..'). As the water jet impinges upon the contoured bucket-blades, the direction of water velocity is changed to follow {{the contours of the}} bucket. Water impulse energy exerts torque on the bucket-and-wheel system, spinning the wheel; the water stream itself does a [...] "u-turn" [...] and exits at the outer sides of the bucket, decelerated to a low velocity. In the process, the water jet's momentum is transferred to the wheel and hence to a turbine. Thus, [...] "impulse" [...] energy does work on the turbine. For maximum power and efficiency, the wheel and turbine system is designed such that the water jet velocity is twice the velocity of the rotating buckets. A very small percentage of the water jet's original kinetic energy will remain in the water, which causes the bucket to be emptied at the same rate it is filled, (see conservation of mass) and thereby allows the high-pressure <b>input</b> <b>flow</b> to continue uninterrupted and without waste of energy. Typically two buckets are mounted side-by-side on the wheel, which permits splitting the water jet into two equal streams (see photo). This balances the side-load forces on the wheel and helps to ensure smooth, efficient transfer of momentum of the fluid jet of water to the turbine wheel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new control strategy for highly loaded anaerobic digestion processes. This strategy {{is based on}} the analysis of disturbances added on purpose to the influent flow rate. The control system then carefully overlooks the response of only two parameters, the biogas output flow rate and the pH, in order {{to determine whether or not}} the load can be increased. The main advantages of this approach rely on its capability to automatically adapt the <b>input</b> <b>flow</b> rate to changes in the influ-ent concentration, without any information on its concentration, and to optimize the biological treat-ment in relation to the influent degradability. Experiments have been carried out using two fluidized bed reactors of dierent sizes and they have demonstrated very good capability of this control strategy. In addition, since only very simple sensors are needed, industrial applications of this strategy can be expected. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
