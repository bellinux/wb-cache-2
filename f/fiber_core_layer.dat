40|$|In-fiber Bragg {{gratings}} are {{key components}} for optical sensing. As embedded sensors, in-fiber gratings find important applications in mechanical structural health monitoring, vibration detection, pressure monitoring and acoustic sensing. However, the current state-of-the-art grating sensors inscribed in standard fiber only {{provide for the}} detection of stress and vibration in one dimension, along the axial dimension (length) of the fiber. In this thesis, we developed fiber Bragg grating sensors in specialty micro-structural fibers that can not only detect structural stress along the fiber, but also can detect stress along the transverse directions with high sensitivity. Finite element analysis (ANSYS) was used to design and study both longitudinal and transverse strain induced in microstructural fibers by external loads. Air holes were strategically placed in the fiber cladding to focus the external stress into the <b>fiber</b> <b>cores</b> to enhance the response of the fiber Bragg grating sensors.
