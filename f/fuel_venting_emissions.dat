5000|$|Federal Aviation Administration: Practically all {{aviation}} {{emission sources}} are independently regulated through equipment specific regulations, standards and recommended practices, and operational guidelines, which are established {{by a variety}} of organizations. For example, on-road vehicles, which take passengers to and from the airport, meet stringent Federal tailpipe standards set by EPA. Stationary sources on the airport, like power boilers and refrigeration chillers, must meet independent state regulations. And FAA certification is required for essentially all aviation equipment and processes. For example there are more than 60 standards [...] that apply to aircraft engine design, materials of construction, durability, instrumentation and control, and safety, among others. These are in addition to the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Venting</b> and Exhaust <b>Emission</b> Requirements for Turbine Engine Powered Airplanes (FAR Part 34), which guide compliance with EPA’s aircraft exhaust emission standards.The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is a United Nations intergovernmental body responsible for worldwide planning, implementation, and coordination of civil aviation. ICAO sets emission standards for jet engines. These are the basis of FAA’s aircraft engine performance certification standards, established through EPA regulations.|$|R
30|$|Heavy metal (loid) (HM) {{accumulation}} in {{the soil}} and the HM spatiotemporal distribution have important implication for soil pollution prevention and remediation. The present study investigated the concentrations and spatiotemporal distributions of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and arsenic (As) in the topsoil of a coal chemical plant in Ningxia Autonomous region (Ningxia), China. Topsoil samples (n[*]=[*] 153) were obtained using the checkerboard method, and the HM concentrations were determined. The soil residual rates of the five HMs were measured with leaching experiments and were applied in a soil environmental capacity model to predict the quantitative variation of the HM concentrations. The predicted results were employed to estimate the HM spatiotemporal distribution within 20  years with the Kriging technique. The number of sampling sites, where all five HM concentrations exceed their corresponding background values in Ningxia, would be increased from 0 to 90 % within 10  years of the plant operation. In addition, Pb and Cd were distributed along the traffic routes. Mercury and As were distributed near <b>fuel</b> gas <b>emission</b> <b>vents.</b> Chromium was mainly accumulated in slag dumps. The study may provide the theoretical and practical foundation for future HM pollution control in coal chemical plants.|$|R

40|$|Fuel leakage has {{the risk}} of being ignited by {{external}} ignition sources, and therefore it is important to detect any fuel leakage before the departure of the aircraft. Currently, there are no fuel leak detection systems installed on commercial aircrafts, to detect fuel tank leakage, while {{only a small number of}} more recent aircraft, have a fuel monitoring system, that generates a fuel leak-warning message in cockpit in the case of fuel imbalance between the tanks. The approach proposed in this paper requires the <b>fuel</b> <b>vent</b> ports on the wings to be replaced with <b>fuel</b> <b>vent</b> valves, which can be controlled to be in open or close position. The <b>fuel</b> <b>vent</b> valve will be in close position, when certain conditions are fulfilled (all the related fuel valves closed, pumps not operating, etc.), the fuel tank ullage area is then pressurized to 4 psi and the rate of change of the pressure is measured over a period. Several experiments have been conducted and, the result show that a continuous fuel leak of one liter per minute can be detected. Further experiments show that if the fuel tank is pressurized to higher pressures, a fuel leak can be detected sooner...|$|R

Advances in jet noise reduction have increased the importance of landing noise from the airframe as {{a significant contribution to}} the effective perceived noise level around airports. The most acoustically active airframe components in a civil aircraft are the high lift systems and the landing gear.

The first airline deliveries were to American Airlines and United Airlines on 24 November 1946. A series of inflight fires (including the fatal crash of United Airlines Flight 608) grounded the DC-6 fleet in 1947.

The design space near the optimal region is found to be flat that is around 40 % shape optimization(80 mm hole), the original weight is 0. 44343 kg and obtained reduction in weight is 0. 27018, this allows us to achieve a considerable enhancement in fatigue life and weight reduction...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} archaeal {{lineages}} {{have been identified}} using culture-independent molecular phylogenetic surveys of microbial habitats occurring in deep-sea hydrothermal environments such as chimney structures, sediments, <b>vent</b> <b>emissions,</b> and chemosynthetic macrofauna. With {{the exception of a}} few taxa, most of these archaea have not yet been cultivated, and their physiological and metabolic traits remain unclear. In this study, phylogenetic diversity and distribution profiles of the archaeal genes encoding small subunit (SSU) rRNA, methyl coenzyme A (CoA) reductase subunit A, and the ammonia monooxygenase large subunit were characterized in hydrothermally influenced sediments at the Yonaguni Knoll IV hydrothermal field in the Southern Okinawa Trough. Sediment cores were collected at distances of 0. 5, 2, or 5 m from a <b>vent</b> <b>emission</b> (90 °C). A moderate temperature gradient extends both horizontally and vertically (5 to 69 °C), indicating the existence of moderate mixing between the hydrothermal fluid and the ambient sediment pore water. The mixing of reductive hot hydrothermal fluid and cold ambient sediment pore water establishes a wide spectrum of physical and chemical conditions in the microbial habitats that were investigated. Under these different physico-chemical conditions, variability in archaeal phylotype composition was observed. The relationship between the physical and chemical parameters and the archaeal phylotype composition provides important insight into the ecophysiological requirements of uncultivated archaeal lineages in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments, giving clues for approximating culture conditions to be used in future culturing efforts...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 A limited scope Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) of a <b>vented</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> {{system for}} a Generation IV Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor Plant was performed. The goal {{of the study was}} to better {{understand}} the safety and licensing implications of <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> technology. A Level 1 PRA was performed to determine the possible and probable failure mechanisms of the <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> fission product collection and auxiliary systems. A Level 2 PRA was performed to determine the possible releases from the <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> collection system under normal and abnormal operating conditions. Finally, a Level 3 PRA was performed to understand the consequence of a release of fission products from the <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> collection system to the population and environment. This work has found that the most probable system damage states are a release from the <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> system within the containment building and within the auxiliary building. As a result of the reduced fission product boundaries present in the event of a release within the auxiliary building, consequences of these events prove to be more severe. Three source term groups were found to have exceedingly higher dose consequences with respect to their estimated frequencies. As a result, the present analysis indicates that additional design and analysis on the <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> system is required. It should be noted that the present work operates under several highly conservative assumptions. Consequently, the <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> system, as modeled, may be safely operated without design changes pending the refinement of the models used to determine source term estimates and atmospheric transport. Specifically, the conservative modeling assumptions that have the potential to greatly reduce the estimated consequences, if refined, include the fraction of the activity within the adsorber beds that is released under accident conditions, the specific attenuation factors applied to the various fission product boundaries, and the atmospheric conditions selected for the atmospheric transport model. In addition, design changes such as an increase in the Exclusion Area Boundary (EAB) or placement of the entire <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> system within the containment building may further reduce the consequences of a release.

50|$|A {{tailwind}} {{was essential}} to making the 36787.559 km that it needed to fly to meet the FAI’s definition of circumnavigation, {{the length of the}} Tropic of Cancer. The GlobalFlyer was designed to complete the circumnavigation with minimal reserves of fuel. As it turned out, a design flaw in the <b>fuel</b> <b>venting</b> system resulted in the loss of about 1,200 kg (2,600 lb) of fuel early in the flight. This forced Steve Fossett and Mission Control to decide whether to abort the flight as it reached the Pacific Ocean near Japan. Steve Fossett chose to delay the final decision until he reached Hawaii. By that time, favorable winds encouraged the mission team to attempt to complete the circumnavigation.|$|R

40|$|This Waste Analysis Plan (WAP) {{provides}} {{the plan for}} obtaining information needed for proper waste handling and processing in the 242 -A Evaporator (Evaporator) located on the Hanford Site. In particular it addresses analysis necessary to manage the waste according to Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 303 and Parts 264 and 265 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Regulatory and safety issues are addressed by establishing boundary conditions for waste received and treated at the 242 -A Evaporator. The boundary conditions are set by establishing limits for items such as potential exothermic reactions, waste compatibility, and control of vessel <b>vent</b> organic <b>emissions.</b> Boundary conditions are also set for operational considerations and to ensure waste acceptance at receiving facilities. The issues that are addressed in this plan include prevention of exotherms in the waste, waste compatibility, and vessel <b>vent</b> <b>emissions.</b> Samples from the other streams associated with the Evaporator are taken as required by Process Control Plans but are excluded from this plan because either the streams do not contain dangerous waste or the analyses are not required by WAC 173 - 303 - 300...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Fission product {{transport}} in a Gen. IV Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor Plant utilizing <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> {{has been}} characterized using analytical and computational methods. The goal was to increase current understanding of fission product transport in helium-cooled GFRs using <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> {{and to provide a}} toolset for determining issues which may arise during normal and abnormal operating conditions. A review of the Peach Bottom Unit 1 reactor, the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor, the Gen IV Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor, and the Energy Multiplier Module—all helium-cooled nuclear systems utilizing vented fuel—provided sufficient background for understanding the design methodology behind vented system and helium purification system design. From documentation for these systems and other literature, the phenomena of fission product generation and decay, volatile fission product chemistry, fission product diffusion and release in fuel, fission product leakage through non-fuel components, fission product plateout, and collection of gaseous fission products through adsorption in the charcoal beds were identified as having a significant effect on the transport of fission products within a <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> system. Understanding of <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> system design and identified fission product transport phenomena was then used {{for the development of a}} <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> system model in the systems modeling program, STELLA. The model was used to analyze test cases, characterizing the time-dependent accumulation and decay of fission products in a <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> system. These results, used in conjunction with the review of past systems, were used to compile conclusions and recommendations for the design of <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> systems and helium purification systems, aiding direction of future research and design efforts. Briefly, the work found that the mass, activity, and power generation of accumulated fission products is likely to be very large, requiring significant consideration within the overall plant design. Additionally, the reduction of the source of vented fission products being purged from the primary vessel, either by fuel or core design, may present significant advantages in plant design. It was also found that safety systems will be necessary to prevent overheat and possible release from the helium purification system in the case of an accident scenario. Lastly, it was found that the determination of the purge stream leakage rate into the primary coolant and the fuel release rate are of crucial importance for the safety and economy of a <b>vented</b> <b>fuel</b> system.

30|$|Summing up the CO 2 flux {{contributions}} for the fumarolic emissions, the degassing {{soils and}} the springs (12  t day− 1, Cruz et al. 1999), the total volcanic/hydrothermal CO 2 output for Furnas volcano {{is estimated to}} be ~ 1030  t day− 1. These results show once more the importance of taking into consideration both soil degassing and gas <b>vent</b> <b>emissions</b> to estimate the CO 2 emission in hydrothermal areas, since their relative contribution seems to be quite different depending on the study sites. Using a portable Multi-GAS, we also obtained the CO 2 /H 2 S ratio signature for the investigated fumaroles, and concluded that the Furnas fumaroles are, in their present state of activity, weak, but yet not negligible, sources of H 2 S (~ 0.25  t day− 1).|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{structures}} are designed without structural health monitoring (SHM) in mind. It is proposed that SHM {{should be addressed}} {{at the design stage}} of new structures. This paper explores the benefit which can be gained from such considerations. The scope encompasses Lamb-wave-based SHM and a given fatigue critical location (FCL). Optimization is performed using specialised ray tracing. A case study is carried out using a specimen that simulates a hard-to-inspect region in a <b>fuel</b> <b>vent</b> hole in wings structures of aircraft. This work will report on the potential use of the focussing of stress wave to improve detectability of defect in this hard-to-inspect location.

40|$|Trace {{metals in}} the ocean are derived from natural and {{anthropogenic}} sources. Despite increased human impact on the marine environment and biological productivity of continental margins, trace metal studies in marine sediments have focused primarily on near-shore regions. I investigated 22 metals in sediments on the continental margin of the northwest Atlantic Ocean to calculate enrichment factors (EF) relative to upper continental crust and identify spatial variations with distance from shore and depth below the sediment-seawater interface. Metals were well correlated with Al, Fe, organic matter, or CaCO 3. No clear trends in metal EFs with distance from shore were evident on a station by station basis, but consistent differences among regions of the continental margin were evident. Significant near-shore enrichment was observed. Enrichment was also evident for As, Hg, Mn, and Ni in sediments farther off-shore, suggesting the influence of human activities or hydrothermal <b>vent</b> <b>emissions</b> have enriched deep ocean sediments...|$|R
