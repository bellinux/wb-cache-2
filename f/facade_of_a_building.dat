2500|$|Before {{the house}} was {{demolished}} a sale was held {{and parts of the}} house were re-used elsewhere. [...] The large chimneypiece from the dining room went to form part of the entrance to what is now a restaurant in Borough Road, Birkenhead. [...] Another immense fireplace was reused at [...] Portmeirion as the main <b>facade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building,</b> the Pantheon. [...] Parts of other chimneypieces went to private houses in Heswall and Bebington, and other piece s went to Llandudno, and to Iwerne Minster House, in Dorset.

60|$|As {{they drew}} near Beacon Street {{they were aware}} of unwonted stir and tumult, and {{presently}} the still air transmitted a turmoil of sound, through which a powerful and incessant throbbing made itself felt. The sky had reddened above them, and turning the corner at the Public Garden, they saw a black mass of people obstructing the perspective of the brightly-lighted street, and out of this mass a half-dozen engines, whose strong heart-beats had already reached them, sent up volumes of fire-tinged smoke and steam from their funnels. Ladders were planted against the <b>facade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>building,</b> from the roof of which a mass of flame burnt smoothly upward, except where here and there it seemed to pull contemptuously away from the heavy streams of water which the firemen, clinging like great beetles to their ladders, poured in upon it.|$|E
