This model has 28mm Keihin carburettors which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{the fact}} that in midgear the valve opening should be the same for the piston in both front and rear dead centre {{positions}} is used to find the mid <b>gear</b> <b>position</b> of the pivot between the combination rod and reach rod. In practice the valve spindle length is adjusted to ensure this as part of setting the timing. Also the dimensions of the lead and lap lever are set so that the valve moves twice the lead + lap of the valve.|$|E
5000|$|Because its friction-drive {{transmission}} allowed {{selection of}} any ratio {{rather than having}} fixed <b>gear</b> <b>positions,</b> the Cartercar was advertised as [...] "The Car of a Thousand Speeds." [...] Another ad touted [...] "It's Hard to Improve a Cartercar." ...|$|R

2500|$|By the 20th century, earlier {{mechanical}} calculators, cash registers, accounting machines, {{and so on}} were redesigned to use electric motors, with <b>gear</b> <b>position</b> as {{the representation}} {{for the state of}} a variable. The word [...] "computer" [...] was a job title assigned to people who used these calculators to perform mathematical calculations. By the 1920s, British scientist Lewis Fry Richardson's interest in weather prediction led him to propose human computers and numerical analysis to model the weather; to this day, the most powerful computers on Earth are needed to adequately model its weather using the Navier–Stokes equations.|$|E

5000|$|Range {{transmissions}} use an [...] "H" [...] pattern {{through a}} narrow range of gears, then a [...] "range" [...] control shifts the [...] "H" [...] pattern {{between high and low}} ranges. For example, an 8-speed range transmission has an H shift pattern with four gears. The first through fourth gears are accessed when low range is selected. To access the fifth through eighth gears, the range selector is moved to high range, and the gear lever again shifted through the first through fourth gear positions. In high range, the first <b>gear</b> <b>position</b> becomes fifth, the second <b>gear</b> <b>position</b> becomes sixth, and so on.|$|E
5000|$|... "Park-to-Reverse" [...] {{issues are}} nearly always caused by several {{possible}} design flaws in a vehicle's transmission {{which makes it}} possible for a driver to unknowingly place the vehicle's shift selector into a position in between the [...] "park" [...] and [...] "reverse" [...] <b>gear</b> <b>positions.</b> Yet rather than being in [...] "park', this area is a transitional zone between gears, which is sometimes called [...] "false park".|$|R
5000|$|The Morris Commercial J2 was a small, forward-control van (driver's cab {{on top of}} the engine) {{launched}} by Morris Commercial in 1956 and produced until 1967. It was offered with the familiar B-series petrol engine, initially in 1489 cc form, but this was subsequently enlarged to 1622 cc. A curious feature of the gear lever linkage was that the usual [...] "H-plane" [...] <b>gear</b> <b>positions</b> were reversed, i.e. 1st/2nd gears were at the right-hand-side and 3rd/4th to the left.|$|R
500|$|Due to Nintendo's {{licensing}} practices {{during the}} lifespan of the Game Gear, few third-party developers {{were available to}} create games for Sega's system. [...] This was a contributing factor to {{the large number of}} Master System ports for the Game Gear. [...] Likewise, because of this, the Game Gear library contained many games that were not available on other handhelds, pulling sales away from the Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress and helping to establish the Game <b>Gear's</b> <b>position</b> in the market. [...] While the Game Gear's library consisted of over 300 titles, however, the Game Boy's library contained over 1000 individual games.|$|R
5000|$|The GZ {{series is}} based {{primarily}} on the GN series, and features air-cooled SOHC single-cylinder engines with chain drive.

The brake pedal operates internally expanding brakes on all four wheels, the handbrake operates at the back using separate shoes. The brake drums are enclosed. Standard fittings include a spare (steel artillery) wheel and tyre. Shock absorbers are provided. There are semi-elliptic springs all round, flat set at the front. The rear springs are underhung. Cross-braced by three direct members the chassis channel-section side members are narrowed at the front and rise over the back axle ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For {{the safety}} problem of heavy duty {{vehicles}} running on long downhill sections, a model {{was built for}} the application of engine brake and service brake combination based on test results. And a model of brake temperature rise for heavy duty vehicles running on long downhill sections was also established. For different braking modes, <b>gear</b> <b>positions,</b> speed and downhill slopes, brake temperature rising to 250 ℃ was used as the index. And then simulation of brake temperature rise and downhill distance was researched. Simulation results show that the combined braking of low gear and high speed should be adopted for heavy duty vehicles running on long downhill sections...|$|R

5000|$|Slip-eccentric - This gear is now {{confined}} to model steam engines, and low power hobby {{applications such as}} steam launch engines, ranging to a few horsepower. The eccentric is loose on the crankshaft but there are stops to limit its rotation relative to the crankshaft. Setting the eccentric to the forward running and reverse running positions can be accomplished manually by rotating the eccentric on a stopped engine, or for many engines by simply turning the engine in the desired rotation direction, where the eccentric then positions itself automatically. The engine is pushed forwards to put the eccentric in the forward <b>gear</b> <b>position</b> and backwards {{to put it in}} the backward <b>gear</b> <b>position.</b> There is no variable control of cutoff. On the London and North Western Railway, some of the three-cylinder compounds designed by Francis William Webb from 1889 used a slip eccentric to operate the valve of the single low-pressure cylinder. These included the Teutonic, Greater Britain and John Hick classes.|$|E

50|$|A {{sample layout}} of a four-speed {{transmission}} is shown below. N marks neutral, the position wherein no gears are engaged {{and the engine}} is decoupled from the vehicle's drive wheels. The entire horizontal line is a neutral position, though the shifter is usually spring-loaded so it {{will return to the}} centre of the N position if not moved to another gear. The R marks reverse, the <b>gear</b> <b>position</b> used for moving the vehicle backward.|$|E
