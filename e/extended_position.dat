5|$|By 1 December the {{fighting}} for Jerusalem was almost over. The Ottoman Army {{had failed to}} win any ground {{as a result of}} their counterattacks, and the advancing British troops were successfully replacing their tired comrades who were well entrenched close to Jerusalem. On 2 December the relief of the XXI Corps by the XX Corps was completed when the 10th (Irish) Division relieved the 52nd (Lowland) Division. And each side began to adjust and improve their lines, leaving insecure or hard to defend places. The British increased the number of soldiers in their line to create a powerful concentration. Over four days the 10th (Irish) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions extended their positions, while the <b>extended</b> <b>position</b> held by the 60th (2/2nd London) Division was shortened.|$|E
5|$|All post-1638 depictions {{appear to}} be based on earlier images, around the time reports {{mentioning}} dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist Julian Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the Gelderland, Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an <b>extended</b> <b>position,</b> unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.|$|E

Although it is claimed that on 3 December the Ottoman Army had abandoned their counterattacks and that fighting in the Judean Hills ceased, as a consequence of units of the 74th (Yeomanry) Division recapturing Beit Ur el Foqa, during a night time attack, the position was impossible to hold. At daylight they found they were overlooked by Ottoman positions on higher ground. Bombing and hand-to-hand fighting continued all morning, and the Yeomanry infantry battalion was forced to withdraw, suffering 300 casualties.|$|E
25|$|Like other decapod crustaceans, the {{crayfish}} {{possesses a}} hard, segmented exoskeleton that reflects muscular and neural segmentation. The anterior {{portion of the}} crayfish is the cephalothorax region. The region rostral to the cephalic grove, which separates the head and thorax region, {{is characterized by the}} presence of eyes, antennae and claws while the region caudal contains four pairs of walking legs. This is the crayfish's primary mode of locomotion. The abdominal section of the crayfish is divided into seven segments. These segments are flexibly interconnected, forming the tail. Normally, the tail is held in an <b>extended</b> <b>position</b> to aid in maneuvering and balancing. The first five segments are similar and the two terminal segments are modified into a tail fan, a region with high surface area that acts as the blade of a paddle in the escape response. This region contains the telson. The abdominal segments contain swimmerets, which aid in swimming.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} proposes a new fine-positioning {{mechanism}} with piezoelectric actuators and a fine-positioning method for this mechanism. We realized a long stroke path and an ultraprecision positioning simultaneously {{with a single}} apparatus. A positioning apparatus with a fine-positioning mechanism attached to the displacement extension mechanism was developed. Actuators were used sequentially for the extension mechanism and the reduction mechanism. Fine positioning is obtained with cooperative positioning that is performed by combining <b>extended</b> displacement <b>positioning</b> and reduced displacement positioning. As a fundamental experiment, the <b>positioning</b> characteristics of <b>extended</b> displacement <b>positioning</b> and reduced displacement positioning were examined individually. A value of 4. 63 times the displacement magnification in <b>extended</b> displacement <b>positioning</b> and a value of 0. 19 times the displacement magnification in reduced displacement positioning were obtained in comparison with displacement of an actuator unit alone. Cooperative positioning using displacement feedback with PI control was then examined. As a result, even though the stroke was <b>extended,</b> high-resolution <b>positioning</b> was realized simultaneously. In addition, {{under the condition that}} the overshoot is not allowed, shortening at the settling time in comparison with only the <b>extended</b> displacement <b>positioning</b> was confirmed...|$|R

In early 222, Liu Bei arrived at the scene to personally take command of the invasion. Sun Quan dispatched Lu Xun to command over the defense of Wu against the invasion by Shu. In the sixth month of 222, waiting until Liu Bei was committed along the Yangtze below the Yangtze Gorges against the advice of his subordinates, Lu Xun launched a series of fire attacks against the flank of Liu Bei's <b>extended</b> <b>position</b> which caused disorder in the Shu army and Liu Bei's retreat to Bodi (near present-day Fengjie). Afterwards in 222, Sun Quan renounced his suzerainty to Wei and declared the independence of Wu. In 223, Liu Bei perished at Bodi. Zhuge Liang now acted as a regent for Liu Shan (aged 17) and held control of the Shu government. Shu and Wu resumed their diplomatic relations by re-establishing peace and alliance in 223. On 23 June 229, Sun Quan proclaimed himself as the Emperor of Wu.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the maximum}} <b>extended</b> <b>position</b> the glacier {{is once again}} {{sensitive}} to changing climate. Brady Glacier and Baird Glacier are examples of glaciers currently at this point. Brady Glacier has been thinning {{during the last two}} decades due to the higher equilibrium line altitudes accompanying warmer conditions in the region, and its secondary termini have begun to retreat. [...] A glacier can remain at this position for sometime, a century at least in the case of Brady Glacier. [...] Usually substantial thinning occurs before retreat from the shoal commences. [...] This allowed the prediction in 1980, by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), of the retreat of the Columbia Glacier from its terminus shoal. The glacier had remained on this shoal throughout the entire 20th century. The USGS was monitoring the glacier due to its proximity to Valdez, Alaska, the port for crude oil export from the Alaskan Pipeline. [...] At some point a decline in mass balance will trigger a retreat from the shoal into deeper water at which point calving will ensue. Based on the recent thinning it is suggested that Brady Glacier is poised to begin retreat.|$|E

Here we found the confirmation of many rumours. The news of a Boer advance on Burghersdorp, twenty-five miles away, is, it seems, well founded, and when our train arrived the evacuation of Stormberg by its garrison, of a half-battalion of the Berkshire Regiment, 350 men of the Naval Brigade, a company of mounted infantry, and a few guns, was busily proceeding.|$|E
40|$|To {{assess what}} kind of {{information}} MR examination in flexed and <b>extended</b> <b>positions</b> provides in Down syndrome subjects with suspected cranio-cervical instability. Between 2005 and 2008, 35 subjects with DS were recruited in the study. Ethics committee approval was granted and a signed {{informed consent was obtained}} from the parents. All the subjects were affected by hypotonic status and ligament laxity established by clinical evaluation, but were asymptomatic about focal neurological symptoms due to medullar damage caused by cranio-cervical instability. Each patient underwent lateral supine radiographs and MR imaging in the neutral, active flexed and <b>extended</b> <b>positions.</b> For evaluating the atlanto-axial and atlanto-occipital joint stability, multiple measurements were calculated. A significant reduction of anterior subarachnoid space in flexed position was evident in DS subjects compared to healthy controls in neutral and flexed positions. Both, space available for cord and ligamentous thickness showed significant differences between DS subjects and healthy controls. In DS subjects with occipito-cervical instability, the anterior subarachnoidal space reduction was significantly reduced in flexed position. In DS subjects with asymptomatic cranio-cervical instability, anterior subarachnoidal evaluation and ligamentous status could add new information about the risk of spinal cord damage...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of {{the surface}} area of the avian body is {{valuable}} for thermoregulation and metabolism studies {{as well as for}} assessing exposure to oil and other surface-active organic pollutants from a spill.

60|$|It is {{probable}} that all these demonstrations of the enemy upon the right of Lord Roberts's <b>extended</b> <b>position</b> were really feints in order to cover the far-reaching plans which Botha had in his mind. The disposition of the Boer forces at this time {{appears to have been}} as follows: Botha with his army occupied a position along Delagoa railway line, further east than Diamond Hill, whence he detached the bodies which attacked Hutton upon the extreme right of the British position to the south-east of Pretoria. To the north of Pretoria a second force was acting under Grobler, while a third under De la Rey had been despatched secretly across to the left wing of the British, north-west of Pretoria. While Botha engaged the attention of Lord Roberts by energetic demonstrations on his right, Grobler and De la Rey were to make a sudden attack upon his centre and his left, each point being twelve or fifteen miles from the other. It was well devised and very well carried out; but the inherent defect of it was that, when subdivided in this way, the Boer force was no longer strong enough to gain more than a mere success of outposts.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the value and}} improve the diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography in the diagnosis of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (SVA) with rare pathological patterns. Echocardiographic features and surgical findings from 270 Chinese patients with SVA treated in the last 18 years (1995 - 2013) at the Union Hospital were compared retrospectively; 22 of 270 cases had rare patterns. The patients with SVA, a rare origin, a rare <b>extending</b> <b>position,</b> or a rare course accounted for 3. 4 %, 7. 4 %, and 0. 4 % of the 270 cases, respectively. The three most common aneurysmal complications of the patients with rare patterns were severe aortic regurgitation (16), obstruction of the ventricular outflow tract or valvular orifice (3), and conduction disturbance (3). The origin, course, <b>extending</b> <b>position</b> and rupture status of the SVAs determined by echocardiography were entirely consistent with surgical findings in 81. 8 % of the 22 cases. With {{the exception of one}} failed diagnosis of an aneurysmal wall dissection and one misdiagnosis of a descending aortic dissection, the echocardiographic results of SVA complications and associated cardiovascular lesions were also confirmed. We could accurately diagnose SVAs with rare pathological patterns by echocardiographic identification of distinguishing features. However, for several conditions, we could not accurately identify the origin or course of the aneurysm or define its relationship to adjacent structures using conventional echocardiography alone. Therefore, we recommend combining conventional echocardiography with different imaging techniques, such as transesophageal echocardiography, three-dimensional echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, and aortic angiography...|$|R
