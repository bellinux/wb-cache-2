Here we present the radial brightness profiles {{of a number of}} barred S 0 –Sb galaxies with the opposite behavior: their outer profiles are distinctly shallower in slope than the main disk profile. We term these “anti-truncations”; they are found in at least 25 % of a larger sample of barred S 0 –Sb galaxies. There are two distinct types of anti-truncations. About one-third show a fairly gradual transition and outer <b>isophotes</b> which are progressively rounder than the main disk <b>isophotes,</b> suggestive of a disk embedded within a more spheroidal outer zone — either the outer extent of the bulge or a separate stellar halo. But the majority of the profiles have rather sharp surface-brightness transitions to the shallower, outer exponential profile and, crucially, outer <b>isophotes</b> which are not significantly rounder than the main disk; in the Sab–Sb galaxies, the outer <b>isophotes</b> include visible spiral arms. This suggests that the outer light is still part of the disk. A subset of these profiles are in galaxies with asymmetric outer <b>isophotes</b> (lopsided or one-armed spirals), suggesting that interactions may be responsible for {{at least some of the}} disklike anti-truncations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Characteristic curves like <b>isophotes,</b> {{reflection}} {{lines and}} reflection cir-cles are well–established concepts {{which have been}} used for automatic fairing of both parametric and piecewise linear surfaces. However, the result of the fair-ing strongly depends on the choice of a particular family of characteristic curves: <b>isophotes</b> or reflection lines may look perfect for a certain orientation of viewing and projection direction, but still have imperfections for other directions. There-fore, fairing methods are necessary which consider multiple families of character-istic curves. To achieve this, we first introduce a new way of controlling character-istic curves directly on the surface. Based on this, we introduce a fairing scheme which incorporates several families of characteristic curves simultaneously. We confirm effectiveness of our method for a number of test data sets. ...|$|R

In our approach, {{the two components}} are assumed to have con-centric and coaxial ellipitical <b>isophotes</b> of arbitrary surface brightness (SuBr) and ellipticity proles. These four func-tions are {{to be determined by}} comparing calculated and easily measured quantities, i. e. the harmonics of the SuBr along suitable reference ellipses. The principle of the method is straightforward and its implementation very easy in favourable cases. There are diculties however with truly edge-on galaxies, where the assumption of elliptical <b>isophotes</b> is perhaps no more valid for the disk, and with objects of such inclinations that the geometrical signature of the two-components structure tends to vanish. Our techniques have been tested with a number of cal-culated model objects, and with 9 real galaxies, observed at sub-arcsec resolution at the CFHT or at the Pic du Midi. The results are compared with those of other au-thors, sometimes involving more uncertain assumptions: the one of negligible disk contributions to the minor axis SuBr is unsatisfactory for S 0 galaxies.
