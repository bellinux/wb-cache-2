5|$|Sound waves {{travel through}} the outer ear, are {{modulated}} by the middle <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> are transmitted to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the inner ear. This nerve transmits information to the temporal lobe of the brain, where it is registered as sound.|$|E

5|$|Aoyama {{tries to}} track her down using her résumé, but as Yoshikawa warned, {{all of the}} {{contacts}} are dead ends. At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E

40|$|Sweet corn “topping” is {{the removal}} of plant parts above the ear after {{pollination}} has occurred. This practice {{has been reported to}} hasten maturity, improve picking ease, reduce bird damage, improve pesticide application to <b>ears,</b> <b>and</b> reduce lodging problems. Disadvantages of topping have included a reduction in earsize, poor kernel fill,sunburn of exposed <b>ears,</b> <b>and</b> additional production costs. The objective was to determine what effect topping would have on <b>ear</b> maturity, yield, <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> quality under Iowa growing conditions...|$|R
5|$|Earwigs {{are fairly}} {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> lay eggs in the brain.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had several}} health problems, {{including}} childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring, deafness in one <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> blindness in one eye, gout, testicular cancer, and a stroke {{in his final}} year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger and {{darker than the}} common impala; melanism {{is responsible for the}} black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E
5|$|The museum's director, Professor Capart, {{exhibited}} similarities with Professor Tarragon, a new {{character that}} Hergé had {{developed for the}} story.

5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E

5|$|For {{the human}} ear, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to tell precisely where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human <b>ear,</b> <b>and</b> cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E
5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
