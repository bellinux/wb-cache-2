40|$|Graduation date: 1974 This {{study of}} the immediate, {{localized}} effects of a small <b>dredging</b> <b>operation</b> on the benthic invertebrate community in the shipping channel of Coos Bay, Oregon, was designed: 1) to measure {{the extent of the}} physical removal of benthic macro- and meiofauna by hopper dredging; 2) to record the subsequent benthic effects of mid-channel spoiling; and 3) to monitor the rate and pattern of biological readjustment in the affected areas. Replicate Shipek grab samples before and after <b>dredge</b> <b>operations</b> were restricted spatially and temporally to delineate rapid and localized biological responses. Faunal abundance, taxa composition, species diversity and qualitative sediment characteristics were studied. Immediate declines in faunal abundance at the dredge and spoil sites were temporary and re-adjusted to pre-dredging abundance levels within 28 days. Temporary increases in diversity reflected changes in the relative abundance of taxa arising from siltation and burial of organisms. Following re-adjustment, populations increased in all areas except the dredge channel. Localized population declines are hypothesized to result from the unsuitability of newly exposed sediment for settlement of pelagic larvae. Although most taxa were adversely affected by dredging activity, Capitella ovincola was relatively unaffected and increased dramatically within the dredge channel within 18 days after dredging. Qualitative sediment characteristics were generally the same before and after <b>dredge</b> <b>operations</b> except for localized increases in wood debris at both dredge and spoil sites. The effects of dredging activity are thought to be dependent on: 1) the size and duration of the <b>dredge</b> <b>operation,</b> 2) pre-dredging history and frequency of dredging, 3) the type of benthic community, 4) depth of water and sediment type, 5) draft and size of the dredging vessel and 6) shipping and related harbor activities. The direct, benthic effects of this <b>dredging</b> <b>operation</b> were short term. The temporary nature of these changes was linked to the small scope of the <b>dredging</b> <b>operation</b> and the adaptability of the benthic community. It is hypothesized that periodic disruption of the sediment surface by small scale maintenance operations may have less effect on the benthic community than the daily presence of heavy shipping and industrial and domestic pollution...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, 1988 The {{effects of}} suction dredge gold mining on the stream habitat of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho salmon (0. kisutch), and steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri) were {{investigated}} at Canyon Creek, Trinity County, California during 1984 and 1985. In 1984, {{a total of}} 1136 m 2 of streambed was disturbed by 20 suction <b>dredge</b> <b>operations.</b> In 1985, 1075 m 2 were disturbed by 15 <b>dredge</b> <b>operations.</b> Increased levels of stream turbidity and total suspended solids were detected 100 m below active dredges. Gravel and fine sediment deposited 10 to 50 m downstream of dredge outflows aggraded the channel, reduced substrate particle size, and increased substrate embeddedness. Other adverse effects on stream habitat included bank undercutting, bank sluicing, channelization, and riparian vegetation damage. A stream flow of approximately 24 cms during Water Year 1985 (October 1984 through September 1985) effectively obliterated instream mining disturbance from the previous season. At {{the onset of the}} 1985 dredge season less than ten percent of the area disturbed by 1984 dredging was visible. Direct observation of anadromous fish indicated that young???of???the???year steelhead abundance and the holding locations of adult spring???run chinook salmon and adult summer???run steelhead were not affected by <b>dredge</b> mining <b>operations.</b> Current California regulations limit suction dredge impacts by requiring permits, seasonal closures, aperture size restrictions, and exclusion from designated areas.
