5|$|While Drive {{is set in}} {{the present}} day, it carries a heavy 1980s {{atmosphere}} that is cautiously set from beginning to end and is underlined not only by the vehicles or music and clothes, but also by its architecture. The parts of the city seen in the Valley and by downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass, often leaving out more contemporary buildings. Drab background settings include the southern California commercial strip. As the Los Angeles Times pointed out, whenever gleaming buildings are shown, it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> being seen from a distance. Refn shot those scenes from a helicopter at night in Bunker Hill, Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
60|$|From a {{very early}} age, indeed, this false note in Dolly had begun to make itself heard. While she was yet quite a child, Herminia noticed with a certain tender but {{shrinking}} regret that Dolly seemed to attach undue importance to the mere upholsteries and equipages of life,--to rank, wealth, title, servants, carriages, jewelry. At first, to be sure, Herminia hoped this might prove but the passing foolishness of childhood: as Dolly grew up, however, it became clearer each day that the defect was in the grain--that Dolly's whole mind was incurably and congenitally aristocratic or snobbish. She had that mean admiration for birth, position, adventitious advantages, which is {{the mark of the}} beast in the essentially aristocratic or snobbish nature. She admired people <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> rich, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> high-placed, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> courted, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> respected; not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> good, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wise, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> noble-natured, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> respect-worthy.|$|R

Income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid {{up the price of}} real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Carbon dioxide sinks {{that store}} {{carbon dioxide in}} the Earth's crust by injecting it into the subsurface, or in the form of {{insoluble}} carbonate salts (mineral sequestration), are considered carbon negative. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> removing carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it indefinitely and presumably for a considerable duration (thousands to millions of years). However, Carbon Capture technology remains, at best, theoretical and is yet to reach more than 33% efficiency. Furthermore, this process could be rapidly undone, for example by earthquakes or mining.|$|E

25|$|Paternity {{confusion}} is proposed {{to be an}} adaptive function for preventing infanticide. Thus, if the female can successfully create paternity confusion, males will {{be less likely to}} kill her offspring, as the lack of paternity certainty means that they run the risk of killing their own genetic offspring. Additionally, the males, in turn, are likely to protect the same female's offspring from infanticide that may be committed by other adults within the species. Once again, this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> uncertain about paternity, and aim to protect infants that are genetically their own.|$|E
25|$|Most runestones {{were raised}} by men and only one runestone in eight is raised by a single woman, while at least 10% are raised by a woman {{together}} with several men. It is common that the runestones {{were raised by}} sons and widows of the deceased, but they could also be raised by sisters and brothers. It is almost only in Uppland, Södermanland, and Öland that women raised runestones together with male relatives. It is not known why many people such as sisters, brothers, uncles, parents, housecarls, and business partners can be enumerated on runestones, {{but it is possible}} that it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> part of the inheritors.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{atypical}} antipsychotics warn {{about the}} possibility of tardive dyskinesia in their package inserts and in the PDR. It is not possible to truly know the risks of tardive dyskinesia when taking atypicals, because tardive dyskinesia can take many decades to develop and the atypical antipsychotics are not old enough to have been tested over a long enough period of time to determine all of the long-term risks. One hypothesis as to why atypicals have a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> much less fat-soluble than the typical antipsychotics and because they are readily released from D2 receptor and brain tissue. The typical antipsychotics remain attached to the D2 receptors and accumulate in the brain tissue which may lead to TD.|$|E

25|$|When public administrators perform {{emotional}} labor, {{many scholars}} argue administrators {{are dealing with}} significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The reason for this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{on the front lines}} of the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.|$|E
25|$|After {{the carbon}} dioxide is split from the oxalosuccinate in the {{decarboxylation}} step (below right), the enol will tautomerize to the keto from. The formation of the ketone double bond is started by the deprotonation of that oxygen off the alpha carbon (C#2) by the same lysine that protonated the oxygen in the first place. The {{lone pair of electrons}} moves down kicking off the lone pairs that were making the double bond. This lone pair of electrons abstracts a proton off the Tyrosine that deprotonated the carboxyl group in the decarboxylation step. The reason that we can say that the Lys and Tyr residues will be the same from the previous step <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> helping in holding the isocitrate molecule in the active site of the enzyme. These two residues will be able to form hydrogen bonds back and forth {{as long as they are}} close enough to the substrate.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} ants with trap-jaws {{such as the}} extant Strumigenys, Mystrium, Myrmoteras and Anochetus along with the extinct Cretaceous age tribe Haidomyrmecini. One {{commonly}} accepted theory suggests that the trap-jaw actually evolved independently at least four different times in ants’ history. This is because {{with the use of}} DNA sequencing, the phylogenetic tree which found that those ants with trap-jaws were not nested neatly in one portion of the tree. Instead they were found scattered around the tree. Therefore, it did not evolve once leading to the hypothesis of a common ancestor. Instead it evolved multiple times and each time it evolved it used a different feature of the ant’s mouth to produce the trap jaw. For instance, O. bauri’s trap jaw is built from the mandible joint; however, Strumigenys trigger is built from it upper lip. This type of evolution would be deemed as convergent evolution and the trap jaw would be considered an analogy. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> all similar features but involved independently rather than a common ancestor.|$|E
