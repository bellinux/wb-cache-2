5|$|Maharashtraian Brahmins were {{absentee}} landlords {{and lived}} off the surplus without tilling the land themselves per ritual restrictions.

5|$|The game {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its approachable gameplay for newcomers and depth for veteran players.

5|$|The raids <b>had</b> <b>mixed</b> results. While {{significant}} damage was inflicted on Singapore's important naval base and commercial port, some raids on these targets were not successful and other attacks on oil storage facilities on islands near Singapore were ineffective.

The Allied air attacks were successful in raising the morale of Singapore's civilian population, who believed that the raids marked the impending liberation of the city. The overall number of civilian casualties from the bombings was low, though civilian workers were killed during attacks on military facilities; one attack rendered hundreds of people homeless.|$|E
