5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>policy.</b> As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
40|$|E-engagement <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> can {{be defined}} as citizens’ {{connection}} with and participation <b>in</b> making <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> The primary goal of connecting citizens during making <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> is to improve efficiency of the governance of government and the acceptance of <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> To enhance <b>public</b> engagement <b>in</b> making <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> the Hong Kong Government is trying out to take soundings from the community and to gauge public views on the government and <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> through social media platform, such as Facebook, twitters, blogs and so on. To evaluate the implementation of social media of the Hong Kong Government, including how the social media encourages <b>public</b> engagement <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> how and why the government employs the views collected from social media platforms <b>in</b> making <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> framework of <b>Public</b> Involvement Spectrum <b>in</b> Local Governance put forward by the International Association for Public Participation (IAP 2), its adapted form developed by Lukensmeyer and Torres and case studies methodology will be applied in this dissertation. This dissertation sought to understand more on the implementation of social media by the Hong Kong Government and what strategy should be applied by the government in e-engagement. This study suggested that the Hong Kong Government tend to use social media to inform, involve and collect views from the public rather than empowering the <b>public</b> <b>in</b> making <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> And the Hong Kong Government has successfully increased public awareness of certain <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> or issues through social media platform but the acceptance on certain policies or the support rating for the Government may not be benefited from the use of social media. Based on the analysis and observations from this study, it provides a useful and practical roadmap for future study and development of social media in e-engagement. published_or_final_versionPolitics and Public AdministrationMasterMaster of Public Administratio...|$|R
