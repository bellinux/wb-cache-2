5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each side on the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> during sidewards flying.|$|E
5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced inertial guidance system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided <b>directional</b> <b>control.</b> The missile was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E
50|$|Attack {{moves are}} {{executed}} by combinations of <b>directional</b> <b>controls</b> {{with the fire}} button for attacking the opponent's head, torso and legs. Weapons, like the ninjato, nunchaku, staff, shuriken and smoke bombs, can be equipped.|$|R

5|$|As Boyd took off, another C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel John Delmore {{closed in}} on Khâm Đức. At an {{altitude}} of about 300 to 400 feet, Delmore's aircraft began to receive North Vietnamese fire, and {{both sides of the}} cockpit were opened up by bullets that had ripped through the floorboards. Subsequently, just before touch down, Delmore and his co-pilot shut down the engine and forced the aircraft to remain upright. With no brakes and little <b>directional</b> <b>control,</b> the aircraft crashed into the CH-47 that had been destroyed early in the morning, but Delmore managed to turn his aircraft off the runway to avoid blocking it. When the aircraft had stopped completely, the five-man crew got out as quickly as they could. About 20 minutes later, U.S. soldiers on the ground guided them to safety, and they were rescued by a U.S. Marine CH-46. After witnessing the destruction of two C-130 Hercules, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin Montgomery landed his C-130 and extracted more than 150 Vietnamese civilians, and some CIDG and U.S. soldiers. Montgomery's aircraft suffered no hits, but the loadmaster was knocked down and trampled by panic-stricken Vietnamese civilians whilst trying to maintain order.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and <b>directional</b> <b>control.</b> It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The captain’s {{application}} of full throttle to both right-hand engines caused to airplane to turn {{further to the}} left due to the relative lack of thrust from the single functioning left-hand engine. This exacerbated his loss of <b>directional</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
50|$|Horizontal Mode {{that acts}} as a {{simulation}} to the original Arcade Mode view on Game Tengoku cabinets. If the television can not be propped to its side to play the new view, then the <b>directional</b> <b>controls</b> can be altered as an alternative.|$|R
50|$|Bangai-O, the player's mecha, is maneuvered via eight-way <b>directional</b> <b>controls</b> {{and fires}} in eight directions, {{controlled}} by the controller's four face buttons. Two firing modes are represented as switching between the two pilots (the current one is displayed at all times in a portrait): Riki fires red homing missiles and Mami fires blue lasers that bounce off walls.|$|R
50|$|This game is {{featured}} in full 3D, thus the <b>directional</b> <b>controls</b> change. Bomberman {{is able to}} walk in eight directions with a rotating camera facing in eight directions and with three different zoom levels. His bombs have a different effect than in other games of the series; the bomb's explosion waves have a spherical pattern, rather than the traditional cross-shaped ones.|$|R
25|$|Alpine stance: Used {{primarily}} for alpine racing, the leading foot may be from 50° up to around 70° and the trailing foot generally identical {{or up to}} 10˚ less. This gives the rider balance on their board, while angling their feet for best <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> at high speeds.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May 1955, F-BASQ of Air France made {{a forced}} landing {{in a field}} at Pont-Évêque, Isère {{following}} <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> problems in flight. The four crew and 46 passengers were unharmed. The aircraft was repaired on site and flown out from an improvised airstrip a few weeks later.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} flew at Hamble Aerodrome near Southampton in October 1921. As {{a result}} of test flying, the fuselage was lengthened by 6ft (2m) {{in order to improve}} <b>directional</b> <b>control,</b> being displayed in this form at the RAF Display at Hendon on 24 June, the second prototype flying in July with the lengthened fuselage and a modified undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|The Apollo Command Module had a set {{of twelve}} hypergolic {{thrusters}} for attitude <b>control,</b> and <b>directional</b> re-entry <b>control</b> similar to Gemini.|$|R
50|$|GKART is a kart racing game of {{extremely}} simplified keyboard <b>control.</b> Besides <b>directional</b> <b>controls,</b> the fundamental keys of GKART are Drifting and Nitrous boost. In speed mode, drifting accumulates N2O, which converts into usable speed boost when a full tank is reached. In props mode, various items {{can be used}} to hinder opponents’ race. Hence GKART is designed for both casual players and professional racers. GKART also features a comprehensive avatar system to satisfy players’ pursuit of uniqueness.|$|R

25|$|An {{autopilot}} used a Rate integrating gyroscope for <b>directional</b> <b>control.</b> The rate integrating gyroscope {{could be}} pre-programmed {{to turn the}} SM-73. Pitch and roll control were provided by elevons either operating in phase or asymmetrically. Yaw control was provided by a rudder. The control system positioned flight controls by sending electrical signals to hydraulic actuators located at each flight control.|$|E
25|$|The final variant was the S.O.1120 Ariel III {{which had}} a {{combined}} Turbomeca Arrius turbine-compressor rather than the two units of the earlier aircraft. With the space made from the power changes an extra seat was fitted. Another difference was the tail unit, the Ariel II had a single fin and rudder and used jet efflux from the turbine to provide <b>directional</b> <b>control,</b> a directional vane linked to the rudder directed the efflux.|$|E
25|$|Testing quickly {{demonstrated}} {{that the idea of}} using a single engine to provide air for both the lift curtain and forward flight required too many trade-offs. A Blackburn Marboré for forward thrust and two large vertical rudders for <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> were added, producing the SR.N1 Mk II. A further upgrade with the Armstrong Siddeley Viper produced the Mk III. Further modifications, especially the addition of pointed nose and stern areas, produced the Mk IV.|$|E

50|$|The {{player has}} four-way <b>directional</b> <b>controls,</b> left, right, {{up and down}} (for {{climbing}} ladders) {{and there are also}} separate keys for jump, firing a fireball, picking up objects and using a spell book. Energy can be replenished by finding hearts hidden in caskets, although some caskets contain daemons instead, which drain the player's energy. The game does have a time limit, but extra time is gained by openening doors and solving puzzles, so the player must work out a logical sequence of puzzle-solving such that the clock does not run down to zero.|$|R
25|$|L6844 first flew on 11 October 1938, {{construction}} {{having been}} delayed chiefly due to the new features and {{also because of the}} late delivery of the engines. L6844 was passed to RAE Farnborough {{at the end of the}} year, while further service trials were later carried out at Martlesham Heath. The Whirlwind exhibited excellent handling characteristics and proved to be very easy to fly at all speeds. The only exception was the inadequate <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> during take-off which necessitated an increased rudder area above the tailplane.|$|E
25|$|The SR.N1 was {{powered by}} a 450hp Alvis Leonides engine {{powering}} a vertical fan {{in the middle of}} the craft. In addition to providing the lift air, a portion of the airflow was bled off into two channels on either side of the craft, which could be directed to provide thrust. In normal operation this extra airflow was directed rearward for forward thrust, and blew over two large vertical rudders that provided <b>directional</b> <b>control.</b> For low-speed maneuverability, the extra thrust could be directed fore or aft, differentially for rotation.|$|E
25|$|The typical plesiosaur had a broad, flat, {{body and}} a short tail. Plesiosaurs {{retained}} their ancestral two pairs of limbs, which had evolved into large flippers. Plesiosaurs {{were related to the}} earlier Nothosauridae, that had a more crocodile-like body. The flipper arrangement is unusual for aquatic animals in that probably all four limbs were used to propel the animal through the water by up-and-down movements. The tail was most likely only used for helping in <b>directional</b> <b>control.</b> This contrasts to the ichthyosaurs and the later mosasaurs, in which the tail provided the main propulsion.|$|E

40|$|What is a {{magnetic}} water treatment device? Typically, these devices are permanent magnets or electromagnets that attach to waterlines entering {{homes and businesses}} to “purify ” or “condition” water supplies. Manufacturers adopt a variety of commercial names for their products from the complex—”patented <b>directional</b> <b>controlled</b> magnet,” “Perm-core, ” and “Magnetizer”—to the simple— ”metal bar ” or “plug-in treatment device. ” Typically, the devices purportedly use electro-magnetic fields to change the molecular makeup of various water constituents like calcium and iron to other more “inert ” forms. The claimed result is a reduction or elimination of water contaminants. On...|$|R
50|$|The game {{consists}} of manipulable images (and usually sounds) {{generated by a}} video game console and displayed on a television or similar audio-video system. The game itself is usually controlled and manipulated using a handheld device connected to the console, called a controller. The controller generally contains a number of buttons and <b>directional</b> <b>controls,</b> (such as analogue joysticks), {{each of which has}} been assigned a purpose for interacting with and controlling the images on the screen. The display, speakers, console, and controls of a console can also be incorporated into one small object known as a handheld game.|$|R
25|$|May 23, 2001: The right main {{landing gear}} of an American Airlines Fokker 100, {{registration}} number N1419D, operating as AA Flight 1107, collapsed upon landing on runway 17C after a scheduled flight from Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. The pilot was able to maintain <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> and bring the aircraft to {{a stop on the}} runway. The incident was attributed to metal fatigue caused by a manufacturing flaw in the right main gear's outer cylinder; there were no serious injuries to the 88 passengers or 4 crew, but the aircraft was written off.|$|E
25|$|Lifting {{bodies were}} also {{developed}} using unpowered prototypes. Although the idea can be dated to Vincent Justus Burnelli in 1921, interest was nearly non-existent until {{it appeared to}} be a solution for returning spacecraft. Traditional space capsules have little <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> while conventionally winged craft cannot handle the stresses of re-entry, whereas a lifting body combines the benefits of both. The lifting bodies use the fuselage itself to generate lift without employing the usual thin and flat wing so as to minimize the drag and structure of a wing for very high supersonic or hypersonic flight as might be experienced during the re-entry of a spacecraft. Examples of type are the Northrop HL-10 and Martin-Marietta X-24.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} tail or vertical stabilizer of a multi-engine aircraft plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining <b>directional</b> <b>control</b> while an engine fails or is inoperative. The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment. This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the VMCA will be. However, a larger tail is more costly and harder to accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of slipstreams. Engineers designing the {{vertical tail}} must make a decision based on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum bank angle of 5° (away from the inoperative engine), as stated by FAR.|$|E
