Through dance, Ms. Yatkin seeks what Isaiah Berlin refers to as an “awareness of the deep currents” - a comprehension {{of the connection between}} all things, an awareness of the present as well as that which transcends time and space. The paths along this quest are numerous (each culture and each time period has their own variant of the theme).

40|$|Disordered Listening’ was {{a two-day}} {{workshop}} run by Cathy Lane at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, with PhD in Practice candidates and postgrad researchers from other European countries. ‘Disordering Listening – a practical seminar’ is a collective {{investigation into the}} role and potentials of listening, considering sound-based practice around listening in relation to social and political subjects and subjectivities. In particular exploring acts and organizations of listening that are embedded in daily life and that activate multiple responses: philosophical, psychological, phenomenological, perceptual, conceptual, political, etc. To “disorder” listening would be to <b>embrace</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> responses transversally, rather than isolating “listening” as an autonomous category of experience. We propose to use the workshop as a platform for research into questions about how knowledge is generated around listening and how listening can constitute a critical practice. 1. What are our habits of hearing and listening? 2. What is the knowledge of listening that we are accustomed to? 3. What are the epistemic, ethical, political and cosmological modes of critical listening? Where do we locate these modes within our subjective discourses and experiences? 4. What could it mean to propose a “decolonial” mode of listening? We are particularly interested in exploring activist and feminist approaches and approaches that consider urbanist and geopolitical perspectives. Cathy Lane is Professor of Sound Arts at University of the Arts London. She established the department of Sound Arts and Design at London College of Communication and now co - directs Creative Research in Sound Arts Practice (CRiSAP). She is currently using the Her Noise Archive {{as a catalyst for}} research into gender in sound arts practice. Cathy Lane is interested how sound relates to the past, our histories, our environment and our collective and individual memories. This informs her current work as a composer, sound artist, lecturer and researcher. Aspects of her creative practice have developed out of these interests and include composition and installation-based work with spoken word, field recordings and archive material. She also writes and lectures on these and related subjects as well as collaborating with choreographers, film makers, visual artists and other musicians...|$|E

Influenced by the cult of nature, creators produced a poetic, symbolic, dreamlike set of images and ideas; at the same time, scientists, experiencing the reper­cussions of Darwinism, were initiating the debate between creationists and evolutionists. Anti-mate­rialistic and idealistic thinking, which in some cases had coincided with the postulates of the theories of evolution, shaped the framework of sensibilities of the Symbolist movement, in which the landscapes of the soul ranged from approaching the unconscious to voyaging to unexplored islands.

This paper identifies some key life-cycle issues associated with interim safe storage (ISS) of ILW, and also {{some of the key}} features of existing stores. Important risk management issues include store design and environmental controls, conditioning and packaging, package handling and cranes, operation, monitoring of waste packages, package retrieval, external environmental factors, stakeholder issues and costs. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> issues will need to be addressed during the design, construction and operation of an ILW store. Given the wide and diverse range of issues requiring consideration, {{it may be difficult to}} choose between alternative design concepts or risk management strategies. We demonstrate a multi-criteria decision analysis approach to ILW storage in which the various attributes of alternative store designs and management strategies are scored and collectively compared using the program OnBalance. By varying the weighting of the different attributes, the sensitivity of the overall score of the various designs to their attributes may be evaluated. Ultimately, the technical issues related to store design, construction and operation will have to be balanced against the non-technical factors that may influence the development of a store, particularly those related to stakeholder interactions and public concerns. Developing a long-term interim storage strategy requires a holistic approach that <b>embraces</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{encompassing}} Sustainable Leadership {{and developing}} leaders sustainably {{are still in}} infancy (Lambert, 2011). Nevertheless indications identify leadership as a vital cog in achieving sustainable organisations. Sustainable leadership can allow a fast, resilient response which is competitive and appealing to all stakeholders (Avery and Bergsteiner, 2011). Arguably, organisations’ need to stop considering leadership as a control function (Casserley and Critchley, 2010; Crews, 2010) and instead focus on dialogue and mutual-interdependency between leaders and their followers (Barrand Dowding, 2012). This paper aims to explore and analyse the concept of sustainable leadership to present a conceptual framework surrounding sustainable leadership. Design/methodology/approachThis conceptual paper will review the existing frameworks of sustainable leadership and present a conceptualisation of the frameworks. This conceptualisation synthesises frameworks and literature surrounding the concept of sustainable leadership which involves work from seminal authors Casserley and Critchley (2010),Avery and Bergsteiner (2011), Hargreaves and Fink (2006), Davies (2009) and Lambert (2011). Seminal themes from the synthesised frameworks are presented to explore and unify the conceptualisation of sustainable leadership. FindingsWithin leadership literature, stakeholder approaches (Groves and LaRocca, 2011; Avery and Bergsteiner, 2011 a); discourses underlining the importance of relationship between leaders and followers (Barr and Dowding, 2012); and discussions about theneed to develop reflexive and participative leadership models (Kopp and Martinuzzi, 2013) have become prominent. Sustainable leadership <b>embraces</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> new components. The concept advocates organisations should shift emphasis from a traditional singular focus on finances, to a view that organisations are contributors to wider environmental and social influences (Crews, 2010; Avery and Bergsteiner, 2011 a). Originality/valueThis paper explores the theoretical frameworks which surround sustainable leadership and will synthesise and present commonly referenced facets of the concept within {{the internal and external}} factors influencing sustainable leadership framework...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Arch.) -University of Natal, Durban, 2001. The Msinga magisterial district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa {{is notable}} {{because it has}} for many years been {{regarded}} socially as a pariah region by residents of the Province. Over the decades {{it has been a}} 'dumping ground' for people and cultures, an infertile land where gun-running, the illegal cultivation of marijuana, and continuous stock theft has relieved some of the abject poverty, but has also exacerbated the local incidence of faction fighting. However, the people of the area have responded to this ongoing social submission by reacting with creativity and colour in their clothing, cultural goods and homesteads. The cultural material of the district is, in my opinion, unsurpassed anywhere else in the Province, from the traditional interpretation of the Msinga dolls to the exuberant architecture of the contemporary homestead. The layout and elevational resolution of any type of vernacular homestead, defined by Oliver in the first chapter, is a result of a broad number of factors, most importantly resources in terms of materials, economy, climate and culture. The response of the people of Msinga in the Tugela Valley <b>embraces</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors to produce a surprising resolution that distills a fresh response to the architectural depiction of a social emergence from the peasantry. The internationally acknowledged prominent form of Zulu architecture, the beehive hut, has been adequately documented in the past. Biermann, Walton and Knuffel carried out different levels of work on this building type from the 1950 s onwards. Nowadays, dwindling natural resources in KwaZulu-Natal have resulted {{in the creation of a}} new set of vernacular architectures, responding to the environment and resources available, and reflecting the specific needs of the builders, from the expression of social and economic values, to the pragmatic reality of protection from 'political strife. On the one hand, the buildings. in the Msinga Valley are changing rapidly with the natural life course of each building. However, on the other, the development of new architectural styles with the continual building of new units within homesteads demonstrates a dynamic architectural and decorative tradition. The co-existence of the material cultures of Msinga and their architectural expression has to be documented and an attempt made at analysis. The threat of indigenous vemacular traditions disappearing at the expense of development is visible on the horizon. Regional planning initiatives are pressured to deliver houses and services on a large scale, which would be severely detrimental to the continuance of a vernacular architectural tradition. The architectural culture, although currently dynamic, is at risk, and thus begs for documentation. I aim to present the unique decorative tradition of Msinga as an architecture within the contexts of place and extant material culture. Adopting anything but a broad socio-cultural perspective in this case is both short-sighted and ill-focussed. The architecture of rural areas is a material culture that is embedded in the history, social and political struggles, and economic strife. Yet, in contrast with these negative influences, it demonstrates an exuberance that is continued in the other material cultures in Msinga. I begin with an overview, pull out the thread of Msinga as an area, then distil the material culture and, ultimately, the architecture and the decoration...|$|R
40|$|This {{collaborative}} research project, {{supported by the}} British Library, used {{a case study of}} the library collection for social enterprise to develop a conceptual approach to the library collection in the digital world, exploring stakeholder perceptions of collections, terminology and collection development and management processes. A mixed-methods multiphase case study design was used to address the research questions. Three strands of data collection are described: a case study of the British Library’s collections and content for social enterprise, searches for relevant material on 88 publicly accessible UK library catalogues, and an exploratory sequential study involving stakeholder interviews (19 interviews with 18 people) followed by two surveys of a larger stakeholder population (149 completed responses in total). Findings from each strand are described and three core concepts of collection are identified: “collection-as-thing”, “collection-as-process” and “collection-as-access”. Conventional views of library collections may tend to focus more on the idea of “collection -as-thing”; this research emphasises the importance of taking a more dynamic view of collection. Three models of collection are described: a revised collection development hierarchy which suggests links to different levels of strategic management; a model of interrelationships between the three concepts of collection; and a model which examines how collection adds value to content by providing context. This research demonstrates that the concept of collection remains highly relevant in the digital world, although the onus is on libraries to <b>embrace</b> <b>all</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>these</b> three concepts <b>of</b> collection if they wish to add maximum value to the content they identify, select, hold, make accessible and to which they connect...|$|R
