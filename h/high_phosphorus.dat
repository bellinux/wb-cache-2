5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly <b>high</b> <b>phosphorus</b> levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E
500|$|The most {{economically}} {{important aspect}} of the geology of the area is the Northampton Sands ironstone formation. This is a marine sand of Jurassic age (Bajocian stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt% iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their <b>high</b> <b>phosphorus</b> content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the Bessemer steel making process and the [...] "basic slag" [...] smelting chemistry, which combine to make high quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to World War II, being the best developed bulk iron producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional dip of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.|$|E
500|$|Temperatures {{estimated}} for the erupted rocks cover a wide range, {{with some}} exceeding [...] These rocks are of enigmatic origin, {{which may be}} geothermal or magmatic, {{with the presence of}} lava bombs of magnetite lava supporting the magmatic origin theory. Other viewpoints consider the texture and chemical composition of the rocks as evidence that metasomatism of andesitic rocks formed the magnetite [...] "lavas". The role of a post-magmatic fluid phase, which was inferred from inclusions in crystals, has also been suggested. Some magnetite was oxidized to hematite, probably under the influence of rainwater as indicated by isotope analysis. Only a minor amount of hematite is primary. Isotope data indicate that the formation of this magnetite magma was accompanied by the segregation of plagioclase. This plagioclase may have generated the rhyodacite lava dome. An iron-phosphate-rich magma generated the magnetite lava flows after release of volatile substances. The magma was probably bordering on forming a two-phase melt containing nelsonite and rhyolite. A favourable tectonic context associated with the compression of the magma chamber and the presence of faults helped with the eruption of the magnetite. The magma formation probably occurred in a magma chamber. During the cooling of the magma, the ores formed. This process was probably not directed by water-rich phases, and the segregation occurred at a shallow depth. <b>High</b> <b>phosphorus</b> and volatile content may have lowered the melting point of the magma and facilitated its eruption, as well as overcoming density-based constraints on the eruption of iron-rich magmas. Suggestions that anatexis of iron-rich sediments generated the iron-rich magmas appear implausible. The ultimate origin of the El Laco iron may be subducted metal-containing sediment.|$|E

For the determination of the phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon contents of aquatic macrophyte species, aerial and submerged plant structures (leaves, roots, and stems) were used; RESULTS: In Camargo Lake, which has a poor connection with the river during the dry period (August 1998), the highest nitrogen content was obtained for Salvinia auriculata Aublet, while the <b>highest</b> <b>phosphorus</b> contest was observed for Eichhornia azurea (Swartz) Kunth.

Para a determinação do conteúdo de fósforo, nitrogênio e carbono das espécies de macrófitas aquáticas, estruturas aéreas e submersas dos vegetais (folhas, raízes e caules) foram usadas; RESULTADOS: Na Lagoa do Camargo, que tem baixa associação com o rio durante o período seco (agosto 1998), o conteúdo mais alto de fósforo e nitrogênio foi encontrado em Salvinia auriculata Aublet.
