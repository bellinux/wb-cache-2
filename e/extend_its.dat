5|$|As the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} the East, Kentucky's {{settlers}} became involved in a dispute about the region's sovereignty. Richard Henderson, a judge and land speculator from North Carolina, had purchased much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in an illegal treaty. Henderson intended to create a proprietary colony known as Transylvania, but many Kentucky settlers did not recognize Transylvania's authority over them. In June 1776, these settlers selected Clark and John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly, asking Virginia to formally <b>extend</b> <b>its</b> boundaries to include Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Norwegian {{authorities}} {{decided to}} <b>extend</b> <b>its</b> operations in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station.

Construction was carried out from December 2004 through February 2005. To ease logistics, Norway took the initiative to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs. The permanent Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005.|$|E

The government stated that the investment was motivated to improve climate research, to strengthen Norway as a bi-polar research nation and to strengthen Norway's role as a premise-maker in the environmental policy of the Antarctic.|$|E

5|$|It mostly breeds in acacia and {{tamarisk}} scrub {{and tall}} grass, invariably near rivers or other wetlands. The construction {{and expansion of}} irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it <b>extend</b> <b>its</b> range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India. It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, it moves away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.|$|E

The rail lines eventually transitioned to freight during the 1940s as the United States Numbered Highway system developed. The city population reached 11,429 in 1940.|$|E

5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted {{in a sealed}} container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and <b>extend</b> <b>its</b> bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers.

Following the liberation of France by the Western Allies in 1944, U-boat activity in many Norwegian ports increased. With the French ports captured or cut off, many German U-boats re-located to Norwegian port cities.|$|E
