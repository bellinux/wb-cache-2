5|$|Partitions of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century {{brought an}} end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna {{established}} a semi-independent Kingdom of Poland (known as Congress Kingdom) under control of and in personal union with the Russian Empire. The King (Tsar) of Poland at that time used a white royal banner <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> arms of the Congress Kingdoma black double-headed Russian eagle with the Polish White Eagle in an inescutcheon.|$|E
5|$|In August 1919, the Sejm (lower {{house of}} parliament) of the renascent Republic of Poland adopted a law {{defining}} the Banner of the Republic of Poland (chorągiew Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej). The banner {{was part of}} the insignia of the head of statethe State Leader (Naczelnik Państwa) and, later, President of the Republic. It was plain red <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crowned White Eagle and bordered with a wężyk generalski, a wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of general's rank. It was modified on December 27, 1927 to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms.|$|E

50|$|Possibly {{the most}} famous of the forecasters is the now semi-retired Michael Fish. Famous for his {{informal}} manner and eccentric dress sense (he once wore a blue and green blazer <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> all <b>the</b> weather symbols), he was a viewer favourite despite an unfortunate comment before the Great Storm of 1987.|$|R
5|$|In {{the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), a banner of the Commonwealth was also used, {{combining}} the heraldic symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> arms of the Commonwealth which consisted of the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white (Argent) charges in a red (Gules) field, these two colors started {{to be used for}} the entire banner. During the 17th century, the banner was usually divided into two, three or four horizontal, often swallow-tailed, stripes of red and white.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{had begun}} {{experiencing}} {{serious health problems}} since his first heart attack in June 1971, and underwent treatment and procedures for ten years. On 16 June 1981, he experienced a massive heart attack and died. Two days later his memorial service {{was held at the}} Flinders Street Baptist Church. The funeral procession carried his coffin from the city, along Magill and Old Norton Summit Roads where thousands turned out to pay their respects, to the Norton Summit cemetery where his forebears had been buried. There his gravestone was <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> phrase: 'a good man who did good things'.|$|E
5|$|Special state service flags {{are used}} by state-employed civil {{special-purpose}} ships while on duty. These flags all follow the same basic design; a white flag with a horizontal stripe whose width is 1/5 of the flag's width. In the middle, each flag is <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> national coat of arms superimposed on a golden or yellow anchor whose height is 3/5 of the flag's width. The middle stripe is broken {{in the middle and}} does not touch the anchor or the arms. The type of special service performed by the ship is indicated by the color of the middle stripe.|$|E
5000|$|The Merchants Guild is a guild of {{traders and}} merchants.

5|$|The Italian Constitution {{does not}} make {{provision}} for a Vice-President. However, separate insignia for the President of the Senate, in exercise of duties as acting head of state under Article 86, was created in 1986. This has a white square on the blue field, charged with {{the arms of the}} Republic in silver. Distinguishing insignia for former Presidents of the Republic was created in 2001; a tricolour {{in the style of the}} Presidential standard, it is <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cypher of Honour of the President of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, at the Sibiu Conference of 26 April/8 May 1848, Transylvanian revolutionaries {{had also}} adopted a blue-white-red {{national}} flag (vertical, {{according to the}} memoirs of George Bariţ). It was <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> words “VIRTUTEA ROMANĂ REÎNVIATĂ” (“ROMAN VIRTUE RESURRECTED”). A number of contemporary sources attests these colors (including the Blaj newspaper Organul naţionale and Alexandru Papiu Ilarian’s Istorie a românilor din Dacia superioară). They had a twofold significance: their importance in Romanian costume and their union of the Transylvanian principality’s old colors (blue and red) with the white symbolizing peace. It appears that the two specimens with blue-yellow-red stripes preserved today at the National Museum of Romanian History were made later to commemorate the events at Blaj; yellow replaced white {{as a symbol of}} Romanian Transylvanians’ desire to join Romania.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} Greek flag of {{blue and}} white cross was first hoisted during the Greek War of Independence in March 1822. This was later modified so that the shade of blue matched that of the Bavarian coat of arms of the first King of Greece, Otto. The shield is <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coat of arms of the Danish Royal Family, and the supporters on either side are also adapted from the Danish royal arms. Beneath the shield is the motto in Greek, Ἰσχύς μου ἡ αγάπη του λαου ("The people's love is my strength"). Beneath the motto dangles the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer, Greece's premier decoration of honor.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} vexilloids (flag-like objects) used in Poland {{were known}} as stanice and probably resembled the Roman vexillum, that is a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal crosspiece attached to a wooden pole or spear. They served as both religious and military symbols as early as 10th century. With Poland's conversion to Christianity in 966, the stanice were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones. The royal banner of arms {{dates back to the}} reign of King Boleslaus the Generous (r.1076–1079), but it was during the reign of King Vladislaus the Elbow-High (r.1320–1333) that a red cloth <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> White Eagle of the arms of Poland was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of royal authority used at coronations and in battles.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{behind the}} church is Tre Kronor castle. Destroyed by fire in 1697 and {{subsequently}} replaced by the Stockholm Palace, it was named after the central citadel, a large gun tower <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Three Crowns symbol, known as the first building in Stockholm and a symbol for the Swedish Crown. While {{it is not known}} when the symbol was first added to the citadel (it became the national coat of arms in the late 14th century), it was gilded during the 16th century. Again, the painting is strictly accurate, as the 1540s enlargement of the tower is not present in the image. The castle's eastern wing, the king's personal residence, was destroyed by fire in 1525 and in letters ten years later the king, burdened by debts of war to Lübeck, expressed his indignation over the fact that the reconstruction was still not completed. In the painting {{to the right of the}} church the eastern wing is accurately depicted as under construction, the exposed roof trusses confirming the inconvenience experienced by the monarch.|$|E
5|$|With the {{establishment}} of a dynastic union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1386, it became customary to use two bannersPolish and Lithuanianas equally important insignia of royal authority. In the mid-16th century, before the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (real union) in 1569, a single banner for the entire entity also came into use. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> arms of the Commonwealth which combined the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). During the 17th century, the banner was often divided into three or four horizontal stripes of white and red, ending with swallowtails. Elective kings' dynastic arms were often placed in an inescutcheon. Variants with the White Eagle and the Pursuer placed side by side without an escutcheon directly in the field or with the Eagle on the obverse and the Pursuit on the reverse side of the banner were also used.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1850s one of {{the school}} {{performances}} opened with herald walking <b>with</b> flags <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> May bugs; <b>the</b> director and all present were very pleased with this symbol.

5000|$|The statue has {{not been}} {{examined}} by archaeologists, but a Reuters report published in The Guardian attests to [...] "a few blurred photographs of the intact deity, who is laid out incongruously on a blanket <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> Smurfs". <b>The</b> evidence dates the statue to between the 5th century BC and the 1st century BC. The statue depicts Apollo with curly hair and one eye possibly inlaid with a blue stone iris, standing upright with an outstretched arm, and with his palm held up.|$|R

25|$|In {{military}} organizations, {{the practice}} of carrying colours, standards or guidons, both {{to act as a}} rallying point for troops and to mark the location of the commander, is thought to have originated in Ancient Egypt some 5,000 years ago. The Roman Empire also made battle standards a part of their vast armies. It was formalized in the armies of Europe in the High Middle Ages, with standards being <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> commander's coat of arms.|$|E
