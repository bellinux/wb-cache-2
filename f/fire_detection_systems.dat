40|$|Abstract — The {{reliability}} of the grid connected photovoltaic system is primarily and strongly depends on the {{reliability of}} the electrical protection systems, failure of which may lead to fire. So a <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> is the crucial component in a grid connected PV system. So its reliability is directed related to the overall {{reliability of the}} PV system. A literature review of reliability data of <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> was made resulting to rough estimates of some failure frequencies. No theoretical or technical articles on the structure of reliability models of these installations were found. In this paper the classifications of failure severity were made from the system point of view by counting failures of components when possible. Since there are no established fault tree structures available for <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> in photovoltaics, these component failure frequencies are intended {{to be used in the}} first round of iteration in the fault trees suggested here. The analysis leads to the necessity of the estimation of reliability of <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> for the assessment of {{the reliability of the}} grid connected photovoltaic power system...|$|R

40|$|Optical fibres {{together}} with a helium-neon laser is proposed {{to be used as}} a new <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system.</b> This has been investigated experimentally and reported in this paper. Results on the coupling loss, bending loss, extinction loss of the fibres due to smoke and refraction loss through hot air shimmer are described. Comparison with the performance of common optical and ionization detectors is made. Experimental results indicate that the optical signal would be significantly changed when there is smoke. Hence it is highly probable that a new <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> can be designed using laser-fibre optics. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.
