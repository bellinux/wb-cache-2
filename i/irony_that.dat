The publication noted the <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} enquiries {{from other}} clubs, he stayed at Vicarage Road for pre-season, {{in the hope}} of regaining his match fitness. After proving that he had recovered, Gibbs was offered a short term contract at the club, which was eventually extended. Newly relegated Watford finished 13th of 24 teams in 1996–97. They conceded 38 goals in 46 league matches, the joint-best defensive record in the division. Gibbs missed just one of the club's 57 fixtures, scoring in a game against Brentford. The defender later noted the <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> having been released as an injury concern, he ended up playing more games the following season than any of his teammates.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{lamented the}} effects of his drug use and noted the <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> the drugs did not do much to improve the {{consistency}} of his performances. On his return to international competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use: in the 100m final at the 2006 European Championships, Chambers ran a sub-par 10.24s and finished in fifth place. He {{was part of the}} gold medal-winning British 4×100m team, but Darren Campbell, who was angry about losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers' ban, refused to join the team in a celebratory lap. After the competition, Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football and completed a week-long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{count of}} those killed during the uprising was 260 people; historians place the number of dead higher. The Zimbabwe National Army suffered no fatal casualties. Binda calls the battle the RAR's greatest victory, writing that the troops were greatly outnumbered, but won through superior professionalism and discipline. Several analysts comment on the <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> Mugabe and ZANU–PF were saved from a major rebellion by white-led ex-Rhodesian troops. The battle was the RAR's last; its personnel were reassigned to other units when it was disbanded later in 1981. The rebellion's defeat, meanwhile, prompted mass desertions by ZIPRA guerrillas fearing retribution from the Mugabe administration. Indeed, the uprising partially fuelled Mugabe's bloody Gukurahundi campaign against Matabeleland later in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, {{there was}} often a {{strategy}} of nominally accepting Brown, but tacitly resisting it. On May 18, 1954 the Greensboro, North Carolina school board declared that it would abide by the Brown ruling. This {{was the result of}} the initiative of D.E. Hudgins Jr, a former Rhodes Scholar and prominent attorney, who chaired the school board. This made Greensboro the first, and for years the only, city in the South, to announce its intent to comply. However, others in the city resisted integration, putting up legal obstacles to the actual implementation of school desegregation for years afterward, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971, after numerous local lawsuits and both nonviolent and violent demonstrations. Historians have noted the <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> Greensboro, which had heralded itself as such a progressive city, was one of the last holdouts for school desegregation.|$|E

A distinction is drawn between the <b>ironies</b> <b>that</b> are endemic in all organizations and rooted in ambiguities and dilemmas, and the <b>ironies</b> <b>that</b> specifically flow from the disjunction between central policies and the contingent circumstances of individual schools. A further distinction is made between the ironies of policy and the ironies of practice, the latter characterized by the strategies used by headteachers and teachers as they adapt policy to practice and as they represent these adaptations as fulfilling accountability requirements. A case is made for principled infidelity as a component of temperate leadership and management which acts as an antidote to ov these give ri...|$|R

40|$|In {{interpersonal}} communication, stereotypes {{are predominantly}} transmitted through language. Linguistic bias theory presupposes that speakers systematically vary their language when communicating stereotype-consistent and stereotype-inconsistent information. We investigate whether these findings {{can be extended}} to verbal irony use. The <b>irony</b> bias posits <b>that</b> <b>irony</b> is more appropriate to communicate stereotype-inconsistent than stereotype-consistent information. Three experiments support this hypothesis by showing <b>that</b> <b>irony</b> is found more appropriate (Experiments 1 - 2) and used more often (Experiment 3) in stereotype-inconsistent than in stereotype-consistent situations. Furthermore, linguistic biases have important communicative consequences, because they implicitly serve to maintain stereotypic expectancies. Experiment 4 shows <b>that</b> <b>irony</b> shares this characteristic with other linguistic biases, in that irony—compared to literal language—leads to more external attribution. Taken together, {{these results indicate that}} stereotypic expectancies are subtly revealed and confirmed by verbal <b>irony,</b> and <b>that</b> verbal <b>irony</b> {{plays an important role in}} stereotype communication and maintenance...|$|R

25|$|Elements of the Protocols were plagiarized from Joly's fictional Dialogue in Hell, {{a thinly}} veiled {{attack on the}} {{political}} ambitions of Napoleon III, who, represented by the non-Jewish character Machiavelli, plots to rule the world.

The Guardian pointed out the <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> the state is working to execute Granville Oliver against Washingtonians' consensus when so many other African American men die on the street. and called this an original argument against the death penalty. The New York Times compared the depiction of violence growing from smaller actions {{to the work of}} Richard Price. Pelecanos has described the book as an anti-detective novel because no case is solved by the private investigators and they are constantly a step behind the police.|$|E

25|$|Just after Didi and Gogo {{have been}} {{particularly}} selfish and callous, the boy comes to say that Godot is not coming. The boy (or pair of boys) may be seen to represent meekness and hope before compassion is consciously excluded by an evolving personality and character, and in which case may be the youthful Pozzo and Lucky. Thus Godot is compassion and fails to arrive every day, as he says he will. No-one is concerned that a boy is beaten. In this interpretation, there is the <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> only by changing their hearts to be compassionate can the characters fixed to the tree move on and cease {{to have to wait}} for Godot.|$|E
25|$|Capp portrayed {{himself in}} a cameo role in the Bob Hope film That Certain Feeling, for which he also {{provided}} promotional art. He was interviewed live on Person to Person on November 27, 1959, by host Charles Collingwood. He also appeared as himself on The Ed Sullivan Show, Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, The Red Skelton Show, The Merv Griffin Show, The Mike Douglas Show, and guested on Ralph Edwards' This Is Your Life on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, {{in a wide variety}} of publications including Life, Show, Pageant, The Atlantic, Esquire, Coronet, and The Saturday Evening Post. Capp was impersonated by comedians Rich Little and David Frye. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends Milton Caniff and Walt Kelly), and—with an <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> would become apparent later—a brand of cigarettes, (Chesterfield).|$|E

500|$|Hundreds {{of people}} died in the uprising. The {{official}} count released at the time was 260, but historians place the number higher; Martin Meredith records [...] "more than 300" [...] dead, while Alexandre Binda writes that the Zimbabwe National Army units alone killed over 400 guerrillas. The Zimbabwe National Army reported no fatal casualties. Hill and Husher were each awarded the Bronze Cross of Zimbabwe for their part in putting down the rebellion, while Dyck received the Silver Cross. In his history of the Rhodesian African Rifles, Binda describes Entumbane as the regiment's greatest victory, commenting that it was won [...] "by dint of professionalism, discipline and determination" [...] in the face of forces that were far larger numerically. Major Michael P Stewart of the United States Army writes that 1RAR's actions at Entumbane [...] "saved Mugabe's government from certain civil war", and provided the [...] "final blow to the military might of ZIPRA". A number of analysts comment on the <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> Mugabe and ZANU–PF, who had spent years fighting white rule and the Rhodesian forces during the 1970s, were secured in power barely a year after the Bush War's end by ex-Rhodesian troops under white command. Binda furthermore highlights the <b>irony</b> <b>that</b> the RAR's finest hour (in his view) came while fighting for Mugabe.|$|E
