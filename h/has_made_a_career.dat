2500|$|Gladwell's {{critics have}} {{described}} him as prone to oversimplification. The New Republic called the final chapter of Outliers, [...] "impervious to all forms of critical thinking" [...] and said Gladwell believes [...] "a perfect anecdote proves a fatuous rule". Gladwell has also been criticized for his emphasis on anecdotal evidence over research to support his conclusions. Maureen Tkacik and Steven Pinker have challenged the integrity of Gladwell's approach. Even while praising Gladwell's writing style and content, Pinker summed up Gladwell as [...] "a minor genius who unwittingly demonstrates the hazards of statistical reasoning", while accusing him of [...] "cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies" [...] in his book Outliers. Referencing a Gladwell reporting mistake in which Gladwell refers to [...] "eigenvalue" [...] as [...] "Igon Value", Pinker criticizes his lack of expertise: [...] "I will call this the Igon Value Problem: when a writer's education on a topic consists in interviewing an expert, he is apt to offer generalizations that are banal, obtuse or flat wrong." [...] A writer in The Independent accused Gladwell of posing [...] "obvious" [...] insights. The Register has accused Gladwell of making arguments by weak analogy and commented Gladwell has an [...] "aversion for fact", adding: [...] "Gladwell <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> out of handing simple, vacuous truths to people and dressing them up with flowery language and an impressionistic take on the scientific method." [...] In that regard, The New Republic has called him [...] "America's Best-Paid Fairy-Tale Writer". His approach was satirized by the online site [...] "The Malcolm Gladwell Book Generator".|$|E
