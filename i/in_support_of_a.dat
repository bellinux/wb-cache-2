A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird's law offices, during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997; this followed Bird speaking up for the Buftons' cause before voting <b>in</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> motion to allow the police to evict them, using force if necessary.

These included Kantor Halfar (1906), Maryčka Magdónova (1908), and Sedmdesát tisíc (1909).|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} the pennant number L134 during 1973.

The former carrier was chosen as she was capable of replenishing smaller vessels, and the RAN's dedicated replenishment oiler, , was undergoing refits. The Australian government did not want to send a warship until all other avenues of protest had been exhausted; the length of this delay meant Supplys refit was finished before Sydney was deployed, and the oiler was sent instead. Sydney visited Singapore in March, returned to Australia, and sailed to New Zealand in April: she participated in training exercises during both visits. The troopship was then involved in a joint warfare exercise in Jervis Bay during May.|$|E
