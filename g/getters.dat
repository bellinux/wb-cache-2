5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as <b>getters</b> in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E

Moderate levels of copper contamination were introduced by ion implantation such that the copper was not supersaturated during the anneals, thus providing realistic copper contamination/gettering conditions. Copper concentrations at cavities and internal <b>gettering</b> sites were quantitatively measured after the annealings. In this manner, the <b>gettering</b> effectiveness of cavities was measured when in direct competition with internal <b>gettering</b> sites. The cavities were found to be the dominant <b>gettering</b> mechanism with only a small amount of copper <b>gettered</b> at the internal <b>gettering</b> sites.

25|$|<b>Getters</b> act by {{chemically}} {{combining with}} residual or infiltrating gases, but {{are unable to}} counteract (non-reactive) inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as cathode ray tubes and camera tubes such as iconoscopes, orthicons, and image orthicons, comes from helium infiltration. The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified (short of re-evacuation and resealing), and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer.

2500|$|To prevent gases from {{compromising the}} tube's vacuum, modern tubes are {{constructed}} with [...] "getters", {{which are usually}} small, circular troughs filled with metals that oxidize quickly, barium being the most common. While the tube envelope is being evacuated, the internal parts except the getter are heated by RF induction heating to evolve any remaining gas from the metal parts. The tube is then sealed and the getter is heated to a high temperature, again by radio frequency induction heating, which causes the getter material to vaporize and react with any residual gas. The vapor is deposited {{on the inside of}} the glass envelope, leaving a silver-colored metallic patch which continues to absorb small amounts of gas that may leak into the tube during its working life. Great care is taken with the valve design to ensure this material is not deposited on any of the working electrodes. If a tube develops a serious leak in the envelope, this deposit turns a white color as it reacts with atmospheric oxygen. Large transmitting and specialized tubes often use more exotic getter materials, such as zirconium. Early gettered tubes used phosphorus-based <b>getters,</b> and these tubes are easily identifiable, as the phosphorus leaves a characteristic orange or rainbow deposit on the glass. The use of phosphorus was short-lived and was quickly replaced by the superior barium <b>getters.</b> Unlike the barium <b>getters,</b> the phosphorus did not absorb any further gases once it had fired.|$|E

40|$|The {{removal of}} iron {{impurities}} to desired regions in silicon wafers {{has been studied}} using phosphorus and boron doped layers and bulk defects as <b>gettering</b> sites. Techniques to remove metal impurities, so-called <b>gettering</b> techniques, are needed for improving the performance of both the microelectronic and photovoltaic silicon devices, although the desired location of impurities may be different in various applications. In this work, both separate and simultaneous influences of the doped layers and bulk defects on the <b>gettering</b> behaviour of iron, e. g. the <b>gettering</b> efficiency and <b>gettering</b> mechanisms, were investigated. The phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering</b> studies at low temperatures enabled the determination of a more accurate segregation coefficient for iron between a phosphorus diffused layer and bulk silicon. Comparison between the phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering</b> experiments and similar experiments with boron showed that boron diffusion <b>gettering</b> can in some cases be nearly {{as effective as the}} phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering.</b> The <b>gettering</b> studies with implanted boron layers revealed that the <b>gettering</b> occurs also by precipitation, not only by segregation. Competitive <b>gettering</b> between an implanted boron layer and bulk defects was investigated using specially designed <b>gettering</b> anneals. It was found that depending on the desired location of iron in silicon wafers in different applications, iron can be collected either to the doped layers or the bulk defects. The <b>gettering</b> anneals were also applied to a microelectronic device process and their effect on the electronic device parameters was evaluated. These results contribute to the understanding of iron behaviour in silicon. Thus, they can help when designing the <b>gettering</b> anneals both for microelectronic and photovoltaic fabrication processes...|$|R
