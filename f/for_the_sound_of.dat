5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, on 3 August, Augereau fell on Lipthay's 4,000-strong brigade with 11,000 men. Though driven back, the Austrians {{put up a}} {{spirited}} fight. Schübirz made the soldierly decision to march at once <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the guns. Once he arrived on the field, he launched an effective attack that saved the village of Solferino from capture and helped halt the French advance. On 5 August at the Battle of Castiglione, Schübirz and Anton Ferdinand Mittrowsky held the Austrian right flank at Solferino. Helped by late-arriving reinforcements, the right wing got away in good order. Schübirz led the rear guard of three squadrons of hussars, which were the last Austrians to cross the Mincio at the Borghetto bridge.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of FBI's investigation, because of the {{possibility}} that international terrorists might have been involved, assistance was requested from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). CIA analysts, relying on sound-propagation analysis, were able to conclude that the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, but were seeing a trail of burning fuel coming from the aircraft after the initial explosion. This conclusion was reached after calculating how long it took <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the initial explosion to reach the witnesses, and using that to correlate the witness observations with the accident sequence. In all cases the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, as the plane had already exploded before their observations began.|$|E
25|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the song}} was directed by Jake Nava and filmed in Paris, France. The video showed Adele walking alone through the streets with a sad look on her face. Critics praised the video for being simple and perfect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the song. Adele performed the song on several award and television shows including the 2011 Brit Awards, 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and the song was played on the ABC hit show Grey's Anatomy. She added the song to the set list of her second tour Adele Live. The live performances of the song were heavily praised by music critics and fans. The song has been covered by Katy Perry, Taio Cruz, the cast of the series Glee, and several other artists.|$|E

25|$|In September 2012, The Weeknd {{signed with}} Republic Records {{in a joint}} venture with his own imprint XO. The {{compilation}} album for the mixtapes, entitled Trilogy, was released two months later, and consisted of several remastered versions of songs, as well as three additional ones. It also officially credited Rose as a producer and writer on the three songs from House of Balloons for which he did not initially receive credit. Trilogy charted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 86,000 copies. It also debuted at number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, with similar sales. Trilogy was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and double-platinum by Music Canada in May 2013.

25|$|Left {{unanswered}} by {{the professional}} analyses {{was the question}} of whose open microphone captured the sounds recorded on the Dictabelt, if not Officer H.B. McLain. Jim Bowles, a Dallas police dispatcher supervisor in November 1963, and later Dallas County Sheriff, believes it originated from a particular officer on a three-wheeled motorcycle stationed at the Dallas Trade Mart, the original destination of President Kennedy's motorcade, along the same freeway to Parkland Hospital, which would account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> sirens rushing by. McLain himself believes that it was from a different officer on a three-wheeler near the Trade Mart, who {{was known for his}} whistling. When interviewed by author Vincent Bugliosi, the officer acknowledged that his microphone could have been stuck in the open position (he did not recall hearing any transmissions for several minutes), and could later have become unstuck after he followed the motorcade to Parkland Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Live or {{recorded}} music: Live or {{recorded music}} has been effective in promoting respiratory regularity and oxygen saturation levels, as well as decreasing signs of neonatal distress. Since premature infants have sensitive and immature sensory modalities, music is often performed in a gentle and controlled environment, either {{in the form of}} audio recordings or live vocalization, although live singing has been shown to have a greater effect. Live music also reduces the physiological responses in parents. Studies have shown that by combining live music, such as harp music, with the Kangaroo Care, maternal anxiety is reduced. This allows for parents, especially mothers, to spend important time bonding with their premature infants. Female singing voices are also more effective at soothing premature infants. Despite being born premature, infants show a preference <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a female singing voice, making it more beneficial than instrumental music.|$|E

25|$|Edmund Roberts {{calls the}} island Crokatoa in his journal. A paraphrased account follows: On 8 September 1832, US sloop-of war Peacock {{anchored}} off the north end, also visiting Long Island, {{in search of}} inhabitants, fresh water, and yams. It was found difficult to effect a landing anywhere, owing to a heavy surf and to the coral having extended itself to a considerable distance from the shore. Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, {{were found on the}} eastern side of Krakatoa, 150 feet from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine Lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. Corals of every shape and hue were there; some resembling sunflowers and mushrooms; others, cabbages from an inch to three feet in diameter: while a third bore a striking likeness to the rose. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not the so-much-needed supply of water and provisions.|$|E

500|$|Like the F-105B, the F-105D's {{early career}} was plagued with {{maintenance}} problems and in-flight failures. The {{origins of the}} nickname [...] "Thud" [...] were obscure; some claim that it stood <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> an F-105 crashing into the ground. The entire F-105D fleet was grounded in December 1961 and then again in June 1962. Many of the issues were worked out during the production run and by 1964, early F-105Ds were upgraded with these fixes under Project Look Alike, although engine failures and fuel system problems persisted until 1967.|$|E
500|$|The platoon's {{position}} {{at the southern end}} of the 99th Division's sector was not only outside their own regimental boundary, it was outside their Division's boundary and V Corps boundary.

500|$|... "Norwegian Wood" [...] was {{released}} on Rubber Soul on 3 December 1965. The song marked the first example of a rock band playing a sitar or any Indian instrument {{on one of their}} recordings. Although droning guitars had been used previously to mimic the qualities of the sitar, [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] is generally credited as sparking a musical craze <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the novel instrument in the mid-1960s – a trend that would be associated with the growth of raga rock, Indian rock, and the essence of psychedelic rock. The song is also acknowledged as an important piece of what is typically called [...] "world music", and it was a major step towards incorporating non-Western musical influences into Western popular music. The composition, coupled with advice given by Harrison, sparked the interest of Rolling Stones multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who soon integrated the sitar into [...] "Paint It Black", another landmark song in the development of raga and Indian rock. Other pieces exemplifying the rapid interest in Indian music by contemporary Western musicians include Donovan's [...] "Sunshine Superman", the Yardbirds' [...] "Shapes of Things", and the Byrds' [...] "Eight Miles High", among others.|$|E
