40|$|This study {{presents}} a regional frequency analysis of Tennessee using the well-known Bulletin- 17 B method standardly {{used in the}} United States and the relatively new and developing L-Moments methods.

Using the L-Moments method, the generalized extreme value distribution was identified as the most robust distribution for each of four hydrologic areas. Multiple regression equations were also calculated for estimating the flood frequency of ungaged, unregulated, rural streams {{in each of the four}} hydrologic areas of Tennessee. Regression equations were computed using the ordinary least squares regression procedure. The standard error of prediction for the regression equations were calculated and used to compare the Bulletin 17 B and L-Moments methods. This is the first study to indicate that the L-Moments method is, on average, the better of the two methods tested for predicting flood frequency for unregulated streams and rivers in Tennessee...|$|R

A regional regression model is widely used which relates physical and climatological parameters to flow characteristics. In this study, a new method is used which is based on the station-year technique and combined records for several stream-flow <b>gaging</b> <b>stations</b> to make a single composite sample. This method, named ‘hybrid’, was proposed by Hjalmarson and Thomas (1992). It was applied to a group of records from 17 apparently homogeneous stream <b>gaging</b> <b>stations</b> to determine regional flood frequency equations. The study area consists of two adjacent basins, Gavkhoony and North Karoon in the central part of Iran. Using area and mean elevation of the catchments as the most important criteria in relation to peak discharge, the interactive process of the hybrid method was performed, resulting in two-parameter models of regional flood frequency. The performance of the hybrid method was evaluated by comparison with the regional relations determined from a multivariate regression. The comparison revealed that the accuracy of the hybrid method was significantly better than the regression method for low return periods...|$|R
