50|$|Piperazine's {{solubility}} is low, so it {{is often}} used in relatively small amounts to supplement another amine solvent. One or more of piperazine's performance advantages are often compromised in practice due to its low concentration; nonetheless, the CO2 absorption rate, <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption,</b> and solvent capacity are increased through the addition of piperazine to amine gas treating solvents, {{the most common of}} which is MDEA due to its unmatched high rate and capacity efficiency. For example, a 5 m PZ/5 m MDEA blend yields an 11% larger difference in CO2 concentration than 8 m PZ between the lean (inlet absorbent) and rich (outlet absorbent) amine solvent streams, or in other words, more CO2 is removed from the sour (flue) gas stream per unit mass of solvent, and an almost 100% larger concentration difference than 7 m MEA.|$|E
5000|$|As {{required}} for all separation techniques, ionic liquids exhibit selectivity towards {{one or more}} of the phases of a mixture. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIM-PF6) is a room-temperature ionic liquid that was identified early on as a viable substitute for volatile organic solvents in liquid-liquid separations. Other PF6- and BF4- containing ionic liquids have been studied for their CO2 absorption properties, as well as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMIM) and unconventional cations like trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium (P66614). Selection of different anion and cation combinations in ionic liquids affects their selectivity and physical properties. Additionally, the organic cations in ionic liquids can be [...] "tuned" [...] by changing chain lengths or by substituting radicals. Finally, ionic liquids can be mixed with other ionic liquids, water, or amines to achieve different properties in terms of absorption capacity and <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption.</b> This tunability has led some to call ionic liquids [...] "designer solvents." [...] 1-butyl-3-propylamineimidazolium tetrafluoroborate was specifically developed for CO2 capture; it is designed to employ chemisorption to absorb CO2 and maintain efficiency under repeated absorption/regeneration cycles. Other ionic liquids have been simulated or experimentally tested for potential use as CO2 absorbents.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} thrive, a fire {{requires}} fuel, oxygen, and heat. As underground fires {{are very difficult}} to reach directly, firefighting involves finding an appropriate methodology which addresses the interaction of fuel and oxygen for the specific fire in question. A fire can be isolated from its fuel source, for example through firebreaks or fireproof barriers. Many fires, particularly those on steep slopes, can be completely excavated. In the case of near-surface coal seam fires, the influx of oxygen in the air can be interrupted by covering the area or installing gas-tight barriers. Another possibility is to hinder the outflow of combustion gases so that the fire is quenched by its own exhaust fumes. Energy can be removed by cooling, usually by injecting large amounts of water. However, if any remaining dry coal absorbs water, the resulting <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> can lead to re-ignition of a once-quenched fire as the area dries. Accordingly, more energy must be removed than the fire generates. In practice these methods are combined, and each case depends on the resources available. This is especially true for water, for example in arid regions, and for covering material, such as loess or clay, to prevent contact with the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{stripper}} configurations include matrix, internal exchange, flashing feed, and multipressure with split feed. Many {{of these}} configurations offer more energy efficiency for specific solvents or operating conditions. Vacuum operation favors solvents with low <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> while operation at normal pressure favors solvents with high <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption.</b> Solvents with high <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> require less energy for stripping from temperature swing at fixed capacity. The matrix stripper recovers 40% of CO2 {{at a higher}} pressure and does not have inefficiencies associated with multipressure stripper. Energy and costs are reduced since the reboiler duty cycle is slightly less than normal pressure stripper. An Internal Exchange stripper has a smaller ratio of water vapor to CO2 in the overheads stream, and therefore less steam is required. The multipressure configuration with split feed reduces the flow into the bottom section, which also reduces the equivalent work. Flashing feed requires less heat input because it uses the latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> water vapor to help strip some of the CO2 in the rich stream entering the stripper {{at the bottom of}} the column. The multipressure configuration is more attractive for solvents with a higher <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption.</b>|$|R

40|$|To date, {{fossil fuels}} {{are the main}} source of energy which causes green house gas (GHG) emissions. Major {{component}} of these GHG is carbon dioxide (CO 2). Carbon dioxide capture from an efficient power plant and other industrial processes using solvents is a developed technology but it reduces the overall efficiency of the process mainly due to energy needed to desorb chemically bound CO 2 with the solvent. This energy is used to provide by low pressure steam flow inside the tubes of reboiler of a stripping column in a CO 2 capture plant. This heating energy is same as that release during absorption stage. This <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> and pumping energy requirement for a CO 2 capture plant depends on the type of solvent and its physical properties (viscosity, density etc). Sometimes activators like piperazine use along with solvent which increases the reactivity of solution. Hence solvent selection is the most important step during process design and development stage. <b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> of CO 2 with different solvents was measured in this work in a commercially available reaction calorimeter CPA- 122 of ChemiSens as a function of temperature and loading over the temperature range from 40 to 80 oC.

Studied absorbent systems are 5 % by weight ammonia aqueous solution, 0. 8 M peprazine, blend of 5 % weight of ammonia and 0. 8 M piperazine, blend of 5 % weight of ammonia and 0. 4 M peprazine (PZ) and blend of 2. 5 % weight of ammonia and 0. 8 M piperazine. Experimental heats of absorption of CO 2 with these systems are compared with other systems as well. The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> of CO 2 with 5 % by weight aqueous NH 3 is estimated to be 70 kJ/mol CO 2 and with 0. 8 M PZ is estimated to be 75 kJ/mol CO 2 at low loading interval (less than 0. 5 mol CO 2 /mol amine) at 40 oC. <b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> decreases for aqueous ammonia solution while increases for the case of PZ with increasing temperature at a specific loading less than 0. 5 mol CO 2 /mol amine. <b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> of CO 2 with blend of these two solutions is also measured which reveals that it {{is similar to that of}} <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> of CO 2 with 5 % by weight aqueous NH 3 solution at 40 oC and 60 oC while it is also similar up to loading of 0. 35 mol CO 2 /mol amine at 80 oC.

A distinct depression in the melting point up to 80 K of DESs was observed compared with that of BMIMCl. The observed red shifts of the C 2 H group in an imidazolium ring and its chemical shifts downfield in NMR spectra are indicative of a hydrogen bond interaction between BMIMCl and MEA. In particular, CO 2 uptake in MEA: ILs (4 : 1) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is up to 21. 4 wt%, which is higher than that of 30 wt% MEA (13 %).

Loading calculation was the next part of the project, the new loadings were calculated based on the injected amount of CO 2 in to the reaction calorimeter. Total pressure and partial pressure of CO 2 were computed based on the new loading and the results were plotted against the calculated loadings for 30 % MEA solution at 40 oC, 80 oC and 120 oC.

40|$|CO 2 排放被认为是引起全球气候变暖最主要的因素之一。化学吸收法是目前最有效、最实用的碳捕集技术，而高效、节能、环保的吸收剂一直是科学家们孜孜不倦的追求。离子液体具有可忽略的蒸汽压、低比热及结构可设计性等优点，为开发CO 2 捕集的新型吸收剂带来契机。然而，常规离子液体的CO 2 吸收量低，功能化离子液体具有合成复杂、成本高、粘度大等缺点，是制约离子液体用于CO 2 捕集工业化应用的瓶颈。因此，开发高CO 2 吸收量、高吸收速率、低吸收热和低成本的离子液体型吸收剂是当前CO 2 捕集领域的研究热点。基于此，本论文从工业应用的角度出发，开展了多位点有机胺、离子液体-有机胺复配溶剂以及低共熔溶剂吸收CO 2 的应用基础研究，为开发新型高效CO 2 吸收剂提供理论支持。本论文的主要研究内容及创新性成果如下：（ 1 ）新型多位点有机胺N-甲基-N-（ 2 -羟乙基）- 1, 3 -丙二胺（HMPDA）的CO 2 吸收性能研究。根据伯胺的CO 2 的吸收速率快，叔胺的CO 2 吸收量大的优势，开发了一种CO 2 吸收量高、吸收速率快且吸收热低的多位点新型有机胺溶剂。用研制的釜式气体吸收评价实验装置和气液相平衡实验装置分别研究了HMPDA水溶液的CO 2 吸收速率和吸收量，发现 30 wt % HMPDA水溶液的CO 2 吸收速率高于 30 wt % MEA及 30 wt % MDEA水溶液。在 250 kPa、 313 K时， 30 wt % HMPDA水溶液的CO 2 吸收量可达 1. 5 mol CO 2 /mol HMPDA，高于 30 wt % MEA（ 0. 6 mol CO 2 /mol MEA）和 30 wt % MDEA（ 0. 9 mol CO 2 /mol MDEA）水溶液的CO 2 吸收量。研究了温度、浓度对吸收性能的影响，并考察了CO 2 吸收前后吸收剂的粘度和密度变化。BT 2. 15 微量热测试系统研究了 313 K时 30 wt % HMPDA水溶液的CO 2 吸收热。结果表明，CO 2 负载量低于 0. 45 mol时， 30 wt % HMPDA水溶液的CO 2 吸收热低于 30 wt % MEA和 30 wt % MDEA水溶液的CO 2 吸收热。（ 2 ）[Bmim][NO 3]-MEA复配体系的CO 2 吸收性能研究。针对现有MEA碳捕集工艺再生能耗高的不足，选择稳定的离子液体[Bmim][NO 3]与MEA形成复配溶剂，替代一部分水，以降低再生能耗。研究了复配溶剂的密度、粘度、比热、折光率等物化性质。与MEA水溶液相比，离子液体的加入增加了溶剂的密度、粘度和折光率，降低了比热。气液平衡实验表明离子液体的加入略微降低CO 2 的饱和吸收量和吸收速率，提高了CO 2 的物理溶解度，降低了CO 2 的扩散系数。用微量热技术研究了复配溶剂的CO 2 吸收热，并分析了温度，压力以及CO 2 负载量和吸收热之间的关系。结果表明，在有化学反应参与的吸收阶段（CO 2 负载量为 0. 5 mol CO 2 /mol MEA），吸收热主要是化学反应放出的热；此后，吸收热明显下降，主要来自离子液体的物理吸收作用。提高离子液体浓度，可明显降低复配溶剂的CO 2 吸收热。（ 3 ）离子液体-MDEA复配体系的CO 2 吸收性能研究。考察了不同离子液体复配溶剂的循环CO 2 吸收量，测量了 313 - 353 K下的CO 2 饱和溶解度，计算了物理吸收热和亨利系数。结果表明，不同复配溶剂的循环吸收量大小顺序为：MDEA-PZ-[Bmim][BF 4] > MDEA-PZ-[Bmim][Cl] > MDEA-PZ-[Bmim][NO 3]。气液平衡实验表明，CO 2 的溶解度随着温度的升高而下降，随着压力的升高而增加，离子液体的加入略微降低了CO 2 的平衡溶解度。用Gibbs-Helmholtz方程计算的吸收热表明，复配体系的CO 2 吸收热与加入离子液体的种类有关，离子液体的加入减小了CO 2 的亨利系数，降低了CO 2 吸收热，尤其在较高的CO 2 负载量以及较高温度时，吸收热降低更加明显。（ 4 ）新型低共熔溶剂的合成、表征及其CO 2 吸收性能研究。针对现有低共熔溶剂CO 2 吸收量低的缺点，新合成一种基于离子液体[Bmim][Cl]的低共熔溶剂，用红外、核磁和拉曼光谱对新低共熔溶剂的结构进行表征，证实低共熔溶剂中氢键的存在是形成共熔物的原因。研究了低共熔溶剂的物化性质诸如密度、粘度和比热等物化性质和稳定性，低共熔溶剂的熔点最大降低约 70 K。考察了低共熔溶剂的CO 2 吸收量和吸收热，最大吸收量可达 21. 4 %，低共熔溶剂的CO 2 吸收热随着CO 2 吸收量的增加而减小。研究了低共熔溶剂的CO 2 吸收机理，发现共熔物与CO 2 之间以化学反应为主，生成的氨基甲酸盐和[Bmim][Cl]形成新的氢键，进而提高了CO 2 的吸收量。   	 CO 2 {{emission}} {{has been}} considered {{as one of the}} primary contributors to climate change and global warming. Chemical <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 is widely established and proved to be the most promising strategy in CO 2 capture. Accordingly, efficient, energy-saving and environmentally-friendly solvent is the desired theme of academic and industrial researchers. Ionic liquids (ILs) have aroused considerable interests as solvent for CO 2 capture due to their unique properties, such as negligible vapor pressure, low heat capacity and tunable designability. However, the CO 2 uptake of conventional ILs is low. The synthesis of functionalized ILs is tedious and the subsequent purification is challenging. Also, functionalized IL usually shows high viscosity which is detrimental to CO 2 diffusivity. Therefore, it is crucial to develop novel ILs based solvent with high CO 2 uptake, fast absorption rate and low <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption.</b> This dissertation serves to extend the knowledge <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption</b> using multiple reaction site amine, ILs-amine hybrids and novel deep eutectic solvents (DESs) from the point of industrial view, which provides insights on the industrial application of ILs in CO 2 capture. The main research work and creative results of this dissertation are as follows:(1) Performance <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption</b> with novel multiple reaction site amine solution were studied. Absorption rate and <b>absorption</b> capacity <b>of</b> CO 2 with amine solutions were determined using the home-made on-line stirred cell and vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE). The results show that the <b>absorption</b> rate <b>of</b> CO 2 with HMPDA solution is faster than those of MEA and MDEA solutions. CO 2 capacity in 30 wt % HMPDA solution is up to 1. 5 mol CO 2 /mol HMPDA, which is higher than those of 30 wt % MEA (0. 6 mol CO 2 /mol MEA) and 30 wt % MDEA (0. 9 mol CO 2 /mol MDEA) solutions. Effects of temperature and concentration on the CO 2 absorption, and the density and viscosity of amine solutions before and after CO 2 absorption were investigated. Finally, <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption</b> in HMPDA solution at 313 K was investigated using BT 2. 15 calorimeter. <b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption</b> in HMPDA solution is lower than that of MEA solution when CO 2 loading MDEA-PZ-[Bmim][Cl] > MDEA-PZ-[Bmim][NO 3]. VLE results show that CO 2 solubility in MDEA-ILs solutions increases with the partial pressure of CO 2 and decreases with addition <b>of</b> ILs. Calculated <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption</b> shows that kind of ILs has a significant role on <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption.</b> Experimental <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption</b> shows that addition of ILs lowers the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption</b> and this phenomenon is significant when CO 2 loading is and temperature is high. (4) Performance <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption</b> in newly synthesized deep eutectic solvents was carried out. In order to improve the CO 2 uptake of existing DESs, we synthesized imidazolium based DESs and characterized the structural information of DESs using IR, Raman and NMR. Newly formed hydrogen bond in DESs is found to be responsible for the formation of eutectics and the depression of melting point up to 70 K, which broadens the application range of DESs. The thermal stability and physicochemical properties, such as density, viscosity and <b>heat</b> capacity <b>of</b> DESs were also measure over wide temperature range. Maximum CO 2 uptake of DESs is up to 21. 4 %, which is found to be the largest CO 2 uptake <b>of</b> DESs. <b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 <b>absorption</b> with DESs was experimentally determined using BT 2. 15 calorimeter and found that heat decreases as CO 2 loading increases. Absorption mechanism between CO 2 and DESs shows that CO 2 is primarily bonded chemically with DESs and the hydrogen bond improved CO 2 uptake of DESs.   </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{thermodynamic}} model in Aspen Plus® was developed to predict properties of piperazine (PZ) /H 2 O and PZ/H 2 O/CO 2. A sequential regression {{was performed to}} represent recently acquired loaded and unloaded heat capacity, CO 2 solubility, CO 2 activity coefficient, speciation, and unloaded and loaded amine volatility data. The resulting model is able to predict each of these properties over operationally significant loading and temperature ranges (0. 20 − 0. 40  mol CO 2 /mol alkalinity and 40  °C− 160  °C). The predicted <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>absorption</b> for 8  m PZ solution at 0. 35  mol CO 2 /mol alkalinity between 40  °C and 160  °C was 65 ± 4  kJ/mol CO 2.
