50|$|Variable {{universal}} life insurance (often shortened to VUL) {{is a type}} of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested {{in a wide variety of}} separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments. The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance. This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has <b>fixed</b> <b>premium</b> payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium).|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{valuation}} of an operating wind farm and the finite-lived option {{to invest in}} it under different reward/support schemes: a constant feed-in tariff, a premium {{on top of the}} electricity market price (either a <b>fixed</b> <b>premium</b> or a variable subsidy such as a renewable obligation certificate or ROC), and a transitory subsidy, among others. Futures contracts on electricity with ever longer maturities enable market-based valuations to be undertaken. The model considers up to three sources of uncertainty: the electricity price, the level of wind generation, and the certificate (ROC) price where appropriate. When analytical solutions are lacking, we resort to a trinomial lattice combined with Monte Carlo simulation; we also use a two-dimensional binomial lattice when uncertainty in the ROC price is considered. Our data set refers to the UK. The numerical results show the impact of several factors involved in the decision to invest: the subsidy per MWh generated, the initial lump-sum subsidy, the maturity of the investment option, and electricity price volatility. Different combinations of variables can help bring forward investments in wind generation. One-off policies, e. g., a transitory initial subsidy, seem to have a stronger effect than a <b>fixed</b> <b>premium</b> per MWh produced...|$|E

40|$|This article {{studies the}} rise and fall of the first {{liability}} insurance cartel in the United States. In 1886, insurance companies in America began selling liability insurance for personal injury accidents, primarily to cover business tort liability for employee accidents at work and non-employee injuries occasioned by their business operations. In 1896, the leading liability insurers agreed to <b>fix</b> <b>premium</b> rates and share information on policyholder losses. In 1906, this cartel fell apart.

30|$|Therefore, while {{reducing}} price risk, {{the acquisition of}} forward contracts to sell the electricity generated by a power producer increases the probability of suffering financial losses due to unexpected unit shutdowns. This risk {{is referred to as}} availability risk. Determining the optimal quantity of forward contracts to be acquired by a risk-averse power producer, taking into account the uncertainty related to both electricity pool prices and generating unit availability, is not a straightforward task [5]. Additionally, a power producer may opt for acquiring an insurance contract against unit failures [6]. Unlike forward contracts, whose main objective is to reduce the price risk faced by power producers, this type of financial product is aimed at limiting the financial losses incurred as a consequence of an unexpected outage of any of the production units owned by the power producer. Therefore, this type of contract reduces specifically the availability risk faced by power producers in exchange for a <b>fix</b> <b>premium.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} some {{drawbacks}} {{of the social}} long-term care insurance structure in Germany {{turned out to be}} in need of reform. : While health insurance is a fully comprehensive system, long-term care insurance only provides limited cover. Therefore, insurance funds have an incentive to shift some services from health care to long-term care insurance. Additionally, there is no free competition on the long-term care market. Finally, the financial situation of the German social long-term care insurance is tight, because of the increasing number of benefit recipients. Therefore, we discuss several reform options which have been proposed in order to overcome the financial and structural problems.

40|$|The {{objective}} of actuarial theory on optimal reinsurance is deriving generally applicable results. Therefore, {{it follows that}} an optimal reinsurance program achieves the greatest possible stability for the insurer's own retention at the lowest possible reinsurance cost price. A measure is needed for comparing {{the stability of the}} retentions within different reinsurance programs. Although the hypotheses used in actuarial theory can differ from article to article, the basic function is often the same, namely: 1. The density function of the total annual claim amount is completely known by the insurer. 2. The reinsurer also knows this function and fully agrees with it. 3.

40|$|Abstract. We {{conduct a}} series of {{laboratory}} experiments designed to test if individual discount rates vary with the time horizon for which the rate is elicited. We conclude that preferences are not continuously hyperbolic, although observations generated in many prior experiments have appeared to reflect hyperbolic preferences. Such observations {{are consistent with the}} intrinsically confounded notions of a “passion for the present ” and other “subjective costs of any delayed payment. ” These result in a <b>fixed</b> <b>premium</b> being attached to payment options delayed beyond the present. We demonstrate the existence of this premium in choices involving an immediate payment option vs. a delayed payment option. When both payment options are delayed, the premium does not vary between the options, and thus does not enter into the choice between them. The revealed rates then do not vary with the choice horizon. To the extent that many significant field choices or policy decisions do not involve choices with immediate payoffs, the use of constant discount rates remains appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Dedicated to Professor Avner Friedman on the {{occasion}} of his 80 th birthday Abstract. In this study, we establish a financial credit derivative pricing model for a contract which is subject to counterparty risks. The model leads to a fully nonlinear partial differential equation problem. We study this PDE problem and obtained a solution as the limit of a sequence of semi-linear PDE problems which also arise from financial models. Moreover, the problems and methods build a bridge between two main risk frameworks: structure and intensity models. We obtain the uniqueness, regularities and some properties of the solution of this problem. 1. Introduction. It became evident in the financial and credit crisis in 2007 the crucial importance for measuring counterparty risks. We start from an example. Consider a Credit Default Swap (CDS) contract.

50|$|Term life {{insurance}} can be contrasted to permanent {{life insurance}} such as whole life, universal life, and variable universal life, which guarantee coverage at <b>fixed</b> <b>premiums</b> for {{the lifetime of}} the covered individual unless the policy is allowed to lapse. Term insurance is not generally used for estate planning needs or charitable giving strategies but is used for pure income replacement needs for an individual. Term insurance functions {{in a manner similar}} to most other types of insurance in that it satisfies claims against what is insured if the premiums are up to date and the contract has not expired and does not provide for a return of premium dollars if no claims are filed. As an example, auto insurance will satisfy claims against the insured in the event of an accident and a homeowner policy will satisfy claims against the home if it is damaged or destroyed, for example, by fire. Whether or not these events will occur is uncertain. If the policyholder discontinues coverage because he or she has sold the insured car or home, the insurance company will not refund the full premium.|$|R
