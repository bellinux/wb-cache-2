5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set.

Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, as <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> individuals conspicuous to predators, {{so they may}} be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it.
