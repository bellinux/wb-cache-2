30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{understanding}} in the flow mechanism of the hub plate crown, the current calculation of the <b>disc</b> <b>friction</b> <b>loss</b> and the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump often uses empirical formulas. Research on the flow characteristics of the hub plate crown is of practical significance. The shroud and hub cavities are respectively studied with regard to tangential and radial velocities at the four different angular positions (0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °) at the four different operational points (0.6 Qsp, 0.8 Qsp, 1.0 Qsp, and 1.2 Qsp). Results indicate that at the same operational point, the smaller the volute chamber sectional area is, the higher the tangential velocity of the fluid core zone of the shroud cavity is. Radial leakage flow from the volute to the seal ring at the same operational point appears in 0 ° and 90 ° direction; when the flow is large, the tangential and radial velocities of the shroud and hub cavities with the same radius tend to be equal with axial symmetry. The axial leakage flow through the balance holes significantly affects the radial distribution of both tangential and radial velocities of fluid flow in the hub cavity. The numerical calculation results of fluid leakage through the clearance of back sealing ring are in good agreement with the test results. Accordingly, the magnitude of leakage is closely related to the fluid pressure and velocity distribution in the hub plate crown of the centrifugal pump. The analysis of the flow characteristics in the hub plate crown of the centrifugal pump could reveal the cause of the <b>disc</b> <b>friction</b> <b>loss</b> from the mechanism, providing a significant guidance for improving the accuracy of calculation and balancing the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump.|$|E
30|$|In an {{impeller}} with balance holes of the double-sealing ring structure in a centrifugal pump, the hub plate crown of the impeller {{is divided into}} a shroud cavity and a hub cavity by the sealing ring. The calculation of round disk friction loss and axial thrust {{is closely related to}} the flow in the hub plate crown. Research on the shroud cavity, hub cavity, and sealing ring leakage has revealed the mechanism of the internal round disk friction loss and axial thrust of the centrifugal pump. Yang et al. [1] pointed out that <b>disc</b> <b>friction</b> <b>loss</b> calculated by the conventional method would produce more errors since it only considered the friction torque of the impeller at its periphery but ignored the major part at the hub plate crown and sealing ring. In the derivation of the axial thrust calculation formula, under the assumption that no fluid leakage flow exists in the hub plate crown and the fluid rotational angular velocity within the shroud cavity is half of the impeller rotational angular velocity, no rotating motion of the hub cavity fluid exists within the sealing ring [2 – 4]. Salvadori et al. [5] pointed out that the cavity flow behavior is a key parameter for the pressure field evaluation and then for the thrust calculation. Over the pump operating range the main contribution to the axial thrust is due to the impellers flow fields, the leakage flows through sealing rings and the pressure distribution that occurs inside the cavities between impeller shrouds and pump stationary walls. Test results on disk friction loss or axial thrust calculated in terms of the theoretical formula in fluid flow velocity in the shroud cavity did not match the results of practical tests [6]. To calculate the axial thrust of centrifugal pump with higher accuracy, Liu et al. [7, 8] developed a mathematical model of the shroud cavity liquid pressure on the design condition by simplifying the Navier–Stokes equations for the movement of cavity fluid. The results of liquid pressure test verified the reliability of the model. The study of Mu et al. [9] showed that the pump clearance leakage flow has significant influence on the flow field in the hub plate crown. The angular velocity of the fluid in the back shroud cavity is less than 0.5 times the angular velocity of impeller. Besides, compared with the experiment result, the axial thrust was found underestimated by the conventional formula. Research has shown that both cavities velocity field in the shroud and hub and the axial changing laws in the centrifugal pump are similar to the velocity field in the enclosed cylinder body [10 – 12]. That is, in the fluid flow velocity of the shroud and hub cavities, a turbulent boundary layer exists near the outer wall of the rotating impeller back shroud. Near the internal wall of the fixed motionless pump shroud, a flow core zone exists along the axial direction without significant changes between two boundary layers [13 – 15]. The flow core zone is the main region of fluid within the shroud and hub cavities. It occupies over two-thirds of the axial distance, whereby the fluid flow conditions within the shroud and hub cavities can be reflected.|$|E

30|$|A large {{exit angle}} favors {{efficiency}} enhancement (Fig.  5). The efficiency is maximum {{at the best}} efficiency point and gets reduced uniformly {{to the right of}} the best efficiency point. At this point, secondary and profile losses are minimum and at the off-design points the secondary and shock losses increases which increases total hydraulic losses resulting in reduced efficiency (Srinivasan 2008). The efficiency for crude oil, saline-water, gasoline or kerosene is lower than that for water. The decrease in efficiency, while pumping the crude oil and saline-water is due to the <b>disc</b> <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> over the outsides of the impeller shroud and hub due to viscous effect. The results agree with the results of Gulich (2010) and Li (2008).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{is based on}} the performance of the centrifugal pump having the backward, radial and forward bladed type of impeller. The impeller is modeled using Creo Parametric 1. 0 having 70 and 80 degree outlet blade angle for the backward type and outlet blade angle 90 for radial and 100 degree for forward type impeller respectively. Numerical simulation is carried out using ANSYS CFX and standard k- turbulence model is adopted for the analysis purpose. Cavitation is clearly predicted in the form of water vapor formation inside the centrifugal pump. The performance of the pump is affected by the cavitation and hence cavitation number (σc) {{is a measure of the}} cavitation phenomenon for the centrifugal pump, it is determined by analytical calculations. From the numerical results it has been found that the pump working on low head gives the best performance when it is operated with the backward bladed type impeller. SHI Weidong [2] found that the oversize impeller outlet width leads to poor pump performances and increasing shaft power. W. G. Li [3] stated that the blade discharge angle has a strong but equal influence on the head, shaft power and efficiency of the centrifugal oil pump for various viscosities of liquids pumped, The rapid reduction in the hydraulic and mechanical efficiencies is responsible for the pump performance degradation with increasing viscosity of liquids. E. C. Bacharoudis et al [4] found that the outlet blade angle increases the performance curve becomes smoother and flatter. But pump performance goes down when the pump handles high viscosity working fluids is that high viscosity results in <b>disc</b> <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> over outside of the impeller and that was found by M.

40|$|Understanding {{the flow}} {{behaviour}} of inorganic-wood fibre slurries {{is important for}} developing new process equipment for the cement fibreboard industry. Little is reported in the technical literature and generally slurry flow knowledge {{is limited to a}} few engineers within the industry. Pipe <b>friction</b> <b>loss</b> characteristics and the settling behaviour of inorganic-wood fibre slurries were studied and data were obtained in pressurised horizontal pipes ranging from 25 to 100 mm diameter at flow velocities up to 8 m/s. The inorganic solids studied were cement and fine silica of size range 10 to 150 m. Solids concentrations ranged from 5 - 20 % and fibre concentrations from 0 - 2 %. Wood pulp fibre suspensions at low fibre concentrations form a structured carrier medium with the ability to support fine particulate solids. Unlike fibre-free suspensions, no permanent stationary deposit formed and therefore no minimum settling velocity exists. At low flow rates particles are trapped in the fibre plug and the <b>friction</b> <b>loss</b> is above water. At high flow rates the particles are still supported but the fibres dislodged from the central plug core damp turbulence and <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> for the cement-silica-fibre system are less than water (drag reduction).
