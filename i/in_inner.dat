40|$|We {{report on}} the two-beam study of {{indirect}} excitons <b>in</b> the <b>inner</b> ring <b>in</b> the exciton emission pattern. One laser beam generates the inner ring and a second weaker beam is positioned <b>in</b> the <b>inner</b> ring. The beam positioned <b>in</b> the <b>inner</b> ring is found to locally suppress the exciton emission intensity. We also {{report on the}} inner ring fragmentation and formation of multiple rings <b>in</b> the <b>inner</b> ring region. These features are found to originate from a weak spatial modulation of the excitation beam intensity <b>in</b> the <b>inner</b> ring region. The modulation of exciton emission intensity anticorrelates with the modulation of the laser excitation intensity. The three phenomena—inner ring fragmentation, formation of multiple rings <b>in</b> the <b>inner</b> ring region, and emission suppression by a weak laser beam <b>in</b> the <b>inner</b> ring—have a common feature: a reduction of exciton emission intensity {{in the region of}} enhanced laser excitation.

Language {{commissions}} of the Mongolian state continuously translate new terminology into Mongolian, {{so as the}} Mongolian vocabulary now has jerönhijlögč 'president' ("generalizer") and šar ajrag 'beer' ("yellow kumys").

5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian <b>in</b> <b>Inner</b> Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation <b>in</b> <b>Inner</b> Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.|$|E

5|$|In the {{build-up}} to the 1997 general election, the Referendum Party {{spent more}} on press advertising {{than either the}} incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the Labour Party.

In the months following the election, the party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith died in July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after.

5|$|Pharnavaz had {{introduced}} a military-administrative organization {{based on a}} network of regional governors or eristavi.

5|$|The party gained over 7% in four constituencies. Much media {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the seat of Putney, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP David Mellor; Goldsmith secured 3.5% of the local vote and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest in the south and east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of agricultural employment. Support for the party was considerably weaker <b>in</b> <b>Inner</b> London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish vote. This may have reflected greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party's Euroscepticism was a form of English nationalism rather than British nationalism. The Referendum Party had proved more electorally successful than its Eurosceptic rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.|$|E
