5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> integer {{in the set}} is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set.

Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.|$|E
5|$|A {{connected}} component of an undirected graph is the subgraph {{consisting of the}} vertices and edges that {{can be reached by}} following edges from a single given starting vertex. A graph is connected if every vertex or edge is reachable from every other vertex or edge. A cycle in an undirected graph is a connected subgraph <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> vertex is incident to exactly two edges, or is a loop.|$|E
5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> tile is {{a regular}} polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E

5|$|Anderssen won the London 1862 chess tournament, {{the first}} {{international}} round-robin tournament (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> participant plays a game against each of the others) with a score of twelve wins out of thirteen games. He lost only one game, to the Rev. John Owen and finished twopoints ahead of Louis Paulsen, who had the best playing record in the early 1860s. Morphy had retired from chess at this time, so Anderssen was again generally regarded as the world's leading active player.|$|E
5|$|Another case of synesthesia is {{swimming}}-style synesthesia <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> swimming {{style is}} associated with a vivid experience of a color. These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).|$|E
5|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that measures}} {{the quality of}} a book embedding, beyond its number of pages, is its pagewidth. This is the maximum number of edges that can be crossed by a ray perpendicular to the spine within a single page. Equivalently (for book embeddings <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> edge is drawn as a monotonic curve), it is the maximum size of a subset of edges within a single page such that the intervals defined on the spine by pairs of endpoints of the edges all intersect each other.|$|E

5|$|Computer {{architectures}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> {{element of}} main memory {{can be accessed}} with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems.

A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.|$|E
5|$|Dataflow {{programming}} languages describe {{systems of}} operations on data streams, and {{the connections between}} the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as a parallel algorithm <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E

5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, {{even before the}} {{accession}} of Louis XVI, whose name {{is attached to the}} first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.|$|E

5|$|Linear {{combinations}} combine multiplication and summation; {{they are}} sums <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> term has a multiplier, usually a real or complex number. Linear combinations are especially useful in contexts where straightforward addition would violate some normalization rule, such as mixing of strategies in game theory or superposition of states in quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E
