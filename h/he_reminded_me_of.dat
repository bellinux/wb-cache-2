500|$|At the post-race podium interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula 1 driver David Coulthard, Nico Rosberg hailed an [...] "awesome weekend" [...] {{and said that}} the start had been the key factor to his victory. Kimi Räikkönen and Ferrari in turn lamented their dismal start, saying that it might have cost him the victory. Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene lauded Räikkönen's drive as [...] "absolutely spectacular", adding: [...] "If you look at the overtake around the outside of [...] Ricciardo, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the driver from the old times. It was very, very good for me." [...] Lewis Hamilton rued his second unfortunate start incident in a row, which he described as [...] "perhaps [...] more painful" [...] than the incident at the previous race. He stressed the fact that with the damage to his car from the first-turn contact he was unable to keep up Räikkönen's speed ahead of him.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 {{country music}} artist Brantley Gilbert {{paid tribute to}} LeDoux in his single [...] "Country Must Be Countrywide," [...] with the line [...] "From his Wranglers to his boots – <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Chris LeDoux. With that Copenhagen smile, Country must be countrywide." ...|$|E
60|$|I liked Nielsen's looks then. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Jim Emett, the Mormon giant to whom {{difficulties}} and obstacles were but spurs to achievement. Such men {{could not be}} defeated.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{nonsense}} he talks!" [...] Cristel exclaimed. [...] "All mere fancy! <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the {{old song}} called 'The Nervous Man.' Do you know it, Mr. Roylake?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Glad to know him,' says I, 'but in {{his present}} {{condition}} <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the joke Shakespeare got off on Julius Cæsar. We might say about your friend: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh {{you meant}} Sir Luke Strett? Certainly he's a fine type. Do you know," [...] Susie continued, [...] "whom <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of?</b> Of our great man--Dr. Buttrick of Boston." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{meant no}} offence," [...] the recruit said. [...] "The man <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> had a queer history, and I suppose {{that is what}} put it into my head." ...|$|E
60|$|He was a sheet-anchor-man, {{an earnest}} Baptist, and was well known, {{in his own}} part of the ship, to be {{constant}} in his solitary devotions in the chains. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> St. Anthony going out into the wilderness to pray.|$|E
60|$|I saw Uriah {{watch her}} while she greeted us; and <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> an ugly and rebellious genie {{watching}} a good spirit. In the meanwhile, some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles; and Traddles, unobserved except by me, went out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{it is from}} an old {{lawyer at}} Bath whom I used to know. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} I said to him {{four or five years}} ago--some little time before we were married--about Dorothy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay; {{anybody can}} {{be what you}} call graceful, if he lives a little time in a city, and keeps his eyes open. And he might have picked up his gentlemanliness {{by going to the}} {{galleries}} of theatres, and watching stage drawing-room manners. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> one of the worst stories I ever heard in my life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} to hear about my uncle at Tanis. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> too many things that give pain, and there are nights when one wishes to escape pain, which is sure to be found again on the morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This made me laugh; the King {{asked the}} reason. I told him, <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the RUSSE A PARIS, that charming {{little piece of}} verse of M. de Voltaire's; and we remembered charming things out of it, which made us both laugh. He said, ...|$|E
60|$|The man didn't say a word. He {{seemed to}} be {{brooding}} on something. He {{was one of those}} silent men. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Joe, the old dog down the street at the grocer's shop, who lies at the door all day, blinking and not speaking to anybody.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted a}} dish-cover, and helped {{his wife and}} daughter. His face was lined and fallen like an old man's after debauch, but his hand did not shake, and his voice was clear. As he worked to restore us by speech and action, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a grey-muzzled collie herding demoralised sheep.|$|E
2500|$|He had the {{pleasing}} {{face and}} he was very virtuous. His speaking style was so delightful that people were not tired of hearing his words and his bright face was very charming. Khomeini said about him: «When I see him, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Allah.» ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at Shields," [...] said Mr. Spence. [...] "He {{might be}} posing for a statue {{to be called}} 'Despair!' <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Macduff. Macbeth, Act iv., somewhere near the end. 'What, all my pretty chickens, at one fell swoop?' That's what Shields is saying to himself." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Toulouse and France teammate, Maxime Médard, Fickou [...] "is {{one of the}} 10 best centres in {{the world}} and soon he will be number one. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Sonny Bill Williams: tall, athletic, technical, with a good {{hand-off}} and a feel for the game. He has everything." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{listened to}} this {{plausible}} explanation with interest, but, {{at the same}} time, with doubts of the lasting nature of the lady's submission to circumstances; suggested, perhaps, by the constraint in the Minister's manner. It was well {{for both of us}} when we changed the subject. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the discouraging view which the Doctor had taken of the prospect before him.|$|E
60|$|On {{returning}} to our places, I mechanically moved my chair away from the table. My mind was by this time {{in such a state}} of confusion and uncertainty about what it would be best for me to say or do next, that I forgot for the moment the position he had assigned to me when we lit the candles. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> this directly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{not long}} to wait. He was in liquor {{again the next}} day, and the next. Hearing this, Mr. Bapchild {{instructed}} me to send him the letter from my husband's brother. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{some of the stories}} about my husband which I had refused to believe in the time before I was married; and he said it might be well to make inquiries.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't. Besides, it {{made him}} seem so ridiculous, and--I don't know why it is--I can't forgive a man for looking ridiculous. Thank goodness, my darling Sam couldn't look ridiculous, even if he tried. He's wonderful, Jane. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a knight of the Round Table. You ought to see his eyes flash." ...|$|R
2500|$|Tubridy {{has been}} subject to {{commentary}} about his physical appearance. He {{describes himself as a}} [...] "young fogey". Podge and Rodge, a televised puppet chat show, commented on his [...] "stupid awkward eyes, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the undead" [...] and introduced him as [...] "South Dublin on a stick" [...] when he appeared on their TV show.|$|R
5000|$|Fenwick {{particularly}} {{likes the}} comedic {{side to the}} character. He has said, [...] "I just ask them to keep it light and shade. I LOVE the comedy side of Billy but there's a sad side to him, too. He's like a little lost soul who is always beaten up and knocked down but he never gives up. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Norman Wisdom." ...|$|R
60|$|Edward's Italian is (I fear) very weak. When {{we began}} to get really into the language, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> poor Roche in Germany. But {{he seems to have}} picked up a little this morning. He has been unfortunate with the unlucky Egg, leaving a pair of his shoes (his {{favourite}} shoes) behind in Paris, and his flannel dressing-gown yesterday morning at Domo d'Ossola. In all other respects he is just as he was.|$|E
60|$|We found Mr. Enderton {{standing}} by himself. His face {{was of the}} hue of wood ashes, his expression haggard. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{a man who had}} fallen from a considerable height, and who had been frightened and stupefied by the shock. I comprehended the situation without difficulty, and felt quite sure that had he had the choice he would have much preferred a thrashing to the plain talk he had heard from Mrs. Lecks.|$|E
60|$|I {{would look}} up and see him {{standing}} so smooth and benevolent behind Mrs Monnerie's chair that <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my bishop, and I doubt if ever she crisply uttered his delightful name but it recalled the pleasant chime of a poem which my mother had taught me: The Nymph Complaining of the Death of her Fawn. I should have liked to have a long talk with Mr Marvell--any time of the day when he wasn't a butler, I mean--but the opportunity never came.|$|E
60|$|The author, then, {{was an old}} fellow. I {{think we}} might learn as much from the story. An old man he was, or a man who felt old. Do you know whom <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of?</b> Why, of Mr. Bowes, of the Theatre Royal, Chatteris; of Mr. Bowes, that battered, old, kindly sentimentalist who told his tale with Mr. Arthur Pendennis.|$|R
60|$|I awakened late. Banks {{was already}} there to dress me, to congratulate me as discreetly as a well-trained servant should; nor did <b>he</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{the fact that he}} had offered to lend me money, for which {{omission}} I liked him the better. In the parlour I found the captain sipping his chocolate and reading his morning Chronicle, as though all his life he had done nothing else.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{because you}} don't know him. He's an enthusiast about ideas, and {{careless}} about outward things. <b>He</b> often <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the Apostle Paul." ...|$|R
6000|$|Whither we rambled, I scarce knew. Our walk was long, yet seemed short; {{the path}} was pleasant, the day lovely. M. Emanuel talked of his voyage--he thought of staying away three years. On {{his return from}} Guadaloupe, {{he looked forward to}} release from {{liabilities}} and a clear course; and what did I purpose doing in the interval of his absence? he asked. I had talked once, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me,</b> <b>of</b> trying to be independent and keeping a little school of my own: had I dropped the idea? ...|$|E
6000|$|Remorse! remorse! It {{seemed to}} me that it would eat the very heart out of me! And yet that small fiend only sat there leering at me with joy and contempt, and placidly chuckling. Presently he began to speak again. Every {{sentence}} was an accusation, and every accusation a truth. Every clause was freighted with sarcasm and derision, every slow-dropping word burned like vitriol. The dwarf reminded me of times when I had flown at my children in anger and punished them for faults which a little inquiry would have taught me that others, and not they, had committed. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> how I had disloyally allowed old friends to be traduced in my hearing, and been too craven to utter a word in their defense. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> many dishonest things which I had done; of many which I had procured to be done by children and other irresponsible persons; of some which I had planned, thought upon, and longed to do, and been kept from the performance by fear of consequences only. With exquisite cruelty he recalled to my mind, item by item, wrongs and unkindnesses I had inflicted and humiliations I had put upon friends since dead, [...] "who died thinking of those injuries, maybe, and grieving over them," [...] he added, by way of poison to the stab.|$|E
60|$|LONDON, April 19th, 1877.--Last night, at Lady H---'s, I met Edmund Stanmer, {{who married}} Bianca Salvi's daughter. I heard {{the other day}} that they had come to England. A {{handsome}} young fellow, with a fresh contented face. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Florence, which I didn't pretend to forget; but it was rather awkward, for I remember I used to disparage that woman to him. I had a complete theory about her. But he didn't seem at all stiff; on the contrary, he appeared to enjoy our encounter. I asked him if his wife were there. I had to do that.|$|E
6000|$|The {{latter part}} of this {{discourse}} {{took place in the}} street. They passed the Chief, the Colonel and he sternly and punctiliously greeting each other, like two duellists before they take their ground. It was evident the dislike was mutual. 'I never see that surly fellow that dogs his heels,' said the Colonel, after he had mounted his horse, 'but <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> lines I have somewhere heard--upon the stage, I think:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An ill-conditioned fellow, our host," [...] <b>he</b> said--"quite <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{our friend}} Brogard at the Chat Gris in Calais. You {{remember}} him, Lady Blakeney?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Agatha, I {{must tell}} you <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> strangely <b>of</b> a young Mr. Merrifield whom I knew at Filsted when I was younger than you." ...|$|R
