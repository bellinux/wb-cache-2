5|$|Aspirin is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are <b>known</b> <b>to</b> enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E

5|$|Doxorubicin is also <b>known</b> <b>to</b> be fluorescent.

However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It is also <b>known</b> <b>to</b> self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E
