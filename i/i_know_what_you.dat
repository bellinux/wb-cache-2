500|$|Killing Mr. Griffin {{was first}} {{published}} in April 1978 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. In October 2010, Little, Brown reissued the novel in paperback with updates to modernize some of the content. Killing Mr. Griffin, along with <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Did Last Summer and Don't Look Behind You, were the first group of ten different titles that were updated and reissued with these changes. An audiobook was released by Listening Library in 1986, and another, read by Ed Sala, was released by Recorded Books in 1998. A reviewer from AudioFile felt that Sala's narration was effective, although occasionally he [...] "seems to lose concentration and expression." [...] A 2010 audiobook, narrated by Dennis Holland, was published by Hachette Audio and features the modernized text.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Did Last Summer, on a foggy evening with a full moon, the Simpsons are driving down a coastal road when Marge accidentally smashes into Ned Flanders, killing him. Homer manipulates the body in several escapades, which convinces Maude that Ned {{died of a heart}} attack and that he does not want an autopsy. Shortly after Ned's funeral, the family finds the phrase [...] "I Know What You Did!" [...] written in blood {{everywhere}} they go. They are terrorized by a cloaked figure, which drives them out of their house. Again, in the wild, they find Ned. It turns out he lived because he was bitten by a werewolf moments before the accident. Clouds uncover the full moon, Ned changes into a werewolf and Marge, Bart, Maggie and Lisa run away. Ned mauls Homer to death while Homer mocks him.|$|E

500|$|Richardson {{began the}} 1960s with a failure. Enid Bagnold's play The Last Joke was savaged by the critics ("a {{meaningless}} jumble of pretentious whimsy" [...] was one description). His {{only reason for}} playing in the piece was the chance of acting with Gielgud, but both men quickly regretted their involvement. Richardson {{then went to the}} US to appear in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of Long Day's Journey into Night, alongside Katharine Hepburn. Lumet later recalled how little guidance Richardson needed. Once, the director went into lengthy detail about the playing of a scene, and when he had finished, Richardson said, [...] "Ah, I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want – a little more flute and a little less cello". After that, Lumet was sparing with suggestions. Richardson was jointly awarded the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor prize with his co-stars Jason Robards Jr and Dean Stockwell.|$|E
500|$|The opening segment, {{which shows}} Kang and Kodos {{attempting}} to entertain {{an audience of}} aliens, was [...] "born out of [...] love" [...] of comedy teams like Martin and Lewis and the Smothers Brothers. The plot of [...] "I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did" [...] {{is based on the}} 1997 horror film <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Did Last Summer. At the beginning of the segment, the Simpsons are seen escaping from a group of vampires. Holding a package of Super Sugar Crisp cereal, Homer starts singing a jingle about the cereal. Super Sugar Crisp is a reference to the breakfast cereal Golden Crisp, while the jingle Homer sings references [...] "Can't get enough of that Golden Crisp", a jingle sung by Golden Crisp's mascot Sugar Bear during advertisements for the cereal. According to Scully, the series' staff had a lot of trouble clearing the song for the episode. [...] "Apparently, they didn't want the tune [...] used in this context" [...] he said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
500|$|After a stint of festival appearances, Korn {{promoted}} The Path of Totality {{during a}} headlining {{tour of the}} same name. Korn split their show into three sections. The band kicked off by playing [...] "rare" [...] songs from their first two albums, including the b-side [...] "Proud", which was originally included on the soundtrack to the 1997 film <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Did Last Summer. They followed with a different stage set up, playing several of their new songs. The set list ended with hit singles and an encore. Other appearances came from Dope D.O.D., Datsik and Downlink. A special album release performance filmed and recorded at the Hollywood Palladium was issued in various formats through Shout! Factory in September 2012. The Path of Totality won Album of the Year at the 2012 Revolver Golden Gods Awards. This was Korn's first victory at the Golden Gods Awards, a ceremony that celebrates the best in hard rock and heavy metal music. Korn was also inducted into the Kerrang!

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the film Viva Las Vegas (1964). The panic and smoke cloud generated from the implosion of Mr Burns' casino is reminiscent of the 1997 disaster film Dante's Peak, and the Simpson family's escape from the smoke cloud is {{a reference to}} a scene in the 1996 science fiction film Independence Day. Outside Rev. Lovejoy's church is a notice that today's sermon will be 'He Knows What You Did Last Summer', which is {{a reference to the}} title of the 1997 slasher film <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Did Last Summer. As Homer and Ned escape from Vegas, a snippet of the theme from the 1996 comic science fiction film Mars Attacks! can be heard. The Comic Book Guy's license plate is NCC-1701, which is also the registration of the USS Enterprise, a fictional starship from the Star Trek media franchise. He also has a bumper sticker which reads [...] "my other car is the Millennium Falcon" [...] which was given to him by somebody who looked like the actor Harrison Ford; the Millennium Falcon was the ship used by Ford's character Han Solo in the Star Wars film series. The line Homer gives after Ned signs the contract is a reference to the 1997 film The Game.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of Glee second season, Lauren forms a {{relationship}} with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman. As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean, but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, {{it comes down to}} whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about {{the two of them together}} that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to Screams {{release the}} {{popularity}} of the horror genre had been considered to be in decline with many films released straight to video while those released in cinemas were sequels to popular and established franchises, such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, capable of drawing audiences despite decreasing budgets and diminishing critical reception. The glut of sequels contributed to audience familiarity with the icons of the late 1970s and early 1980s such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees that they were considered to have lost their ability to instill scares or interest in their audience. Scream, utilizing a popular and attractive cast and an innovative script that mocked and embraced the conventions of horror which had become considered clichéd, was credited with changing the status of the genre, becoming both a financial and critical success, and launching the careers of many of its actors. Such was the film's impact that some commentators considered its legacy as the creation of a distinct era of [...] "post-Scream" [...] horror films. Following its release many studios, including Screams own Dimension Films, rushed to capitalize on its unexpected success with the release of films such as <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Did Last Summer (1997) and Urban Legend (1998) as well as sequels to popular, but diminishing, franchises such as [...] and Bride of Chucky.|$|E

500|$|S. T. Karnick, {{editor of}} American Culture, {{wrote an article}} for the National Review {{detailing}} the impact Friday the 13th has had on the slasher genre and noting that the reasons critics have deplored the films are the same reasons why the franchise has had such a strong influence. Karnick explained that Friday the 13th did not try and recreate the same [...] "clever" [...] film that John Carpenter made in 1978, but instead [...] " [...] the formula" [...] of Halloween, and [...] " [...] it down to its essentials" [...] {{so that it could}} be copied by other filmmakers. In his assessment, Friday the 13th changed the horror genre by purposefully not providing back‑stories for characters so that when the audience witnessed a character's death, they are [...] "strangely unaffected". Instead, Friday the 13th focuses on the history and motivations of the killer, who would exact revenge not on the people directly responsible, but on innocent people—a formula Karnick notes was replicated in A Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, Scream, <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Did Last Summer, Saw, the Hannibal Lecter films, and the Halloween sequels. As Karnick sees it, [...] "these films spoke directly to fears of increasing crime and social dislocation [...] provided audiences with ways to detach from these worries and conquer their fears of violence by laughing at it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] was {{directed}} by Pete Michels and written by Donick Cary, Tim Long and Ron Hauge. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on Halloween,1999. [...] "I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did" [...] was conceived and written by former staff writer Cary. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Cary said that {{he came up with}} the segment after watching the 1997 horror film <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Did Last Summer. [...] "I had just seen the movie and I was like, 'Hey, there you go.'" [...] he said. While Flanders serves as the segment's antagonist, the role would originally go to Grampa, who would chase Homer inside a roller disco. While Grampa does not appear in the segment, the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders. Despite serving as writer for the segment, Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated Austin Powers series, which never came to fruition. In his absence, the writing staff rewrote {{the last quarter of the}} segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf. In order to dispose of Ned Flanders' corpse, Homer throws his body into Flanders' house. After he is finished, he says [...] "That's the end of that chapter", a phrase that Cary often uses in his everyday life. [...] "That's just something that comes up a lot in my life is when no matter if it's a good or a bad thing, just move on" [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Singer {{first read}} Apt Pupil {{when he was}} 19 years old, and {{when he became a}} director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script {{adapting}} the novella. [...] Boyce recalled the writing process, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} stageplay, actually... two people, pretty much in a house talking. [...] My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't work out, at least I'd have a writing sample." [...] When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, [...] "Stephen loved it. He seemed to think I captured the mood of the piece." [...] The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal: [...] "There have been a lot of fun horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, and <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Did Last Summer. But I miss movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and The Innocents by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie sort of in the spirit of the real horror movie." ...|$|E
