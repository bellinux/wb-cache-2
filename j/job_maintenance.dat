40|$|Employees with {{a chronic}} {{physical}} condition may be hampered in job performance due to physical or cognitive limitations, pain, fatigue, psychosocial barriers, or because medical treatment interferes with work. This study investigates {{the effect of}} a group-training program aimed at <b>job</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Essential elements of the program are exploration of work-related problems, communication at the workplace, and {{the development and implementation of}} solutions. Participants with chronic physical diseases were randomly assigned to the intervention (N= 64) or the control group (N= 58). Participants were eligible for the study if they had a chronic physical disease, paid employment, experienced work-related problems, and were not on long-term 100 % sick leave. Primary outcome measures were self-efficacy in solving work- and disease-related problems (14 - 70), job dissatisfaction (0 - 100), fatigue (20 - 140) and <b>job</b> <b>maintenance</b> measured at 4 -, 8 -, 12 - and 24 -month follow-up. We used GLM repeated measures for the analysis. After 24 months, loss to follow-up was 5. 7 % (7 / 122). Self-efficacy increased and fatigue decreased significantly more in the experimental than the control group [10 versus 4 points (P= 0. 000) and 19 versus 8 points (P= 0. 032), respectively]. Job satisfaction increased more in the experimental group but not significantly [6 versus 0 points (P= 0. 698) ]. <b>Job</b> <b>maintenance</b> was 87 % in the experimental and 91 % in the control group, which was not a significant difference.

The study also identified a number of risk factors associated with falls in the elderly. Although a causal relationship remains to be confirmed, some of these factors are potentially modifiable. They included both intrinsic health problems, such as impaired lower limb function and balance that might be addressed through targeted exercise regimens, and environmental aspects, such as the layout of the home and the presence of objects/situations that increase the likelihood of falls. Identification of such factors could help the development of interventions to reduce fall risks, potentially resulting in substantial health care cost savings.

40|$|Thesis: An {{integrated}} model of service delivery, combined with community partnerships for provision of childcare, focused training related to specific employer needs, {{and other resources}} indirectly related to return to employment, provide {{a system that is}} most effective and humanizing in assisting individuals to find meaningful employment. Summary: I. A number of factors have contributed to dehumanizing of Welfare Clients. Recent deep cuts to welfare amounts have left individuals without adequate funds for housing and food. Services divided between many agencies require clients to navigate a maze of places, people and paperwork. Agencies limited to one or two services must turn over large numbers of clients to provide revenue for survival, lessening their ability to provide relationship and stability to clients. II. An {{integrated model}}, such as the one Pathways Skill Development and Placement Centre is using, can provide full service from assessment to employment. Clients begin with common assessment and job search skills training, including interview skills and resume creation. Community Placement can offer short-term experience for skill and confidence development. Employment Placement can then liase with employers and clients and create fit between the two. Job mentors monitor and coach for long-term <b>job</b> <b>maintenance.</b> III. Partnerships between the Service Agency and other community agencies will be established to overcome other barriers. Childcare, specific job skills training identified with area employers, computer skills and similar resources will be drawn on, with case management continually handled by the service agency IV. Such a model provides an interactive, holistic, and client centred approach to the Welfare to Work system. It maintains client dignity and integrity, builds a support system that is stable, and contains the elements that build the independence and self-sufficiency of the client without becoming overwhelming. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the Independent Living (IL) program targeting foster youths to prepare them for effective adulthood. The study employed a pre-post, two-group comparative research design. The IL group was composed of 49 young adults who participated in the IL or SIL (subsidized IL) program prior to their emancipation from foster care (mean age, 20. 6 years). The comparison was made up of 18 young adults who experienced foster care but never participated in the IL or SIL programs (mean age, 20. 2 years). Data were collected via a mailed survey that included the Daniel Memorial Independent Living Assessment (DMILA) and an additional questionnaire developed by the researcher. The study also examined: (1) why youth in foster care do not participate in IL programs, (2) how participating youth evaluate IL services and what recommendations they make to improve services, and (3) the internal consistency of the DMILA. Results suggest that the DMILA assessment has mediocre reliability. IL program participation is associated with better educational, employment, income, housing, early parenting-prevention, transportation, anger control, criminal-prevention, and self-evaluation outcomes. However, IL participation is not associated with better social support, perceived parenting competence, substance abuse-prevention, sexual risk-prevention outcomes, increased knowledge in money management skills, job seeking and <b>job</b> <b>maintenance</b> skills, interpersonal skills, or lower depression. Results also suggest that the outreach activities of the IL program may be flawed. IL participants reported the IL program was doing best in educational preparation, criminal involvement prevention, and money management preparation and least well in parenting preparation, housing preparation, employment preparation, and substance abuse prevention. To improve services, youths recommended primarily that IL counselors develop closer relationships with youths, that IL training better address organizational skills, and that monthly subsidy be raised and SIL eligibility requirements softened.

This study examined the clinical relevance of cognitive impairment in early stages of infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) by identifying concurrent disruption of abilities related to daily functioning. In previous studies, deficiencies in cognitive abilities during pre-symptomatic HIV infection have been proposed to contribute to unemployment as well as residential placement problems. To date, neuropsychological studies of adaptive functioning in HIV-seropositive patients have used scales that may be too broadly constructed to discriminate subtle differences, or scales reliant on patient self-report rather than direct demonstration of functioning. The current study addressed these problems by using a performance-based scale of adaptive living skills, the Test of Everyday Living (TEL). A total of 48 participants were given neuropsychological and adaptive living skills evaluations in interview and paper-and-pencil formats. Of these, 24 participants reported intravenous drug use as their primary risk factor for HIV transmission, and 24 reported gay or bisexual contact as the primary risk factor. There {{were no significant differences between}} transmission risk groups on cognitive or demographic measures. Participants were grouped into impaired (n = 16) or unimpaired (n = 32) cognitive groups based on their performance relative to the sample mean on: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised Vocabulary subtest; Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span subtest; Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task, California Verbal Learning Test; and Trailmaking Test Parts A and B. The cognitive group means were comparable for age, education, and socio-economic status, but differed for estimated premorbid verbal IQ. Global and subscale scores on the TEL served as the dependent variables in testing differences between impaired and unimpaired groups. Even after controlling for premorbid verbal IQ differences in an analysis of covariance, significant group differences were found on total TEL test performance as well as on specific subtests measuring skills for <b>job</b> <b>maintenance,</b> purchasing and banking. The results of this study imply that case management for HIV-positive patients should include evaluation of cognitive and adaptive skills even prior to the emergence of opportunistic infections and AIDS.

For professionals involved in this analysis of fundamental importance appears the use of technical/good practice norms or the guide lines produced by scientific society or association, such as for our country the guide lines published on this theme by the Italian Society of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene (SIMLII). The objective {{of this research was}} to verify and validate the multiple step method suggested by above mentioned guide lines and to compare results obtained by six analysis methods adopted (Washington State Standard, OCRA, HAL, RULA, OREGE and STRAIN INDEX (SI)). 439 workstation in 17 manufactures employing 4166 workers for a total of 1396 analysis by different methods were considered, by adopting the following multiple step procedure: preliminary evaluation by Washington State method and OCRA checklist in all the working stations, RULA or HAL as first level evaluation, OREGE or SI as second level evaluation when complexity of work variables or contradictory results emerged. We have also collected data, provided by occupational physicians, about the pathologies of the upper limb. A representative sample of workers was also administered a INRS OREGE questionnaire that investigates the disorders of the upper limb, the subjective perception of risk, psychosocial factors and stress-related disturbs. The preliminary evaluation resulted negative (risk absent) in the 87 % of examined work stations and by using checklist OCRA optimal-acceptable condition was found in 57 % (the percentage reaches more than 90 % when classes of risk absent-very low-low risk classes of the method were considered all together), by HAL in 91 % of analysis, by RULA in 90 %, by OREGE in 58 %; by SI in 67 % of examined working position. Five methods have been contemporary used for 31 working position with the following results: 58 % at different degree of risk by OCRA, 13 % by HAL, 19 % by RULA; 13 % by OREGE; 10 % by SI. Among the main components of the bio mechanical risk the high frequency of working task resulted at first place for 4 / 5 methods and for checklist OCRA also the evaluation of recovery times. Consistent with the findings from {{risk assessment}}, the majority of reports of occupational diseases by occupational physician is localized at the wrist and workers assigned to tasks at risk not always have had occupational diseases. The role of main psychosocial factors was demonstrated in about the 15 - 20 % of working conditions and regarded in particular the working climate, the <b>job</b> <b>maintenance</b> perspective, the time pressure and errors possibility together with the difficulty of help by colleagues and managers and stress related disturbs. The preliminary evaluation by State of Washington method appears to be an adequate instrument for identify the working condition at risk. The results of this method appears well correlated with OCRA checklist and HAL. The risk conditions were always confirmed by higher complexity methods (RULA, OREGE, SI). All the adopted methods were in a good agreement in two extreme situations: high risk or absent risk.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer the {{research}} question: is the allocation of resources to insolvent company employees in Australia consistent with Rawlsian distributive justice? The analysis of the research question comprises two components: first, the allocation of resources to insolvent company employees that is required by Rawlsian distributive justice and second, whether Australian law is consistent with that allocation. This thesis focuses on four particular areas of Australian law: the priority regime that is applicable when an insolvent companyâ€™s assets are distributed to creditors, director and related company liability for employee entitlements, the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) and the procedure for corporate and business rescue contained in Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Employees are among the least advantaged persons {{in the event of}} corporate insolvency. According to Rawlsian distributive justice, resources must therefore be reallocated to ensure greater equality between employees and other persons â€˜affectedâ€™ by corporate insolvency, including secured creditors, quasi-secured creditors, consumers, shareholders, insolvency practitioners, directors and taxpayers. However, Rawlsâ€™s â€˜difference principleâ€™ permits inequalities between employees and other persons affected by corporate insolvency if those inequalities contribute to achieving the greatest benefit of employees, for example as a result of <b>job</b> <b>maintenance</b> or the payment of employee entitlements. The priority regime is broadly consistent with the Rawlsian objective of ensuring the greatest benefit of the least advantaged employees. Although employee entitlements receive only partial priority over the claims of secured creditors and are subordinated to the claims of quasi-secured creditors and insolvency practitioners, the better prospects of secured creditors, quasi-secured creditors and insolvency practitioners satisfy Rawlsâ€™s difference principle because they are likely to preserve employment and the payment of employee entitlements in the ordinary course of business, thus contributing to the greatest benefit of employees. Director and related company liability for employee entitlements is likely to be beneficial for employees only in circumstances where directors and related companies engage in improper behaviour in relation to the payment of entitlements. Liability outside those circumstances is likely to jeopardise employment and the payment of employee entitlements. However, existing Australian law does not adequately provide for director and related company liability in circumstances of improper behaviour. Amendments to director and related company liability for employee entitlements in Part 5. 8 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), including the replacement of the test of subjective intention with an objective test, are likely to contribute to the greatest benefit of employees, thus ensuring greater consistency with the Rawlsian framework. In certain respects, GEERS is consistent with Rawlsian distributive justice. For example, GEERS reduces inequalities between employees and taxpayers; operates in conjunction with the employee priority regime and director and related company for employee entitlements, thus facilitating the equal sharing of resources among claimants; and effectively differentiates between the relative levels of disadvantage faced by individual employees in the event of corporate insolvency. However, the limitation of GEERS to liquidation and the restriction on claimable wages pursuant to GEERS compromise the Rawlsian objective of ensuring the greatest benefit of employees. The corporate and business rescue procedure contained in Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) facilitates sustained employment and the preservation of employee entitlements, thus contributing to the greatest benefit of employees. Additionally, Part 5. 3 A does not encourage â€˜hopelessâ€™ rescue attempts and does not override the interests of secured and quasi-secured creditors, thus avoiding outcomes that may otherwise compromise the greatest benefit of employees. However, the ability of substantial charge holders to remain outside a Part 5. 3 A corporate or business rescue attempt is likely to adversely affect the interests of employees, thus implementing greater protection for secured creditors than is required to satisfy Rawlsâ€™s difference principle...|$|E
