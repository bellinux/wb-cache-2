This allows regulators to take into account the contributions of global mercury sources in a consistent way with other pollutants of concern. We use the GEOS-Chem mercury simulation (which includes the species Hg(0), Hg(II) and Hg(P)) to show the contributions of sources other than domestic anthropogenic emissions to wet and dry deposition to the U.

Simulated wet deposition shows a latitudinal gradient, with higher deposition at lower latitudes reflecting the influence of oxidation of Hg(0) to Hg(II) by OH and its subsequent deposition. A regional enhancement in total (wet+dry) deposition is seen in the Midwest in the model, which is a result of proximity to sources. Measurements show a similar regional enhancement.

40|$|The MESSENGER {{mission to}} Mercury offers our first {{opportunity}} to explore this planet s miniature magnetosphere since the brief flybys of Mariner 10. <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> magnetosphere is unique in many respects. The magnetosphere of Mercury is among the smallest in the solar system; its magnetic field typically stands off the solar wind only - 1000 to 2000 km above the surface. For this reason there are no closed drift paths for energetic particles and, hence, no radiation belts. The characteristic time scales for wave propagation and convective transport are short and kinetic and fluid modes may be coupled. Magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause may erode the subsolar magnetosphere allowing solar wind ions to impact directly the regolith. Inductive currents in <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> interior may act to modify the solar wind interaction by resisting changes due to solar wind pressure variations. Indeed, observations of these induction effects {{may be an important}} source of information on the state of <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> interior. In addition, <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> magnetosphere is the only one with its defining magnetic flux tubes rooted in a planetary regolith as opposed to an atmosphere with a conductive ionospheric layer. This lack of an ionosphere is probably the underlying reason for the brevity of the very intense, but short-lived, - 1 - 2 min, substorm-like energetic particle events observed by Mariner 10 during its first traversal of <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> magnetic tail. Because of <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> proximity to the sun, 0. 3 - 0. 5 AU, this magnetosphere experiences the most extreme driving forces in the solar system. All of these factors are expected to produce complicated interactions involving the exchange and re-cycling of neutrals and ions between the solar wind, magnetosphere, and regolith. The electrodynamics of <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> magnetosphere are expected to be equally complex, with strong forcing by the solar wind, magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause and in the tail, and the pick-up of planetary ions all driving field-aligned electric currents. However, these field-aligned currents do not close in an ionosphere, but in some other manner. In addition to the insights- into magnetospheric physics offered by study of the solar wind - Mercury system, quantitative specification of the "external" magnetic field generated by magnetospheric currents is necessary for accurate determination of the strength and multi-polar decomposition of <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> intrinsic magnetic field.

In this study we present a 17 300 years old record of mercury accumulation in lake sediments in combination with a multi-proxy investigation of climatic and environmental changes in Southernmost Patagonia (53 ° <b>S).</b> <b>Mercury</b> accumulation in the remote pristine lake has been highly variable (up to a factor of 16), clearly exceeding the anthropogenic forcing of atmospheric mercury fluxes (factor of 3 – 5). Statistical data evaluation based on Principle Component Analysis reveals that the dominant driver of variations in mercury accumulation along with other organically bound elements (e. g. copper and yttrium) has been leaching of soluble organic complexes from catchment soils. This indicates that changes in precipitation rates and soils leaching are the most important climatic driver for short term variations in mercury in the lake's sediments. In the long term, however, mercury accumulation rates remain relatively constant (29 μg m − 2 yr − 1). This reflects that mercury accumulation in the catchment soils through atmospheric deposition and bedrock weathering has been fairly constant, too. As carbon storage in the soils and transport into the lake have increased, Hg/C ratios in the soil OM decreased. Fluxes of Hg into the lake are therefore mainly determined by the amount of OM leached into the lake and its Hg/C ratio...|$|R

Although the domestic dog is considered the most important reservoir of the disease, other mammalian, including wildlife, are susceptible to infection. The goal {{of this study was to}} perform xenodiagnosis to evaluate the capacity of naturally infected maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) to transmit Leishmania infantum to female sand flies (L. longipalpis). Xenodiagnoses were performed in February and August, 2013, when 77. 7 % (three maned wolves and four bush dogs) or 100 % of the animals were positive, respectively. However, parasite loads in the engorged sand flies was low (< 200 promastigotes and < 150. 2 parasites/μg of DNA).

Furthermore, methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius is emerging, resembling the human health threat of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore it is increasingly important to characterize targets for intervention strategies to counteract S. pseudintermedius infections. Here we used biophysical methods, mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallo-graphy, to define the ligand-binding properties and structure of SitA, an S. pseudintermedius surface lipoprotein. SitA was strongly and specifically stabilized by Mn 2 + and Zn 2 + ions. Crystal structures of SitA complexed with Mn 2 + and Zn 2 + revealed a canonical class III solute-binding protein with the metal cation bound in a cavity between N-and C-terminal lobes. Unexpectedly, one crystal contained both apo- and holo-forms of SitA, revealing a large side-chain reorientation of His 64, and associated structural differences accompanying ligand binding. Such conformational changes may regulate fruitful engagement of the cognate ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter system (SitBC) required for metal uptake. These results provide the first detailed characterization and mechanistic insights for a potential therapeutic target of the major canine pathogen S. pseudintermedius, and also shed light on homologous structures in related staphylococcal pathogens afflicting humans...|$|R

OEt 2. The structures of these regioisomers was confirmed by 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR studies and the crystal structure was studies using single crystal X-ray diffraction technique. Conclusions. An easy and efficient synthetic route was employed for the preparation of two nitro-regioisomers of the tetrahydroquinoline derivatives. The spectroscopy analyses (NMR, GC-MS and X-ray diffraction) showed a complete characterization and permit to establish the correct stereochemistry for the tetrahydroquinoline ring. The molecular packing for the 5 -nitro regioisomer 4 was resulted by combinations of intermolecular hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions, while 7 -nitro regioisomer 3 possesses only intermolecular van der Waals interactions and N—H··· π interactions also occur...|$|R
40|$|Environmental mercury {{measurements}} were started in Fy- 01 at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEEL) to monitor downwind impacts from on-going waste treatment {{operations at the}} Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) and to improve our scientific understanding of mercury fate and transport in this region. This document provides {{a summary of the}} sampling done in FY 04. Continuous total gaseous mercury (TGM) {{measurements were}} made using a Tekran Model 2537 A mercury vapor analyzer during October 2002 and from February through July 2003. The equipment was deployed in a self-contained field trailer at the Experimental Field Station (EFS) four kilometers downwind (northeast) of INTEC. Mercury surface-to-air flux measurements were made in October 2002 and from February through May 2003 to better understand the fate of the estimated 1500 kg of mercury emitted from 36 years of calciner operations at INTEC and to improve our scientific understanding of mercury environmental cycling in this region. Flux was measured using an INEEL-designed dynamic flux chamber system with a Tekran automated dual sampling (TADS) unit. Diel flux was positively correlated with solar radiation (r = 0. 65), air temperature (r = 0. 64), and wind speed (r = 0. 38), and a general linear model for flux prediction at the INEEL was developed. Reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) was measured at EFS in July using a Tekran Model 1130 mercury speciation unit. Based on comparisons with other published data around the U. <b>S.,</b> <b>mercury</b> air concentrations and surface flux rates directly downwind from INTEC were not distinguishable from remote area (non-industrial) background levels during the monitoring period...|$|R
40|$|The region {{upstream}} from a planetary bow shock {{is a natural}} plasma laboratory containing a variety of wave particle phenomena. The study of foreshocks other than the Earth s is important for extending our understanding of collisionless shocks and foreshock physics since the bow shock strength varies with heliocentric distance from the Sun, and the sizes of the bow shocks are different at different planets. The <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> bow shock is unique {{in our solar system}} as it is produced by low Mach number solar wind blowing over a small magnetized body with a predominately radial interplanetary magnetic field. Previous observations of Mercury upstream ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves came exclusively from two Mercury flybys of Mariner 10. The MESSENGER orbiter data enable us to study of upstream waves in the <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> foreshock in depth. This paper reports an overview of upstream ULF waves in the <b>Mercury</b> <b>s</b> foreshock using high-time resolution magnetic field data, 20 samples per second, from the MESSENGER spacecraft. The most common foreshock waves have frequencies near 2 Hz, with properties similar to the 1 -Hz waves in the Earth s foreshock. They are present in both the flyby data and in every orbit of the orbital data we have surveyed. The most common wave phenomenon in the Earth s foreshock is the large-amplitude 30 -s waves, but similar waves at Mercury have frequencies at ~ 0. 1 Hz and occur only sporadically with short durations (a few wave cycles). Superposed on the " 30 -s" waves, there are spectral peaks at ~ 0. 6 Hz, not reported previously in Mariner 10 data. We will discuss wave properties and their occurrence characteristics in this paper...|$|R
