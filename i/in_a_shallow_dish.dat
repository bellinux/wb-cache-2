50|$|The {{presentation}} of baked {{fish in a}} paper envelope is about theater and spectacle. There are no purely culinary reasons to do it. The same effect can be had by baking fish <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> with a tight lid. As long as the contents can be heated quickly {{and most of the}} steam retained, you will get the same basic dish. But grand restaurants are not simply about the food. At their best, they create a sense of specialness, of celebration, of achievement, and even a bit of mystique. Great restaurants today do this. Antoine's has been doing it since the mid 19th century. The presentation en papillote is an attention getter in the dining room, much like a soufflé has always been, and much like the now played-out towering architectural food of the 1990s was.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the {{traditional}} northern Lunar New Year dishes such as thịt đông, giò thủ, and [...] canh măng móng giò involve the use of pig heads, tongues, throats and feet. Pig and beef tails, as well as chicken heads, necks and feet, are Vietnamese favorite beer dishes. Bóng, used as an ingredient in canh bóng - a kind of soup, is pig skin baked until popped. Steamed pig brains can be found almost anywhere along a Vietnamese street. Also {{in the northern part}} of Vietnam, different kinds of animal blood can be made into a dish called tiết canh by whisking the blood with fish sauce and cold water <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> along with finely chopped, cooked duck innards (such as gizzards), sprinkled with crushed peanuts and chopped herbs such as Vietnamese coriander, mint, etc. It is then cooled until the blood coagulates into a soft, jelly-like mixture and served raw.|$|E
50|$|The freshly drawn {{blood is}} {{collected}} in a bowl, and prevented from premature coagulation (hãm huyết), by mixing it with some fish sauce of certain proportions, usually three to five soup spoons of fish sauce for one quart (approximately 1 liter) of blood. Finely chopped meat such as cooked duck innards (such as gizzards) and duck meat are put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> along with a sprinkling of crushed peanuts and chopped herbs such as Vietnamese coriander, mint, etc. The blood and fish sauce mixture is then diluted with some watery broth left from cooking the meat and/or gizzards to promote blood coagulation, then quickly poured into the prepared meat dish. After the blood has set, the finished dish resembles a pizza. The finished dish can be kept cooled in the refrigerator, which allows the blood to maintain its coagulated state, when immediate consumption is not called for right away. If the dish {{is removed from the}} refrigerator and left to sit at room temperature for a while the blood will return to a liquid state.|$|E
40|$|The sera {{of persons}} or monkeys {{actively}} immunized to yellow fever will react to "fix " complement inrhen mixed with saline extracts of livers taken at autopsy from monkeys which {{have died of}} yellow fever (1). Methods of demonstrating this reaction and of employing it in routine complement-fixation tests have been previously described (2). The nature of the substance in the liver extracts which enters into the reaction is not known. That it is not present in normal livers {{and is not a}} collateral antigen composed of foreign protein accompanying the virus was pointed out in our first report (1). This was also shown by Davis (3) by means of mosquito-infected monkeys, and subsequently was amply confirmed by studies in this laboratory (2, 4). That it is probably not lipoidal in character as are certain antigens for syphilis, tuberculosis (Craig), amoebiasis (Craig) (5), bilharziasis (Fairley), cestodiasis (Meyer), and diphtheria (Freund), is now indicated by the following data. The livers of rhesus monkeys which had died of yellow fever were removed in toto at autopsy. After tissue had been taken for histo-logical examination and all adventitious material had been removed, each liver was weighed, cut with scissors into small pieces, and ground to <b>a</b> paste <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mortar with clean sand. The paste of each liver was spread <b>in</b> <b>a</b> broad, <b>shallow</b> <b>dish,</b> placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> desiccator, and allowed to dry over sulphuric acid in vacuo.

5000|$|Both under-watering and over-watering can be {{detrimental}} to a houseplant. The best way {{to determine whether a}} plant needs water is to check the soil moisture. Feeling the soil is most reliable, since moisture meters are often inaccurate. Most potted plants must be allowed to reach an appropriate level of dryness in between waterings, though the amount of watering required varies greatly depending on the species. Proper soil moisture can range from still slightly moist on the soil surface to very dry to nearly the bottom of the pot. Watering a plant by the calendar is not recommended. If a plant does need to be watered, water should be slowly poured over the surface of the soil until it begins to drain out the bottom of the pot, ensuring complete saturation. However, sometimes the soil separates from the sides of the pot if it is allowed to dry out thoroughly, allowing the water to flow down the sides of the rootball and out the bottom too quickly to be absorbed and retained by the soil and roots. If this is the case, {{it may be necessary to}} set the plant <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> of water long enough for it to soak up enough water to moisten the rootball to its center. Repotting should eliminate this problem. Repotting should be done only when necessary, since the roots of a plant that is in an excessively large pot may rot.|$|E

40|$|Author: Microscopy Laboratory General notes: The same {{procedures}} {{are used to}} fix and stain cells for SEM and for TEM. Cells can be fixed using conventional [glutaraldehyde-osmium fixation]([URL] described for transmission electron microscopy. To preserve ciliary orientation, use the "instant fixation" protocol described here. With this method, the cortex and ciliary beat form is well preserved but the cytoplasm is poorly preserved and membrane breakage and blebbing on the cell surface is evident. To suspend cells, use a wide bore pipette and gentle flow to avoid damaging cells. Polypropylene disposable Pasteur pipettes work very well for all procedures. Carry out all fixation procedures in a properly vented fume hood. Supplies and most EM chemicals {{can be obtained from}} Electron Microscope Sciences, Ernest F. Fullum, Ladd Research Industries, Polysciences, Ted Pella, and Bio-Rad. ### Instant fixation **Materials:** - Polypropylene conical centrifuge tube (Falcon 35 - 2097 or equivalent) - Ice in ice bucket **Solutions:** - 200 mM stock solution of sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7. 2 - 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate (allow a few hours to dissolve) - Deionized water Glutaraldehyde - 10 % or 25 % stocks in sealed ampoules - Osmium tetroxide - 4 % solution in deionized water. To prepare, score and break an ampoule containing crystalline OsO 4 and drop the open ampoule into a small amber jar. Add appropriate amount of deionized water and let dissolve at room temperature for several days. Store in a second jar at 4 degrees C. OsO 4 tends to evaporate and blacken surfaces, so the second jar is highly recommended. It is best to use a separate refrigerator for fixatives. OsO 4 solutions also can be frozen in small aliquots and stored at - 20 degrees C. Fix: 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde, 2 % OsO 4, 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7. 2 Mix glutaraldehyde and cacodylate. Add OsO 4 and mix immediately before adding to cells. ### Procedure: 1. Harvest cells in a clinical or appropriate low speed centrifuge. Centrifuge to obtain a loose pellet of cells (setting # 3, 5 min with a clinical centrifuge). - (Optional, but produces cleaner cell surface) Gently pellet cells from the culture medium and suspend in room temperature HNMK (50 mM HEPES, pH 6. 9, 36 mM NaCl, 0. 1 mM Mg acetate, 1 mM KCl) at a concentration of 106 - 108 cells/ml. Put in a shallow container and gently agitate for 10 - 30 min at room temperature to aerate cells. - Decant most of the medium/HNMK and suspend cells in a slurry (< 1 ml of remaining medium or HNMK). Transfer to a 16 ml polypropylene conical centrifuge tube. - Rapidly add the freshly prepared glutaraldehyde-OsO 4, mixture, mix well, and immediately put the tube in ice. Fix for 30 - 60 min. If the solution turns black, pellet the cells, remove the fix, and add a fresh aliquot of a freshly prepared mixture of glutaraldehyde-OsO 4. - Wash cells at least 3 times with deionized water at room temperature. If necessary, gently pellet cells during each wash. - Suspend cells in 0. 5 - 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate and leave at room temperature for at least 1 hr. Cells can be stored for weeks in uranyl acetate. - Proceed to ethanol dehydration and critical point drying (SEM) or acetone dehydration and embedding (TEM), below. ### Critical point drying We use one of two methods. **Method 1 :** This is preferred but requires microporous specimen capsules (# 4620; Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA), which cost ~$ 2. 00 each. 1. Dehydrate uranyl acetate-treated cells in a series of ethanol-water washes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, two 95 %, and three 100 % ethanol). If possible, use ethanol dried over molecular sieve pellets (Sigma Chemical Corp. #M 2260). Dehydrate in polypropylene conical centrifuge tubes and let cells settle between washes. - Place specimen capsule <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>dish</b> (ex: glass petri dish) containing 100 % dry ethanol and transfer dehydrated cells into the capsule. Do not fill the capsule more than about one third full with cells or they will cake during the drying procedure. Firmly fit the lid to the capsule and transfer to the critical point dryer. - If more than one sample capsule will be dried at the same time, label the outside of each capsule with pencil and/or insert a tiny piece of paper (marked with pencil) into the capsule before capping. - Critical point dry cells using a critical point drying apparatus and CO 2. - Dust the dried cells on a SEM specimen stub covered with a piece of double stick tape. Spreading is easier if cells are brushed on the tape with a fine camel hair brush while observing spreading with a dissecting microscope. - Coat specimens on the stubs with gold/palladium using a sputter coater. - Store specimens in a dry container. **Method 2 :** This method is simple but requires that cells or organelles stick to a coated glass coverslip. Many cells are lost during the dehydration procedure but, usually, more than enough cells will stick for SEM observation. 1. Place a 12 mm circular coverslip on a piece of Parafilm or in a small plastic or glass petri dish. - Apply a drop of an 0. 5 % aqueous solution of polyethylenimine (Sigma P- 3143) to the coverslip. Let sit for 10 - 20 min. - Remove the drop of polyethylenimine and rinse with one or two drops of deionized water. - Put a drop of fixed cells in water or uranyl acetate on the coverslip and let settle for 5 - 10 min. - Dehydrate samples with a series of ethanol-water washes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, two 95 %, and three 100 % ethanol). For the last, washes, use ethanol dried by molecular sieve pellets (Sigma Chemical Corporation, Cat #M 2260). Many cells will detach from the coverslips during the dehydration procedure. This can be minimized if solutions are removed with a pipette held vertically over the specimens. - Dry cells using a critical point drying apparatus and CO 2. Use a cover-slip holder designed for the dryer or prop the coverslips on a plastic separator removed from a typical microscope slide box. - Remove the coverslips from the dryer and attach them to SEM specimen stubs using double stick tape or adhesive tabs (# 76760 from Electron Microscopy Sciences). - Coat specimens with gold/palladium (60 - 40) using a [sputter coater]([URL] - Store specimens in a dry container...|$|E
