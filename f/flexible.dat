5|$|Herrerasaurus had a <b>flexible</b> {{joint in}} the lower jaw that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a {{grasping}} bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and <b>flexible.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, the ReactOS project {{announced}} an Indiegogo campaign to launch ReactOS Community Edition, {{a version of}} ReactOS based on the 0.4 release. The <b>flexible</b> funding campaign had a goal of US$50,000 with additional stretch goals beyond that. Development of ReactOS Community Edition would be community-centric, with ReactOS users voting and funding to decide which software and hardware drivers the project will aim to support. On 1 June 2014, the <b>flexible</b> crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo was finished with raising $25,141 {{for the development of}} the community edition, and the voting process to support hardware and software was started shortly after.|$|E

5|$|These starfish are deep-sea {{dwelling}} {{and have}} particularly <b>flexible</b> arms. The inner dorso-lateral {{surfaces of the}} arms contain characteristic longitudinal muscle bands. In some species, the tube feet lack suckers.|$|E
5|$|Water {{efficiency}} is being improved {{on a global}} scale by increased demand management, improved infrastructure, improved water productivity of agriculture, minimising the water intensity (embodied water) of goods and services, addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world, concentrating food production in areas of high productivity, and planning for climate change, such as through <b>flexible</b> system design. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are <b>flexible</b> and reversible. At the local level, people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water.|$|E

25|$|<b>Flexible</b> {{electronics}} are polymers {{or other}} <b>flexible</b> materials (e.g. silk, pentacene, PDMS, parylene, polyimide) that are printed with circuitry; the <b>flexible</b> {{nature of the}} organic background materials allowing the electronics created to bend, and the fabrication techniques utilized to create these devices resembles those used to create integrated circuits and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). <b>Flexible</b> electronics were first developed in 1960s and 1970s, but research interest increased in the mid-2000s.|$|E
25|$|The <b>flexible</b> simple point-charge water model (or <b>flexible</b> SPC water model) is a re-parametrization of the three-site SPC water model. The SPC {{model is}} rigid, whilst the <b>flexible</b> SPC model is <b>flexible.</b> In {{the model of}} Toukan and Rahman, the O–H {{stretching}} is made anharmonic, and thus the dynamical behavior is well described. This {{is one of the}} most accurate three-center water models without taking into account the polarization. In molecular dynamics simulations it gives the correct density and dielectric permittivity of water.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option in}} this {{category}} is the <b>flexible</b> partial, which takes advantage of innovations in digital technology. <b>Flexible</b> partial fabrication involves only non-invasive procedures.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for some polyhedra to change their overall shape, while keeping the shapes of their faces the same, by varying the angles of their edges. A polyhedron that can do {{this is called a}} <b>flexible</b> polyhedron. By Cauchy's rigidity theorem, <b>flexible</b> polyhedra must be non-convex. The volume of a <b>flexible</b> polyhedron must remain constant as it flexes; this result is known as the bellows theorem.|$|E

25|$|These octahedra {{were the}} first <b>flexible</b> polyhedra to be discovered.|$|E
25|$|Another of Hilbert's problems, Hilbert's 18th problem, {{concerns}} (among other things) polyhedra that tile space. Every such polyhedron {{must have}} Dehn invariant zero.
