Although Orbiter contains a database of over 100,000 stars, these are for display purposes only and interstellar travel is currently not possible in the simulator. The simulator also includes a planetarium mode that allows ecliptic and celestial grids to be overlaid onto the star map, along with labels of the constellations and other celestial markers. The planetarium mode can also <b>display</b> <b>labels</b> indicating the location and identity of objects in the solar system, such as planets, moons, or vessels, that appear within a certain proximity based on their type.

40|$|Abstract. The {{steady-state}} distribution of endogenous albumin in mouse diaphragm {{was determined by}} quantitative postembedding protein A-gold immunocytochemistry using a specific anti-mouse albumin antibody: Labeling density was recorded over vascular lumen, endothelium, junctions, and subendothelial space. At equilibrium, the volume density of interstitial albumin was 18 % of that in circulation. Despite this large difference in albumin concentration between capillary lumen and interstitium, ptasmalemmal vesicles labeling was uniformly distributed across the endothelial profile. 68 % of the junctions <b>displayed</b> <b>labeling</b> for albumin, which was however low and confined to the luminal and abluminal sides.

40|$|In situ {{hybridisation}} {{to identify}} P 2 Y 2 receptor mRNA was performed {{for the first}} time at the ultrastructural level on the thymus of adult male rats. These studies revealed transcripts for P 2 Y 2 receptors in cortical T cells and endothelial cells of thymic blood vessels. These transcripts are likely to be linked with the production of functional P 2 Y 2 receptors in these cells. In the T cells, transcripts for the P 2 Y 2 receptor were localised in the cytoplasm as well as on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and cell membrane. Dividing T cells also expressed P 2 Y 2 receptor mRNA, mostly in the cytoplasm around chromosomal Abbreviations used in this paper DIG digoxigenin PBSphosphate-buffered saline SSC saline sodium citrate buffer material. Endothelial cells <b>displaying</b> <b>labels</b> for P 2 Y 2 receptor transcripts were of cortical arteries/arterioles and capillaries and of postcapillary venules in the corticomedullary junction. P 2 Y 2 mRNA transcripts were localised in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells, although they did not appear to be specifically associated with subcellular organelles or structures. In postcapillary venules, T cells <b>displaying</b> <b>labelling</b> for the P 2 Y 2 receptor were seen migrating across the P 2 Y 2 receptor mRNA-positive endothelium. Our findings are discussed in terms of the relationship between thymic immune cells and the endothelium. This includes the issue of immune cell trafficking into the circulation, and the ATP-related regulatory role and involvement of P 2 Y 2 receptors in the rat thymus...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of technologies in printed electronics, they are perfect for low performance applications, such as <b>displays,</b> <b>labels,</b> clothing, and batteries. Flexible, electrical circuits can be printed using functional inks and printing methods, such as screen printing, gravure and inkjet. Uniform ink surface, smoothness, fine lines, and registration are keys in determining the capability of printed electronics. Screen mesh count, printing methods and emulsion thickness are all variables {{that are involved in}} screen printing and need to be quantified in order to determine optimal operational conditions. Inkjet printing is used to conductive traces based on its tiny drop. This study attempted to control human errors during operation that might influence electrical conductivity with inkjet and screen printing...|$|R
