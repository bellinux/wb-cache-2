2500|$|The {{historical}} name Grand Sport {{returned to}} the Corvette lineup in 2010 as an entirely new model series that replaced the Z51 option. The new model was basically an LS3 equipped Z06 with a steel frame instead of aluminum. It retained many {{of the features of}} the Z06 including a wide body with 18x9.5 and 19x12 inch wheels, dry sump oiling (manual transmission coupes only), 6-piston 14" [...] front brakes and 4-piston rear, and improved suspension. Manual power train equipped G/S coupe models receive a tweaked LS3 with a forged crank, are built in Z06 fashion by hand, and utilize a <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system.</b> The first three gears were also made shorter for better throttle response and faster acceleration. A new launch control system was introduced for all models that allows for sub-4-second 0–60. EPA is estimated 26 MPG highway, 1.0 G on skid pad.|$|E

5000|$|The 426 Hemi, in [...] "street Hemi" [...] form, was {{produced}} for consumer automobiles from 1965 through 1971. There were many {{differences between the}} Hemi and the Wedge-head big-block, including cross-bolted main bearing caps and a different head bolt pattern. There were also many differences between the racing Hemi's and the street Hemi, including {{but not limited to}} compression ratio, camshaft, intake manifold, exhaust manifold. Some 1960s NASCAR and NHRA Hemi engines featured magnesium cross-ram intake manifolds and magnesium oil pans in an attempt to reduce the massive weight of the overall engine, along with chain-driven internal <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oil</b> <b>systems.</b> Today, aftermarket blocks, heads, intakes, rods and pistons are usually made of aluminum.|$|R
50|$|The 348 was {{equipped}} with a <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> to prevent oil starvation at high speeds and during hard cornering. The oil level can only be accurately checked on the dipstick when the motor is running due to this setup. The 348 was fitted with adjustable ride-height suspension and a removable rear sub-frame {{to speed up the}} removal of the engine for maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The high-revving {{character}} and <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> both {{meant that the}} 1300's engine should be a natural for racing, and soon the RSC (Racing Service Club, Honda's competition department) built the mid-engined, tubular framed Honda R·1300. Next, in the 1969 Japan GP the similar Can-Am style Carman-Apache made its racing debut, with a Honda 1300 engine tuned to 135 PS (at 7,000 rpm) mounted transversally in the middle. Weight was a mere 490 kg. The car only made 29 laps (out of 120) before retiring, but continued to race with some modest success through the next year.|$|E
50|$|The Silver Hawk’s 592 cc {{design was}} a {{development}} of the Silver Arrow and shared a similar frame design and cycle parts, {{as well as the}} monoblock 26 degree V with a one-piece OHC head concept. The single bevel-gear overhead camshaft ran across the cylinder head and four bores with special air cooling housed two pairs of cylinders at 26 degrees to each other. A single carburettor fed all four induction valves through a cross shaped induction that produced an uneven feed. Coil and dynamo ignition was driven by skew gearing from the camshaft-drive vertical shaft. A <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> was supplied from a steel tank {{at the base of the}} front-down tube, bolted to the engine's crankcase. The engine was flexible, however, and could be started by hand and run in top gear most of the time. This was an important factor for the hand operated gear change.|$|E
2500|$|By 1937, all Harley-Davidson's {{flathead}} engines were {{equipped with}} <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oil</b> recirculation <b>systems</b> {{similar to the}} one introduced in the [...] "Knucklehead" [...] OHV engine. The revised 74-cubic-inch (1,210cm³) V and VL models were renamed U and UL, the 80-cubic-inch (1,300cc³) VH and VLH to be renamed UH and ULH, and the 45-cubic-inch (740cc³) R to be renamed W.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} {{displacement}} increase from 3.4 to 3.5 L, {{the major difference}} between the V8 engine in the 348 and F355 is {{the introduction of a}} 5-valve cylinder head. This new head design allowed for better intake permeability and resulted in an engine that was considerably more powerful, producing [...] [...] The longitudinal 90° V8 engine was bored 2mm over the 348's engine (85 mm rather than 83 mm), resulting in the small increase in displacement. Engine internals are produced using lightweight materials; the connecting rods are forged in Ti6-Al-4V titanium alloy. The engine's compression ratio is 11:1 and employs the Bosch Motronic M2.7 engine control unit in the 1995 model year, later changed to the M5.2 in 1996 through end of production. The Motronic system controls the electronic fuel injection and ignition systems, with a single spark plug per cylinder. Engine lubrication is via a <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oiling</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|The LT4 engine {{builds on}} the design {{strengths}} of the previous LS9 supercharged engine used in the sixth-generation Corvette ZR1 and leverages the technologies introduced on the seventh-generation Corvette Stingray, including direct injection, cylinder deactivation and continuously variable valve timing, to take Corvette performance to an all-new level. The LT4 engine {{is based on the}} same Gen 5 small block foundation as the Corvette Stingray’s LT1 6.2L naturally aspirated engine, incorporating several unique features designed to support its higher output and the greater cylinder pressures created by forced induction, including: Rotocast A356T6 aluminum cylinder heads that are stronger and handle heat better than conventional aluminum heads, lightweight titanium intake valves, forged powder metal steel connecting rods which are highly machined to an optimized geometry for increased strength while eliminating unnecessary reciprocating mass, 10.0:1 compression ratio, high for a forced-induction engine, enhances performance and efficiency and is enabled by direct injection, forged aluminum pistons with unique, stronger structure to ensure strength under high cylinder pressures, stainless steel exhaust manifolds for structure at higher temperatures, aluminum balancer for reduced mass, and standard <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oiling</b> <b>system</b> with a dual-pressure-control oil pump. The engine uses a 1.7L Eaton TVS supercharger. Although smaller than the previous 2.3l supercharger used on the sixth-gen ZR1, it spins 5000 RPM faster thus generating boost quicker while making only slightly less total boost than the LS9 engine.|$|R

5000|$|The Hinckley factory {{began making}} modern triples {{such as the}} Trident and Daytona 675, and {{although}} the inspiration was perhaps the Meriden Trident, no attempt {{has been made to}} link the new bike with the old. By contrast, when the Hinkley factory started to produce its parallel twins, it was deemed vital to make the new [...] "retro" [...] bikes appear similar to the Meriden predecessors. For instance, the [...] "timing chest" [...] is still on the right, and the [...] "primary chaincase" [...] is on the left (needing the rear chain drive to move to the right), twin [...] "rocker boxes", a R/H side panel resembling a <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oil</b> tank, and although the engines are fuel-injected, the injectors are made to resemble carburettors.|$|R

2500|$|From their {{inception}} in the 1950s {{until the early}} 1970s, Pontiac engines were known for their performance. The largest engine was a massive 455 cubic inch V8 that was available in most of their mid-size, full-size and sports car models. At {{the height of the}} horsepower era, Pontiac engines reached a powerful 390 rated horsepower (SAE gross), though other engines achieved considerably higher outputs in actuality. Federal emissions laws eventually brought the horsepower era to a close and resulted in a steady decline for Pontiac's engines. One holdout to this industry-wide slide was the Super Duty 455 engine of 1973–1974. Available only in the Firebird Formula and Trans Am models, this was rated at [...] net initially but after having issues passing EPA emissions tests, the camshaft was changed to the old RA III cam and with the change, came a [...] net rating. The engine was the pinnacle of Pontiac engine development and was a very strong performer that included a few race-specific features, such as provisions for <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oiling.</b> This engine and its legacy drive the SD Trans Ams and Formulas as one of the more, if not the most, desirable Pontiacs ever produced.|$|R
5000|$|The Yamaha TRX850 270-degree {{parallel}} twin motorcycle has a <b>dry-sump</b> engine. Its <b>oil</b> reservoir is not remote, but {{integral to the}} engine, sitting atop the gearbox. This design eliminates external oil lines, allowing simpler engine removal and providing faster oil warm up.|$|R
50|$|The M2B33 {{engine in}} the R32 had a {{displacement}} of 494 cc {{and had a}} cast-iron sidevalve cylinder/head unit. The engine produced , which propelled the R32 to {{a top speed of}} 95 km/h. The engine and gear box formed a single unit. The new engine featured a recirculating wet sump <b>oiling</b> <b>system</b> {{at a time when most}} motorcycle manufacturers used a total-loss <b>oiling</b> <b>system.</b> BMW used this type of recirculating <b>oiling</b> <b>system</b> until 1969.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main purpose}} of the dry-sump system is to contain all the stored oil in a {{separate}} tank, or reservoir. This reservoir is usually tall and round or narrow and specially designed with internal baffles, and an oil outlet (supply) {{at the very bottom}} for uninhibited <b>oil</b> supply. The <b>dry-sump</b> <b>oil</b> pump is a minimum of 2 stages, with as many as 5 or 6. One stage is for pressure and is supplied the oil {{from the bottom of the}} reservoir, and along with an adjustable pressure regulator, supplies the oil under pressure through the filter and into the engine. The remaining stages [...] "scavenge" [...] the oil out of the dry-sump pan and return the oil (and gasses) to the top of the tank or reservoir. If an oil cooler is used usually it is mounted inline between the scavenge outlets and the tank. The dry-sump pump is usually driven by a Gilmer or HTD timing belt and pulleys, off the front of the crankshaft, at approximately one half crank speed. The dry-sump pump is designed with multiple stages to ensure that all the oil is scavenged from the pan and also to allow removal of excess air from the crankcase.|$|R

30|$|The oil/water {{interfacial}} {{properties of}} crude oil emulsions formed by alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flooding in the Daqing Oilfield were investigated in this paper by the measurement of interfacial tension, interfacial shear viscosity and Zeta potential of the oil/water system. The result showed that both NaOH and Na 2 CO 3 could react with acid substances in the crude oil to produce interfacially active components, which are adsorbed on the interfaces between the aqueous phase and oil phase, resulting in a decrease of the interfacial tension, negatively charging the surface of oil droplets, but making little change in the interfacial shear viscosity. For the same ionic strength of NaOH and Na 2 CO 3, the interfacial tension of NaOH solution-crude <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> is lower, but the interfacial shear viscosity of NaOH solution-crude <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> is higher, than that of Na 2 CO 3 solution-crude <b>oil</b> <b>system.</b> The negative value of the Zeta potential {{on the surface of}} the oil droplets is large. Accordingly, the O/W emulsion of NaOH solution-crude <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> is more stable than that of Na 2 CO 3 solution-crude <b>oil</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
