40|$|In {{the buried}} natural gas pipelines, many defects can occur by {{construction}} faults, corrosion, third-party interference and ground movement. Nowadays, selection of proper repair method on in-service natural gas pipeline {{is a matter}} of primary concern of Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS). Therefore, the systematic study has been required for the repair methods of API 5 L X 65 main pipeline operating under the internal pressure of 6. 9 MPa whose diameter is 762 mm and thickness is 17. 5 mm. The objective of this work is to investigate the fracture behavior of repaired pipe using full scale burst test and to select the appropriate repair method of in-service gas pipelines. We performed a series of full scale burst test for <b>damaged</b> <b>pipe</b> and each repaired pipe and analyzed the fracture behavior on API 5 L X 65 grade gas pipelines (diameter 762 mm, thickness 17. 5 mm) with mechanically machined defects. Tested specimens are <b>damaged</b> <b>pipe</b> and repaired pipes with sleeve welding, epoxy sleeve, composite material rapping (clock-spring) and direct deposit welding method for <b>damaged</b> <b>pipe</b> with same shape.

This was to be attempted by the next crew, the current one lacking the necessary training and tools.

The tool was delivered by Soyuz T-12, and the leak was subsequently fixed.|$|E
5000|$|For decades, when {{sanitary}} sewer pipes cracked or experienced other damage, {{the only option}} was an expensive excavation, removal and replacement of the damaged pipe, typically requiring street repavement afterwards. In the mid-1950s a unit was invented where two units at each end with a special cement mixture in between was pulled from one manhole cover to the next, coating the pipe with the cement under high pressure, which then cured rapidly, sealing all cracks and breaks in the pipe. Today, a similar method using epoxy resin is used by some municipalities to re-line aging or <b>damaged</b> <b>pipes,</b> effectively creating a [...] "pipe in a pipe". These methods may be unsuitable for locations where the full diameter of the original pipe is required to carry expected flows, and may be an unwise investment if greater wastewater flows may be anticipated from population growth, increased water use, or new service connections within the expected service life of the repair.|$|E

50|$|The real {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was a gas leak from a <b>damaged</b> <b>pipe</b> located underneath the sidewalk. The gas got into an underground telephone connection and gathered {{in the basement of}} the Rotunda. Frozen water and snow clogged all the air vents, and in those circumstances, one spark or the turning on of a light in the basement, was enough to ignite the powerful explosion. The Rotunda itself did not have a gas connection. The low temperature caused the odorant to condense, and nobody was warned of a leak.|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{before the}} end of the Second World War on 2 May 1945, there was a {{detonation}} of explosives under the Landwehrkanal. As a result, the entire tunnel and (via a connecting tunnel at FriedrichstraÃŸe) part of the Berlin Underground network was flooded. [...] There are few other examples in the history of Berlin that have produced so much conflicting information. It is debatable whether people were drowned during the flooding, because it is possible these drownings were confused with the 80 to 130 bodies of victims of the last days of the war, who died before the tunnel was flooded. Also debatable (and to this day also unclear) is who actually demolished the tunnel and who had ordered it. In order to cause such an explosion, a very good knowledge of the area and buildings would be required. One theory states that the explosion was undertaken by members of the SS. There are few eyewitnesses who can actually verify this. Rather they report that in the last days of the war the tunnel was already partially flooded with fresh and sewage water that was leaking from <b>damaged</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Much {{suspense}} {{was built}} around the devastation that Hurricane Ivan had caused {{as the leader of}} Government business Mr. Mckeeva Bush decided to close the Islands to any and all reporters, aid and denied permissions to land any aircraft except for Cayman Airways. The line of people wishing to leave but unable to do so because of his actions extended from the airport to the post office each day as thousands stranded with no shelter, food, or fresh water hoped for a chance to evacuate. As a result, most evacuations and the mass exodus which ensued in the aftermath was done so by private charter through personal & Corporate expense, with or without official permission. It was also a collective decision within the government at that time to turn away two British warships that had arrived the day after the storm with supplies. This decision was met by outrage from the Islanders who thought that it should have been their decision to make. Power and water was cut off due to <b>damaged</b> <b>pipes</b> and destroyed utility poles, with all utilities restored to various areas {{over the course of the}} next three months. Fortis Inc., a Canadian-owned utility company, sent a team down to Grand Cayman to assist the local power company, CUC, with restoration.

40|$|Cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) {{technology}} {{is commonly used}} for pipe rehabilitation, and transportation agencies are increasingly using it to repair <b>damaged</b> <b>pipe</b> culverts. In typical CIPP applications, a lining tube saturated with a styrene-based thermosetting resin is installed into the <b>damaged</b> <b>pipe.</b> Subsequent curing with a heat source results in a pipe-within-a-pipe. In this study, seven styrene-based, steam-cured CIPP installations in surface water and stormwater conveyances in Virginia were identified and observed {{over the course of}} 1 year. Although the sites were not directly linked to sources of drinking water, styrene levels at five sites were higher than the U. S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s maximum contaminant level for drinking water of 0. 1 mg/L. These concentrations were detected at these sites for a minimum of 5 days to at least 71 days after installation. Certain measurements were also found to exceed the LC 50 values (i. e., the concentration required to kill 50 percent of a study population) for several freshwater aquatic indicator species. The findings suggest that the elevated styrene levels could have resulted from one or a combination of the following: (1) installation practices that did not capture condensate containing styrene, (2) uncured resin that escaped from the liner during installation, (3) insufficient curing of the resin, and (4) some degree of permeability in the lining material. A summary of the actions taken by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) in response to the preliminary findings of this study is also provided in this report. VDOT suspended the use of styrene-CIPP for pipes that convey surface or stormwater while further evaluating CIPP repair and subsequently developing new requirements for these installations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The 1980 â€™s and 1990 â€™s saw an {{explosion}} of new pipe installation and repair techniques which minimize the need to dig continuous trenches to bury the pipeline, so called â€˜trenchless technologiesâ€™. However, use of these construction methods has largely relied on experience and empirical â€˜rules of thumbâ€™. These application areas have received little attention from Geomechanics analysts, {{though there is a}} wealth of interesting engineering problems deserving investigation. This article illustrates the work of the author and his research students and collaborators to investigate the stability of pipe liners placed within <b>damaged</b> <b>pipes</b> and culverts, pulling forces needed to undertake pipe replacement using static pipe bursting and the ground deformations that result, the ability of soil surrounding directional drilling operations to contain the pressurized drilling mud and prevent hydrofracture during construction, and the axial stresses along a buried pipeline during and after construction using these pulled-in-place installation procedures. ...|$|E
