40|$|In {{order to}} ensure a {{hygienic}} safe status of material surfaces, e. g. in public restrooms, chemical disinfectants are used. The broad and regular use of these biocidal substances may pose adverse effects on human health, because compounds may get {{in contact with the}} human body. In addition, some disinfecting substances may be flammable or may have corrosive effects on certain materials. An effective, safe and fast approach as an alternative to chemical methods is surface disinfection by UVC-irradiation. In the present study an UVC-irradiation source was tested in laboratory experiments, including field sampling, for its capability to improve the hygienic status of different surfaces. Our results provide a recommendation for a general function for the efficacy in reducing the bacterial contamination. A responsible application of UVC-irradiation may significantly reduce bacterial counts on surfaces within a relatively short time and this effective way of <b>decontaminating</b> <b>surfaces</b> could supplement hygienic measures...|$|E

In pursuit of this mission, numerous remediation projects are under way and many others are being planned at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). In this report, tests using two proposed methods for <b>decontaminating</b> <b>surfaces</b> one using water ice crystals [Crystalline Ice Blast (CIB) ], the other using dry ice crystals (CO{sub 2 } Cleanblast{trademark}) [...] are described. Both methods are adaptations of the commonly used sand blasting technology. The two methods tested differ from sand blasting in that the particles are not particularly abrasive and do not accumulate as particles in the wastes. They differ {{from each other in}} that the CO{sub 2 } particles sublime during and after impact and the ice particles melt. Thus, the two demonstrations provide important information about two strong candidate decontamination methodologies. Each process was tested at ORNL using contaminated lead bricks and contaminated tools and equipment. Demonstrations with the prototype Crystalline Ice Blast and the CO{sub 2 } Cleanblast systems showed that paint, grease, and oil can be removed from metal, plastic, asphalt, and concrete surfaces. Furthermore, removal of contamination from lead bricks was highly effective. Both processes were found to be less effective, under the conditions tested, with contaminated tools and equipment that had chemically bonded contamination or contamination located in crevices since neither technology abrades the substrates or penetrates deeply into crevices to remove particulates.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM) faces {{a number}} of {{sizeable}} challenges as it begins to transform its mission from managing risk to reducing and eliminating risk throughout the DOE Complex. One {{of the greatest challenges}} being addressed by DOE-EM as this transformation takes place is accelerating the deactivation and decommissioning of thousands of facilities within the DOE Complex that were once used to support nuclear-related programs and projects. These facilities are now unused and aging. Finding solutions to complete the cleanup of these aging facilities more safely, efficiently, and effectively while reducing costs is critical to successfully meeting DOE-EM's cleanup challenge. The Large-Scale Demonstration and Deployment Project (LSDDP) of Hot Cells at the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) is a near-term project funded through the DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE-NETL) for the specific purpose of identifying, evaluating, demonstrating, and deploying commercially available technologies that are capable of streamlining the cleanup of hot cells in unused facilities while improving worker safety. Two DOE project sites are participating in this LSDDP: the WVDP site in West Valley, New York and the Hanford River Corridor Project (RCP) site in Richland, Washington. The WVDP site serves as the host site for the project. Technologies considered for demonstration and potential deployment at both LSDDP sites are targeted for application in hot cells that require the use of remote and semi-remote techniques to conduct various cleanup-related activities because of high radiation or high contamination levels. These hot cells, the type of cleanup activities being conducted, and technologies selected for demonstration are the main topics discussed in this paper. The range of cleanup-related activities addressed include in-situ characterization, size-reduction, contamination control, decontamination, in-c ell viewing, and various types of handling, retrieval, and dismantlement tasks. The primary focus of the LSDDP of Hot Cells is on demonstrating technologies capable of reducing cost and schedule baselines for work scopes involving in-situ characterization (including nondestructive examination to access in-cell areas), size-reducing equipment and piping, contamination control, and <b>decontaminating</b> <b>surfaces</b> (including equipment surfaces). Demonstrations of technologies that can streamline these tasks are scheduled for the WVDP site. Demonstrations scheduled for the Hanford RCP site focus on work scope activities involving remote-inspection and viewing. Each demonstration conducted will be assessed using evaluation criteria established by the participating sites to determine if selected technologies represent a significant improvement over current baseline technologies being used to perform work. If proven to be effective, each of the commercially available technologies demonstrated has th e potential to be quickly deployed at other sites, resulting in improved worker safety, reduced cleanup costs, and accelerated schedule completion for many of the most challenging cleanup efforts now underway throughout the DOE Complex...|$|E
40|$|Background. Non-porous {{environmental}} surfaces accidentally/deliberately {{contaminated with}} bioagents might {{play a role}} in the spread of infections. The risk of such spread can be reduced with judicious use of liquid chemical disinfectants. Such chemicals are usually applied directly on the target surface as a liquid by immersion, flooding, spray, or by wiping with a disinfectant-wetted fabric. However, the assessments and label claims of microbicidal activities of such chemicals are often based on testing against individual classes of microbes without an appropriate soil load, while pathogens in the field are either unknown or may exist as mixtures in body fluids or other organic/inorganic debris. Further more, the influence of the mechanical action of wiping in <b>decontaminating</b> <b>surfaces</b> is hardly ever assessed. Wiping microbially-contaminated surfaces with an ineffective disinfectant may also spread localized contamination over a wider area, thus enhancing the risk of spread of infections. The potential impact of such spread remains virtually unknown. This study was, therefore, aimed at filling these three gaps in our knowledge. Experimental. To simulate field conditions better, the challenge was a cocktail of bacterial spores (Geobacillus stearothermophilus), a vegetative bacterium (Acinetobacter baumannii), a mycobacterium (Mycobacterium terrae), and a non-enveloped virus (hepatitis A) in a soil load. Disks (1 cm in diameter) of brushed stainless steel were used as prototypical hard, non-porous environmental surface. Each disk received 10 muL of the microbial suspension. The inoculum was then dried prior to direct contact with the test disinfectant or assessing the effect of wiping for decontamination and transfer of contamination. In both decontamination methods, normal buffered saline (NBS) was used as the control fluid. Results. The microbial mixture successfully evaluated the efficacy claims and spectrum of activity of disinfectants concurrently, with no major differences in inactivation of microbes when challenged alone or as a mixture. Surprisingly, peracetic acid (PAA; 1, 000 ppm) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) -based formulations (40, 000 to 70, 000 ppm) reduced the viability of the spores to undetectable levels, but without complete inactivation of the virus at the same contact time and temperature. Chlorine dioxide (CD) and a 5. 25 % (w/v) solution of sodium hypochlorite, i. e., domestic bleach (DB), showed the broadest spectrum of microbicidal activity. However, their activities depended on air temperature. While CD (500 and 1, 000 ppm) and DB (5, 000 ppm) completely inactivated HAV and the spores at room temperature (∼ 22 - 24 °C), these formulations only killed the virus at 4 °C but not the spores. M. terrae and A. baumannii were relatively readily inactivated and proved to be very similar in their sensitivities to all the tested chemicals. In general, wiping with a disinfectant-wetted fabric was more effective than direct kill for decontamination. Our data suggested that applying a formulation directly on to a contaminated surface, letting it dry, and then wiping the surface with a disinfectant helped achieve greater log 10 reductions while reducing substantially the risk of transfer of contaminants to clean areas. Conclusions. This study assessed the relative strengths and the spectrum of activity of the tested formulations concurrently and under conditions more akin to those expected under field conditions. Incorporation of a cocktail of microorganisms into a single test permitted a more reliable means of classifying microbicides based on their spectrum of activity. Chlorine releasing agents proved to be more effective and have a broader spectrum of activity as compared to the peroxygens. Disinfectant activity depended on air temperature, and none of them was effective against the spores at 4 °C. Decontamination by wiping with disinfectants proved to be faster and more effective than direct kill. However, a higher risk of a wider spread of contamination during wiping was also evident in this study. The foundations laid by this investigation should allow more detailed studies using actual infectious bioagents. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

In an attempt to manage beef carcass contamination, spray wash treatments utilizing three concentrations (1, 1. 5 and 2 %) of acetic, lactic, propionic and formic acids were performed to evaluate their efficacy in reducing numbers of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Staphylococcus aureus on meat tissues. The procured beef pieces of freshly slaughtered animals were decontaminated with hot water and then inoculated with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. aureus individually which then were spray washed with organic acids separately. The total plate count of the treated samples showed that the popula-tions of bacteria decreased after being exposed to organic acids. Spray wash of formic acid resulted in the highest reduction of both bacterial species on meat surface. Significantly, higher log reductions were obtained for S. aureus than E. coli O 157 :H 7.

40|$|International audienceWe {{probe the}} {{drainage}} and imbibition dynamics of foams {{in which the}} continuous aqueous phase is a transient gel-like network. To produce these foams, we provide a new method – a PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) solution is first foamed and then a cross-linker, Borax, is added, which binds reversibly to the PVA chains. The resulting foams are ultra-stable-over a month. We find that the typical time for gravitational drainage of the continuous phase can be slowed down from hours to several weeks by tuning the Borax concentration. We show that the Borax concentration controls both the bulk viscosity of the continuous phase and the surface viscosity of the air–water interfaces. From these results we suggest that the PVA molecules adsorbed at the bubble interfaces are highly cross-linked by the Borax molecules. We find that the capillary rise of a dyed liquid into these foams is orders of magnitude faster than the drainage flow, meaning that these foams can quickly absorb liquids.

40|$|A reverse {{transcriptase}} {{polymerase chain reaction}} assay was used to study the transfer of Norovirus (NV) from contaminated faecal material via fingers and cloths to other hand-contact surfaces. The results showed that, where fingers {{come into contact with}} virus-contaminated material, NV is consistently transferred via the fingers to melamine surfaces and from there to other typical hand-contact surfaces, such as taps, door handles and telephone receivers. It was found that contaminated fingers could sequentially transfer virus to up to seven clean surfaces. The effectiveness of detergent- and disinfectant-based cleaning regimes typical of those that might be used to <b>decontaminate</b> faecally contaminated <b>surfaces</b> and reduce spread of NV was also compared. It was found that detergent-based cleaning with a cloth to produce a visibly clean surface consistently failed to eliminate NV contamination. Where there was faecal soiling, although a combined hypochlorite/detergent formulation at 5000 ppm of available chlorine produced a significant risk reduction, NV contamination could still be detected on up to 28 % of surfaces. In order consistently to achieve good hygiene, it was necessary to wipe the surface clean using a cloth soaked in detergent before applying the combined hypochlorite/detergent. When detergent cleaning alone or combined hypochlorite/detergent treatment failed to eliminate NV contamination from the surface and the cleaning cloth was then used to wipe another surface, the virus was transferred to that surface and to the hands of the person handling the cloth. In contrast, were surfaces where contaminated with NV-infected faecal suspension diluted to 1 in 10 and 1 in 80, intended to simulate surfaces that have become contaminated after secondary transfer, treatment with a combined bleach/detergent formulation, without prior cleaning, was sufficient to <b>decontaminate</b> <b>surfaces</b> and prevent transfer...|$|R

30|$|Recent {{studies that}} {{zoom in on}} {{titanium}} surface physico-chemistry reveal interesting results [38, 39]. Kotsakis et al. [38] hypothesized that chemical residues alter the titanium surface physicochemistry and subsequently compromise cellular response to these <b>decontaminated</b> <b>surfaces.</b> However, they report on effective restoring of biocompatibility when sterile saline, citric acid, and EDTA/sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl-EDTA) were used, in contrast to chlorhexidine. Therefore, they propose the use of sterile saline, citric acid, and NaOCl-EDTA {{in the treatment of}} peri-implantitis not only for their antimicrobial properties but also for the preservation of the titanium material properties. In contrast, a study by [39] found noticeable morphological changes and corrosion on the titanium surface when the synergistic effect of acidic environments (i.e., citric acid, 15 % hydrogen peroxide, tetracycline, peroxyacetic acid) and mechanical forces (rubbing with cotton swabs) was investigated. Dissolution of the oxide layer (which can result in corrosion) was observed when using peroxyacetic and citric acid. It is therefore hypothesized that surface damage of dental alloys may potentially be induced after detoxification and maintenance treatments with acidic solutions and subsequently might hinder re-osseointegration. No visibly evident damage of the surfaces was shown by [39] when neutral or basic treatments such as sodium fluoride 0.12, 0.20, and 1.10 % were used, which might be explained by the neutral electrochemical environment [40].|$|R

Higher levels of LM attachment and survival was however noticed on the sub-surface structures. Chlorine had a greater effect on the LM on the surface structures compared to those in the sub-surface structures, possibly because chlorine was not able to access the sub-surface structures where the pathogens were located.

40|$|A heavy {{reliance}} on synthetic fungicides has been necessary to control postharvest decay of fruits. Recently, there is an ongoing concern about pesticide residues on fruits. Consumers increasingly prefer fruits without pesticides, and this is used by supermarkets as a selling strategy (residue free fruit). The use of ultraviolet-C (UV-C, 190 - 280 nm wavelengths) offers interesting possibilities for controlling storage decay. UV-C acts directly by damaging the microorganisms on the exposed surfaces, and indirectly by stimulating defense mechanisms in the treated product. In our study the effect of UV-C on spore germination (inactivation) and mycelial growth was examined. All conidia of the tested fungal species were completely or partially killed with UV-C. However, conidia with dark pigments, such as Alternaria alternata and Venturia inequalis, were shown to be more resistant as compared with weakly pigmented conidia, such as Penicillium expansum and Botrytis cinerea.

Results: The product was able to achieve a high degree of decontamination (around 90 %) immediately after application and that, after 72 hours, decontamination remained at about 55 %. The results are statistically significant. Conclusion: It may be concluded that the tested product could be profitably used to <b>decontaminate</b> <b>surfaces</b> in hospital wards...|$|R
2500|$|As {{with work}} on open bench tops, work {{performed}} within a BSC must be performed carefully and safely. To avoid contamination {{and the risk}} of personnel exposure, the CDC advises investigators to follow best practices to reduce and control splatter and aerosol generation, such as keeping clean materials at least [...] from aerosol-generating activities and arranging the work flow [...] "from clean to contaminated". In particular, open flames, not necessary within the clean environment of a Class II or III BSC, cause disruption of the airflow inside. Once work inside a BSC has been completed, it is necessary to <b>decontaminate</b> the <b>surfaces</b> of the BSC as with other lab equipment and materials.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{buildings}} {{throughout the}} DOE complex are being decommissioned. The decommissioning process typically includes dismantling equipment and utility systems for disposal, <b>decontaminating</b> remaining <b>surfaces</b> to meet regulatory limits, demolishing the building structure, and remediating the surrounding environment to address any historical releases. Typically, {{a large amount}} of information and radiation survey data needs to be processed and evaluated. Rapid assessment of project information is required to effectively manage unanticipated conditions that are frequently encountered as building components are dismantled. Parsons has developed a relational database called D&D TRAK to estimate, plan, manage, and track decommissioning projects. D&D TRAK has been successfully used at DOE and other federal facilities to terminate radioactive licenses thus allowing the unrestricted free-release of these buildings to public and private sectors...|$|R
40|$|Adult mice, made {{susceptible}} to Clostridium botulinum by feedings of metronidazole, were immobilized with an anesthetic and held for 30 min in isolators {{in which a}} fine powder of lyophilized pathogen spores was made airborne. Exposed mice were <b>surface</b> <b>decontaminated</b> before being kept for 2 days in holding isolators. Mice were intestinally colonized by the pathogen. Colonization rates were related to spore numbers (10 (4) to 10 (7) type A or B) seeded into isolators...|$|R
40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{popularity of}} dental implants {{in recent years}} has been associated with the reported incidence of short-term and long-term complications such as peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. Therapies proposed for treating peri-implantitis are based on the evidence available for the treatment of periodontitis, and are aimed at reducing the bacterial load within peri-implant pockets and <b>decontaminating</b> implant <b>surfaces,</b> and, in some cases, attempting afterward to bring about bone regeneration. The treatment of peri-implant infections comprises conservative (nonsurgical) and surgical approaches. This paper reviews various treatment strategies used for the treatment of peri-implant diseases. There are many approaches suggested by various authors for the treatment of peri-implant diseases, but there is no “ideal peri-implant therapy” that has been described in the literature. There is no consensus regarding the treatment protocol as the studies conducted so far have had varying study designs, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods...|$|R
