5|$|Portuguese traders reached Sri Lanka by 1505 {{where their}} initial forays were against the {{south-western}} coastal Kotte kingdom {{due to the}} lucrative monopoly on trade in spices that the Kotte kingdom <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> was also {{of interest to the}} Portuguese. The Jaffna kingdom {{came to the attention of}} Portuguese officials in Colombo for multiple reasons which included their interference in Roman Catholic missionary activities, (which was assumed to be patronizing Portuguese interests) and their support to anti-Portuguese factions of the Kotte kingdom, such as the chieftains from Sittawaka. The Jaffna Kingdom also functioned as a logistical base for the Kandyan kingdom, located in the central highlands without access to any seaports, as an entrypot for military aid arriving from South India. Further, due to its strategic location, it was feared that the Jaffna kingdom may become a beachhead for the Dutch landings. It was king Cankili I who resisted contacts with the Portuguese and even massacred 600-700 Parava Catholics in the island of Mannar. These Catholics were brought from India to Mannar to take over the lucrative pearl fisheries from the Jaffna kings.|$|E
25|$|In 1907–1909, {{a schoolteacher}} in Bursuceni, he {{associated}} the Romanian national club founded by judge Ion Pelivan. His activity there brought {{him under the}} watch of the Okhrana, and, during the subsequent clampdown, he received a punishment for having taught his students in Romanian. Nevertheless, he remained active in the nationalist circles and, by 1913, was in contact with Cuvânt Moldovenesc journal, which he also edited for a while, again as N. Romanaș. He also began a lifetime work of collecting Romanian folklore, and, despite such work being repressed by the Russian authorities, documented the folkloric links between Bessarabia and other Romanian-inhabited regions. The folk songs of his collections also pointed to the Bessarabians' dissatisfaction with Tsarist autocracy, against claims that they <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> regime more than they supported Romania.|$|E
500|$|Kristine Sutherland {{appears as}} Joyce Summers, Buffy's mother. Whedon <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> she got [...] "to play just {{completely}} sexy , {{because when you}} play the mom on a show you're sort of relegated to momhood, so {{it was nice to}} see that side of her." ...|$|E

500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{rated the}} episode with an [...] "A" [...] grade. He felt the episode was the [...] "highlight" [...] of the season. McNutt applauded that Michael was portrayed {{in a way}} that was neither [...] "too dumb or too ignorant" [...] and that he was able to have the final moment where he showed that he was a skilled salesman. Despite noting that the sting was not realistic, he further <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> Michael, Dwight, and Jim were allowed to react to the {{situation}} rather than becoming part of it. Jason Hughes of AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review and praised the use of Meredith, calling her [...] "hilarious and so spot-on". Furthermore, he, like McNutt, <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> Michael was portrayed as competent in the end. Hughes also enjoyed the B-story and wrote that [...] "it was a sweet moment when Darryl told Andy he didn't have to pay him any more to jam with them".|$|E
500|$|... "The Pointy End" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Among the most enthusiastic was Maureen Ryan from AOL TV, who called it [...] "the best episode yet," [...] and wrote {{that she was}} [...] "extremely impressed with how many moving parts were deployed smoothly and how the hour just flowed." [...] IGN's Matt Fowler remarked that this mostly Ned-less episode was very busy; he <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> Robb got to share the spotlight as viewers witnessed part of his [...] "maturation." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, {{who gave}} the film {{three and a half}} out of four stars in a Chicago Sun-Times review, <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> the story is [...] "always about more than boxing" [...] with its deeper themes [...] "about a girl growing up in a macho society and ... {{discovering}} she has a nature probably more macho than the men around her". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicle Edward Guthmann opined that Kusama [...] "ultimately undercuts her theme of female self-reliance by having Diana fall for Adrian" [...] and criticized the plot for [...] "tak too much time justifying a woman's right to be in the ring – instead of celebrating her achievement".|$|E

500|$|Cosimo III {{considered}} compelling Gian Gastone {{to become}} a cardinal. In order to rally Gian Gastone to its cause, Spain, concerned that another Medicean cardinal—Gian Gastone's uncle, Francesco Maria de' Medici, Duke of Rovere and Montefeltro, already <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> dignity—would tip the scales in favour of France at a Papal conclave, offered to create him [...] "General of the Spanish Seas". Peter II of Portugal, however, had other things in mind for him: he wanted Gian Gastone to marry his only daughter, Isabel Luísa, Princess of Beira. To marry her, Gian Gastone would have to convince his father to allot him an allowance of [...] "adequate stature". However, the Grand Duke refused and neither the cardinalate nor the Portuguese marriage ever materialised.|$|E
500|$|Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste {{magazine}} {{awarded the}} episode an 8.2 rating out of 10, noting that [...] "The Office {{is at its}} best when it has one foot planted in reality and the other drifting off into the absurd." [...] She also <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> the show illustrated Michael's actual talents as a salesman. Furthermore, Stiernberg felt that Andy's subplot helped balance the [...] "silliness" [...] of Michael's main plot. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four-and-a-half stars out of five and praised Olyphant's acting, writing that he [...] "just killed it" [...] during his appearance. He also called the entry [...] "a big step up from last week", largely due to its entertaining main plot and its [...] "pleasant" [...] B-story.|$|E
500|$|Many years later, authors Timothy Burke and Kevin Burke {{wrote in}} Saturday Morning Fever: Growing Up with Cartoon Culture called the show a [...] "special treat" [...] and {{appreciated}} it {{for being able}} to parody [...] "pop culture stables" [...] cleverly. They <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> Waldo was selected as the main character because there was [...] "no more perfect a character for kids to empathize with than a shy dreamer who lives out a thousand adventures in his or her head". They also speculated that Wishbone (1995–1997) contained the same premise as The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty, but with a dog as the main character instead of a cat. Producer Scheimer was hugely disappointed by the entire series, calling it [...] "a mistake on many levels".|$|E

500|$|... "I thought I {{was making}} noise all these years," [...] Sims {{said of the}} award. [...] "Now they're calling it culture." [...] He used the funds to teach dance to {{children}} in Harlem, using a parking lot {{in lieu of a}} formal dance studio, drawing on his own youth learning dance on the street. Sims would later explain, [...] "most people wait [...] until after they've grown up—and then it's too late." [...] That same year, clogger Ira Bernstein received an NEA Folk Arts Apprenticeship grant [...] "o study traditional lack tap dance with master dancer Howard 'Sandman' Sims." [...] Sims loved to teach; his son recounted how Sandman would [...] "stop every kid he saw and show them a step and get them to copy a step. He <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> more than performing in front of an audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of iOS 10 {{were mostly}} positive. Reviewers {{highlighted}} the significant updates to iMessage, Siri, Photos, 3D Touch, and the lock screen as welcome changes. The third-party extension support to iMessage meant it was [...] "becoming a platform", although the user interface {{was criticized for}} being difficult to understand. Third-party integration in Siri was [...] "great", although the voice assistant was criticized for not having become smarter than before. Reviewers were impressed with the image recognition technology in Photos, although noting {{it was still a}} [...] "work in progress" [...] with a higher error rate than the competition. 3D Touch [...] "finally feels useful" [...] and [...] "works in almost every part of the OS". The lock screen was [...] "far more customizable than before", and reviewers <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> notification bubbles could be expanded to see more information without needing to unlock the phone.|$|E
500|$|Gameplay was {{generally}} praised as detailed, with many side quests to occupy players' time. IGN said players would be [...] "amazed at the detail" [...] {{of the environment}} and the [...] "amount of thought that went into designing it". IGN praised the cinematics, citing great emotional impact and [...] "flawless camera work". EGM <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> Nintendo was able to take the elements of the older, 2D Zelda games and [...] "translate it all into 3D flawlessly". Nintendo Power cited Ocarina of Time, along with Super Mario 64, as two games that [...] "blazed trails" [...] into the 3D era. The context-sensitive control system was seen as one of the strongest elements of the gameplay. Reviewers noted that it allowed for simpler control using fewer buttons, but that it occasionally caused the player to perform unintended actions. The camera control was quoted as making combat [...] "second nature", although the new system took time for the player to get used to.|$|E

500|$|Besides Wait Till Your Father Gets Home (1972–1974) and Hong Kong Phooey (1974), Nichola Dobson {{wrote in}} The A to Z of Animation and Cartoons that Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch! {{was one of}} Hanna-Barbera's more {{successful}} shows. However, in The Encyclopedia of Guilty Pleasures: 1001 Things You Hate to Love, three different authors labeled the series as one of Hanna-Barbera's [...] "lesser-known efforts" [...] but ultimately called it a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> it had its own score. In a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of [...] "15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s You Used to Love". Deirdre Sheppard from Common Sense Media rated it three out of five stars and noted that it has [...] "no educational content"; however, she also said that [...] "other than the mildest of mild violence, and the characters' tendency to poke fun at each other, the series is fun and inoffensive".|$|E
500|$|Jim Beaver made an {{appearance}} on [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] as Lawson, the gun vendor from the opening scene. Beaver previously starred in the HBO western drama series Deadwood along with Breaking Bad star Anna Gunn. He also previously appeared in [...] "Field Trip", a sixth season episode of The X-Files which was written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan. While Gilligan believed Beaver to be a talented actor, {{he had never met}} him during the filming of either show. The CW Network television series Supernatural, in which Beaver co-stars, was filming {{at the same time as}} [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub", so Beaver flew into Albuquerque for the Breaking Bad shoot and had only half a day to film the scenes. Mastras said he particularly <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> the character tries to convince Walter to buy a gun legally because, [...] "I like the aspect that you've got this black market dealer who in an ironic way is the sound of morality here." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reviews for}} the first five episodes of the series, Brian Lowry of Variety felt that [...] "Compared to Marvel's {{experience}} with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for ABC, operating in Netflix's pay-to-view world is clearly liberating" [...] in terms of what can be done and shown. Matt Patches of Esquire added, [...] "The show's exterior recasts the high fructose, splash page aesthethic of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America with neo-noir attitude. Goddard and DeKnight drench Daredevil in shadows and blood." [...] He compared Daredevil to [...] "a TV spinoff" [...] of Christopher Nolans Batman films, and praised Cox and D'Onofrio's portrayals, while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of Daredevil, in which story may be stretched out more than needs be, could be a problem for binge-watchers. Victoria McNally of MTV felt the early episodes' fight sequences were [...] "filmed beautifully" [...] and <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> they featured little CGI, while also calling Henson [...] "perfectly cast and endlessly amusing" [...] as Nelson.|$|E

500|$|Within {{a year of}} the game's release, the Japanese PTA unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to ban the game for allegedly inspiring truancy. In North America, doctors identified a condition called the [...] "Space Invaders elbow" [...] as a complaint, while a physician in The New England Journal of Medicine named a similar ailment the [...] "Space Invaders Wrist". Space Invaders {{was also the first}} game to attract political controversy, when a 1981 Private Member's Bill called the [...] "Control of Space Invaders (and other Electronic Games) Bill" [...] drafted by British Labour MP George Foulkes {{attempted to}} allow local councils to restrict the game, and those like it, by licensing for its [...] "addictive properties" [...] and for causing [...] "deviancy". Conservative MP Michael Brown defended the game as [...] "innocent and harmless pleasure" [...] which he himself had <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> day, and criticized the bill as an example of [...] "Socialist beliefs in restriction and control". A motion to bring the bill before Parliament was defeated by 114 votes to 94 votes; the bill itself was never considered by Parliament.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} budget problems created strong character development potential for Leslie and comedic opportunities for Ron. Fowler also <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> the normally-dissolute Tom formed an authentic romantic connection, and said Chris Pratt brought [...] "a certain naturalness" [...] to {{a role that}} could otherwise have been overly idiotic. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club strongly praised the episode, praising Rob Lowe and the entire regular cast. He declared Parks and Recreation the best television show since Arrested Development, and said, [...] "As much as I like the '50 jokes a minute' style of comedies ... I'm a sucker for a show where the characters are as well-wrought and as purely funny as they are on this show." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall praised {{the implementation of the}} new characters, particularly the fact that the script did not rely too heavily on them. Sepinwall also said the episode balanced well the workplace humor with the romantic subplots between Leslie and Ben, April and Andy, and Ann and Chris.|$|E
500|$|Coulson's {{return to}} the Barnsley first team came on 1 January 2008 after {{entering}} a 2–2 draw at home to Scunthorpe United as a half-time substitute. Following this appearance, Coulson said: [...] "I really <b>enjoyed</b> <b>that</b> chance {{and it has been}} a long time coming". His second Barnsley goal came with the winner in an FA Cup third round 2–1 victory over Blackpool on 5 January 2008, which was his first goal at Oakwell. He made an appearance as an 80th-minute substitute for match winner Kayode Odejayi in the 1–0 home victory over Premier League team Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final on 8 March 2008. He suffered a knee injury in training on 21 April 2008, rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament, which was expected to keep him sidelined for seven to nine months. Manager Simon Davey commented: [...] "It's a complete disaster for him. He'd been coming on really well. He was the first name I looked to put on the bench". Some consolation came after being named as Barnsley's Young Player of the Year for 2007–08. He finished the season with 16 appearances and one goal for Barnsley.|$|E
5000|$|Dylan {{has denied}} this autobiographical interpretation, stating in a 1985 {{interview}} with Bill Flanagan, [...] "A {{lot of people}} thought that album pertained to me.

[...] Informed of the album's popularity, Dylan told Mary Travers in a radio interview in April 1975: [...] "A lot of people tell me they <b>enjoy</b> <b>that</b> album.
