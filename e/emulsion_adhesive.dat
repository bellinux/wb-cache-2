40|$|On-demand binding {{requires}} {{books to}} be printed and finished in quick turnaround time. In order {{to serve the}} on-demand binding market, the binders have the options of hot melt adhesives or cold emulsion adhesives. Cold <b>emulsion</b> <b>adhesive</b> bookbinding has been available in the industry for a long time. In the past few years, this type of binding process was more favorable as compared to hot melt because of its durability, flexibility, and strength. But the process of cold emulsion binding faced a serious drawback of curing time where the bound bookblock requires {{a minimum of two}} hrs. of curing time before trimming when books are cured naturally. As of recent technological advancement, it is possible now to bind a book by cold <b>emulsion</b> <b>adhesive</b> and trim it in 15 minutes after forced cured. This process is offered by Planax North America, Inc. There has been no testing done where the study evaluates the two different curing processes for cold emulsion adhesives, namely natural curing and accelerated curing on a preheated plate. Consequently, this thesis research investigates both curing processes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate which curing process is better suited for cold emulsion adhesives. This was accomplished by comparing page-pull and page-flex values taken from thirty five books cured by each curing process (total of seventy books). Moffett page-pull and page-flex testing equipment were used for this test. It was found that natural curing resulted in higher page-pull values whereas forced curing resulted in higher page-flex. However, it was noticed that both types of curing process resulted in page-pull and page-flex values within the recommended industrial bookbinding guidelines. It can be inferred that on-demand books can be cured by forced curing which ultimately results into faster turnaround for production benefits yet books are within the industrial guidelines in regard to page-pull and page-flex strength values...|$|E

After 1, 3, 5, and 10  years of exposure, block-shear test were conducted and deterioration of GLT according to position was investigated. Residual ratio of shear-strength increased in order of south-side, north-side, and middle of south-side and north-side positions. Deterioration rates of shear-strength at south-side were larger than those at north-side. Decrease and deterioration rate of shear-strength were large at upper glue-layers, and this was conspicuous in VAE with low adhesion durability. Wood-failure ratio decreased at the first glue-layer of VAE after 5  year of exposure. However, in other adhesive resins, differences of wood-failure ratio among position or glue-layers were small regardless of exposure duration.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{adhesives}} that harden by drying: solvent-based adhesives and polymer dispersion adhesives, also known as <b>emulsion</b> <b>adhesives.</b> Solvent-based adhesives are a mixture of ingredients (typically polymers) dissolved in a solvent. White glue, contact adhesives and rubber cements are members of the drying adhesive family. As the solvent evaporates, the adhesive hardens. Depending on the chemical composition of the adhesive, they will adhere to different materials to greater or lesser degrees.|$|R

They were impregnated with wood-preservative (ACQ), and exposed under outdoor conditions with their glue-layers at level position for ten years. Block-shear {{tests were conducted}} after 1, 3, 5, and 10  years of exposure. After 10  years of exposure, significant differences were recognized for shear-strength among adhesive resins {{as the result of}} analysis of coefficient variance (AOCV). Results for pair-comparison of AOCV between adhesive resins, showed significant differences in four pair-comparisons and those included VAE. Standard deviations of shear-strength tend to increase with exposure year, and for VAE they were larger than for the others. Results of goodness-of-fit tests of shear-strength for normal, log-normal, 2 P-Weibull, and 3 P-Weibull distributions, showed that none of these forms fit VAE after 1  year of exposure. Wood-failure ratio decreased gradually with exposure duration; however, even after 10  years of exposure, it was more than 80 % regardless of adhesive resin.|$|E
30|$|Glued {{mortise and tenon}} joints {{are often}} used in joints for {{furniture}} such as chairs. However, such joints are not sufficiently resistant to withdrawal forces {{because of the difficulty}} of applying a clamping pressure to the surfaces being glued. Therefore, some reinforcement, {{such as the use of}} dowel-type fasteners, is necessary. In this study, we discussed the applicability of the shrink-fit method used in green woodworking to strengthen glued round mortise and tenon joints. The test specimens were assembled using wet mortise members and air-dried tenon members with polyvinyl acetate resin <b>emulsion</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Withdrawal tests on joint specimens of four hardwood species were conducted to study the reinforcing effects of the shrink fit on the withdrawal performance of the mortise and tenon joints. The proposed shrink-fitted glued round mortise and tenon joint exhibited sufficient withdrawal strength equivalent to that of the joint glued with epoxy resin adhesive. After applying four humidity cycles to simulate seasonal variations in moisture content, withdrawal strength did not decrease significantly. The proposed joint could withstand the withdrawal force to some extent after adhesion was fractured by shear force.|$|E

40|$|Many insects {{cling to}} {{vertical}} and inverted surfaces with pads that adhere by nanometre-thin films of liquid secretion. This fluid is an emulsion, consisting of watery droplets in an oily continuous phase. The detailed function of its two-phasic nature has remained unclear. Here {{we show that}} the pad emulsion provides a mechanism that prevents insects from slipping on smooth substrates. We discovered {{that it is possible}} to manipulate the adhesive secretion in vivo using smooth polyimide substrates that selectively absorb its watery component. While thick layers of polyimide spin-coated onto glass removed all visible hydrophilic droplets, thin coatings left the emulsion in its typical form. Force measurements of stick insect pads sliding on these substrates demonstrated that the reduction of the watery phase resulted in a significant decrease in friction forces. Artificial control pads made of polydimethylsiloxane showed no difference when tested on the same substrates, confirming that the effect is caused by the insects' fluid-based adhesive system. Our findings suggest that insect <b>adhesive</b> pads use <b>emulsions</b> with non-Newtonian properties, which may have been optimized by natural selection. <b>Emulsions</b> as <b>adhesive</b> secretions combine the benefits of 'wet' adhesion and resistance against shear forces. © 2009 The Royal Society...|$|R
40|$|The Master thesis, {{presented}} at the colloquium, describes the research that has been conducted at the Chemical Engineering department of the University of Groningen. Plywood adhesives based on formaldehyde induce health and safety problems due to the emission of hazardous components. The University of Groningen developed a thermosetting material based on polyketone, which might be used an alternative for adhesives containing formaldehyde. However, a large disadvantage of polyketone is its high material costs. To improve the ratio between cost and performance of polyketone based adhesives, further research has been initiated. One area in which improvement is sought, {{is that of the}} setting speed of the adhesive. The goal of this thesis is to enhance the fundamental understanding regarding the development of new fast thermosetting wood adhesive by systematically researching the influence of an increased ethylene content on the performance of linear alternating polyketones based <b>emulsions</b> as wood <b>adhesive.</b> A case study has been used to illustrate the implementation of such (faster setting) polyketone based adhesive within a hypothetical plywood factory. ...|$|R
30|$|We {{investigated}} the curing behavior of an <b>emulsion</b> polymer isocyanate <b>adhesive</b> for wood with different ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) emulsions, {{because it was}} found that the ethylene/vinyl acetate weight composition (E/VA ratio) of EVA could control the volume of gas emitted from the adhesive. EVA with higher VA content reduced the volume of gas emitted at the initial stage, which was caused by the extent of the reaction between the NCO groups and water. The reaction scheme of NCO could not be determined because the broad infrared (IR) absorptions due to CaCO 3 and water masked the information of the NCO products in IR spectra. Examination of the degree of swelling suggested that the adhesive films stored for 3 weeks had the same degree of cross-linking structure in spite of the variation of EVA. This result was supported by IR spectroscopy, which showed the same amounts of NCO remained in these films. All the adhesives prepared in this study had satisfactory bond performance. The findings indicate that the E/VA ratio affects the curing behavior of the adhesive in the initial curing stage, whereas the cross-linking structure and the bond performance were independent of the E/VA ratio after storage for 3 weeks.|$|R

Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were {{used to analyze the}} obtained proteins. The proteins were used at different contents as a reactive component in polyketone-based wood adhesive formulations. The stability, structure, pot-life and performance of the <b>emulsions</b> as wood <b>adhesive</b> were studied at room temperature by using rheology analysis, confocal fluorescence microscopy and shear strength tests. Emulsions containing proteins were prepared at 45 % solids content, a composition which results in phase separation when using only the reference polyketone-based adhesive. Several factors, such as the particle size (100, 250 pm) of the Jatropha proteins and the overall chemical composition of the emulsion, were systematically studied regarding their influence on the product performance. The present study shows that introducing Jatropha proteins into the basic recipe of a polyketone-based adhesive constitute a successful strategy for improving the performance as wood adhesives {{while at the same time}} significantly improving the economical attractiveness of these <b>adhesive</b> formulations. All <b>emulsions</b> presented in this work fulfill the requirements for the application of the final product as wood adhesives according to the European EN- 314 Standard. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: Based on {{previous}} chemical analyses of insect tarsal adhesives, we prepared 12 heterogeneous synthetic emulsions mimicking the polar/non-polar principle, analysed their microscopical structure and tested their adhesive, frictional, and rheological properties. Results: The prepared emulsions varied in their consistency from solid rubber-like, over soft elastic, to fluid (watery or oily). With droplet sizes > 100 nm, all the emulsions {{belonged to the}} common type of macroemulsions. The emulsions {{of the first generation}} generally showed broader droplet-size ranges compared with the second generation, especially when less defined components such as petrolatum or waxes were present in the lipophilic fraction of the first generation of emulsions. Some of the prepared emulsions showed a yield point and were Bingham fluids. Tribometric adhesion was tested via probe tack tests. Compared with the "second generation" (containing less viscous components), the "first generation" emulsions were much more adhesive (31 – 93 mN), a finding attributable to their highly viscous components, i. e., wax, petrolatum, gelatin and poly(vinyl alcohol). In the second generation emulsions, we attained much lower adhesivenesses, ranging between 1 – 18 mN. The adhesive performance was drastically reduced in the emulsions that contained albumin as the protein component or that lacked protein. Tribometric shear tests were performed at moderate normal loads. Our measured friction forces (4 – 93 mN in the first and 0. 1 – 5. 8 mN in the second generation emulsions) were comparatively low. Differences in shear performance were related to the chemical composition and emulsion structure. Conclusion: By varying their chemical composition, synthetic heterogeneous <b>adhesive</b> <b>emulsions</b> can be adjusted to have diverse consistencies and are able to mimic certain rheological and tribological properties of natural tarsal insect adhesives...|$|R

40|$|The {{forestry}} {{sector in}} New Zealand {{ranks as the}} third largest export earner. The individual industries within the forestry sector have, in some cases, grown up {{on the basis of}} institutionalised knowledge, sometimes without a full understanding of the underlying fundamental physico-chemical relationships and the changes that occur during wood material processing. At the same time the commercial pressures of operating within the forestry sector have resulted in demand for more uniform, high quality, fit-for-purpose product, faster throughput and less downgrade from what is becoming a lower quality feedstock as harvest ages decline. In the 21 st century, the forestry sector is being transformed into an "engineered ligno-cellulosic materials processor" and this in turn is requiring a more sophisticated knowledge of the material feedstock and the processes involved in wood products manufacture. The aim of this work was to use magnetic resonance techniques to explore aspects of ligno-cellulosic materials processing at points along the value-added process chain, namely drying, chemical modification (preservation) and re-engineering (gluing) of wood products. Magnetic resonance mini-imaging studies of the water transport during the drying of radiata pine boards rave shown differences in the directional movement of water within the wood structure. These effects show a dependence on the surface area to volume ratio of timber and the orientation of the annual rings with respect to the larger drying face. Narrow, flat-sawn boards exhibit anomalous drying behaviour in terms of water mass transport, whereas thicker boards display more conventional core-shell drying behaviour. These restrictions to flow have been further investigated using diffusion tensor imaging via a modified pulsed field gradient spin-echo sequence to elucidate the nature of anisotropic diffusion in wood. The direction of least restriction to self-diffusion is in the longitudinal direction, as would be expected with it being the direction of active transport within a tree stem, whereas the direction of greatest restriction to self-diffusion is in the radial direction, with the higher density latewood acting as a barrier. Preservation of radiata pine sapwood with novel boron-based preservatives has been investigated using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the penetration and retention of the incipient compounds. An apparent anomaly in retention for trimethylborate-treated Pinus radiata sapwood was investigated by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy of excised sections of latewood and earlywood, which showed hydrolytic decomposition of trimethyl borate to form boric acid. The rate of hydrolysis of trimethylborate was monitored by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy and was shown to occur very rapidly in the latewood (within 24 hours), and over a longer time scale of several days in the earlywood. The resulting publication has reported some of the first published 11 B MRI images. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has provided (in conjunction with separate mass spectrometry studies) mechanistic evidence for the accelerated curing of phenol-resorcinol formaldehyde resols, using ammonia in combination with the conventional paraformaldehyde hardener - a process known as GreenWeldTM. Carbon- 13 and nitrogen- 15 NMR spectroscopy has shown evidence of both benzylamine and aniline type bridging structures formed during cure, compared to only methylene structures being formed under conventional curing conditions. Poly(vinyl acetate) <b>emulsion</b> polymer <b>adhesive</b> has also been examined using NMR spectroscopic methods, with particular focus on the effect of addition of aluminium chloride, which is often commercially added to PVAc formulations as a crosslinking agent. Multinuclear magnetic resonance spectra obtained during the cure of AlCl 3 modified PV Ac adhesive, shows a low frequency 27 Al shift of ca. 3 ppm suggesting a local change in environment as the aluminium changes from a solvated to a covalently bonded octahedral environment. Finally, as a preliminary study, a new device for measuring uniaxial extension of visco-elastic solids was trialled on poly(vinyl acetate) hydrogels to study the effect of addition of aluminium chloride on the visco-elastic properties of the adhesive. A similar, manually operated device was used to obtain NMR spectroscopic data during compression of the gel. These studies have shown that addition of aluminium chloride as a crosslinking agent, in fact produces a cured adhesive with fewer crosslinks than the corresponding unmodified adhesive, but with increased resistance to shear-induced creep...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 The {{advent of}} {{synthetic}} adhesives {{has transformed the}} structural applications of wood. However, a persistent issue in adhesively-bonded wood products has been moisture durability. When designing wood based composites, moisture durability will depend on both the wood phase and the adhesive phase. A key question, therefore, is how does one rank adhesives {{for their ability to}} convey moisture durability in wood composites? Typical wood-based composite tests for moisture durability assessments do not consider the post-peak load regime of the material or are merely qualitative. This research explores the suitability of crack propagation fracture experiments to develop new methodologies for durability assessment of wood composites and adhesives. Fracture resistance curves (R curves) were measured for solid wood Douglas-fir and laminated veneer lumber (LVL) made with Douglas-fir veneer and a variety wood adhesives, namely, polyvinyl acetate, phenol formaldehyde, emulsion polymer isocyanate and phenol resorcinol formaldehyde. The LVL and solid wood R curves were similar for initiation of fracture, but the LVL toughness rose much higher than solid wood. Because a rising R curve is caused by fiber bridging effects, these differences show that the LVL adhesive has a large effect on the fiber bridging process. This resin effect was exploited to develop a test method for characterizing the ability of a resin to provide wood composites that are durable to moisture exposure. In characterizing toughness changes, it was important to focus on the magnitude and rate of the toughness increase attributed to fiber bridging. A new method was developed for ranking the role of adhesives in the durability of wood-based composites by observing changes in fracture toughness during crack propagation following cyclic exposure to moisture conditions. This new approach was compared to conventional mechanical performance test methods, such as observing strength and stiffness loss after exposure. Comparing changes in fracture toughness as a function of crack length after moisture cycling shows that fracture-mechanics based methods can distinguish different adhesive systems {{on the basis of their}} durability, while conventional test methods do not have similar capability. Using steady-state toughness alone, the most and least durable adhesives (phenol formaldehyde and polyvinyl acetate) could be distinguished, but the performance of two other <b>adhesives</b> (<b>emulsion</b> polymer isocyanate and phenol resorcinol formaldehyde) could not. Further analysis of experimental R curves based on kinetics of degradation was able to rank all adhesives confidently and therefore provided the preferred method. The likely cause for the inability of conventional tests to rank adhesives is that they are based on initiation of failure while the fracture tests show that comparisons that can rank adhesives require consideration of fracture properties after a significant amount of crack propagation has occurred. Additionally, a new method was proposed for determining fiber-bridging cohesive laws in fiber-reinforced composites and in natural fibrous materials. In brief, the method requires direct measurement of the R curve, followed by a new approach to extracting a cohesive law. This new approach was applied to finding fiber bridging tractions in LVL made with four different adhesives. Moreover, observations of changes in the bridging cohesive laws were used to rank the adhesives for their durability. Finally, both analytical and numerical models for fiber bridging materials were developed. The numerical modeling developed using material point method (MPM) simulated crack propagation that included crack tip propagation, fiber bridging zone development, and steady state crack growth. The simulated R curves agreed with experimental results...|$|R
