500|$|Asked in an {{interview}} if he ever worried about going broke, Keating responded, [...] "All the time, every day. I come into the office with this hollow feeling <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> lots of time.... You get trapped almost. You get too many responsibilities. It's a bellyfull to carry. It's risky. Dangerous. There's the possibility of failure with it every day and every night. But in a way, it's a challenge. It's invigorating. There isn't any point in not being a player – you're here.... It's not only the money. It's the disgrace, yourself, your manhood. I'm not sure I'd have a big problem with that. On the other hand I'm not sure I wouldn't." ...|$|E
500|$|After the game, Gary Anderson was {{described}} as [...] "inconsolable." [...] Although the Vikings still led by seven points at the time, his missed kick had a demoralizing effect on the team. ESPN contributor Ben Goessling noted [...] "how swiftly it pulled the bottom {{out from under a}} team that had an air of inevitability about it to that point." [...] Writing for the website Sporting News, Jeff Diamond, the Vikings' general manager in 1998, observed that, [...] "Our team played the rest of the game as if it was in shock that our automatic kicker had missed at the most critical time." [...] Randle concurred, describing his reaction to the kick as, [...] "I was standing there like someone just punched me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> and was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Atkinson {{has said}} that in the buildup to the final episode, he began to psychologically {{experience}} something of his character's apprehension. Speaking to Michael Parkinson in 2003, he recalled [...] "I remember...in {{the weeks leading up to}} the one day recording of that final episode when we went over the top, for the first time in my acting career...knowing that even though the rest of the episode was its usual standard funny sitcom self, there was this deep twist <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> throughout that week thinking along with your character that you were doomed. It was most peculiar. I'm sure serious character actors feel this all the time... Obviously if you're trying to feel the character and his dilemma then you're going to experience some of the fictional feelings for real. You felt swept along by it." ...|$|E

Bah! {{these are the things}} that shake one's faith in human nature. I feel infernally seedy. That cursed Channel passage--I tremble <b>in</b> <b>my</b> inmost <b>stomach</b> when I think of it. Get me something, Moody." ...|$|R
60|$|Looking {{back with}} the drinker's knowledge, I know now why I did not {{collapse}} stupefied upon the table. As I have said, I was frozen, I was paralysed, with fear. The only movement I made was to convey that never-ending procession of glasses to my lips. I was a poised and motionless receptacle for all that quantity of wine. It lay inert <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fear-inert <b>stomach.</b> I was too frightened, even, for <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> to turn. So all that Italian crew looked on and marvelled at the infant phenomenon that downed wine with the sang-froid of an automaton. It {{is not in the}} spirit of braggadocio that I dare to assert they {{had never seen anything like}} it.|$|R

500|$|According to Rodriguez, [...] " [...] had an {{idea and}} a {{complete}} vision for it right away when he first talked about it. He started {{to tell me the}} story and said, 'It's got this death-proof car in it.' I said, 'You have to call it Death Proof. I helped title the movie, but that's it." [...] Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, [...] "CGI for car stunts doesn't make any sense to me—how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2. And Final Destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot.

500|$|Unavailable {{for several}} months, Bjørnebye {{appeared}} just twice for Liverpool in the 1995–96 season. Recovery and injuries to other left back candidates enabled Bjørnebye to reclaim his place the following season, {{in which he}} scored his first goal for Liverpool on 17 August 1996 in a 3–3 draw against Middlesbrough. He contributed to the club's most convincing title challenge {{since the inception of}} the Premier League by supplying club strikers Stan Collymore and Robbie Fowler with precise crosses. He was ultimately included in the PFA Team of the Year with Steve McManaman and Mark Wright. The acquisition of Steve Staunton and arrival of Gérard Houllier in the 1998–99 season, limited Bjørnebye's first-team opportunities, leading to his effective marginalisation. Bjørnebye affirmed his recurring determination to stay at Liverpool that season, remarking [...] "If I didn't have any fight <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> I'd have left Liverpool at least three times before".|$|E
500|$|Critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 stars out of 4 {{and called it}} [...] "painfully and unremittingly intense" [...] and a [...] "superb example of filmmaking craft." [...] He also stated [...] "when I {{walked out of the}} theater, there were knots <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> from the film's roller-coaster ride of violence." [...] Walter Goodman of The New York Times said it was a [...] "flaming, flashing, crashing, {{crackling}} blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics." [...] Time magazine featured the film on the cover of its , 1986, issue, calling it the [...] "summer's scariest movie". Time reviewer Richard Schickel declared the film [...] "a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore." [...] The selection of Aliens for a Time cover was attributed to the successful reception of the film, as well as its novel example of a science fiction action heroine. Echoing Times assessment, Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader called the film [...] "one sequel that surpasses the original." [...] On the negative side, Gene Siskel described Aliens as [...] "one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses" [...] and that [...] "toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn't want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The men {{fell upon}} {{their faces and}} waited. The shells {{ploughed}} the ground around them, smothering them with dirt. A horrible, griping pain started <b>in</b> <b>my</b> young friend's <b>stomach,</b> and began creeping upwards. His head and heart both seemed to be shrinking and growing cold. A shot tore off {{the head of the}} man next to him, sending the blood spurting into his face; a minute later another ripped open the back of a poor fellow lying to the front of him.|$|R
5000|$|Copenhagen police {{spokesperson}} chief inspector Flemming Steen Munch gave the following comment:"It is about {{time to set}} an example ... It has almost become acceptable to be violent on the pitch, but violence should not be accepted on the pitch or in society. The TV images clearly show how the Swede is punched <b>in</b> the <b>stomach.</b> <b>My</b> immediate opinion is that according to the penal code the act will lead to a 30-day imprisonment".|$|R
60|$|I {{was never}} the same man after that double-jacketing. Never again, to this day, no matter what my food, was I {{properly}} nurtured. I suffered internal injuries to an extent I never cared to investigate. The old pain <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ribs and <b>stomach</b> is with me now as I write these lines. But the poor, maltreated machinery has served its purpose. It has enabled me to live thus far, and it will enable me to live the little longer to the day they take me out in the shirt without a collar and stretch my neck with the well-stretched rope.|$|R
2500|$|Initially, {{members of}} the {{audience}} reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramović described it later: [...] "What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brown is a Christian. He says, I'm not a spooky snake handler because I live in Georgia and I'm Christian, that I {{believe in}} the Bible, that I travel with the Bible, that I read the Bible every day. I'm still me.

But I've gotten to a point where I think, nah, I'm not going to feel bad about that. I'm not going to apologize about that.
