5000|$|There {{has been}} {{research}} that both substantiates and refutes {{the benefits of}} <b>information</b> <b>brokerage.</b> A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are [...] "dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values" [...] of such organizations. However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations {{and were more likely}} to be promoted. Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.|$|E

Databases can be queried through brokers with no schema-relevant or geographical difference being noticed. However, all existing <b>information</b> <b>brokerage</b> systems view or handle query brokering and access control as two orthogonal issues: query brokering is a system issue that concerns costs and performance, while access control is a security issue that concerns information confidentiality. As a result, access control deployment strategies (in terms of where and when to do access control) {{and the impact of}} such strategies on end-to-end system performance are neglected by existing <b>information</b> <b>brokerage</b> systems. In addition, data source side access control deployment is taken-for-granted as the “right ” thing to do.

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of <b>{{information}}</b> <b>brokerage,</b> where information consumers search for the data acquired by information producers. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no retrieval-guaranteed location-aware <b>information</b> <b>brokerage</b> scheme with a bounded data retrieval path length and bounded replication and retrieval message overhead costs available for use in 3 D wireless ad hoc networks to date. In this paper, we propose a novel location-aware <b>information</b> <b>brokerage</b> scheme, termed LAIB, where the network area is divided into cube grids, and data are replicated and retrieved in the hashed geographic location in each grid designated by the producer and the consumer, respectively. In LAIB, a polylogarithmic number of grids are designated by the producer and by the consumer, and at least one grid, whose distance from the grid of the consumer is smaller than the distance from the grid of the consumer to the grid of the producer, is designated by both the producer and the consumer. Simulations show that, as the network area is divided into a moderate number of grids, LAIB has good performance in term of retrieval latency stretch while ensuring moderate replication memory, replication message, and retrieval message overhead costs.

40|$|International audienceWhy can {{contracting}} with {{an intermediary}} {{be perceived as}} a " bad deal " compared with a direct contract between buyers and sellers? This study shows that <b>information</b> asymmetries in <b>brokerage</b> services lead to forming a judgmental heuristic that is a negative attitude toward commission fees, called " commission inequity. " Using a questionnaire from 3, 484 housing buyers and sellers, we show that this heuristic influences the perceived satisfaction of the transaction price which, in turn, influences broker reputation. Moreover, buyers using brokerage services do not report different purchasing prices than buyers via direct transactions (FSBO) but perceive a significantly lower price satisfaction. These results are replicated with sellers who report a higher selling price when using a broker as compared to sellers selling directly. However, they also indicate a significant lower price satisfaction compared with FSBO sellers. Therefore, the commission inequity heuristic is shown to lead to the illusion of a bad deal...|$|R

Abstract People try to help others in a wide number of ways. Taken together this is social action - the heart of civil society, and the foundation of a healthy one. However, some social action is hard to spot. It may be unregistered, be carried out with little or no income, or have little formal governance. This paper examines {{a new way of}} detecting and measuring social action – especially that which takes place below the radar. It uses a new methodology developed by CASM to use social media to spot, collect and measure social action that normally is carried out below the radar. It uses natural language processing algorithms to analyse, and sort large quantities of Tweets related to two key events: the flooding of 2014, and the launch of the Step up to Serve Campaign. This paper finds: 	Disasters, accidents and catastrophes are likely to create a explosions of Tweets too large to manually read. 	Some people will use Twitter to either offer or ask for help.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Information</b> <b>brokerage</b> in {{wireless}} sensor networks involves producers (such as sensor nodes) storing {{in storage}} positions {{a large amount of}} data that they have collected and consumers (e. g. base stations, users, and nodes) retrieving that information. In this paper, first, the data storage problem is formalized into a one-to-one (one producer and one consumer) model, a many-to-one (m producers and one consumer) model, and a many-to-many (m producers and n consumers) model with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption. Second, based on the above models, two algorithms are proposed to determine the storage positions based on data rates of producers, query rates of consumers, and transmission scheme of <b>information</b> <b>brokerage.</b> The optimal data storage (ODS) scheme, a greedy algorithm, produces the global optimal data storage positions and the near-optimal data storage (NDS) scheme, an approximate algorithm, can greatly reduce the computational overhead while achieving local optimal positions. Both ODS and NDS are able to adjust the storage positions adaptively to minimize energy consumption that includes the costs of storing and querying the data. Simulation results show that NDS not only provides substantial cost benefits but also performs as effective and efficient as ODS in over 70 % of the tested cases...|$|E
