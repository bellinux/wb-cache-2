2500|$|The medium {{material}} is usually {{soda lime glass}} or a ceramic. It is usually spherical in form, but angular shapes are also used. For plating, medium usage is usually 1 part medium for every workpiece, but for galvanization the ratio is 2:1. However, various sized media are used in each batch with a typical batch consisting of 50% [...] sized beads, 25% [...] sized beads, and 25% [...] sized beads. The smaller media are omitted when the workpiece has a cavity that the medium can get caught in, such as a fastener's recessed <b>head.</b> <b>Note</b> that the medium is reused many times.|$|E

6000|$|... "A celebrated publicist, {{recently}} deceased {{at a great}} age. You see him unfolded by {{this work}} of multiform genius, in every aspect known to art, religion, nature, and the population. From his knees downwards he is clearly devoted to nature, and is portrayed as about to enter his bath. From his waist to his knees he is devoted to religion--mark the complete disappearance of the human aspect. From his neck to his waist he is devoted to public affairs; observe the tweed coat, the watch chain, and other signs of practical sobriety. But the head is, after all, the crown of the human being, and is devoted to art. This is why you cannot make {{out that it is}} a <b>head.</b> <b>Note</b> its pyramidal severity, its cunning little ears, its box-built, water-tightal structure. The hair you note to be in flames. Here we have the touch of beauty--the burning shrub. In the whole you will observe that aversion from natural form and the single point of view, characteristic of all twentieth-century æsthetics. The whole thing is a very great masterpiece of childlike contortionism. To do things as irresponsibly as children and contortionists--what a happy discovery of the line of least resistance in art that was! Mark, by the way, this exquisite touch about the left hand." ...|$|E
