5|$|A. tendagurensis {{was named}} in 1925 by Werner Janensch for a partial shin (MB.R.3620) {{found in the}} Kimmeridgian-age Tendaguru Formation in Mtwara, Tanzania. Although {{tabulated}} as a tentatively valid species of Allosaurus in the second edition of the Dinosauria, subsequent studies place it as indeterminate beyond Tetanurae, either a carcharodontosaurian or megalosaurid. Although obscure, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> theropod, possibly around 10meters long (33ft) and 2.5metric tons (2.8short tons) in weight.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} in November, a trough was present across the west-central Atlantic Ocean.

5|$|Although Hurricane Marco {{never made}} landfall, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> storm {{with an unusual}} and erratic path and as a result, caused heavy {{rainfall}} throughout Central America and the western Caribbean nations. In the Dominican Republic, three people drowned north of Santo Domingo, while 200families fled their homes during the flooding. Marco also contributed to an ongoing flood in Jamaica, which had already caused a total of $3million in damage to roads and left 170families without shelter. After significant damage from Hurricane Lili in the previous month, minimal effects occurred in Cuba. Large amounts of precipitation also fell across Cuba, especially on the Isle of Youth and in Pinar del Río Province. Heavy rains caused thousands to flee their homes. However, damage in the country, if any is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Athens {{was chosen}} as the Greek capital for {{historical}} and sentimental reasons, not because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses {{at the foot of the}} Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of Athens (1837, under the name Othonian University), the Athens Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens of Athens (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), and the Old Parliament Building (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion, Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fernanda in 1993 was {{the first}} {{significant}} hurricane threat to Hawaii since Hurricane Iniki struck in September 1992. The seventh named storm and fourth major hurricane of the 1993 Pacific hurricane season, Fernanda developed on August 9 {{off the coast of}} Mexico from a tropical wave. Throughout its life, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> system, and the hurricane reached peak winds of 145mph (230km/h). After weakening slightly, Fernanda restrengthened and was expected to move across the Hawaiian Islands. Instead, the hurricane slowed its forward motion and turned away from the state, although it still produced high waves along the eastern shore of the islands. Several homes were damaged, and the surf damaged coastal roads. The storm also contributed to rainfall across the state, and minor flooding occurred in Kauai. Fernanda became extratropical on August 19, and after turning to the northeast became absorbed by a cold front.|$|E
5|$|On October14, a {{tropical}} depression was first observed over the western Caribbean Sea, {{just off the}} eastern Honduras coast. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> and weak tropical cyclone, moving slowly northwestward and gradually intensifying. On October15, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status, and its strengthening became more steady. The next day, the storm reached hurricane status about 130mi (215km) southeast of Cozumel, Quintana Roo. Around that time, it began to execute a small counterclockwise loop off {{the east coast of}} the Yucatán Peninsula. By October18 the hurricane completed the loop, during which its winds increased to 115mph (185km/h); this is the equivalence of a major hurricane, or a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of atmospheric pressure and maximum sustained winds by ships and land stations.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} cavalry division {{consisted of}} a ninety-six man headquarters, as well as 6,872 cavalrymen in four brigades, 1,682 artillerymen in four artillery batteries, 191 men in a Royal Engineers field squadron and another 206 men in the engineers signal squadron, twenty-six men in an Army Service Corps headquarters, and four field ambulances with 496 men. This made a total of 9,269 men, 9,518 horses, 425 wagons, 23 cars, 412 bicycles, 18 motorcycles, 24 13-pounder guns, and 24 Vickers machine guns. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> force when mounted, but when asked to serve dismounted, the cavalry division was only the equivalent of two weakened infantry brigades, with less artillery than an infantry division. It did, however, have a higher allocation of artillery compared to foreign cavalry divisions.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Bronze Age, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon activity, {{including}} coins, jewellery and axes, {{has been}} discovered locally. The area was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> estate which included neighbouring Cheadle. In the early 14th century it was split into southern and northern parts at about the future locations of Cheadle Hulme and Cheadle, respectively. The area was acquired by the Moseley family in the 17th century and became known as Cheadle Moseley. Unlike many English villages it did not grow around a church; instead it formed from several hamlets, many of which retain their names as neighbourhoods within Cheadle Hulme. In the late 19th century Cheadle Hulme was united with Cheadle, Gatley and other neighbouring places to form the urban district of Cheadle and Gatley. This district was abolished in 1974 and Cheadle Hulme became a distinct place in its own right, {{as part of the}} Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, six guns, four 12-pounders and two 12-pound carronades, were {{installed}} on the bastion, and four years later, five 32-pounders were mounted on the fortification. The earliest defences of {{the southern end of}} the city of Gibraltar included the 16th century Charles V Wall, Flat Bastion, South Bastion, Southport Gate, and Southport Ditch. The complex of defences also included Southport Ditch which was depicted in the 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de Acuña. On that map which is held by the British Museum, the ditch is shown as a Fosso south of Southport Gate. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> trench which extended from the southwestern aspect of the 16th century South Bastion to the Flat Bastion at Prince Edward's Gate. The width of the ditch is now indicated by that of Ragged Staff Gates, which initially served as a water gate. By the late 19th century, the ditch was utilised as an ordnance depot, with a magazine constructed in the 1880s. However, by the early 20th century, that same magazine was used as a pump house. After World War I and reclamation of land, the Ragged Staff Gates were opened to vehicular traffic. Gibraltar's Sunken Gardens, a 19th-century market garden, were a remnant of the western portion of the Southport Ditch, and were filled in at the time of the 1967 Referendum Gate. Trafalgar Cemetery represents an eastern remnant of the ditch.|$|E

5|$|The {{tree was}} well known to Māori before its {{scientific}} discovery. The generic Māori language term for plants in the Cordyline genus is tī, and names recorded as specific to C.australis include tī kōuka, tī kāuka, tī rākau, tī awe, tī pua, and tī whanake. Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight {{the characteristics of the}} tree that were important to Māori. These include what the plant looked like—whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> tree (tī rākau, tī pua), the whiteness of its flowers (tī puatea), whether its leaves were broad (tī wharanui), twisted along the edges (tī tahanui), or spiky (tī tarariki). Other names refer to its uses—whether its fruit attracted birds (tī manu), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (tī whanake) and nets (tī kupenga). The most widely used name, tī kōuka, refers {{to the use of the}} leaf hearts as food.|$|E
5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} martensitic stainless steel. The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E
