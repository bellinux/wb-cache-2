5|$|Amongst those {{calling for}} change have been Tony Beddison, then {{chairman}} of the Australia Day Committee (Victoria), who argued for change and requested debate on the issue in 1999; and Mick Dodson, Australian of the Year in 2009, who called for <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> to when Australia Day was held.|$|E
5|$|As some archaeological records {{support the}} view that the Egyptian state was divided during Peribsen's reign, there is {{continued}} <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> to why his predecessors decided to divide the realm, and whether Peribsen ruled part or all of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|North Korea was disqualified for {{cheating}} at the 32nd IMO in 1991 {{and again}} at the 51st IMO in 2010. It {{is the only country}} to have been accused of cheating. There is some <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> to whether North Korea was actually cheating, especially in the 51st IMO.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent to}} which cryovolcanism really occurs is a subject of some <b>debate,</b> <b>as</b> water, being denser than ice by about 8%, has {{difficulty}} erupting under normal circumstances. At Enceladus, it appears that cryovolcanism occurs because water-filled cracks are periodically exposed to vacuum, the cracks being opened and closed by tidal stresses.|$|E
5|$|Then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev {{sang the}} song {{together}} {{when they met}} in Moscow in 1959 to reduce the tension between them during the Kitchen <b>Debate.</b> <b>As</b> the story goes, Nixon did not know any Russian songs, but Khrushchev knew that one American song {{as it had been}} sung on the Ed Sullivan show.|$|E
5|$|There is some <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> to the {{decompression}} {{requirements for}} helium during short-duration dives. Most divers do longer decompressions; however, some {{groups like the}} WKPP have been pioneering the use of shorter decompression times by including deep stops.|$|E

5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|Despite that, the {{government}} has stated that the issue might be addressed if France were to be offered something of equal value. The Council itself has indicated privately that it would discuss the Strasbourg seat only if Parliament gives them a signal to start a <b>debate,</b> <b>as</b> they would not do on their own initiative. However, few wish {{to discuss the issue}} while the current constitutional issues are still present. Although political parties have no formal position, the Greens, Liberals and Socialists are all outspoken on having Brussels as a permanent seat.|$|E

5|$|One of Stanley Marcus's first jobs {{was as a}} 10-year-old {{salesman}} of Saturday Evening Post, {{bringing him}} into the family's business tradition from a young age. He attended Forest Avenue High School, where he studied <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> well as English with teacher Myra Brown, whom he later credited with much of his early interest in books. He began his university studies at Amherst College, but when traditions preventing Jews from joining clubs or fraternities drastically curtailed his social life, he transferred to Harvard University after the first year. At his new school, he {{became a member of}} the historically Jewish fraternity Zeta Beta Tau, later rising to become the group's president.|$|E
5|$|Social life in {{the urban}} setting did not {{initially}} {{live up to his}} expectations, but after a time his writing and lecturing upon a variety of subjects filled the void. He also joined The American Institute for the Advancement of Science and successfully urged its members to establish a section on Political Economics and Statistics. He as well engaged in a <b>debate,</b> <b>as</b> antagonist of Malthusian population theory with proponent Alexander Everett.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} route through Innherred was largely without much <b>debate,</b> <b>as</b> the line {{naturally}} {{went through all}} the towns {{and most of the}} important villages. Sunnan was a natural place to halt construction, as it is located {{at the foot of the}} lake of Snåsavatnet, allowing connection with steam ships. Scheduled services on Snåsavatnet started in 1871 with SS Dina, which was replaced with SS Bonden in 1885. From 1904 to 1921, Bonden was supplemented with MS St. Olaf, although SS Bonden remained in corresponding service with the train until 1926.|$|E

5|$|The {{debate has}} played out {{across a wide}} {{spectrum}} of media, including newspapers, magazines, web blogs, and congressional research arms like the Government Accountability Office. Each side has presented different arguments on the best approach to the problem, but most of the participants favor the continuation of the DD(X) program or the reinstatement of the Iowa-class battleships to the Naval Vessel Register. The s, the s, and s have entered the <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> options put forward for naval gunfire support, while others advocate the use of specifically designed close air support planes and newer missile systems that can loiter in an area as a replacement for naval gunfire.|$|E
5|$|The major Russian ORT TV station {{organised}} {{a national}} televised <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> to {{what should be}} done with the station. Former cosmonaut Georgi Grechko suggested that it should be kept in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it, for transfer to the International Space Station or other spacecraft, however Konstantin Feoktistov argued that it would cost more to retrieve the equipment than to replace it. Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E
5|$|This {{new class}} of GRB-like events was first {{discovered}} through the detection of GRB 110328A by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission on 28 March 2011. This event had a gamma-ray duration of about 2 days, much longer than even ultra-long GRBs, and was detected in X-rays for many months. It occurred {{at the center of}} a small elliptical galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. There is an ongoing <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> to whether the explosion was the result of stellar collapse or a tidal disruption event accompanied by a relativistic jet, although the latter explanation has become widely favoured.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. <b>Debate</b> <b>as</b> to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of <b>debate</b> <b>as</b> whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E
