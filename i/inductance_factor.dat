40|$|A set of {{convenient}} thermoelectric device solutions {{have been}} derived {{in order to}} capture {{a number of factors}} which are previously only resolved with numerical techniques. The concise conversion efficiency equations derived from governing equations provide intuitive and straight-forward design guidelines. These guidelines allow for better device design without requiring detailed numerical modeling. The analytical modeling accounts for factors such as i) variable temperature boundary conditions, ii) lateral heat transfer, iii) temperature variable material properties, and iv) transient operation. New dimensionless parameters, similar to the figure of merit, are introduced including the device design factor, fin factor, thermal diffusivity factor, and <b>inductance</b> <b>factor.</b> These new device factors allow for the straight-forward description of phenomenon generally only captured with numerical work otherwise. As an example a device design factor of 0. 38, which accounts for thermal resistance of the hot and cold shoes, can be used to calculate a conversion efficiency of 2. 28 while the ideal conversion efficiency based on figure of merit alone would be 6. 15.

This work addresses a niche area of inductor design as it applies to the 3 -dimensional (3 -D) integration of active transistors and passive components. Hybrid, 3 -D circuits residing on inexpensive silicon substrates can be fashioned using a photosensitive epoxy known as SU- 8 serving as the interposer layer between the substrate and in which the passive components are embedded. The active components, which are known-good-chips, are secured with epoxy into deep reactive ion etched pockets in the silicon substrate. The inductors are fabricated in the SU- 8 covering the active chips. This technique saves considerable money and increases the yield of 3 -D circuits compared with the high cost of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs).
