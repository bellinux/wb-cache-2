The {{results showed that}} the penetration increased with the decrease of frequency and <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> cycle, but weld width showed the opposite change tendency. Furthermore, some experiments were implemented to analyze the effect of wire extension length and arc voltage on bead appearance. All of these experimental data could provide proper parameters for the lead arc and the trail arc in tandem SAW using square wave AC and also testified square wave AC was preferred over DC and traditional 50 Hz AC.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the technology of}} orderly printing of microdroplets by means of electrohydrodynamic print (EHDP) with alternating current (AC). The AC electric field induces charges to reciprocate in the electrohydrodynamic charged jet and generates periodic alternation of electric field force, which facilitates the breakup of charged jets and injection of microdroplets. Microdroplets with a diameter of 100 ~ 300 [*]μm can be printed with a frequency of 5 ~ 25 [*]Hz via AC EHDP. Effects of process parameters on the microdroplet injection behaviors were investigated.

40|$|The article {{originates}} {{from the}} recent re-flourishing of the Italian and foreign juridical literature about the constitutional duties. Firstly, it tries to individualize the reasons that appear mostly suitable to justify {{the revival of the}} “sense of duty” and of “civic morals”. The paper also reviews, in a comparative and diachronic perspective, the constitutional dispositions on duties that are in the constitutionals texts from the revolutions {{of the end of the}} eighteenth century to the liberal age and the democratic and pluralistic State. The comparative approach of the study <b>of</b> the <b>duties,</b> omitted until now, is a good starting point to identify the intensity degree in the receipt and circulation of ideas and principles between Europe and America and it also formulates some conclusions about the evolution of the nature <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> and their possible replacement in the juridical contemporary contexts. This analysis shows from the one hand, the progressive <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> (so much that we can see a sort <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> generations) within the constitutional texts and perceives, on the other hand (in virtue of the expressions used by the contemporary constituents), the possible weakening of the clauses <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> contained in the Constitutions.

The latter, however, also soon resigned, and was succeeded on the July 10, 1891 by Erik Gustaf Boström, a landed proprietor. The protectionist system gained in favour on the expiry of the commercial treaty with France in 1892, as it could now be extended to articles of industry. The elections of 1890, when the metropolis returned free traders and Liberals to the Second Chamber, certainly effected a change in the latter, as the representatives of the towns and the old [...] "Lantmanna" [...] party joined issue and established a free-trade majority in the chamber, but in the combined meetings of the two chambers the compact protectionist majority in the First Chamber turned the scale. The customs duties were, however, altered several times in accordance with market prices and ruling circumstances. When the import duty on ungrounded barley was reduced in 1892, the same duties were also retained for the following year. They were also retained for 1894 {{at the request of the}} government, which desired to keep faith with their promise that while the new organization of the army was going on no <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> on the necessaries of life should take place. This measure caused much dissatisfaction, and gave rise to a strong agrarian movement in consequence of which the government, in the beginning of 1895, before the assembling of the Riksdag, made use of its right of raising the two duties on barley just referred to, which were afterwards somewhat reduced as far as seed barley for sowing purposes was concerned.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the excise duty on tobacco {{products}} in the Czech Republic since 1993 {{up to the present}} time, especially the development of rates and revenues. Excise duty is imposed on tobacco products in the Czech Republic and also in the other European Union countries. Harmonisation efforts in the European Union and also fiscal need of Czech Republic cause frequent changes in tobacco excise duty rates, which conduces not only to change of tax collection, but can also bring some other related effects. In the theoretical part I first characterize the tax theory with a detailed focus on excise duty on tobacco products. Subsequently I define the meaning <b>of</b> excise <b>duty</b> on tobacco products, the principles and the mechanisms of the tax collection. In the practical part of the thesis I aim at analyse the evolution of the legal framework that affects excise duty on tobacco products and significantly affects the thesis in other sections. Further, I analyse the relationship between the rate <b>of</b> excise <b>duty</b> on tobacco products and tax collection and find out that the higher rate <b>of</b> excise <b>duty</b> not always led to higher tax yields.
