5|$|The {{barbed wire}} which fenced us in {{did not cause}} us any real fear.... We {{appointed}} a Jewish Council, a Jewish police, an office for social assistance, a labor committee, a hygiene department–a whole government machinery. Everyone marveled at <b>it.</b> <b>We</b> should no longer have before our eyes those hostile faces, those hate-laden stares. Our fear and anguish were at an end. We were living among Jews, among brothers...|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about <b>it.</b> <b>We</b> were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample <b>it,</b> <b>we</b> went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

25|$|In the Stern-Gerlach {{experiment}} discussed above, {{the spin}} {{of the atom}} about the vertical axis has two eigenstates: up and down.

25|$|It is {{in those}} two {{functions}} that the real life of the ego is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In <b>it</b> <b>we</b> cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are {{the sense of being}} one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in <b>it</b> <b>we</b> are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.|$|E
25|$|From {{the first}} the British had an {{extraordinary}} advantage, {{never to be}} balanced out {{at any time during}} the whole war, which was their radar and fighter control network and organization.

25|$|As {{a way of}} {{visualizing}} {{the choice}} of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on <b>it,</b> <b>we</b> cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(x), where x measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.|$|E

25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}.

25|$|The proof above for {{the square}} root of two can be {{generalized}} using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This asserts that every integer {{has a unique}} factorization into primes. Using <b>it</b> <b>we</b> can show that if a rational number is not an integer then no integral power of {{it can be an}} integer, as in lowest terms there must be a prime in the denominator that does not divide into the numerator whatever power each is raised to. Therefore, if an integer is not an exact kth power of another integer then its kth root is irrational.|$|E
25|$|I want to {{conclude}} with a few remarks about the domestic scene {{and the role of}} Social Democrats, U.S.A. in <b>it.</b> <b>We</b> are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.|$|E

25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot.

I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that.
