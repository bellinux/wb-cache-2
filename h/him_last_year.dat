2500|$|When {{being interviewed}} by WCBS-NY, Espada {{walked out of}} the taping of the show [...] "Eye on New York" [...] on April 24, 2010, after {{reporter}} Marcia Kramer revisited issues of his actual residence. Espada got testy when Kramer reminded him that when she approached <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> outside his Mamaroneck home, he donned an orange ski cap and held a baby {{in front of his face}} to hide from the camera before speeding off in a car driven by his wife Connie Espada.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony {{played one}} season at Syracuse University, during the 2002–2003 season, where he {{averaged}} 22.2 points (16th in the NCAA, 4th in the Big East) and 10.0 rebounds (19th in the NCAA, 3rd in the Big East, 1st among NCAA Division I freshmen). He helped guide the Orangemen {{to their first}} ever NCAA tournament title in 2003. He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made and free throws made and attempted. Anthony's 33-point outburst against the University of Texas in the Final Four set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman. In the championship game against the University of Kansas, Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds. For his efforts during the NCAA tournament, Anthony earned the tournament's Most Outstanding Player Award. Afterwards, Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim described Anthony as [...] " [...] by far, {{the best player in}} college basketball. It wasn't even close. Nobody was even close to <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> in college basketball. That's the bottom line".|$|E
6000|$|... "He must at some time, in Paris, for instance, or {{when you}} lunched with <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> have said {{something}} about his profession, or how he spent his time?" ...|$|E
50|$|On March 5, 2009 Roberts was {{released}} by the Giants, despite the team still owing <b>him</b> the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of his contract.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} had a formed {{character}} when you saw <b>him</b> <b>last.</b> The twelve <b>years</b> before five-and-forty don't alter the nature." ...|$|R
50|$|Hussain died in Mumbai on 13 March 2002 {{following}} a heart attack. After his death, Asha Parekh stated {{in an interview}} that she had not seen <b>him</b> the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of his life, as he became reclusive because of his wife's death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit. Just a plain slogger. That's all. That's why Drummond beat <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> in the Feather-Weights. In {{strength}} {{there was}} no comparison, but Drummond was just too clever for him. You will be the same, Sheen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no. You {{forced me}} into visiting <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> and promised, if I {{went to see}} him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! It {{took you}} {{a long time}} to tell it. I don't believe it {{amounted}} to much. Mr. Clarke {{did not appear to be}} the sort of a man to insult anyone. All the girls were crazy about <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> If he was not all right they would not have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{a prince}} he looks like," [...] quoth Tom to himself, {{as he waited}} in the bank outside, and looked through the glass screen. [...] "How well the old man wears! I wonder how many fresh {{thousands}} he has made since I saw <b>him</b> <b>last,</b> seven <b>years</b> ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|P. C. MAN. [With sudden resolution] Now, look here! This man George Blunter was had {{up three}} years ago--for livin' on the {{earnings}} of a woman called Johnson. He was dismissed with a caution. We got <b>him</b> again <b>last</b> <b>year</b> over a woman called Lee--that time he did-- ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{winner was}} Torstein Snekvik {{with the song}} [...] "Svikter aldri igjen" [...] (meaning Never fails again in Norwegian). The trophy that was handed to <b>him</b> by <b>last</b> <b>year's</b> winner Jørgen Dahl Moe. Presenters were Kåre Magnus Bergh and Ingrid Gjessing Linhave. AF1, Didrik Solli-Tangen and Tine Thing Helseth {{performed}} during the competition breaks.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{nearly killed}} <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> {{but he never}} had lungs good for anything. First, my aunt set my father against it, and when he gave in, she had a crabbed {{decrepit}} old grandfather, and between them they were the death of her, and almost of him. I never thought he would rally again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear,' he said, tenderly, 'your brother needs prayer {{such as when}} {{we watched}} <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> he is in peril of grave suspicion.' And as she stood waiting and {{watching}} for further explanation, he continued, 'My dear, he told you everything. You do not know of any notion of his of going away, or going out without leave?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{made his}} request to me, and I refused it. Had I consented to marry <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> all {{this would have}} been different. I {{intended}} to do right, and even now I do not think that I was wrong. But I cannot impute fault to him. He does all this in order that I may impute it, and that then he may have his revenge." ...|$|E
5000|$|Parry's health {{continued}} to deteriorate {{and he died}} on 4 February 1922, leaving a widow and six children. At the Everton board meeting on 7 February, a letter was read from the vicar of Oswestry informing the club of Parry's death. It was [...] "decided that as we had given <b>him</b> assistance <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> the question be left over".|$|R
6000|$|... "Natural like, I reckon, fer Jack to feel gay on gettin' home. I ain't holdin' thet ag'in' <b>him.</b> These <b>last</b> three <b>years</b> {{must have}} been gallin' to thet boy." ...|$|R
50|$|According to one report, {{his widow}} married William Burford and nursed <b>him</b> in his <b>last</b> <b>years.</b> Burford died in 1925. If true, this could only {{mean that he}} married a third time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thirty-five {{thousand}} dollars' {{worth of}} neck and legs," [...] Dick smiled. [...] "That's what {{a pool of}} breeders offered me for <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> after he'd cleaned up the Coast with his get as well as himself. And as for Paula, she could break necks and legs at that price {{every day in the}} year until I went broke--only she doesn't. She never has accidents." ...|$|E
60|$|And then Leonidas {{explained}} {{all about}} it to her: how his father had brought <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> to Europe and had put him to school at Paris; but when the war broke out, {{and most of the}} stranger scholars were taken away, no orders came about him, because his father was a merchant and was away from home, so that no one ever knew whether the letters had reached him.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{during the}} quest into trains came {{a fit of}} humility. [...] "Do {{you think they will}} listen to me? You are not the sort who would think me a catch, and I know I am a very poor stick {{compared}} with any of you, and should have gone to the dogs long ago but for Jock, ungrateful ass as I was to <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> But if I had such a creature as that to take care of, why it would be like having an angel about one. I would-—indeed I would—-reverence, yes, and worship her all my life long." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1828, {{she became}} the second wife of Harvard {{professor}} John Farrar. She nursed <b>him</b> during his <b>last</b> <b>years,</b> and many of her stories were used as diversions for his sick room.|$|R
5000|$|Armin Wegner, a {{contemporary}} of Essad Bey {{and who knew}} <b>him</b> in his <b>last</b> <b>years</b> in Positano, Italy, observed that Essad Bey [...] "kept up the comedy of being Muslim to the end." ...|$|R
40|$|For {{my family}} ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I {{would like to}} show my {{gratitude}} to Professor Jerzy Kanicki for his support throughout my doctoral study. The academic discussion with <b>him</b> for <b>last</b> <b>years</b> was always helpful and inspired me. I also sincerely thank my doctoral committee: Professor Jamie D. Phillips, Professor Wei Lu and Professor Çagliyan Kurdak for their time and valuable comments...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no! Rene's a French prisoner--on parole. That means he's {{promised not}} to escape till he has been {{properly}} exchanged for an Englishman. He's only a doctor, so I hope they won't think him worth exchanging. My uncle captured <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> in the FERDINAND privateer, off Belle Isle, and he cured my uncle of a r-r-raging toothache. Of course, after that we couldn't let him lie among the common French prisoners at Rye, and so he stays with us. He's of very old family--a Breton, which is nearly next door to being a true Briton, my father says--and he wears his hair clubbed--not powdered. Much more becoming, don't you think?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well! {{we shall}} soon {{see what this}} favour is worth,' {{retorted}} Sir Ratcliffe, rather bitterly. 'Regularly every visit {{for the last three}} years your father has asked me what I intended to do with Ferdinand. I said to <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> more than I thought I ever could say to anyone. I told him that Ferdinand was now fifteen, and that I wished to get him a commission; but that I had no influence to get him a commission, and no money to pay for it if it were offered me. I think that was pretty plain; and I have been surprised ever since that I ever could have placed myself in such a degrading position as to say so much.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For," [...] said he, [...] "Cloudbrow {{is willing}} to wait till spring for payment of the horse an' cart I hired from <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> You know that I could not pay him till I go to the plains an' get another load of meat an' leather. You will go with me, Slowfoot, an' we will have grand times of it with buffalo-humps an' marrow bones, an' tea an' tobacco. Ah! it makes my mouth water. Give me more tea. So. That will do. What a noise the wind makes! I hopes it won't blow over the shed an' kill the horse. But if it do I cannot help that. Cloudbrow could not ask me {{to pay for what}} the wind does." ...|$|E
50|$|In June, Ma won the Japan Open in Tokyo, beating Xu (who had {{defeated}} <b>him</b> there <b>last</b> <b>year)</b> in 6 {{games and}} Fan in 5 {{on his way}} to the title. This was the first time he won in Japan, meaning he has won at every major station on the ITTF World Tour (Kuwait, Germany, China, Qatar, Japan, and Korea).|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not wise to jeer at Olaf," [...] said Steinar, [...] "for {{when he is}} stung {{with words}} he does mad things. Don't you {{remember}} what happened when your father called <b>him</b> 'niddering' <b>last</b> <b>year</b> because Olaf {{said it was not}} just to attack the ship of those British men who had been driven to our coast by weather, meaning us no harm?" ...|$|R
25|$|The Ashmolean Museum's (Oxford) {{exhibition}} William Blake: Apprentice and Master, {{open from}} December 2014 until March 2015, examined William Blake's formation as an artist, {{as well as}} his influence on young artist-printmakers who gathered around <b>him</b> in the <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of his life.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the morning}} of the 27th, Mrs. Hanson {{appeared}} with the milk as usual, in her sun-bonnet. The time would be out on Tuesday, she reminded us, and bade me be in readiness to play my part, though I had no idea what it was to be. And suppose Ronalds came? we asked. She received the idea with derision, laughing aloud with all her fine teeth. He could not find the mine to save his life, it appeared, without Rufe to guide <b>him.</b> <b>Last</b> <b>year,</b> when he came, they heard him [...] "up and down the road a hollerin' and a raisin' Cain." [...] And at last he had to come to the Hansons in despair, and bid Rufe, [...] "Jump into your pants and shoes, and show me where this old mine is, anyway!" [...] Seeing that Ronalds had laid out so much money in the spot, and that a beaten road led right up {{to the bottom of the}} clump, I thought this a remarkable example. The sense of locality must be singularly in abeyance in the case of Ronalds.|$|E
6000|$|The {{doctor is}} much the most talkative of our company, and {{sometimes}} bores me thereby; though he seldom says anything that is not either instructive or amusing. He tells a curious story of Prince Albert, and how he avails himself of American sharp-shooting. During the doctor's tour in Scotland, which he has just finished, he became acquainted {{with one of the}} Prince's attaches, who invited him very earnestly to join his Royal highness's party, promising him a good gun, and a keeper to load it for him, two good dogs, besides as many cigars as he could smoke and as much wine as he could drink, on the condition that whatever game he shot should be the Prince's. [...] "The Prince," [...] said the attache, [...] "is very fond of having Americans in his shooting-parties, on account of their being such excellent shots; and there was one with <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> who shot so admirably that his Royal Highness himself left off shooting in utter astonishment." [...] The attache offered to introduce the doctor to the Prince, who would be certain to receive him very graciously. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "John of Dunster?" [...] {{said the}} King. [...] "Henry, didst thou not know for whose sake I had loved and proved him? He was Richard's pupil. I {{was forced to}} take the child with me, for old Sir Reginald had been unruly enough, and I thought would be the less {{troublesome}} to my father were his son in my keeping. But I half repented when I saw what a small urchin it was, to be cast about among grooms and pages! But Richard aided the little uncouth varlet, nursed him when sick, guarded him when well, trained him to be loyal and steadfast. The little fellow came bravely to my aid in my grapple with the traitor before Acre; and when the blow had fallen on Richard, the boy's grief was such that I loved him ever after. And of late I have had no truer trustier warrior. I warrant me he was too shy to tell thee that I knighted <b>him</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> {{in the midst of}} some of the best feats of arms I ever beheld against the Welsh! Whatever John de Mohun saith is sooth, and I would rather mate my daughter with him than with many a man of fairer speech." ...|$|E
50|$|His {{wife died}} in 1872, and in 1875 he was again married to Margaret Briscoe, of Georgetown, Ky., who survived <b>him.</b> His <b>last</b> <b>years</b> were spent in Cincinnati, Ohio, {{and he died}} on September 19, 1888, in his 84th year, worn out with old age and infirmities, in Petoskey, Mich. He had visited that place {{annually}} for several years, on account of hay fever, from which he had long been a sufferer.|$|R
50|$|In 306, {{a council}} held under Pope Peter of Alexandria deposed Meletius, Bishop of Lycopolis, for idolatry and other crimes. The schism then begun by <b>him</b> <b>lasted</b> fifty <b>years</b> {{and was the}} source of much trouble for the Church of Egypt. In 321 was held the council that first {{condemned}} Arius, then parish priest of the section of Alexandria known as Baucalis. After his condemnation Arius withdrew to Palestine, where he secured the powerful support of Eusebius of Caesarea.|$|R
50|$|Federer {{began his}} clay {{season at the}} Monte-Carlo Masters. He opened up against Jérémy Chardy who had beaten <b>him</b> on clay <b>last</b> <b>year</b> in Rome. However this time Federer beat him in {{straight}} sets. He then played Gaël Monfils {{in the third round}} and lost in straight sets.|$|R
