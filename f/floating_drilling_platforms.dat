40|$|Internal waves {{near the}} ocean surface have been {{observed}} {{in many parts of}} the world including the Andaman Sea, Sulu Sea and South China Sea. The factors that cause and propagate these large-amplitude waves include bathymetry, density stratification and ocean currents. Although their effects on <b>floating</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>platforms</b> and their riser systems have not been extensively studied, in the past these waves have seriously disrupted offshore exploration and drilling operations. In particular, a drill pipe was ripped from the Blow-Out Preventer (BOP) and lost during drilling operations in the Andaman Sea. Drilling riser damages were also reported from the South China Sea and other places. The motivations of this study were to find a valid numerical model conforming to the physics of internal waves and to study the effects on offshore drilling semisubmersibles, different types of offshore hull forms and riser systems, including the large diameter cold water pipe of floating Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) systems. The influence of internal waves on offshore systems was studied through nonlinear fully coupled time-domain analysis. The numerical model was implemented in a coupled analysis program where the hull, moorings and riser were considered an integrated system. The program HARP was modified and then utilized to study the effects of the internal wave on the platform global motions and riser system integrity. The study could be useful as future guidance for offshore exploration and operations in areas where the internal wave phenomenon is prominent...|$|E

To withstand such magnitude of ice forces, mooring system using 32 lines was designed. For lower ice loads in a milder environment, the number of mooring lines can be reduced considerably. For operating in the warmer season, {{the platform}} was analyzed for design environments of operating and survival conditions. The motion responses in these conditions were found to be excellent in comparison to other deepwater MonoCone Arctic (MCAD) <b>Platform</b> is a <b>floating</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>platform</b> intended for using in the arctic condition. The platform has been (preliminarily) designed to withstand ice loading as well wave loading. In the warmer season of the year, the platform will be subjected to environmental forces due to wave, wind and current, whereas in the winter, the platform will be subjected primarily to ice loads. The ice loads are much more severe than combined environmental loads due to wind, wave, and current. Thus the concept of MCAD has been developed with a configuration that would minimize the ice loads...|$|R

Englebright Lake is a 14 -km-long reservoir on the Yuba River of northern California, impounded by Englebright Dam, which {{was completed in}} 1940. The sediments were cored to assess the current conditions in the reservoir {{as part of the}} California Bay-Delta Authority’s Upper Yuba River Studies Program. Sediment was collected using both hydraulic-piston and rotational coring equipment mounted on a <b>floating</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>platform.</b> Thirty boreholes were attempted at 7 sites spaced along the longitudinal axis of the reservoir. Complete sedimentary sections were recovered from 20 boreholes at 6 sites. In total, 335 m of sediment was cored, with 86 % average recovery. The core sections (each up to 1. 5 m long) were processed using a standard set of laboratory techniques, including geophysical logging of physical properties, splitting, visual descriptions, digital photography, and initial subsampling. This report presents the results of these analyses in a series of stratigraphic columns. Using the observed stratigraphy as a guide, several series of subsamples were collected for various sedimentologic, geochemical, and geochronological analyses. The results of laboratory analyses of most of these subsamples will be presented in future reports and articles...|$|R
40|$|Coral reef {{calcareous}} sediment, {{a special}} category of rock-soil material, has representative geological structure and environmental characteristics. It is widely distributed in shallow {{areas of the}} tropical ocean; therefore the exploration instruments and technologies for engineering geology studies of coral reef calcareous sediments {{are very different from}} those used in land or deep-sea. Obtaining undisturbed cores from the Holocene unconsolidated stratum of coral reefs has been a key problem in the field of marine geology and environment surveying. The authors have designed a novel <b>floating</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>platform</b> equipped with a drilling machine, and successfully achieved undisturbed cores from both reef flats (with water depth 0. 5 to 2 m) and a enclosed lagoon (with water depth 2 – 12 m) of Yongshu Reef (9 ° 32 – 9 ° 42 N, 112 ° 52 – 113 ° 04 E), southern South China Sea. Based on the detailed observation on the cores and the analysis from engineering geology, Yongshu Reef was split into reef three engineering geological zones: leading edge, reef flat (including outer reef flat, middle reef flat and inner reef flat) and lagoon. The sediments are classified in the stratum as fine sand, medium sand, coarse sand, gravel and weak-cemented reef limestone...|$|R
40|$|There {{are some}} {{disadvantages}} for existing heave compensation systems of drill string {{used for the}} <b>Floating</b> <b>Drilling</b> <b>Platform</b> (FDP), including high energy consumption, large and complex structure, and expensive manufacturing and maintenance costs. In view of the above, we present a streamlined mechanical semi-active heave compensation system (MSAHC) in this study. This system consists of active compensation part with the pinion and rack and passive compensation part. In order to evaluate system performance of the MSAHC, we establish its simulation model with AMEsim software. In the process of simulation, displacement of rotary hook and energy consumption is regarded as performance parameters of the system. And the change rule of two performance parameters are analyzed by changing these design parameters including gear radius of the pinion and rack, scale coefficient of PID, rotary hook load, heave height and heave period of the FDP, and accumulator volume. Then, based on the simulation results of the MSAHC system performance, we have selected out a best set of design parameters from them. Moreover, the feasibility of the design scheme of the MSAHC is effectively verified by comparison with the existing three heave compensation system. The result shows that the energy consumption of the MSAHC {{is lower than the}} active heave compensation system (AHC) and the semi-active heave compensation system (SAHC) when achieving a same compensation effect as well as the accumulator volume of MSAHC is half of the passive heave compensation system (PHC). Therefore, the new designed MSAHC not only ensure compensation effect but also lower energy consumption, and its structure is simplified by adopting the simple mechanical structure to decrease manufacturing cost, maintenance cost and floor space...|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} report presents the engineering research, process development and data accomplishments that have transpired {{to date in}} support of the development of Cost Effective Composite Drill Pipe (CDP). The report presents progress made from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005 and contains the following discussions: (1) Qualification Testing; (2) Prototype Development and Testing of ''Smart Design'' Configuration; (3) Field Test Demonstration; and (4) Commercial order for SR-CDP from Torch International. The objective of this contract is to develop and demonstrate ''cost effective'' Composite Drill Pipe. It is projected that this drill pipe will weigh less than half of its steel counter part. The resultant weight reduction will provide enabling technology that will increase the lateral distance that can be reached from an offshore <b>drilling</b> <b>platform</b> and the depth of water in which drilling and production operations can be carried out. Further, composite drill pipe has the capability to carry real time signal and power transmission within the pipe walls. CDP can also accommodate much shorter drilling radius than is possible with metal drill pipe. As secondary benefits, the lighter weight drill pipe can increase the storage capability of <b>floating</b> off shore <b>drilling</b> <b>platforms</b> and provide substantial operational cost savings...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{carbon dioxide}} capture and storage (CCS) offers the benefit of {{reducing}} CO{sub 2 } emissions and thereby mitigating climate change risk, {{but it will also}} bring its own health, safety, and environmental risks. Curtis M. Oldenburg, Editor-in-Chief, considers these risks {{in the context of the}} broader picture of energy production. Over the last year, there have been major acute health, safety, and environmental (HSE) consequences related to accidents involving energy production from every major primary energy source. These are, in chronological order: (i) the Upper Big Branch (coal) Mine disaster, (ii) the Gulf of Mexico Macondo (oil) well blowout, (iii) the San Bruno (natural gas) pipeline leak and explosion, and (iv) the Fukushima (nuclear) reactor radioactivity releases. Briefly, the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster occurred in West Virginia on April 5, 2010, when natural methane in the mine ignited, causing the deaths of 29 miners, the worst coal mine disaster in the USA since 1970. Fifteen days later, the Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico suffered a blowout, with a gas explosion and fire on the <b>floating</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>platform</b> that killed 11 people. The oil and gas continued to flow out of the well at the seafloor until July 15, 2010, spilling a total of approximately 5 million barrels of oil into the sea. On September 9, 2010, a 30 -inch (76 -cm) buried, steel, natural gas pipeline in San Bruno, California, leaked gas and exploded in a residential neighborhood, killing 8 people in their homes and burning a total of 38 homes. Flames were up to 1000 ft (300 m) high, and the initial explosion itself reportedly measured 1. 1 on the Richter scale. Finally, on March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9. 0 earthquake off the coast of Japan's main island, Honshu, caused a tsunami that crippled the backup power and associated cooling systems for six reactor cores and their spent fuel storage tanks at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. At time of writing, workers trying to bring the crisis under control have been exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, and radioactive water and particulates have been released to the sea and atmosphere. These four disasters, all of which occurred within the past 12 months, were not unprecedented; similar events differing only in detail have happened around the world before, and such events will occur again. Today, developed nations primarily use fossil fuels to create affordable energy for comforts such as lighting, heating and air-conditioning, refrigeration, transportation, education, and entertainment, as well as for powering manufacturing, which creates jobs and a wealth of material goods. In addition to the risks of the existing energy infrastructure that have become obvious through these recent disasters, there is also the ongoing risk of climate change that comes from the vast emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily CO{sub 2 }, from the burning of fossil fuels. The implementation of CO{sub 2 } capture and storage (CCS) will help mitigate CO{sub 2 } emissions from fossil fuel energy, but it also carries with it HSE risks. In my personal interactions with the public and with students, the main concern voiced is whether CO{sub 2 } could leak out of the deep reservoirs into which it is injected and rise up out of the ground, smothering people and animals at the ground surface. Another concern expressed is that CO{sub 2 } pipelines could fail and cause similar gaseous plumes of CO{sub 2 }. The widespread concerns about CO{sub 2 } leaking out over the ground surface may be inspired by events that have happened within natural systems in equatorial Africa, in Indonesia, and in Italy. Researchers have been investigating a wide variety of HSE risks of geologic CO{sub 2 } storage for some time and have determined that wells are the main potential pathways for significant leakage from the deep subsurface. I discuss the acute HSE risks of CO{sub 2 } leakage through wells and from pipelines, and compare the behavior of failures in CO{sub 2 } wells and pipelines with oil and gas analogues from which most of our experience derives...|$|R
