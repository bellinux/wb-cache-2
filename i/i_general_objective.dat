Opinions from both, primary school students and adults on the topic were gathered and I found out which themes are the most applicable to everyday life according to the students and other adults. I also found out that the prevailing opinion of men and women on this topic is different. In the theoretical part of this thesis, I defined what knowledge is and presented the basic division of it. I also defined the subject of Home economics and described its development in Primary schools until today. <b>I</b> listed the <b>general</b> <b>objectives</b> of the subject in Slovene primary schools and in corresponding activity days. In the practical part of the thesis, I conducted a research about {{the applicability of the}} Home economics class. I used two questionnaires. One of them was given to 6 th year students in Primary schools and the second to random adults. I gathered 260 responses: 130 answered questionnaires from the students and 130 from adults. In the final part of the thesis, I analysed the data gathered and determined that the students think Home economics is useful, while the adults disagree. In contrast to men, women find the knowledge they receive more useful. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>general</b> <b>objective</b> of {{the project}} {{described}} in {{this paper is to}} build a process-centred environment kernel, providing assistance and active guidance to its users. Thanks to an hybrid approach of process modelling, both task-oriented at a coarse grain level, and decisionoriented at a fine grain level, it can be customized to support a broad range of collective design activities. The concept of issue is central to the modelling approach, both on the design side, for decision-oriented modelling of creative activities, and on the cooperation side, for modelling collective conflict resolution tasks. The paper reports some initial experiences with the current prototype (CPCE), customized for supporting collective code inspections. This experiment demonstrates the concrete feasibility of the approach. 1.

40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} manufacturing environment and marketplace of today, {{the selection and}} evaluation of an appropriate manufacturing policy is a vital issue. However, {{this is a difficult}} task for decision-makers because manufacturing objectives are multiple, complex, conflict and often vague. This paper presents a methodology for a satisfaction assessment of multi-objective schedules with results from a scheduling simulator. In addition, a <b>general</b> <b>objective</b> structure appropriate for multi-objective manufacturing scheduling is also proposed for use in satisfaction assessment methodologies. The <b>general</b> <b>objective</b> structure is a hierarchical structure of the scheduling objective that consists of a goal, subgoal and criteria. The assessment methodology was based on a neural network and Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which is a common technique for multi-attribute decision-making problems. This paper extends TOPSIS by using fuzzy logic to deal with inaccurate and linguistic attributes in the <b>general</b> <b>objective</b> structure and a neural network for the weight calculation of inter-attribute importance. close 192...|$|R
