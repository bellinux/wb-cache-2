5|$|The stay of the {{division}} in this sector was marked by several serious encounters with the enemy, where considerable forces were engaged. There were furthermore almost nightly encounters between patrols or ambush parties, and the <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> of the artillery on both sides was very active.|$|E
5|$|Aside from a brief {{break in}} firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the , damaged by gunfire, New Jersey was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, {{supporting}} {{the movement of}} the U.S. X Corps. The pattern again was <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns. A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, pillboxes, bunkers, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.|$|E

50|$|Ion Vianu was one {{of those}} who signed Paul Goma's 1977 open letter that {{expressed}} solidarity with the Charter 77 movement in Czechoslovakia.

As a result he was interrogated by the Romanian's secret police, the Securitate, <b>harassed,</b> <b>fired</b> from his University job, and eventually allowed to emigrate to Switzerland. After settling down in Switzerland, he joined the “Geneva Initiative Against Political Psychiatry” and collaborated with Radio Free Europe, discussing attempts to use psychiatry as a form of repression.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy {{still had to}} fight through the {{numerous}} Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road. On {{the first night of}} the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces {{for the rest of the}} march, the cold weather, <b>harassing</b> <b>fire,</b> raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{were spotted}} advancing towards the brigade box and were bombarded by heavy artillery, which repulsed the attack. Around 09:00, more infantry attacked {{the box and}} came too close for artillery fire. Hand-to-hand fighting began and a British platoon was overrun before a tank-infantry counter-attack repulsed the German infantry and restored the position. The Germans resorted to <b>harassing</b> <b>fire,</b> sniping, mortar bombardments and heavy artillery fire. After a long artillery bombardment, simultaneous attacks by tanks and infantry were made at 19:00, {{from the north and}} south, which broke into the box and closed on the brigade headquarters, before being driven back around 22:30.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} from the lectures, the Canadian Corps staff {{officers}} produced a tactical analysis of the Verdun battles and delivered a series of corps and divisional-level lectures to promote the primacy of artillery and {{stress the importance of}} <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> and company and platoon flexibility. The report of 1st Canadian Division commander Arthur Currie highlighted the lessons he believed the Canadian Corps could learn from the experiences of the French. The final plan for the assault on Vimy Ridge drew heavily on the experience and tactical analysis of the officers who attended the Verdun lectures. British First Army commander General Henry Horne approved the plan on 5 March 1917.|$|E

Ambush patrols and listening posts left the perimeter of the base for their sentry positions in the surrounding jungle for the night. At about 20:30, men of an A Company listening post to the east of the perimeter, while moving into position, reported seeing and engaging three Viet Cong with unknown results. Collins placed the battalion on 75 percent alert and artillery <b>harassing</b> <b>fires</b> continued.|$|R

5000|$|The British Army soon {{realised}} that clumsy sweeps {{by large}} formations were unproductive. Instead, platoons or sections carried out patrols and laid ambushes, based on intelligence (from informers, surrendered MNLA personnel, aerial reconnaissance, etc.). A typical operation was [...] "Nassau", {{carried out in}} the Kuala Langat swamp (excerpt from the Marine Corps School in The Guerrilla - and how to Fight Him):After several assassinations, a British battalion was assigned to the area. Food control was achieved through a system of rationing, convoys, gate checks and searches. One company began operations in the swamp, about 21 December 1954. On 9 January 1955, full-scale tactical operations began; artillery, mortars and aircraft began <b>harassing</b> <b>fires</b> in the South Swamp. Originally, the plan was to bomb and shell the swamp day and night so that the terrorists would be driven out into ambushes; but the terrorists were well prepared to stay indefinitely. Food parties came out occasionally, but the civil population was too afraid to report them.Plans were modified; <b>harassing</b> <b>fires</b> were reduced to night-time only. Ambushes continued and patrolling inside the swamp was intensified. Operations of this nature continued for three months without results. Finally on 21 March, an ambush party, after forty-five hours of waiting, succeeded in killing two of eight terrorists. The first two red pins, signifying kills, appeared on the operations map, and local morale rose a little.Another month passed before it was learned that the terrorists were making a contact inside the swamp. One platoon established an ambush; one terrorist appeared and was killed. May passed without a contact. In June, a chance meeting by a patrol accounted for one killed and one captured. A few days later, after four fruitless days of patrolling, one platoon en route to camp accounted for two more terrorists. The No. 3 terrorist in the area surrendered and stated that food control was so effective that one terrorist had been murdered in a quarrel over food.On 7 July, two additional companies were assigned to the area; patrolling and <b>harassing</b> <b>fires</b> were intensified. Three terrorists surrendered and one of them led a platoon patrol to the terrorist leader's camp. The patrol attacked the camp, killing four, including the leader. Other patrols accounted for four more; by the end of July, twenty-three terrorists remained in the swamp with no food or communications with the outside world...This was the nature of operations: 60,000 artillery shells, 30,000 rounds of mortar ammunition, and 2,000 aircraft bombs for 35 terrorists killed or captured. Each one represented 1,500 man-days of patrolling or waiting in ambushes. [...] "Nassau" [...] was considered a success {{for the end of the}} emergency was one step nearer.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the earlier}} UN defeat at the Battle of Unsan, the US 25th Infantry Division {{expected}} to encounter heavy Chinese resistance during its advance. But the Chinese screening forces withdrew with the American advance. Aside from the <b>harassing</b> <b>fire,</b> the US 25th Infantry Division did not encounter strong resistance along the way. Ipsok was captured by Task Force Dolvin on November 24, and several American POWs from the Unsan battle were also recovered at the town. When Task Force Dolvin proceeded to capture a series of hills north of Ipsok on the next day, Chinese resistance started to stiffen. During the hill battles {{on the afternoon of}} November 25, the Eighth Army Ranger Company of Task Force Dolvin suffered heavy losses against the Chinese defenses, and the task force stopped its advance at dusk.|$|E
5|$|In late May, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion was {{deployed}} {{to support the}} defensive operations in the Chateau–Thierry Sector. During this time they were employed as a complete unit {{in order to provide}} concentrated fire support at key points along the Allied line. The 77th and 81st Companies were assigned to the right flank while the 15th and 23rd Companies were assigned to the left. Their job was to lay down covering and <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> during both defensive and offensive operations. They also assisted the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments in their respective drives through Belleau Wood. On 10 June, the battalion's commanding officer, Major Cole, was mortally wounded and command temporarily passed to Captain Harlan E. Major. Captain George H. Osterhout took over on 11 June; however, he remained in command only until 21 June, when Major Littleton Waller officially took over.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{sailed to}} the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more 17 August, {{returning}} to the Kansong area where for four days she provided <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> by night, and broke up counterattacks by day, inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops. She returned to this general area yet again 29 August, when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the Changjon area, with one of her own helicopters spotting the results: four buildings destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.|$|E
50|$|Phase One. The Americans began Operation Crazy Horse {{with heavy}} <b>harassing</b> {{artillery}} <b>fire</b> designed to disrupt a possible {{attack on the}} CIDG camp and {{to prepare for a}} helicopter landing.

5|$|The only {{portion of}} the Canadian assault that did not go as planned was the advance of the 4th Canadian Division, {{collapsing}} almost immediately after exiting their trenches. The commanding officer {{of one of the}} assaulting battalions requested that the artillery leave a portion of German trench undamaged. Machine-gun nests in the undamaged sections of the German line pinned down, wounded or killed much of the 4th Canadian Division's right flank. The progress on the left flank was eventually impeded by <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> from the Pimple that was made worse when the creeping barrage got too far ahead of the advancing troops. In view of the German defence, the 4th Canadian Division did not attempt a further frontal assault throughout the afternoon. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division came forward and once again attacked the German positions {{on the top of the}} ridge. Persistent attacks eventually forced the German troops holding the south-western portion of Hill145 to withdraw but only after they had run out of ammunition, mortar rounds and grenades.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, {{just before}} dawn, Spragg took {{command of the}} trench in the {{southern}} sector of No.3 Post, opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the post. He successfully deployed his men {{so that when the}} attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' small arms fire. But by 03:30 the post was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of the post. Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully {{to the north of the}} post. However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own small arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post, making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of the post. At 06:30 communications were re-established with No.3 Post by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who had to see to themselves.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, {{several small}} probing attacks {{were carried out}} against the Confederate defenses, {{essentially}} ignoring orders from Grant that no general engagement be provoked. On the Union left, C. F. Smith sent two of his four brigades (under Cols. Jacob Lauman and John Cook) to test the defenses along his front. The attack suffered light casualties and made no gains, but Smith {{was able to keep}} up a <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> throughout the night. On the right, McClernand also ordered an unauthorized attack. Two regiments of Col. William R. Morrison's brigade, along with one regiment, the 48th Illinois, from Col. W.H.L. Wallace's brigade, were ordered to seize a battery ("Redan Number 2") that had been plaguing their position. Isham N. Haynie, colonel of the 48th Illinois, was senior in rank to Colonel Morrison. Although rightfully in command of two of the three regiments, Morrison volunteered to turn over command once the attack was under way; however, when the attack began, Morrison was wounded, eliminating any leadership ambiguity. For unknown reasons Haynie never fully took control and the attack was repulsed. Some wounded men caught between the lines burned to death in grass fires ignited by the artillery.|$|E
50|$|Following her shakedown, Porterfield joined Task Force 53 (TF 53), getting {{underway}} 12 January 1944 and arriving off the Marshalls on the 31st.

5|$|The {{remainder}} {{of the day was}} relatively quiet for the Canadians, although they were subjected to periodic <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> from the Chinese. D Company received heavy machine-gun fire from Hill 865 to the west, in particular. Regardless, the Chinese made no further attempt to attack, and confined themselves to limited patrolling activities across the front. Later the Patricias, with American tanks in support, cleared the remaining Chinese from the northern slopes of Hill 677, while several concentrations of Chinese were again broken up by heavy artillery fire and airstrikes. The American battalion on the south-west flank of the Canadians was subsequently relieved by the Middlesex, following which the 5th US Cavalry Regiment launched an assault to recover Hill 504. The Chinese resisted until 16:00, before the 118th Division suddenly withdrew. American patrols north of the feature met no resistance, while the Americans were also able to patrol east along Route 17 to Chunchon without contact. By last light the situation had stabilised on the Kapyong Valley front. Having left their supplies of food and ammunition far behind during the advance two days earlier, the Chinese had been forced to withdraw back up the Kapyong Valley in the late afternoon of 25 April in order to regroup and replenish following the heavy casualties incurred during the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that they}} had only faced a series of probes the {{previous}} night, rather than a major attack, and as these actions {{may have been in}} preparation for a heavier attack, a vigorous defence was subsequently prepared by the Australians with the reserve companies moved into blocking positions to strengthen the forward defences. The defenders endured steady shelling and <b>harassing</b> <b>fire,</b> while after dark The Hook was probed again, this time by a group of about 20 Chinese. The force was subsequently engaged by an Australian standing patrol from D Company at 21:00 and forced to withdraw, leaving behind one dead at a cost of one Australian killed and one wounded. At 21:20 the Chinese fire became more intense, and a heavy blow was launched by the Chinese against the Marines on Hill 119 shortly after. Beginning at 21:30, elements of the 1st and 7th Marines were attacked by two Chinese companies. A heavy concentration by the entire US I Corps artillery was fired in response, and the Chinese were forced to withdraw. At 23:00 the Chinese shelling intensified to thirty-rounds per minute, and was followed fifteen minutes later by another determined charge by the Chinese infantry against the US Marines on the left flank on Hill 111 and Boulder City during a furious attack. The Australian positions were not directly attacked during the night, although C Company engaged the Chinese in no man's land sporadically at long range in support of the Americans. As on the previous night, 3 RAR was not attacked. In total more than 4,200 mortar and artillery rounds were fired by the Chinese at 2 RAR during the night, and three Australians were killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|Based at Nui Dat in the III Corps Tactical Zone {{as part of}} US II Field Force, Vietnam, 1 ATF {{included}} two infantry battalions plus armour, aviation, engineers and artillery support, with total Australian troop strength in Vietnam reaching 6,300 men. Logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group based {{at the port of}} Vung Tau. Meanwhile, People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units operating in the province in early-1967 included Main Forces from the 5th Division, which consisted of the 274th and 275th Regiments, each of three infantry battalions under the command of Senior Colonel Nguyen The Truyen. Supporting this force were a number of artillery, engineer, medical and logistic units. Group 89 (Artillery) was equipped with recoilless rifles, medium mortars and heavy machine-guns. Local Forces included D445 Battalion, a provincial unit normally operating in the south of the province and in Long Khanh, while guerrilla forces {{included two}} companies in the Chau Duc district, one in Long Dat and a platoon in Xuyen Moc; in total around 4,500 men. Australian intelligence assessed the division as capable of conducting a regimental-sized harassing raid against Nui Dat, {{while at the same time}} using its second regiment for ambushes, decoys or other supporting tasks. 274th Regiment was believed capable of inflicting heavy casualties on units up to a battalion, while 275th Regiment was assessed as only having the capability to attack isolated outposts or conduct limited ambushes and was unlikely to attempt a major attack without the support of 274th Regiment. Overall, it lacked the ability to conduct a protracted division-sized operation, although one regiment could likely reinforce the other within a period of eight hours. Yet even while the possibility of a divisional attack against Nui Dat was considered remote, the threat of raids up to regimental strength forced Graham to maintain a defensive posture. Yet lacking a third infantry battalion, 1 ATF's operational strength was limited. D445 Battalion was thought capable of mortaring, <b>harassing</b> <b>fire</b> and quick raids and was likely to be able to inflict heavy casualties on forces up to company size.|$|E
60|$|From one village, situate half a {{mile from}} the eastern gate of the city, so {{constant}} and <b>harassing</b> a <b>fire</b> was maintained, by the enemy, that General Primrose resolved to make a sortie, to capture it. The affair was, however, badly planned, and resulted in failure. The Afghans--sheltered in the strongly-built houses--kept up so severe a fire upon the assailants that these were obliged to fall back, with a considerable loss. After that, no further sorties were attempted; and the city remained in quiet, until the relieving columns were close at hand.|$|R
5000|$|Aston was {{watched by}} the police, who sent agents {{to her home}} and read her letters. Different cities in Germany collaborated in these efforts.

60|$|During the 22nd and 23rd {{the troops}} held the {{positions}} they had won, and the infantry {{were subjected to}} a <b>harassing</b> shell <b>fire</b> from the Boer guns, which, playing from either flank, searched the re-entrants in which the battalions sheltered, and which, though they did not cause a greater loss than forty men on the 22nd and twenty-five on the 23rd, nevertheless made their position extremely uncomfortable. It was quite evident that the troops could not be fairly required to endure this bombardment, against {{which there was no}} protection, indefinitely. Nor was any good object, but rather the contrary, to be gained by waiting.|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of the attacking Zulu force swept around to attack the north wall, while a few took cover and were either pinned down by continuing British fire or retreated to the terraces of Oscarberg.

50|$|This sinking {{resulted}} in a concerted response {{on the part of}} the Soviets. M-103 made the kill; dropping a pattern of depth charges which opened a large hole in the U-boat's pressure hull. Only six men escaped the submarine, forty-six others did not; the U-boat sank in the relatively shallow depth of 27 m. It was decided to raise U-250, despite her proximity to the German-held shore. <b>Harassing</b> artillery <b>fire</b> was met with a constant smokescreen while divers worked.

In May the 2RMF received many of the personnel from the disbanded 9RMF, bringing it up to strength for the summer campaign. The first noteworthy operation was the Liévin raid on 25 June into which much preparation had been put, a VC. being awarded to Lieutenant Arthur Batten-Pooll, though losses were heavy with 5 officers and 60 other ranks (2 and 12 resp. killed).|$|R
