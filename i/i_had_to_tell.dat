At first we had been giving out relief at such a rate that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the chairman that he was providing the smelter men with more than they had had while at work. Then he cut down the rations until the wives of the smelter men began to complain {{that they were not}} getting enough to eat. Years later, when his letters were published in The Pinkerton Labor Spy, I discovered that the chairman of the relief committe (sic) was a Pinkerton detective, who was carrying out the instructions of the agency...|$|E

This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs?

500|$|... "Fire Water Burn" [...] {{played a}} major role in the slow build of {{interest}} that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. Because the band could not afford financially solvent national tours, they promoted themselves by sending their music to alternative rock-based radio stations across the country. Eventually, an intern brought the band to the attention of the music director of 107.7 The End in Seattle. The director, liking what he heard, played [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] on his Friday night show. After airing, the station was flooded with phone calls asking about the song and the band and the director passed the song onto the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. This snowball effect eventually overwhelmed the band with demands for their new record. After hearing of the underground success One Fierce Beer Coaster was receiving, many record labels began courting the band. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna's label Maverick [...] "really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even to the point where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Madonna that I couldnâ€™t put her on the phone with Jimmy Pop." [...] The band eventually signed a record deal with Geffen Records.|$|E

The single was scheduled for release in Germany in a basic and premium format on December 14, 2007, but a release date was never officially announced. While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for me because it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, for me because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth and the truth is, I feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write from my heart and be genuine, because I think that's what people loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting on August 3, 1948, during further HUAC hearings, Bentley {{received}} corroboration from Whittaker Chambers, who, under subpoena by HUAC, {{testified that}} he knew at lest two of Bentley contacts, Victor Perlo and Charles Kramer as communists and members of his earlier Ware Group. He also supported her charge that Harry Dexter White, a prominent economist who {{had worked in the}} Treasury Department, was a Communist sympathizer. [...] Of his testimony compared to hers, Chambers wrote in his memoir: [...] I knew that I was simply back-stopping Miss Bentley, that hers was the current testimony. [...] The things that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> were ten years old and I had only to let the shadows, dust and cobwebs conspicuously drape them to leave the stand unscathed.|$|E
2500|$|According to James Gunn, one of Wells's major {{contributions}} to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his [...] "new system of ideas". In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as [...] "the plausible impossible" [...] and [...] "suspension of disbelief". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived {{the idea of using}} a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term [...] "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle. He explained that while writing The Time Machine, he realized that [...] "the more impossible the story <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the Time Traveller were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts." [...] In [...] "Wells's Law", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the [...] "law" [...] appears in his introduction to The Scientific Romances of H.G. Wells (1933), ...|$|E
