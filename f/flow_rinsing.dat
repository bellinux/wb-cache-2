40|$|In {{the last}} fifty years the {{electronics}} industry experienced substantial growth. During this period of growth technologies for manufacturing printed circuit boards, the heart of most electronics, have evolved continually. These improvements include many environmentally conscious innovations within the manufacturing process. <b>Flowing</b> <b>rinse</b> systems are {{an essential part of the}} manufacturing process. These <b>flowing</b> <b>rinse</b> baths utilize a very large amount of water. Environmental benefits and economic gain can sometimes be achieved through recycling the <b>flowing</b> <b>rinse</b> effluent for reuse. Ion exchange is a conventional water treatment technology that is well suited to the application of recycling <b>flowing</b> <b>rinse</b> water from circuit manufacturing processes. This is due to the dilute nature of the solutions as well as the high proportion of ionic constituents that must be removed. Specifically, ion exchange demineralisation holds the capacity to treat <b>flowing</b> <b>rinse</b> water to a high purity allowing optimal rinsing efficiency and continual reuse of the same water. Experiments were undertaken, using a variety of ion exchange demineralisation setups and materials to prove that this technology will work for a specific application at an Ottawa circuit board manufacturer. A series of experimental runs were performed leading to the conclusion that ion exchange demineralisation is effective for the recycling of this manufacturer's <b>flowing</b> <b>rinse</b> wastewater. The Serfilco MBD- 10 mixed bed resin showed the best performance although, being a mixed bed resin, it is not readily regenerated leading to a high operating cost of approximately $ 8. 65 /m 3 of water treated. It is expected that a two-bed system with the same type of resins (strong acid and strong base) would have the capability of treating the same water to an acceptable level at a much lower cost and this type of set-up is recommended for future work. It was demonstrated that chelating strong acid resins such as the ones used in some of the experiments are not effective for demineralisation...|$|R
40|$|Cleaning of {{surfaces}} and submicron deep trenches {{is a tremendous}} challenge in semiconductor manufacturing. In this work, the rinsing of blanket and patterned wafers using pulsating flow are studied using physical numerical modeling. Preliminary results on blanket wafers cleaning process show good agreement with numerical and experimental results of literatures. Preliminary results for blanket and patterned wafers show that oscillating <b>flow</b> <b>rinse</b> is more efficient than steady <b>flow</b> <b>rinse,</b> and the optimum frequency of the oscillating flow {{is a function of}} the size of the trench. Introduction Microcontamination is responsible for most of the yield loss in volume manufactured VLSI ICs [1]. Traditionally, wafer-cleaning efforts have been focused on blanket wafer. However, chemical and particulate contamination naturally occurs over patterned wafers as well. For example, ion implantation, Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), wet chemical cleaning all leave metal and/or chemical contaminant on pat [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSorption-enhanced water-gas shift (SEWGS) is a {{technology}} for pre-combustion CO 2 capture, {{which can be}} integrated in an IGCC plant. A computer model is used to simulate the SEWGS unit, using a counter-current steam rinse cycle with one equalization step. The sensitivity of the CO 2 recovery and {{the purity of the}} CO 2 stream with respect to the feed <b>flow</b> rate, <b>rinse</b> <b>flow</b> rate, purge flow rate and cycle time has been investigated at an initial operating point. One at a time variations show that the CO 2 recovery increases with increasing purge flow rate and decreases with increasing feed flow rate, cycle time and <b>rinse</b> <b>flow,</b> in order of decreasing sensitivity. The CO 2 purity is much less sensitive to changes of these conditions, unless either the <b>rinse</b> <b>flow</b> rate or the cycle time drop below certain values, which are determined by the ratio of the pressures {{at the end of the}} rinse and equalization steps. The optimum <b>rinse</b> <b>flow,</b> purge flow and cycle time have been determined with respect to the efficiency penalty due to the rinse and purge steam requirements, with a CO 2 recovery of 90 % and a dry CO 2 purity of 98 % as constraints, for a given feed flow rate, feed flow composition, operating pressure, reactor sizing and configuration. Minimum steam-to-carbon ratios are 0. 55 for the rinse and 1. 3 for the purge gas...|$|R

40|$|One of life’s {{immutable}} laws, sometimes {{known as}} Murphy’s law of dirt, is that, {{to make something}} clean, something else must become dirty. Thus now, when more than ever before, our manufacturing and process industries are striving to achieve total cleanliness and purity of products and components, we are also making more dirty waste products than ever before. Further, to make something very clean, the cleaning agent must also be very clean. Water is an excellent cleaning agent because it is easily purified, has numerous other advantages including extremely low toxicity and widespread abundance. Hence water is now used in massive quantities {{for the removal of}} dirt from almost everything we wish to make clean. Not surprisingly the cost of supplying clean water and then removing and treating dirty water is escalating in many countries at a rate well above that of inflation. This paper presents a simple theoretical framework for typical industrial cleaning processes, and deals in particular with what is often the most wasteful aspect of cleaning, i. e. rinsing. Simple mathematical tools are presented which show how to manage key process parameters such as counter <b>flow,</b> <b>rinse</b> rate. Case studies demonstrating the cost and environmental benefits of a cleaner production approach to product cleaning are provided, showing the advantages that improvements to cleaning processes can bring to both the environment and the economy...|$|R
40|$|The Minnesota Technical Assistance Program (MnTAP) and the U. S. EPA {{began this}} program to assess waste {{reduction}} achievable for rinses on two processes at Micom, Inc., {{a printed circuit}} board manufacturer. Baseline measurements for wastewater volume and copper concentration, the waste parameters of interest, were taken along with measurements for drag out and rinsing effectiveness. Candidate rinsing modifications include: slowing the rate of withdrawal, increasing the drain time, reducing the <b>rinse</b> <b>flow</b> with restrictors, and controlling the <b>rinse</b> <b>flow</b> with conductivity meters. The most promising modifications will be implemented. Follow-up sampling will be performed to evaluate the effect of rinsing modifications on wastewater volume and copper concentrations.

The Scoping Audit and the Water Economy Assessment results were determined using empirically derived models while the Mass Balancing and the True Cost of Waste results were obtained through more detailed calculations. The results of the audit showed that the three most important areas for waste minimisation were water usage, effluent from rinse water waste streams and nickel consumption. Water usage has the highest waste minimisation potential followed by nickel. Dragged-out process chemicals and rinse water consumption contribute to ranking the effluent stream the most important waste minimisation opportunity identified by the True Cost of Waste Analysis. Potential financial savings were roughly estimated to be in the order of R 19949 and R 126603 for water and nickel respectively. Intervention using only "low cost-no-cost" waste minimisation measures was recommended as a first step before contemplating further focus areas or technical or economical feasibility...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} the integration of impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) into one surface analytic device. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flow cell is created, matching the dimensions of a commercially available sensor chip used for SPR measurements.

After a successful integration, a proof of principle {{study was conducted to}} investigate any signs of interference between the two systems during a measurement. The <b>flow</b> cell was <b>rinsed</b> with 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 × PBS buffer in an alternating manner, while impedance and shifts of the resonance angle were monitored.

40|$|Disposition of {{plutonium}} recovered from nuclear weapons or production residues must {{be stored in}} a manner that ensures safety. The criteria that has been established to assure the safety of stored materials for a minimum of 50 years is DOE-STD- 3013. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has designed a containment package in accordance with the DOE standard. The package consists of an optional convenience (food pack) can, a welded type 304 L stainless steel inner (primary) can, and a welded type 304 L stainless steel outer (secondary) can. With or without the food pack can, the material is placed inside the primary can and welded shut under a helium atmosphere. This activity takes place totally within the confinement of the glove box line. Following the welding process, the can is checked for leaks and then sent down the line for decontamination. Once decontaminated, the sealed primary can may be removed from the glove box line. Welding of the secondary container takes place outside the glove box line. The highly automated decontamination process that has been developed to support the packaging of Special Nuclear Materials is based on an electrolytic process similar to the wide spread industrial technique of electropolishing. The can is placed within a specially designed stainless steel fixture built within a partition of a glove box. This fixture is then filled with a flowing electrolyte solution. A low DC electric current is made to flow between the can, acting as the anode, and the fixture, acting as the cathode. Following the decontamination, the system provides a <b>flow</b> of <b>rinse</b> water through the fixture to rinse the can of remaining salt residues. The system then carried out a drying cycle. Finally, the fixture is opened from {{the opposite side of the}} partition and the can surface monitored directly and through surface smears to assure that decontamination is adequate...|$|R
40|$|Carbon felt is a {{potential}} material for electrochemical reduction of chromates. Very dilute solutions may be efficiently treated due to its large specific surface area and high porosity. In this work, the up-scaling of this technology is investigated using {{a new type of}} separated cell and once-through <b>flow</b> of industrial <b>rinse</b> water. A significant enhancement of the process is obtained due to copper deposition during long-term operation. The co-deposition and re-solution of copper occurs depending on the inlet chromate concentration. When previously deposited copper is present a current-free reduction of chromate takes place resulting in current efficiencies apparently above 100 %. Very high space time yields are obtained even for effluents at low concentration and optimised conditions (high flow rates and pH 2). The economic feasibility of the technology is also considered. Continuous, single-pass operation results in lower energy requirements than batch processing. The economic potential of the process is also evaluated in comparison with chemical detoxification of chromate. The operating costs for the electrochemical treatment of very dilute effluents on a carbon felt electrode are 30 % lower than for the chemical method...|$|R
40|$|For {{the vapor}} {{phase of the}} WVN process the 160 to 190 {sup 0 }F {{temperature}} limit is shown to be well within the 145 to 208 {sup 0 }F minimum/maximum range. Decreasing process time by expansion of the temperature range {{is not expected to}} aid processing. The most productive area for improvement would be an increase in the water vapor concentration above the present 5 % level. However, this would require confirmatory testing before approved use. The rinsing process was shown to be mainly controlled by component crevice geometry. Improvements in rinse time may be made by increasing the water temperature, but the concern over the caustic stress corrosion cracking will tend to limit the available increase. Although directed jets or sprays of <b>rinse</b> <b>flows</b> was not recommended, methods were suggested for conserving rinse water. Drying (as well as heating and cooling) of components was again shown to be constrained mostly by individual geometry and not processing parameters. A gas only, vacuum only, or {{a combination of the two}} modes were shown to be generally accepted methods. The hot gas only mode was recommended for its simplicity...|$|R
30|$|The {{chromatin}} fiber labeled with either biotin or digoxigenin {{at the two}} ends {{was attached to the}} modified magnetic tweezers. To avoid non-specific binding of {{chromatin fiber}}s to the surface and magnetic beads, the flow cell requires passivation by incubating with PBS passivation buffer (10  mg/mL BSA, 1  mmol/L EDTA, 10  mmol/L PB, 10  mg/mL Pluronic F 127 surfactant (Sigma-Aldrich), 3  mmol/L NaN 3, pH 7.8) for 2  h (Fulconis et al. 2006; Koster et al. 2005). To tether the chromatin fiber to the surface of super paramagnetic beads (M 280 Invitrogen Norway), the diluted chromatin fiber solution (~ 10  pmol/L) was first mixed with M 280 beads for 30  min at room temperature on the Hula Mixer (ThermoFisher) at 1 turns/min. Secondly, passivation buffer in the <b>flow</b> cell was <b>rinsed</b> by HE buffer (10  mmol/L HEPES, 1  mmol/L EDTA) using a pump (500  μl/min). Thirdly, the mixture of chromatin fibers and magnetic beads was incubated in the flow cell for 10  min to anchor {{the other end of the}} chromatin fiber to the surface of the functionalized coverslip. At last, the unbound beads and chromatin fibers in the flow cell were subsequently washed out with 500  μl HE buffer.|$|R
40|$|Adhesion to host tissues is an {{initiating}} step in {{a majority}} of bacterial infections. In the case of Gram-negative bacteria this adhesion is often mediated by a specific interaction between an adhesin, positioned at the distal end of bacterial pili, and its receptor {{on the surface of}} the host tissue. Furthermore, the rod of the pilus, and particularly its biomechanical properties, is believed to be crucial for the ability of bacteria to withstand external forces caused by, for example, (in the case of urinary tract infections) urinary <b>rinsing</b> <b>flows</b> by redistributing the force to several pili. In this work, the adhesion properties of P-piliated E. coli and their dependence of pH have been investigated in a broad pH range by both the surface plasmon resonance technique and force measuring optical tweezers. We demonstrate that P piliated bacteria have an adhesion ability throughout the entire physiologically relevant pH range (pH 4. 5 - 8). We also show that pH has a higher impact on the binding rate than on the binding stability or the biomechanical properties of pili; the binding rate was found to have a maximum around pH 5 while the binding stability was found to have a broader distribution over pH and be significant over the entire physiologically relevant pH range. Force measurements on a single organelle level show that the biomechanical properties of P pili are not significantly affected by pH...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{determine}} if unstimulated saliva flow (measured in μl min− 1) is affected by different durations of sample collection and by temperatures of mouthrinse water used before sample collection. In randomized order, participants provided 10 samples of unstimulated saliva at time points ranging from 1 to 6 min after rinsing with different temperatures of water (10, 20, and 30 °C). Data were analysed by one-way anova with post-hoc tests. Test–retest reliability was assessed using Bland–Altman plots and correlation coefficients. A larger volume of saliva was obtained over a longer collection time. No significant difference in saliva flow rate was observed between collection times [mean: 364 (95 % CI: 332 – 397) μl min− 1]. Although rinsing with different temperatures of mouthrinse water resulted in no significant difference in saliva flow rates {{as a result of the}} mouthrinse water temperatures, 60 % of the participants had a higher saliva <b>flow</b> rate after <b>rinsing</b> with mouthrinse water at a temperature of 10 °C compared with mouthrinse water at 20 and 30 °C, suggesting large individual variation (range: 24 – 420 μl min− 1). These findings provide justification for using saliva collection times of 1 – 6 min during sampling of unstimulated saliva. The large individual variations in saliva flow rate in response to different mouthrinse water temperatures suggest that standardization, control, and reporting of mouthrinse water temperature is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Background. Significant {{increases}} in intracranial pressure (ICP) may occur during neuroendoscopic procedures. To detect and prevent serious and sustained increases, ICP should be monitored. At present, controversy {{exists on the}} optimal location of the monitoring sensor. Therefore, we conducted an in vitro study to estimate the pressure gradients between the ventricle, the 'gold standard' site, and the rinsing inlet and outlet. Methods. A head model and a standard endoscope were used. Rinsing was enforced by using a pressurized infusion bag. Using clinically relevant flow rates, pressure was measured at the rinsing inlet and outlet, in the ventricle, and at the distal end of the rinsing channel using a tip sensor or a capillary tube. Results. At a flow of 61 ml min(- 1), the steady-state pressures measured at the rinsing inlet, in the ventricle, and at the rinsing outlet were 38, 26, and 12 mm Hg, respectively. At 135 ml min(- 1), these increased to 136, 89, and 42 mm Hg. Transendoscopic pressure measurements were always within 1 mm Hg of the ventricular pressure. Conclusions. During endoscopy, measurements at the rinsing inlet overestimated the ventricular pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg during heavy rinsing, whereas measurements at the rinsing outlet underestimated the pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg. An electronic tip sensor or a pressure capillary tube placed at the distal end of the lumen of the rinsing channel of the endoscope did not interfere with <b>rinsing</b> <b>flow</b> and produced measurements that were equal to ventricular pressures...|$|R
40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} often initiate their colonization by use {{of extended}} attachment organelles, so called pili. When exposed to force, the rod of helix-like pili {{has been found to}} be highly extendable, mainly attributed to uncoiling and recoiling of its quaternary structure. This provides the bacteria with the ability to redistribute an external force among a multitude of pili, which enables them to withstand strong <b>rinsing</b> <b>flows,</b> which, in turn, facilitates adherence and colonization processes critical to virulence. Thus, pili fibers are possible targets for novel antibacterial agents. By use of a substance that compromises compliance of the pili, the ability of bacteria to redistribute external forces can be impaired, so they will no longer be able to resist strong urine flow and thus be removed from the host. It is possible such a substance can serve as an alternative to existing antibiotics in the future or be a part of a multi-drug. In this work we investigated whether it is possible to achieve this by targeting the recoiling process. The test substance was purified PapD. The effect of PapD on the compliance of P pili was assessed at the single organelle level {{by use of}} force-measuring optical tweezers. We showed that the recoiling process, and thus the biomechanical compliance, in particular the recoiling process, can be impaired by the presence of PapD. This leads to a new concept in the search for novel drug candidates combating uropathogenic bacterial infections-"coilicides", targeting the subunits of which the pilus rod is composed...|$|R
