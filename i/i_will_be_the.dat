Davis won the election, with Cox subsequently alleging that nepotism was to blame for his loss. After winning the race, Davis told The Morehead News, [...] "My words can never express the appreciation but I promise {{to each and every}} one that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> very best working clerk that I can be and will be a good steward of their tax dollars and follow the statutes of this office to the letter." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1395 the Turks {{attacked}} Wallachia {{to punish}} its ruler, Mircea I, for his incursions into their territory. Three Serbian vassals fought on the Ottoman side: King Marko, Lord Konstantin Dragaš, and Despot Stefan Lazarević (son and heir of Prince Lazar). The Battle of Rovine, on 17May 1395, was {{won by the}} Wallachians; Marko and Dragaš were killed. After their deaths the Turks annexed their lands, combining them into an Ottoman province centred in Kyustendil. Thirty-six years after the Battle of Rovine, Konstantin the Philosopher wrote the Biography of Despot Stefan Lazarević and recorded what Marko said to Dragaš {{on the eve of}} the battle: [...] "I pray the Lord to help the Christians, no matter if <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first to die in this war." ...|$|E
500|$|He did {{not forget}} his {{children}} left in Brazil. He wrote poignant letters {{to each of}} them, conveying how greatly he missed them and repeatedly asking them to seriously attend to their educations. Shortly before his abdication, Pedro had told his son and successor: [...] "I intend that my brother Miguel and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last badly educated of the Braganza family". Charles Napier, a naval commander who fought under Pedro's banner in the 1830s, remarked that [...] "his good qualities were his own; his bad owing to want of education; and no man was more sensible of that defect than himself." [...] His letters to PedroII were often couched in language beyond the boy's reading level, and historians have assumed such passages were chiefly intended as advice that the young monarch might eventually consult upon reaching adulthood.|$|E

500|$|While Bush {{endorsed}} the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, {{he declined to}} endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump {{and he did not}} attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which formally nominated Trump. On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, [...] "I'm worried that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last Republican president." [...] Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson for the Bush family, instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank. After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory. Both he and Laura attended Trump's inauguration, and images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme.|$|E

2500|$|The {{filming of}} Lizzy Borden's movie Forced Entry, which {{included}} several simulated rapes, {{was covered in}} the PBS Frontline documentary American Porn which aired on February 7, 2002; the makers of the documentary were repulsed and walked off the set. Zicari was interviewed in the documentary; he defended the company's content and challenged Attorney General John Ashcroft {{to take action against}} him. Zicari stated in an interview for the program, [...] "We've got tons of stuff they technically could arrest us for. I'm not out there saying I want to be the test case. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> test case. I would welcome that. I would welcome the publicity. I would welcome everything, to make a point in, I guess, our society".

[...] Larry King, who is Jewish, replied, [...] "When you say—when you say something like that, you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are—" [...] Brando interrupted: [...] "No, no, because <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews'." ...|$|E

[...] The campaign received another boost when former New Jersey senator and 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley endorsed Obama on January 6. At the Democratic debate at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on January 5, Obama, Clinton, and Edwards all battled over who best exemplified the buzzword of the campaign, [...] "change". In one key exchange, Clinton said, clearly targeting Obama's rhetorical prowess, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. ... We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] Obama replied that [...] "The truth is, actually, words do inspire. Words do help people get involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duterte's {{constant}} cursing had {{local officials}} {{worried that the}} Philippines would lose foreign aid from the United States and European Union.

We have a problem here trying to preserve our society" [...] he said. [...] The President continued that he would “be the first to go hungry. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first one to die of hunger". [...] Local actress Agot Isidro responded in Tagalog [...] "First of all, no one's trying to fight you. As a matter of fact, you're the one who's picking a fight. Secondly, the country where you are elected as President by 16 million out of 100+ million is Third World. You talk as if the Philippines is a superpower. Excuse me, we don't want to go hungry. If you want, you do it yourself. Leave us out of it. So many people have nothing to eat, and yet you'll starve us even further". Her sentiments were echoed by Senator Panfilo Lacson adding that [...] "if the economy worsen, the entire Filipino people will be affected, they will go hungry as well".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2004, Gaahl again {{received}} a prison sentence, for aggravated assault. He appealed for a reduced sentence, and in February 2005 he was re-sentenced to fourteen {{months in prison}} and ordered to pay the victim 190,000 NOK (about 30,400 US$) in compensation. The incident happened in February 2002 during a late-night party at Gaahl's house in Espedal, when he became involved in a confrontation {{with a man who}} arrived at his house. Gaahl was accused of severely beating the man, collecting his blood into a cup and threatening to make him drink it. Gaahl said [...] "I {{was the one who was}} attacked, but they think I punished him too hard. As I always say, when people cross my line and I let them know where the line is many steps before they cross it, and still they choose to cross it, then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one to decide what their punishment will be". He also claimed to have given the man the cup [...] "so that he would not make such a mess in my house with all the blood". In March 2006, Gaahl recorded vocals for Gorgoroth's next album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam. According to band members, he was in prison from April to December 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The St. Eugene Mission {{had a large}} {{garden that}} {{provided}} fresh produce for {{the residents of the}} mission and the local miners who were prospecting nearby at Wild Horse and Perry Creeks. There were few white settlers in the area and many had left because they had concerns that the local Kootenai First Nations were going to revolt. Their concerns dated back a few years earlier to 1884 when two Kootenai men had been arrested and charged with murdering two white men. Upon learning that there was no evidence to support the charges, Chief Isador led a band of thirty warriors to Wild Horse Creek and broke the two suspects out of the gaol. When confronted, Chief Isador had defended the action with this statement, [...] "If it can be found that these men are guilty, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first to punish and deliver them. How many Indians have been found killed and white men not arrested?". The Chief then ordered that the judge, the arresting officer and the land surveyor leave the area within twenty-four hours. When Coccola arrived in 1887, the settlers had petitioned the government for protection and North-West Mounted Police (later the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) were established at Galbraith's Ferry, later known as Fort Steele, which was seven miles (11km) from the St. Eugene Mission.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "End of Time" [...] is a {{declaration}} of co-dependence; Knowles professes her everlasting love to her romantic interest. As stated by Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic, [...] "At the start, she's stricken by her own emotional vulnerability; by the end, she's empowered by it." [...] The song opens with [...] "spitfire drums" [...] while Knowles sings in an almost distorted fashion, with her vocals layered underneath until a [...] "dramatic explosion". As her vocals continue to build up, Knowles airily chants: [...] "Come take my hand / I won’t let you go / I’ll be your friend / I will love you so deeply / <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one to kiss you at night / I will love you {{till the end of}} time." [...] She continues her appeal as she sings to her love interest, [...] "Take you away from here / There's nothing between us but space and time". On the bridge, Knowles belts her vocal lines over a shooting horn sequence; with her multiple-layered vocals, she commands, [...] "Boy come to me", and towards the end, she repeatedly sings, [...] "Say you’ll never let me go". Knowles [...] "finds the strength in two" [...] as she affirms to her romantic interest, [...] "I just wanna be with you / I just wanna live for you / I'd never let you go!".|$|E
