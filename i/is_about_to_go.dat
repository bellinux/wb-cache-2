500|$|The Enterprise brings {{aboard the}} Betazoid Federation {{emissary}} Tam Elbrun (Harry Groener), and takes {{him to a}} distant star system. Elbrun, whom Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) previously knew {{when he was a}} mental patient, has a history of mental instability due to his overpoweringly strong telepathic capabilities, but his unique skills are used for first contact situations with alien life. On this particular mission, Elbrun's abilities are needed to try to coax a giant sentient spaceship, code named [...] "Tin Man," [...] away from a star that <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> supernova. It also comes to light that the star is in a Romulan-claimed area of space, and that this is a race to claim the ship. [...] Elbrun finds it impossible to filter out the thoughts of the Enterprise crew, but finds solace in meeting Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), who Elbrun is initially puzzled by finding what he calls 'absence of mind'; he finds relief in developing a friendship with Data, who, being an artificial lifeform, has no organic mind to be read.|$|E
500|$|Breeds {{received}} a Logie Award nomination for [...] "Most Popular New Female Talent" [...] at the 51st Logie Awards for her portrayal of Ruby. She was later {{nominated for the}} [...] "Most Popular Actress" [...] Logie in 2010, with Breeds stating: [...] "To know that people like Ruby makes me think I'm doing a good job." [...] At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards, Breeds was nominated for [...] "Best Daytime Star". Holy Soap recall Ruby's most memorable moment as being: [...] "Trying to cope with her Dad's illness, Ruby started talking to someone on Skype, {{only to find out}} it was Matthew playing a trick. She got revenge by convincing him to go skinny-dipping and nicking his clothes." [...] Carolyn Stewart writing for TV Week felt it was unrealistic for Ruby and Nicole to be best friends after she has [...] "actively pursued two of Nicole's ex-boyfriends." [...] She criticised Bianca's role in Ruby and Liam's storyline, quipping [...] "Bianca-The-Butt-In-Ski" [...] offered [...] "her two cents worth" [...] – subsequently calling her efforts unhelpful to Ruby. She also discussed Ruby's sudden descent into drink and wearing make up; [...] "Obviously heavy make-up is a clue that a character <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> off the rails… and, boy did she!" [...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never {{fall in love with a}} teacher and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face". Stewart later said [...] "The way Ruby stares at Liam... oh, I'm just so embarrassed for the poor little petal! Hilarious!" [...] She also criticised Nicole's bad advice. She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy". Catrin Griffiths writing for the Daily Express said the serial came back in style after its summer break in the UK, owing to storylines such as Ruby's binge drinking.|$|E

Do the math: the other option is more chaotic, given that those expected to fill the vacuum are al-Qaeda and the Salafist organizations. It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with whom do you talk and who do you hold accountable?" [...] Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that [...] "I always thought {{that it might be}} the case {{that at the end of}} the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper hand. And I think that this is possible and I thought that this is possible already a long time ago. [...] might not just survive but even regain territories."
