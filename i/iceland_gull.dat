25|$|White-winged gull {{is used to}} {{describe}} the four pale-winged, high Arctic-breeding taxa within the former group; these are <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull,</b> glaucous gull, Thayer's gull, and Kumlien's gull.|$|E
50|$|The American taxon Kumlien's gull {{is often}} {{considered}} a subspecies, L. g. kumlieni, of <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull.</b> The taxon Thayer's gull {{is considered a}} subspecies, L. g. thayeri, of <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> by the American Ornithological Society as of 2017.|$|E
50|$|It has variably been {{considered}} a full species, a subspecies of Thayer's gull, a subspecies of <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull,</b> and a hybrid between the aforementioned species. It is currently considered a subspecies of <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> by the American Ornithologists' Union.|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is known}} for its wintering wildfowl. Amongst the most recorded are tufted duck, goldeneye, goosander and common teal. Other, less common sightings included the lesser scaup, the ring-necked duck, the Slavonian grebe, the black-necked grebe, the long-tailed duck, the Leach's petrel and the European honey buzzard. Due to a nearby landfill site, the reservoir also plays host to a large gull population including yellow-legged <b>gulls,</b> Caspian <b>gulls,</b> <b>Iceland</b> <b>gulls</b> and Kumlien's gulls.|$|R

40|$|As one {{observer}} (DH) noted, {{this was a}} 2 ̆ 2 weird 2 ̆ 2 winter. January and February were more like March, producing winter reports of species with few such previous reports; the species involved come {{from all parts of}} the taxonomic list, from loons to icterids. Almost certainly, a first (in recorded history) was a slam of all the Nebraska grebe species in January, even Red-necked and Clark 2 ̆ 7 s! Also in January, a Pacific Loon was reported. As shown in the species 2 ̆ 7 accounts below, the list of rare midwinter species is long. Another significant, related finding involved early-arriving spring migrants, also a long list. In some cases it cannot be determined whether these were wintering nearby or indeed were very early migrants. The February weather certainly was conducive to early arrival of “opportunist-type 2 ̆ 2 migrants, such as waterfowl and blackbirds. Rarities were not earth shattering, but a nice list nevertheless. Included were an 2 ̆ 2 Eastern 2 ̆ 2 Brant, Black Scoter, Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneye, a Merlin of the blackish subspecies Falco columbarius suckleyi, three Mew <b>Gulls,</b> two <b>Iceland</b> <b>Gulls,</b> and a Black-throated Sparrow...|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} by some that the Kumlien's {{race of the}} <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> may be a hybrid population between <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> and Thayer's gull. No pure Thayer's gulls are known to occur {{within the range of}} Kumlien's although many Kumlien's within their range are almost indistinguishable from Thayer's gull, while others look like pure Iceland gulls with a range of variation in between.|$|E
50|$|There is {{continuing}} {{debate about the}} taxonomic status of this species, and some authorities consider Thayer's gull to be the dark-mantled form of <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull,</b> with Kumlien's gull (variously treated as a subspecies of either Thayer's or Iceland gulls) as an intermediate example, forming a cline rather than separate species. The American Ornithologists' Union considered Thayer's gull a subspecies of American herring gull from 1917 until 1973, when they determined it was a separate species from herring gull. After numerous papers had been written suggesting downgrading this species to a subspecies or even a morph of <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull,</b> the American Ornithologists' Union invalidated the Thayer's gull as a full species in the 2017 annual supplement to the American Ornithologists' Union checklist. Thayer's gull is now considered a subspecies of <b>Iceland</b> <b>Gull.</b> The verdict was based on geographic location of breeding populations rather than objective genetic evidence, and thus the lump was received negatively by some. It is possible that proposals to resplit Thayer's gull and <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> will be submitted to the American Ornithologists' Union in the future. The British Ornithologists' Union follows the publication Birds of North America in lumping the three (thayeri, kumlieni, and glaucoides) as forms of <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull.</b>|$|E

40|$|FALL 1991 OCCURRENCE REPORT During {{the period}} from 1 July to 31 December 1991, 292 species plus a {{probable}} escape were recorded in the state. This compares with 284 species {{for the same period}} in 1990, 291 species in 1989, 282 species in 1988, 296 in 1987, and 293 in 1986. Tables are arranged in a west-to-east fashion, following major river valleys where possible. The whooping crane and Christmas Count reports, found in other parts of this issue, are not included in this report. Weather in this period was noteworthy. Most reporters noted a significant drop in bird populations after the late October ice and snow storm. A comment from Father Thomas Hoffman typifies those made by NOD reporters: 2 ̆ 2 After the Halloween ice/snow storm, Great Blue Herons, Robins, Goldfinches, all sparrows except Juncos and an occasional Tree Sparrow simply disappeared. House and Purple Finches never appeared. A second ice storm in NW Saunders County wreaked havoc on trees the day after Thanksgiving. In spite of the generally very warm January and February, winter birding has been miserable at Wolf Lake. 2 ̆ 2 Countering this trend was the influx of northern gulls and seabirds. The Pomarine Jaeger in Lancaster County was most noteworthy, but Glaucous and <b>Iceland</b> <b>Gulls</b> also appeared. Early in January a Lesser Black-backed Gull was reported in Lancaster County. The Keith County December records of gulls, scoters, and Oldsquaw are also quite exciting...|$|R
40|$|B IRD-BANDING {{is carried}} out only to a limited extent in the Arctic today, {{although}} information on birds there is probably more urgently needed than elsew’here for ‘both economic and scientific reasons. Many arctic birds make m’ore extensive migrations and cover longer distances than is usual among boreal birds; these migrations can be studied in detail only by banding. Before the Greenland bird-banding programme was started, no regular banding system was in operation {{in any part of}} the Arctic. The banding of a few sea birds, particularly kittiwakes (Rissa tridactylx), common murres (Uria aalge), and herring gulls (Larus argentatus), had been carried out by the Russians on the coast of Pol’uostrov Kol’skiy (Dement’ev, 1955; Kartashev, 1955). Arctic waders were banded at some Scandinavian stations (Jaren in Norway, Oeland in Sweden, and Amager in Denmark) during spring and fall migrations, but no banding was carried out on their arctic breeding grounds. The inaccessibility of breeding localities, the nomadic habits of most of the human population and the lack of competent, educated personnel made it difficult to carry out regular bird-banding programmes in the Arctic. In Greenland these difficulties have been overcome to a large extent. Trade and other economic matters are handled by the government, and Danish officials are stationed a t regular intervals along the extensive coasts as managers of settlements and outposts, or as employees at weather stations. The native inhabitants are in frequent contact with the officials, and they can be interested in bird-banding by the offer of a modest reward for their co-operation. This idea was developed by the late Dr. Alfred Bertelsen, Medical Officer of Umanak District, West Greenland, who, with the help of Greenlanders, banded a total of 681 birds, mainly eiders (Somateria mollissima) and kitti-. wakes, in the years 1926 - 34. During 1936 - 39 only 51 birds were banded, mainly great black-backed gulls (L a m s marinus) and <b>Iceland</b> <b>gulls</b> (Lmus glaucoides) (Bertelsen, 1948). After the Second World War bird-banding was organized at my request as a joint enterprise by Grgnlands Styrelse (now Ministeriet for Grgnland) an...|$|R
50|$|Martnaham Loch is a SSSI for {{the western}} half of its area. The {{south-western}} end of the loch is bordered by mixed woodland. Martnaham has had some notable rarities recorded over the years, such as smew, ring-necked duck, black tern, lesser scaup and hobby. Autumn and winter feature visits from flocks of goldeneye, wigeon, pochard and teal. Shoveller, scaup, long-tailed duck and gadwall are commonly seen and glaucous, <b>Iceland</b> and Mediterranean <b>gulls</b> are occasional visitors. Greylag geese and whooper swans gather in the surrounding fields. Great crested and little grebe breed here.

50|$|After the Territorials had {{finished}} using the land, the Amber Valley Council started {{using it as}} a tip. The big field that is in front of the viewing mound has all sorts of nasty things buried underneath it. In those days there weren’t any laws on what one could and couldn't dump. By burying thousands of tons of rubbish, it pushed any water that was there further up and this created bigger pools. A few local birders still sometimes pump out water into the river to keep the pools low to attract waders. As with most tips it used to be good for Gulls including visits from <b>Iceland</b> and Glaucous <b>Gulls.</b> Eventually the tip closed in the 1970s and things started to settle down. Levels are now controlled by a sluice {{at the southern end of}} the main pool. There is also a pipe that leads from the main pool to the river which is bunged during winter to maintain the water levels for wintering wildfowl. Then come spring it's taken out again and if we get a dry summer it should be low enough to attract waders late summer/autumn.|$|R
50|$|The moorland to {{the north}} of Gress is a {{breeding}} site for Arctic and great skua in the summer. The <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> and the brent goose can be seen at Gress. The garden tiger moth has also been seen at Gress.|$|E
50|$|Birdlife {{includes}} raven, ptarmigan, glaucous gull, <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull,</b> snow bunting, guillemot, eider, king eider, gyrfalcon, white-tailed eagle, redpoll, red-necked phalarope, various sandpipers, red-breasted merganser, red-throated diver, great northern diver, cormorant, long-tailed duck, puffin, northern wheatear, little auk, various duck species, {{and more}} rarely, snowy owls.|$|E

50|$|The taxon is pale in all plumages, with {{a remarkably}} {{variable}} amount of pigment in the primaries. Individuals range from completely white-winged (indistinguishable from nominate glaucoides <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull)</b> to so {{dark in the}} wings as to be indistinguishable from Thayer's gull. Eye color is also variable, from pale yellow to dark brown. Such remarkable variation seems to lend credence {{to the belief that}} Kumlien's gull is in fact a hybrid swarm.|$|E
50|$|Thayer's gull (Larus glaucoides thayeri) is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull.</b> It {{is a large}} gull {{native to}} North America that breeds in the Arctic islands of Canada and winters primarily on the Pacific coast, from southern Alaska to the Gulf of California, though there are also wintering populations on the Great Lakes and the upper Mississippi River. The species has occurred as a vagrant to Japan, Denmark, {{and other parts of}} western Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus glaucoides) is {{a medium}} size gull which breeds in the Arctic regions of Canada and Greenland; {{although}} not in Iceland (as its name suggests), {{where it is}} only seen during winter. The genus name is from Latin Larus which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific glaucoides denotes its resemblance to Larus glaucus, a synonym of Larus hyperboreus, the glaucous gull; -oides is Ancient Greek and means [...] "resembling".|$|E
5000|$|Although {{his family}} {{originally}} {{lived on the}} island of Hascosay in Shetland, Laurence lived with his brother Thomas on Unst. In his teens, he acquired specimens of glaucous gull Larus hyperboreus and snowy owl Bubo scandiacus, both later recognised as the first British records. In 1822 and 1823, while completing his medical studies in Edinburgh, Edmondston published several papers in the Memoirs of the Wernerian Society, adding two more species to the British List, <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> Larus glaucoides and ivory gull Pagophila eburnea.|$|E
50|$|There is {{generally}} very little snow, {{but a lot}} of rain. Owing to this microclimate, returning migrant birds are often first seen in the spring and they set out from the islands in the autumn. All of Iceland's seabirds can be found in Vestmannaeyjar: the guillemot, gannet, kittiwake, <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull,</b> and puffin. The puffin is the most plentiful species and is the Vestmannaeyjar emblem. More than 30 species of birds nest in their millions in the cliffs and grassy ledges, and other species make irregular appearances.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> is {{a medium}} size gull, {{although}} relatively slender and light-weight. In length, it can measure from 50 to 64 cm, wingspan is from 115 to 150 cm and weight is from 480 to 1100 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 37.9 to 44.3 cm, {{the bill is}} 3.6 to 5.4 cm and the tarsus is 4.9 to 6.7 cm. It is smaller and thinner-billed than the very large glaucous gull, and is usually smaller than the herring gull. It takes four years to reach maturity.|$|E
50|$|Somewhat {{intermediate}} between American {{herring gull}} and <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull</b> in habit and appearance {{and at times}} considered conspecific with either species, the adult Thayer's gull in nonbreeding plumage has a pale gray mantle, with obvious blackish wingtips, and extensive brown streaking {{on the head and}} neck. The head, neck, breast, belly, and underwings are primarily white, and the legs are pink. There is a red spot on the lower mandible, and the color of the iris is generally dark. In summer, the head and neck are white, with the bill turning bright yellow with a larger red spot on the lower mandible. Juvenile gulls are brown, with black bills, and black legs which quickly fade to adult pink. Thayer's Gull reaches a length of 56 to 64 cm, with a wingspan of 130 to 148 cm and a weight of approximately 720 to 1500 g. Males average around 1093 g and females, being slightly smaller, average 900 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38.4 to 44.2 cm, the bill is 4.4 to 5.5 cm and the tarsus is 5.2 to 6.9 cm.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{large and}} {{powerful}} gull, second largest of all gull species and very pale in all plumages, with no black on either of the wings or the tail. Adults are pale grey above, with a thick yellow bill. Immatures are very pale grey with a pink and black bill. This species is considerably larger, bulkier and thicker-billed than the similar <b>Iceland</b> <b>gull,</b> and can sometimes equal {{the size of the}} great black-backed gull, the oft-titled largest gull species. In some areas, glaucous gulls are about the same weight as great black-backed gulls or even heavier and their maximum weight is greater. They can weigh anywhere from 960 to 2700 g, with the sexes previously reported to average 1.55 kg in males and 1.35 kg in females. At the colony on Coats Island in Canada, the gulls are nearly 15% heavier than some other known populations, with a mean weight 1.86 kg in 5 males and 1.49 kg in 7 females. One other study claimed even higher weights for glaucous gulls, as on Wrangel Island 9 males reportedly averaged 2.32 kg and 2.1 kg in 6 females, which if accurate would make the glaucous gull the heaviest gull and shorebird in the world if not (as far as is known) the largest linearly on average. These gulls range from 55 to 77 cm in length and can span 132 to 170 cm, with some specimens possibly atttaining 182 cm, across the wings. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 40.8 to 50.1 cm, the bill is 4.9 to 6.9 cm and the tarsus is 6 to 7.7 cm. They take four years to reach maturity.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{amount of}} work reporters put into their reports is tremendous. Putting the {{information}} into a readable format which preserves it for future use is a challenge, but always interesting. Reporters can report on their own forms if preferred; some do now, often because of computerized record-keeping systems. I [Ross Silcock] enter the data into my computer, and so almost anything is fine, as long as I can read it. It {{is not necessary to}} list every species, although {{it is difficult to know}} whether your dates of arrival, high counts, etc. are significant until compared with the others submitted. Perhaps the best way to save time and work reporting is to plan your system so that it is simple to report when the time comes. NOTABLE EVENTS There are several highlights among the data presented below. A long list of rarities included Eurasian Wigeon, Oldsquaw, Gyrfalcon, King Rail, Snowy Plover, Red Knot, Ruff (first Nebraska record), Thayer 2 ̆ 7 s Gull, <b>Iceland</b> <b>Gull,</b> Lesser Black-backed Gull, Great Black-backed Gull, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Cape May Warbler, Worm-eating Warbler, Connecticut Warbler, MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler (specimen in Lancaster County), Hooded Warbler, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. American Bittern is doing well in the Sandhills, as is Black-crowned Night-Heron, and especially Black-necked stilt. White-faced Ibis was also numerous, although it is not resident. Trumpeter Swan is present in the Sandhills in good numbers also, with several breeding pairs noted. This year, Cinnamon Teal was also present in good numbers. That these species are doing well speaks for the good condition of Sandhills waterbird habitats...|$|E
40|$|Last year, I wrote: 2 ̆ 2 Overall, {{this was}} a pretty quiet winter season. There were no major weather events, no major invasions (just one minor incursion), and, with one big exception, no real rarities. 2 ̆ 2 This is pretty much true of this winter too, except that there weren 2 ̆ 7 t even any minor incursions, unless Common Redpoll and Purple Finch qualify, and no drop-dead rarities, {{although}} Black-headed Gull comes close! In fact, we returned to a fairly normal type of winter with some cold weather and accumulating snow cover. This caused birds to leave in fall in normal fashion, and, in general, to arrive in spring at normal times. Waterfowl and blackbirds generally departed in early Jan and returned {{at the end of}} February, just like old times, and there were some half-hardy birds in evidence: Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, Hermit Thrush, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Fox Sparrow, and Brown-headed Cowbird. A surprise was the absence of scoters. There was a minor influx of Common Redpolls and Purple Finches, but other winter finches were in low numbers. Clearly declining in recent years, especially when compared to CBC numbers of around 20 years ago, is the House Sparrow. Numbers of Harris 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow also were low, as were chickadees, the latter strikingly so in the Platte Valley. Huge numbers of robins, starlings, and crows were reported, as well as Canada Geese in the central and western Platte Valley. Eurasian Collared-Doves continued to occupy new counties, with only 17 unsullied; interestingly, 12 of these are Sandhills counties. There were few late dates set; a Rock Wren was most noticeable, being 2 months later than the previous late date, and an Eared Grebe and a Lincoln 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow were both 2 nd latest ever for fall, the latter possibly wintering. Rare midwinter records were a Barn Owl and a Savannah Sparrow. Almost old friends were the Tufted Duck at Lake Ogallala, back for the 5 th year, and the Curve-billed Thrasher in Sioux County. A genuine rarity was a Black-headed Gull, only the 3 rd state record (2 nd acceptably documented, pending NOURC). Other rare birds were all gulls at Lake McConaughy, truly an incredible gulling experience this winter. The list of 12 species found there included Little Gull (13 th state record), Great Black-backed Gull (14 th), <b>Iceland</b> <b>Gull</b> (17 th), and Mew Gull (19 th). Far out of range for winter was a Carolina Wren in Scotts Bluff County...|$|E
