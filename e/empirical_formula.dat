5|$|The {{descriptor}} hydrated or anhydrous is {{used when}} referring to iron(III) chloride, {{to distinguish between the}} two common forms. The hexahydrate is usually given as the simplified <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> FeCl3⋅6H2O. It may also be given as trans-Cl⋅2H2O and the systematic name tetraaquadichloroiron(III) chloride dihydrate, which more clearly represents its structure.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E
5|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} different cations and/or anions, multiplicative prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-,...) are often required to indicate the relative compositions, and cations then anions are listed in alphabetical order. For example, KMgCl3 is named magnesium potassium trichloride to distinguish it from K2MgCl4, magnesium dipotassium tetrachlorideMgCl4 and Cs2MgCl4|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry|date=January 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=114–118|doi=10.1139/v75-015}} (note that in both the <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> and the written name, the cations appear in alphabetical order, but the order varies between them because the symbol for potassium is K). When one of the ions already has a multiplicative prefix within its name, the alternate multiplicative prefixes (bis-, tris-, tetrakis-,...) are used. For example, Ba(BrF4)2 is named barium bis(tetrafluoridobromate).|$|E

Common method of calculating of the magnetic force are the Maxwell equations, <b>empirical</b> <b>formulas,</b> and he equivalent magnetic charge method as well. The Maxwell equations method is the most complicated and the <b>empirical</b> <b>formulas</b> method is the simplest with low accuracy. The equivalent magnetic charge method is simpler than the Maxwell equations method and more accurate than the <b>empirical</b> <b>formulas</b> method. In this paper, the magnetic force of the magnetic driver of reciprocate in line is calculated with the equivalent magnetic charge method and was compared with the experiment...|$|R

25|$|The first {{description}} of phenylalanine {{was made in}} 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the <b>empirical</b> <b>formula,</b> C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) seedlings. In 1882, Erlenmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|Upon heating orthophosphoric acid, {{condensation}} of the phosphoric units can {{be induced}} by driving {{off the water}} formed from condensation. When one molecule of water has been removed for each two molecules of phosphoric acid, the result is pyrophosphoric acid (H4P2O7). When an average of one molecule of water per phosphoric unit has been driven off, the resulting substance is a glassy solid having an <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> of HPO3 and is called metaphosphoric acid. Metaphosphoric acid is a singly anhydrous version of orthophosphoic acid and is sometimes used as a water- or moisture-absorbing reagent. Further dehydrating is very difficult and can be accomplished only {{by means of an}} extremely strong desiccant (and not by heating alone). It produces phosphoric anhydride (phosphorus pentoxide), which has an <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> P2O5, although an actual molecule has a chemical formula of P4O10. Phosphoric anhydride is a solid, which is very strongly moisture-absorbing and is used as a desiccant.|$|E

However, the values of the matrix elements are found through <b>empirical</b> <b>formulae</b> that estimate the degree of overlap of specific atomic orbitals.

40|$|To {{ensure the}} quality of pavement, it is {{important}} {{to make sure that the}} resilient moduli [...] that describe the stiffness of all the pavement layers [...] exceed a certain threshold. From the mechanical viewpoint, pavement is a non-linear medium. Several <b>empirical</b> <b>formulas</b> have been proposed to describe this non-linearity. In this paper, we describe a theoretical explanation for the most accurate of these <b>empirical</b> <b>formulas...</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> for benzene {{was long}} known, but its highly {{polyunsaturated}} structure, {{with just one}} hydrogen atom for each carbon atom, was challenging to determine. Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 and Joseph Loschmidt in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} structure of venlafaxine is designated (R/S)-1- cyclohexanol hydrochloride or (±)-1- cyclohexanol hydrochloride, {{and it has}} the <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> of C17H27NO2. It is a white to off-white crystalline solid. Venlafaxine is structurally and pharmacologically related to the atypical opioid analgesic tramadol, and more distantly to the newly released opioid tapentadol, but not to any of the conventional antidepressant drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, MAOIs, or RIMAs.|$|E
25|$|When the {{chemical}} compound of the formula consists of simple molecules, chemical formulas often employ ways {{to suggest the}} structure of the molecule. There are several types of these formulas, including molecular formulas and condensed formulas. A molecular formula enumerates the number of atoms to reflect those in the molecule, so that the molecular formula for glucose is C6H12O6 rather than the glucose <b>empirical</b> <b>formula,</b> which is CH2O. Except for very simple substances, molecular chemical formulas lack needed structural information, and are ambiguous.|$|E

25|$|Compounds of gallium(II) were unknown until quite recently. As {{the atomic}} number of gallium {{is an odd}} number (31), Ga2+ should have an {{unpaired}} electron. It was assumed that it would act as a free radical and have a very short lifetime. The non-existence of Ga(II) compounds {{was part of the}} so-called inert pair effect. When salts of the anion with <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> such as − were synthesized they were found to be diamagnetic. This implied the formation of a Ga-Ga bond and a dimeric formula, 2−.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{formic acid}} {{was formed by}} the {{distillation}} of dead ants, and Döbereiner's ant bodies probably contained some plant matter. In 1840, the Scottish chemist John Stenhouse found that the same chemical could be produced by distilling {{a wide variety of}} crop materials, including corn, oats, bran, and sawdust, with aqueous sulfuric acid; he also determined an <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> of (C5H4O2). George Fownes named this oil furfurol in 1845 (from furfur - bran, and oleum). This name persisted prominently in the literature until 1901 when the German chemist Carl Harries deduced furfural's structure.|$|E
25|$|In {{empirical}} formulas, these proportions {{begin with}} a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, as ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> of ethanol may be written C2H6O because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number empirical formulas. An example is boron carbide, whose formula of CBn is a variable non-whole number ratio with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fundamental}} {{periods of}} buildings {{are essential to}} calculate the design base shear and lateral forces. Most seismic codes specify <b>empirical</b> <b>formulae</b> to estimate the fundamental vibration period of buildings. These <b>empirical</b> <b>formulae</b> are used for both low- and medium- rise buildings. These formulae depend on the building materials (steel, reinforced concrete etc), building types (frame, shear wall etc) and overall dimensions of the buildings. In this paper, for finding the fundamental natural period of steel moment resisting frames, numerical studies are carried out, and by regression analysis, <b>empirical</b> <b>formulae</b> are derived for low- and medium- rise buildings. The numerical studies carried out includes, {{the influence of the}} plan and bay dimensions, normalized stiffness and height of storeys and various cross sections as columns and beams on fundamental period of the moment resisting frames...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} select the correct power it is {{necessary}} to first calculate the thermal energy required to raise the material to the required temperature in the time allotted. This can be done using the heat content of the material which is normal expressed in KW hours per tonne the weight of metal to be processed and the time cycle. Once this has been established other factors such as radiated losses from the component, coil losses and other system losses need to be factored in. Traditionally this process involved lengthy and complex calculations in conjunction with a mixture of practical experience and <b>empirical</b> <b>formula.</b> Modern techniques utilise finite element analysis and other computer aided modeling techniques, however as with all such methods a thorough working knowledge of the induction heating process is still required.|$|E
500|$|Alfred Werner, a Nobel-prize winning {{pioneer in}} {{coordination}} chemistry, worked with compounds of <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> Cl3. One of the isomers determined was cobalt(III) hexammine chloride. This coordination complex, a typical Werner-type complex, {{consists of a}} central cobalt atom coordinated by six ammine orthogonal ligands and three chloride counteranions. Using chelating ethylenediamine ligands in place of ammonia gives tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) chloride (Cl3), {{which was one of}} the first coordination complexes to be resolved into optical isomers. The complex exists in the right- and left-handed forms of a [...] "three-bladed propeller". This complex was first isolated by Werner as yellow-gold needle-like crystals.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{nomenclature}} {{recommended by}} IUPAC, ionic compounds are named {{according to their}} composition, not their structure. In the most simple case of a binary ionic compound with no possible ambiguity about the charges and thus the stoichiometry, the common name is written using two words. The name of the cation (the unmodified element name for monatomic cations) comes first, followed {{by the name of}} the anion. For example, MgCl2 is named magnesium chloride, and Na2SO4 is named sodium sulfate ( [...] , sulfate, {{is an example of a}} polyatomic ion). To obtain the <b>empirical</b> <b>formula</b> from these names, the stoichiometry can be deduced from the charges on the ions, and the requirement of overall charge neutrality.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of hydrodynamic forces {{acting on a}} bottom-seated hemisphere in waves only, in currents only and in waves & currents are presented {{from the viewpoint of}} the design of an artificial reef. A large number of regular wave experiments were conducted in order to find the <b>empirical</b> <b>formulas</b> of the hydrodynamic coefficients for the bottom-seated hemisphere. It is shown that the proposed <b>empirical</b> <b>formulas</b> are sufficiently accurate for predicting the hydrodynamic forces. The effects of the normalized water depth and hemisphere spacing relative to its diameter are also elucidated experimentally...|$|R
50|$|Uranates {{with more}} {{complicated}} <b>empirical</b> <b>formulas</b> are known. Essentially these arise when the cation:uranium ratio {{is different from}} 2:1 (monovalent cations) or 1:1 (divalent cations). Charge-balance constrains the number of oxygen atoms to be equal to half the sum of charges of the cations and uranyl groups. For example, with the cation K+, compounds with K:U ratios of 2, 1 and 0.5 were found, corresponding to <b>empirical</b> <b>formulas</b> K2UO4, KUO3 and K2U4O13. The uranate structures in these compounds differ {{in the way the}} UOx structural units are linked together.|$|R

500|$|Proteins {{were first}} {{described}} by the Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1838. Mulder carried out elemental analysis of common proteins and found that nearly all proteins had the same <b>empirical</b> <b>formula,</b> C400H620N100O120P1S1. He came to the erroneous conclusion {{that they might be}} composed of a single type of (very large) molecule. The term [...] "protein" [...] to describe these molecules was proposed by Mulder's associate Berzelius; protein is derived from the Greek word πρώτειος (proteios), meaning [...] "primary", [...] "in the lead", or [...] "standing in front", + [...] Mulder went on to identify the products of protein degradation such as the amino acid leucine for which he found a (nearly correct) molecular weight of 131 Da.|$|E

500|$|Boyd {{was born}} to Emory Fortson and Rosa Lee (née Wright) Boyd on July 18, 1906 in Tignall, Georgia, a small town near the eastern border {{of the state of}} Georgia. He had two brothers, John and Ellis, and a sister, Sophia. In 1927, he {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Georgia, where {{he was a member of}} the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. In 1928, he received a Master of Arts in mathematics from Duke University. From 1928 to 1930, Boyd was an instructor of physics at the University of Georgia. He entered graduate school at Yale University in 1930, and was a graduate assistant there from 1930–1931 and a Loomis Fellow from 1931–1933. He received his PhD in physics from Yale in 1933, with a thesis entitled Scattering of X-Rays by Cold-Worked and by Annealed Beryllium. In his thesis, Boyd described the effects of reflecting radiation through samples of powdered, cold-worked and annealed beryllium with differing particle sizes. The experiment showed that beryllium crystals are [...] "rather imperfect", that annealing caused [...] "no appreciable change" [...] in beryllium's lattice structure, and that the mass absorption coefficient of beryllium found in the experiment was reasonably close to the theoretical value calculated using Compton's <b>empirical</b> <b>formula.</b>|$|E
