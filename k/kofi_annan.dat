5|$|The {{day of the}} vote, 30 August 1999, was {{generally}} calm and orderly. 98.6 percent of registered voters cast ballots, and on 4 September UN Secretary-General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> announced that 78.5 {{percent of the votes}} had been cast for independence.|$|E
5|$|Then Secretary General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> {{streamlined}} all UN Agencies {{working on}} International Development Issues {{under a new}} United Nations Development Group, chaired by the Administrator of the UNDP. The Delivering as One concept was also introduced.|$|E

Secretary General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to attempt to {{negotiate}} a peace accord with Laurent Kabila in an erupting regional war.|$|E
5|$|A very {{frequently}} discussed {{change to the}} UN structure {{is to change the}} permanent membership of the UN Security Council, which reflects the power structure of the world as it was in 1945. There are several proposed plans, notably by the G4 nations, by the Uniting for Consensus group, and by former UN Secretary-General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Streep {{entered the}} 2000s {{with a voice}} cameo in Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), a science fiction film about a childlike android, played by Haley Joel Osment. The same year, Streep co-hosted the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert with Liam Neeson which was held in Oslo, Norway, on December 11, 2001, in honour of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the United Nations and <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 2006, talks {{concerning}} a territorial {{dispute over the}} Bakassi peninsula were resolved. The talks involved President Paul Biya of Cameroon, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and UN Secretary General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan,</b> and resulted in Cameroonian control of the oil-rich peninsula. The northern portion of the territory was formally {{handed over to the}} Cameroonian government in August 2006, and the remainder of the peninsula was left to Cameroon 2 years later, in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Nina's daughter, Nane Maria Lagergren, married <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan,</b> former {{secretary}} general of the United Nations, and is active in many humanitarian efforts. Another of Wallenberg's nieces, Louise von Dardel, is the main activist in the family and dedicates much of her time to speaking about Wallenberg and lobbying various countries to help uncover information about her uncle. The extended Wallenberg family remains an influential part of Swedish society as major shareholders in banks and corporations including Saab and Scandinavian Airlines.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to Raoul Wallenberg by Scottish sculptor Philip Jackson {{is located at}} Great Cumberland Place in London's Marble Arch district, outside the Western Marble Arch Synagogue. It was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997, {{in the presence of}} the President of Israel, Ezer Weizman, the Secretary General of the United Nations, <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan,</b> and survivors of the Holocaust. A separate monument stands near the Welsh National War Memorial in Cathays Park, Cardiff. A bronze briefcase monument by Gustav Kraitz with the initials RW is located in the garden of the Beth Shalom Holocaust Centre near Laxton in Nottinghamshire.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the last}} decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN {{condemned}} the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption. In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan, withdrew his nation's funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by Britain and Singapore. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing {{the size of the}} organization somewhat. His successor, <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> (1997â€“2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> appointed Clinton to head a relief effort. After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year. As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show, and traveled to the affected areas. They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 2008, 18 Columbia {{affiliates}} {{have won}} Nobel Prizes, of whom nine are faculty members while {{one is an}} adjunct senior research scientist (Daniel Tsui) {{and the other a}} Global Fellow (<b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan).</b> Columbia faculty awarded the Nobel Prize include Richard Axel, Martin Chalfie, Eric Kandel, Tsung-Dao Lee, Robert Mundell, Orhan Pamuk, Edmund S. Phelps, Joseph Stiglitz, and Horst L. Stormer. Other awards and honors won by faculty include 30 MacArthur Foundation Award winners, 4 National Medal of Science recipients, 43 National Academy of Sciences Award winners, 20 National Academy of Engineering Award winners, 38 Institute of Medicine of the National Academies Award recipients and 143 American Academy of Arts and Sciences Award winners.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Commission on Human Rights {{came under}} fire during its {{existence}} for the high-profile positions it gave to member states that did not guarantee {{the human rights of}} their own citizens. Several nations known to have been guilty of gross violations of human rights became members of the organization, such as Libya, Cuba, Sudan, Algeria, China, Azerbaijan and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States was also angry when it was ejected from the Commission in 2002. While it was re-elected, the election of human rights-abusing nations also caused frictions. It was partly because of these problems that <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> in the In Larger Freedom report suggested setting up a new Human Rights Council as a subsidiary UN body.|$|E
5|$|The {{interval}} between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime {{body of work}} rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts. However, {{they can also be}} awarded for specific recent events. For instance, <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.|$|E
5|$|Alumni in American {{politics}} {{and public service}} include former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, former MA-1 Representative John Olver, former CA-13 Representative Pete Stark, former National Economic Council chairman Lawrence H. Summers, and former Council of Economic Advisors chairwoman Christina Romer. MIT alumni in international politics include Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President of Colombia Virgilio Barco Vargas, President of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan, former British Foreign Minister David Miliband, former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, former UN Secretary General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan,</b> former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi, former Minister of Education and Culture of The Republic of Indonesia Yahya Muhaimin.|$|E
5|$|The {{site of the}} UN {{headquarters}} has extraterritoriality status. This affects some {{law enforcement}} where UN rules override the laws of New York City, {{but it does not}} give immunity to those who commit crimes there. In addition, the United Nations Headquarters remains under the jurisdiction and laws of the United States, although a few members of the UN staff have diplomatic immunity and so cannot be prosecuted by local courts unless the diplomatic immunity is waived by the Secretary-General. In 2005, Secretary-General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> waived the immunity of Benon Sevan, Aleksandr Yakovlev, and Vladimir Kuznetsov in relation to the Oil-for-Food Programme, and all were charged in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Benon Sevan later fled the United States to Cyprus, while Aleksandr Yakovlev and Vladimir Kuznetsov decided to stand trial.|$|E
5|$|A {{string of}} new {{peacekeeping}} missions were launched in Namibia, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Angola by the Security Council which also triggered {{interest in the}} reform of the 15-member body. Germany and Japan in particular, as well as India and Brazil, launched efforts to gain permanent seats and veto rights at the Council. In the late 1990s, Secretary-General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of peacekeeping operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international â€˜responsibility to protectâ€™ populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.|$|E
5|$|GPI is {{the product}} of the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) and {{developed}} in consultation with an international panel of peace experts from peace institutes and think tanks with data collected and collated by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The list was launched in May 2007 and updates have been made on an annual basis since then. It is claimed to be the first study to rank countries around the world according to their peacefulness. In 2014 it ranked 162 countries, up from 121 in 2007. The study is the brainchild of Australian technology entrepreneur Steve Killelea, founder of Integrated Research, and is endorsed by individuals such as <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan,</b> the Dalai Lama, archbishop Desmond Tutu, Finland's President Sauli NiinistÃ¶, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, economist Jeffrey Sachs, former president of Ireland Mary Robinson, former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson and former United States president Jimmy Carter.|$|E

5|$|The Angolan {{military}} launched Operation Restore, {{a massive}} offensive, in September 1999, recapturing N'harea, Mungo and Andulo and Bailundo, {{the site of}} Savimbi's headquarters just one year before. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 1268 on 15 October, instructing United Nations Secretary General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> to update the Security Council {{to the situation in}} Angola every three months. Dos Santos offered an amnesty to UNITA militants on 11 November. By December, Chief of Staff General JoÃ£o de Matos said the Angolan Armed Forces had destroyed 80% of UNITA's militant wing and captured 15,000tons of military equipment. Following the dissolution of the coalition government, Savimbi retreated to his historical base in Moxico and prepared for battle. In order to isolate UNITA, the government forced civilians in countryside areas subject to UNITA influence to relocate to major cities. The strategy was successful isolating in UNITA but had adverse humanitarian consequences.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} and individuals {{associated with the}} UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag HammarskjÃ¶ld and <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan,</b> were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, RenÃ© Cassin (1968), {{a contributor to the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1945), the latter {{for his role in the}} organization's founding. Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International Atomic Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.|$|E
5|$|Despite growing {{protests and}} the {{increasing}} death toll, President Zedillo did not initially request for international aid, believing that the country had the necessary resources, although by October15 he changed his position. The office of Secretary-General of the United Nations <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> issued a statement of condolences to those affected by the tragedy. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) donated $100,000 on October13. The European Commission approved â‚¬1million (1999euros) in aid to be distributed through the German and Spanish Red Cross agencies. The Church World Service launched an appeal on October8 to raise funds, and provided $47,000 worth of blankets and bedding. The Catholic Relief Services pledged $100,000 for flood victims in Mexico. Thousands of residents in Mexico donated 500tons of food, along with water, clothes, and medicine to the Mexican Red Cross. After additional flooding in Tabasco, the Mexican Red Cross sent 254metric tonnes of food, water, medicine, and clothing to the state. The American Red Cross donated about $100,000 to its Mexican counterpart. Direct Relief International sent two loads of medicine and blankets to Oaxaca. Adventist Development and Relief Agency provided food for about 25,000people.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the LomÃ© Agreement, UNAMSIL set up disarmament camps throughout Sierra Leone that were intended to disarm the Sierra Leone Army, the RUF, and the militia groups operating in the country. The SLA and some militia groups began to enter the camps but the RUF did not. In April 2000, 10 members of the RUF entered a UNAMSIL camp without {{the knowledge of the}} RUF's leadership. Upon locating its fighters, the RUF demanded their return. The military observers refused, and the RUF responded by besieging the camp and attacking other UNAMSIL bases in the area. They took large numbers of UN personnel prisoner, and then began to advance into areas previously controlled by the Sierra Leone government. On 3 May, the RUF took control of the town of Kambia. Foreign diplomats in the country estimated that the RUF could be in Freetown within a week, since the SLA had been confined to barracks and had handed over most of its weapons in {{accordance with}} the LomÃ© Agreement. The United Nations issued a statement condemning the violence, after which Secretary-General <b>Kofi</b> <b>Annan</b> told the British representative to the UN that it expected the United Kingdom, as the former colonial power, to intervene in Sierra Leone directly, rather than relying on the international community.|$|E
