5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour <b>early</b> <b>on,</b> <b>a</b> rift developed between them and the two never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the film}} {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida, and Rio de Janeiro. The {{production}} team had considered India and Nepal as a location in the film but on arriving at those places to investigate, they found that it was inconceivable to write them into the script, particularly with time restrictions to do so. They decided on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, relatively <b>early</b> <b>on,</b> <b>a</b> city that Cubby Broccoli had visited on holiday, and a team was sent to that city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the Carnival festival, which featured in the film.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about Stefan's childhood. His family {{could not afford to}} send him to a {{university}} abroad (only one of his brothers would do so); hence he embarked <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> military career. Before that, he attended a jesuit college, either in Kraków or Sandomierz, achieving a solid secondary education. After finishing his schooling, he became a courtier to then-royal prince and future king of Poland John II Casimir Vasa. As Stefan could not afford the equipment needed to join a hussar unit, he learned the art of war serving with the Lisowczycy mercenaries, joining them as towarzysz (companion, a junior cavalry officer) in the spring of 1621. Already an officer at the age of eighteen, he took part in the battle of Chocim (Khotyn) in 1621, where the Commonwealth army stopped the Ottomans and ended the Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21). His years with the brutal Lisowczycy mercenaries would impact his strategy in the latter years, where he would not hesitate to use any means necessary – including mistreatment of civilians – to achieve victory.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1926–27, with other {{candidates}} unavailable, Gilligan was chosen to captain an MCC team which toured India; the side was not fully representative and did not play Test matches. In first-class games, he scored three fifties and, bowling infrequently, took ten wickets on the tour. The team, the first to tour India under the colours of the MCC, was very successful. Gilligan left most of the day-to-day organisation to his vice-captain, Raleigh Chichester-Constable, and did not take his speech-making duties particularly seriously. He nevertheless had several issues to deal with. One of his players, Jack Parsons, refused for religious reasons to play in any matches in which play took place on a Sunday; Gilligan threatened to send him home {{but in the end}} he agreed to play on condition that he could leave <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunday to attend religious services. Parsons was also openly critical of racial and social discrimination that he saw. Gilligan intervened at one point when his team's professionals were excluded from some invitations in Calcutta and told their hosts that no-one would attend the functions if the professionals were not included. Both the sporting and social programmes for the tour were demanding, and Gilligan wanted to attend most functions for fear of offending the European or Indian hosts. The members of the team were left exhausted, necessitating the use of reinforcements to their number, including the occasional use of English cricketers who were coaching in India, and on several occasions, the Maharajah of Patiala, {{who was a member of}} the MCC and entitled to play.|$|E

On Bougainville there was Kieta, Panguna, Arawa and <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> part-time sub branch at Loloho. The bank maintained those facilities to support trade, local business, government and small savers.|$|E

25|$|As the Sperrin was {{considered}} to be a possible production aircraft <b>early</b> <b>on,</b> <b>a</b> decision was taken for the two prototypes to be constructed upon production jigs; this served to slow their construction.

25|$|Cannabis smoking {{was common}} in the Middle East {{before the arrival of}} tobacco, and was <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> common social {{activity}} that centered around the type of water pipe called a hookah. Smoking, especially after the introduction of tobacco, was an essential component of Muslim society and culture and became integrated with important traditions such as weddings, funerals and was expressed in architecture, clothing, literature and poetry.|$|E
25|$|He {{and friends}} Emil Cioran and Constantin Noica were by then under the {{influence}} of Trăirism, a school of thought that was formed around the ideals expressed by Ionescu. A form of existentialism, Trăirism was also the synthesis of traditional and newer right-wing beliefs. <b>Early</b> <b>on,</b> <b>a</b> public polemic was sparked between Eliade and Camil Petrescu: the two eventually reconciled and later became good friends.|$|E
50|$|Feibusch's {{work was}} always {{representational}} but he developed <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> Expressionist use of colour {{and intensity of}} vision.

Another flying bomb hit the gasholder on the Common, destroying both the structure and a nearby cottage, whose occupant was killed.|$|E
25|$|McGlaughlin was <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{champion}} of living composers and new music, {{dating back to}} his Pennsylvania days and his involvement with {{groups such as the}} Penn Contemporary Players and the Philadelphia Composers Forum. McGlaughlin himself founded the Pittsburgh Camerata (1973), which focused on contemporary music, and he was a steady proponent of living composers' works in Kansas City as well. Eventually, this championing became a desire to compose on his own.|$|E
25|$|In black-figure vase painting, the pre-drawn {{outlines}} {{were a part}} of the figure. In red-figure vases, {{the outline}} would, after firing, form part of the black background. This led to vases with very thin figures <b>early</b> <b>on.</b> <b>A</b> further problem was that the black background did not permit the depiction of space in any depth, so that spatial perspective was almost never attempted. Nonetheless, the advantages outnumbered the disadvantages. The depiction of muscles and other anatomical details clearly illustrates the development of the style.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch West India Company {{introduced}} {{slavery in}} 1625 with {{the importation of}} eleven black slaves who worked as farmers, fur traders, and builders. Although enslaved, the Africans had a few basic rights and families were usually kept intact. Admitted to the Dutch Reformed Church and married by its ministers, their children could be baptized. Slaves could testify in court, sign legal documents, and bring civil actions against whites. Some were permitted to work after hours earning wages equal to those paid to white workers. When the colony fell, the company freed the first slaves and some others, establishing <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nucleus of free negros.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{eventually}} {{was able to}} stealthily move his army across the James River. After stopping a Union attempt to capture Petersburg, Virginia, a vital railroad link supplying Richmond, Lee's men built elaborate trenches and were besieged in Petersburg, a development which presaged the trench warfare of World War I. Lee attempted to break the stalemate by sending Jubal A. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> raid through the Shenandoah Valley to Washington, D.C., but Early was defeated early on by the superior forces of Philip Sheridan. The Siege of Petersburg lasted from June 1864 until March 1865, with Lee's outnumbered and poorly supplied army shrinking daily because of desertions by disheartened Confederates.|$|E
25|$|Opening the innings with Pathan back-fired for India, {{as he got}} out <b>early.</b> <b>On</b> <b>a</b> {{balancing}} first day, India made {{total of}} 309–5, thanks to major contribution from Sachin Tendulkar's 39th ton. Tendulkar went unbeaten on 124 on the first day. On the second day, Sachin and Dhoni got out early, but a stubborn innings from Kumble and an attacking innings from Harbhajan took India past 500. Kumble was unlucky to miss a century {{and he was the}} last man to get out. Australia played with caution and they did not lose any wicket on the second day. Australia were at 62–0 at stumps.|$|E

25|$|While the {{earthquake}} {{quickly became the}} only subject on talkback radio, other early coverage relied on comments from Police and other 24-hour services who were immediately affected and needed {{to communicate with the}} media. Because {{the earthquake}} occurred <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Saturday morning, with only overnight staff on duty, it took several hours for some media outlets to give the event full live coverage. So it took until mid-morning for some media outlets to have sufficient stories and staff on duty to allow them to commence continuous live broadcasts. One television producer later observed that if the earthquake had happened just a few hours earlier, or later, they would have had a full studio crew on duty and have been able to go live immediately.|$|E
25|$|After {{their victory}} over Mississippi State, Alabama {{moved into the}} No. 5 {{position}} in the AP Poll prior to their game against LSU. Against the Tigers, the Crimson Tide won 31–7 at Tiger Stadium. Alabama scored their first touchdown <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 45-yard Steve Sloan pass to Dennis Homan for a 7–0 first quarter lead. 17 second quarter points scored on a two-yard Steve Bowman run, a six-yard Sloan pass to David Ray and a 41-yard Ray field goal made the halftime score 24–0 {{in favor of the}} visitors. After Bowman scored on a 35-yard run in the third, LSU scored their only points in the fourth on a 53-yard Pat Screen touchdown pass to Joe Labruzzo that made the final score 31–7. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against LSU to 17–8–4.|$|E
25|$|Sonic 3D Blast was {{the final}} Sonic game to be {{released}} for the Sega Genesis. Sega had discontinued official support for the Genesis in 1995, but intended all along to produce the game for the 16-bit console because games typically sell for {{one to two years}} after their platforms' discontinuation. <b>Early</b> <b>on,</b> <b>a</b> test build was made to help decide if a split-screen two-player mode would be viable, but split-screen would not end up in the final product. Jon Burton, programmer for the Genesis version, implemented an exception handler where, should an error occur, the game would greet the player with a secret level select screen instead of crashing; this was done so the game could easily pass Sega's approval process for publishing games. Burton also gave this version a unique full motion video intro sequence that could only fit on the 4MB cartridge by using compression and various tricks to make the low-resolution video appear higher resolution.|$|E
