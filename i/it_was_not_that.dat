Inspired by radical {{debate in the}} student community, he wrote a {{critical}} essay on Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom. Palme wrote his senior honour thesis on the United Auto Workers union, led at the time by Walter Reuther. After graduation he traveled {{throughout the country and}} eventually ended up in Detroit, where his hero Reuther agreed to an interview which lasted several hours. In later years, Palme regularly remarked during his many subsequent American visits, that the United States had made him a socialist, a remark that often has caused confusion. Within the context of his American experience, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> Palme was repelled by what he found in America, but rather that he was inspired by it.|$|E

[...] Her husband was originally to give the address but he felt that she should do it; she later recalled, [...] "At that moment, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> I found my voice. Instead, it was as if my voice found me." [...] Her words summarized one of the goals and moral rationales of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and it became one of the more famous speeches of his administration. In May 2002, she made a speech to the people of Afghanistan through Radio Liberty. [...] In March 2005, she made the first of three trips to that country as First Lady.|$|E

When Liz learns that her mother {{could have been an}} astronaut's wife, Margaret explains that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> simple as she had just graduated from secretary school and got a job as a secretary at Sterling Cooper. The latter is a fictional advertising agency on the AMC program Mad Men. In addition, actor Jon Hamm, who plays the lead role on Mad Men, has had a recurring role on 30 Rock as a love interest for Tina Fey's character. Later, Liz gets angry at her mother's admission of not marrying Buzz Aldrin and tells her that actress Laura Linney [...] "could've played you in the HBO original movie Moon Wives." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, former [...] "good-girl" [...] Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. A weakened Cassie escapes from the hospital to find Daniel and tell him she was driving; she is returned to the hospital. During the episode dated May 24, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. Following her death, the strong relationship between Nick and Sharon changes forever. Weighing in on the [...] "groundbreaking" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] plot, Morrow stated, [...] "As a person who watched Camryn grow up, I was devastated and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> difficult to use those feelings in the scenes we had to play. But as an actor, I have to commend our producer and writers at that time because it gave the show a huge new storyline that years later we are still playing out". He felt that losing a child gave Nick [...] "an edge and a change" [...] that affected him deeply. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick tells a judge that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death. Luke Kerr of Zap2it referred to this as playing the [...] "Cassie card".|$|E

Washington ruled it passed on the vote 5 yes, 4 no, 1 divided. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> five was a {{majority}} of twelve, but to keep the business moving forward, he used precedent established in the Convention earlier. Now some of the big-state delegates talked of walking out, but none did. Debate {{over the next ten}} days developed an agreed general outline for the Constitution. Small states readily yielded on many questions. Most remaining delegates, big-state and small, now felt safe enough to chance a new plan.|$|E
2500|$|Whether Mara's {{resignation}} {{was in fact}} forced {{has been}} the subject of a police investigation since 21 May 2003, when the Police Investigations Department confirmed that they had opened an investigation into the events surrounding his departure from office. Mahendra Chaudhry, the deposed Prime Minister, has publicly supported Mara's version of events, and has further alleged that Mara was blackmailed with a threat to kill his daughter, Tourism Minister Adi Koila Nailatikau, who was one of the hostages. Commodore Bainimarama has defended his role in the incident saying it was [...] "necessary" [...] at the time, and that Mara's resignation was, in fact, voluntary and that he had refused offers of reinstatement. Mara's daughter, Adi Ateca Ganilau (wife of Ratu Epeli Ganilau) appeared to support Bainimarama's claims in a statement on 10 January 2005, saying that her father had resigned and had refused to return because he was upset by the abrogation of the Constitution. [...] "He did not agree with the abrogation of the Constitution. That was probably why he refused to return to office. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> the military pressured him to move out," [...] Ganilau said. She called for a thorough investigation into the abrogation of the Constitution, and for those who were legal advisers at the time to be answerable for their actions.|$|E
2500|$|The series' horror {{was mostly}} criticized; Henderson {{asserted}} [...] "it isn't really a horror title ... It's {{more of the}} psychological horror", while Wildsmith considered the stories were not [...] "scary enough to make this collection horror, nor are they thought provoking {{enough to make it}} a psychological thriller". Sherman said it [...] "isn't as unsettling as it could be: there are terrors, after all, which reflect the characters' primal fears, yet Esuno doesn't delve as deeply into 'em as he could". Most reviewers agreed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> scary, but at least featured [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "spooky" [...] moments. Santos felt that it [...] "would probably be a lot more horrifying ... if it didn't keep trying to be cute and funny with the characters", especially criticizing Hanako's role who [...] "make annoying quips that derail the creepy mood of the series". Zack Davisson of Japan Reviewed remarked that when it [...] "is playing with straight horror, it really shines" [...] so the second and third volumes were considered an improvement over the first as they relied less on [...] "cheap gags" [...] and [...] "panty-gags" [...] and [...] "deliver some actual horror". Ho also said it has [...] "an incredibly goofy sense of humour", and while Garrity concluded that [...] "promising blend of comedy and horror", the manga [...] "doesn't quite work as comedy or horror", some reviewers appreciated this humor and horror mix. Ed Sizemore of Comics Worth Reading affirmed it is a good reading for those who [...] "like light horror with sense of humor", and Henderson said it is [...] "a light read with just a touch of the shiver factor".|$|E

2500|$|In mid-1917, Colter made known his {{intentions}} {{to run for}} the governorship on the Democratic ticket in 1918. In declaring his intention to run, Colter said: [...] "It has never occurred to me until recently that I could further assist in bringing about better results in the democratic situation by running for State office but, as I have had so many personal requests and letters from all over the state from people who think I am the logical man to get the party together, to counteract the immense Republican machine, I have decided {{to run for the}} governorship of the state." [...] While he was seen as a strong candidate, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> there weren't several strong opponents vying for the Democratic nomination. When the former governor, Hunt, announced that he had no intention on contending for the governorship in 1918, Sidney Osborn was a favorite for the nomination, representing the more conservative arm of the Democratic Party, and Colter established himself as the favorite of what some considered the radical part of the Democrats. While Hunt did not openly endorse him, most of his backers threw their support behind Colter. In late February, another prominent Arizona Democrat, Benjamin Baker [...] "Billy" [...] Moeur announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor at the meeting of the Arizona Cattlemen's Association in Nogales, Arizona. In June, Judge Fred Sutter officially entered the race, although he had been discussed as a possible contender since March. After Sutter's entrance into the race, Hunt officially threw his support behind Colter. In the midst of the race, Colter purchased a large home at the southwest corner of Central Avenue and McKinley Street in Phoenix, for the sum of $20,000.|$|E
