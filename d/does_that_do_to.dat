The advancements of modern medicine, while helping to heal the body, oftentimes neglect the emotional and psychological effects an affliction has on the patient as well as his family and friends. Faith and religion of any sort can be an incredibly effective tool in dealing with such a distressing situation; not as a salve for the physical pain, but in addressing the emotional wounds that may result for both the patient and his loved ones. For example, it is simple to explain the cause of a disease: the mutation of cells or the failure of the immune system. It is infinitely more difficult to explain, and impossible in medical terms, why a certain person was inflicted to begin with. What, in particular, <b>did</b> <b>that</b> person <b>do</b> <b>to</b> “deserve” such misfortune?

500|$|Using {{detailed}} {{information provided by}} Loyalist spies, the grenadier companies searched the small town for military supplies. When they arrived at Ephraim Jones's tavern, by the jail on the South Bridge road, they found the door barred shut, and Jones refused them entry. According to reports provided by local Loyalists, Pitcairn knew cannon had been buried on the property. Jones was ordered at gunpoint to show where the guns were buried. These {{turned out to be}} three massive pieces, firing 24-pound shot, that were much too heavy to use defensively, but very effective against fortifications, with sufficient range to bombard the city of Boston from other parts of nearby mainland. The grenadiers smashed the trunnions of these three guns so they could not be mounted. They also burned some gun carriages found in the village meetinghouse, and when the fire spread to the meetinghouse itself, local resident Martha Moulton persuaded the soldiers to help in a bucket brigade to save the building. Nearly a hundred barrels of flour and salted food were thrown into the millpond, as were 550 pounds of musket balls. Of the damage <b>done,</b> only <b>that</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> the cannon was significant. All of the shot and much of the food was recovered after the British left. [...] During the search, the regulars were generally scrupulous in their treatment of the locals, including paying for food and drink consumed.

60|$|Thus {{advantageously}} was the {{new king}} situated. Will it be believed that {{the first thing he}} <b>did</b> was <b>to</b> destroy his Established Church, root and branch?

It heavily oppressed the people; it kept them always trembling in the gloom of mysterious threatenings; it slaughtered them in sacrifice before its grotesque idols of wood and stone; it cowed them, it terrorized them, it made them slaves to its priests, and through the priests to the king. It was the best friend a king could have, and the most dependable. To a professional reformer who should annihilate so frightful and so devastating a power as this Church, reverence and praise would be due; but to a king who should do it, could properly be due nothing but reproach; reproach softened by sorrow; sorrow for his unfitness for his position.|$|R
