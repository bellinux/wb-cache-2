5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Bamber {{was born}} on 24September 1899 at 23 Zante Street, Liverpool, the eldest {{daughter}} of Hugh Bamber, a bookbinder, and his wife Mary, née Little. Mary had come to Liverpool as a child when her father, a well-to-do Edinburgh lawyer, abandoned his family after his <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> alcoholism and poverty. Liverpool in the late 19th century suffered extremes of deprivation, and had the highest infant mortality rate in the country. Mary became a trade union organiser and campaigner against deplorable social conditions, and established a reputation as an outstanding platform speaker. She was the dominant early influence on her daughter Elizabeth, who formed a lifelong determination to represent and fight for the disadvantaged.|$|E

After unwittingly releasing the Darkwatch's greatest enemy, a vampire lord named Lazarus Malkoth, Jericho is conscripted into the Darkwatch as an elite operative. Jericho, however, is slowly turning into a vampire himself, {{as a result of}} being bitten by Lazarus. The game outlines either Jericho's struggle for humanity or his <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> darkness, depending on the player's actions.|$|E
5|$|In 1392 however, Carrouges {{was present}} {{for one of}} the more notorious occurrences in fourteenth century France; the first <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> madness of King Charles VI. As a chevalier d'honneur, Carrouges {{accompanied}} the King on campaign and thus was present when the Royal Army entered Brittany to hunt for Pierre de Craon, a noble who had fled Paris following a failed attempt to murder Olivier de Clisson, Constable of France. As the army passed Le Mans on 8 August 1392, a loud noise within his entourage startled the French King, who believing himself to be under attack, lashed out at the nearest person to him. The man happened to be his brother Louis of Valois, who turned and fled from his brother's sword. Killing several pages who attempted to calm his temper, the King set off on full pursuit of Louis, leaving the army strung out across the countryside behind him. The pursuit continued for hours until the exhausted King was eventually subdued by his bodyguard, including Jean de Carrouges.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 popular uprisings {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots, and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by General Joan Prim), who {{were concerned about the}} ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. However, the intellectuals behind the Republic were powerless to prevent a <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> chaos. Uprisings were crushed by the military. The old monarchy returned with the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874, as reform was deemed less important than peace and stability. Despite the introduction of universal male suffrage in 1890, elections were controlled by local political bosses (caciques).|$|E

Montgomery was killed leading an assault along with all but one of his officers; his men never got close to the walls. Arnold's force made a <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> the lower town. Early in the battle, Arnold was wounded in the leg, but stayed on the battlefield encouraging his troops on. Daniel Morgan's rifle company, the most successful of the American troops, fought inside the city until Morgan was cornered and forced to surrender.

5|$|In {{the late}} centuries BCE, {{the worship of}} Isis spread from Egypt across the Mediterranean world, and she {{became one of the}} most popular deities in the region. Although this new, {{multicultural}} form of Isis absorbed characteristics from many other deities, her original mythological nature as a wife and mother was key to her appeal. Horus and Osiris, being central figures in her story, spread along with her. The Greek and Roman cult of Isis developed a series of initiation rites dedicated to Isis and Osiris, based on earlier Greco-Roman mystery rites but colored by Egyptian afterlife beliefs. The initiate went through an experience that simulated <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> the underworld. Elements of this ritual resemble Osiris's merging with the sun in Egyptian funerary texts. Isis's Greek and Roman devotees, like the Egyptians, believed that she protected the dead in the afterlife as she had done for Osiris, and they said that undergoing the initiation guaranteed to them a blessed afterlife. It was to a Greek priestess of Isis that Plutarch wrote his account of the myth of Osiris.|$|E
5|$|Matilda's half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} Anglo-Norman barons, controlling estates in Normandy as well as the Earldom of Gloucester. In 1138, he rebelled against Stephen, starting the <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> civil war in England. Robert renounced his fealty to the King and declared his support for Matilda, which triggered a major regional rebellion in Kent and across the south-west of England, although he himself remained in Normandy. Matilda had not been particularly active in asserting her claims to the throne since 1135 and in many ways it was Robert who took the initiative in declaring war in 1138. In France, Geoffrey took advantage of the situation by re-invading Normandy. David of Scotland also invaded the north of England once again, announcing that he was supporting the claim of Matilda to the throne, pushing south into Yorkshire.|$|E

The steep <b>descents</b> <b>into</b> the gorge and sharp turns onto this bridge made it {{dangerous}} for auto traffic. In 1916 the road (then Route 3, renumbered U.S. Route 9W in 1930) was rerouted over a high steel viaduct further downstream, near the site of Fort Montgomery, in 1916. Another bridge was built immediately adjacent in 1936.|$|R

5|$|Pound {{began work}} on The Cantos in earnest after {{relocating}} to Italy. The poems concern good and evil, a <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> hell followed by redemption and paradise. Its hundreds of characters fall into three groupings: those who enjoy hell and stay there; those who experience a metamorphosis and want to leave; and a few who lead the rest to paradiso terrestre. Its composition was difficult and involved several false starts, and he abandoned most of his earlier drafts, beginning again in 1922. The first three appear in Poetry in June–August 1917. The Malatesta Cantos appeared in The Criterion in July 1923, and two further cantos were published in The Transatlantic Review in January 1924.

5|$|Stephen was {{attacked}} {{on several fronts}} during 1138. First, Robert of Gloucester rebelled against the King, starting the <b>descent</b> <b>into</b> civil war in England. An illegitimate son of Henry I and the half-brother of the Empress Matilda, Robert {{was one of the}} most powerful Anglo-Norman barons, controlling estates in Normandy as well as the Earldom of Gloucester. He was known for his qualities as a statesman, his military experience, and leadership ability. Robert had tried to convince Theobald to take the throne in 1135; he did not attend Stephen's first court in 1136 and it took several summons to convince him to attend court at Oxford later that year. In 1138, Robert renounced his fealty to Stephen and declared his support for Matilda, triggering a major regional rebellion in Kent and across the south-west of England, although Robert himself remained in Normandy. In France, Geoffrey of Anjou took advantage of the situation by re-invading Normandy.
