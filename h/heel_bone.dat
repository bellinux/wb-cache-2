5|$|The {{brain of}} Smilodon had sulcal {{patterns}} similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased {{complexity of the}} regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. The <b>heel</b> <b>bone</b> of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests {{it was a good}} jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S.fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening {{to such an extent that}} they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S.fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasion as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey.|$|E

Various techniques of osteosynthesis have been described. This study aimed to determine clinical and radiological outcome after surgical treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures. Fourteen intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus {{were included in}} this retrospective study. Eleven children (2 girls and 9 boys) aged 6 - 16 years (average age 11. 5 years) underwent surgical treatment. One child sustained a Type II open fracture of both calcanei. All injuries occurred after a high-energy trauma; 3 patients had multiple additional fractures. The clinical and radiological postoperative follow up was an average 44 months. In 4 cases, a reduction through a minimally invasive approach and fixation with K-wires or screws could be achieved. Eleven fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with plate osteosynthesis, K-wires or screws. In one case with open fractures of both <b>heel</b> <b>bones,</b> an additional external fixator was applied. The surgical treatment approach adopted enabled the pre-operative Boehler’s angle (average 16 °) to be improved to an average 30 °. In all cases, except for the patient with open fractures, a good functional result and outcome could be achieved. In calcaneal {{fractures in}} childhood, anatomical reduction is the determining factor, as in fractures in adults, whereas the surgical technique {{seems to have no}} influence on clinical outcome in children.

40|$|International audienceIIn 1951 peat cutters {{unearthed}} the bog body of {{an adult}} female dating from the Roman period (AD 78 - 233) in the ‘Damsel’s Bog’ northwest of the villages of Aalden and Zweeloo (province of Drenthe, the Netherlands, fig. 1). The degree of the body’s preservation has now been assessed using atomic force microscopy imaging (AFM) and histology. AFM images of the skin showed evidence of moderate decomposition of collagen fibrils. Although histology revealed moderate decalcification of the bones, the abdominal organs {{were found to be}} very well preserved. Apart from shrinkage and deformation caused by the long immersion in the bog, Zweeloo Woman’s skeleton shows possible signs of a pathological disorder affecting both the forearms and the lower legs. The long bones were measured, the woman’s stature was assessed and a CT scan was carried out to assess the degree of micromelia and the possibility of dwarfism. Although shrinkage had caused overall shortening and deformation of single bones (i. e. the pelvis, <b>heel</b> <b>bones</b> and the femora) altering the stature, the radiological findings show probable evidence of Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (DCS). DCS is a dominantly inherited dysplasia characterised by short stature with mesomelic shortening of middle segments of the forearms and lower legs. Only three cases of probable or indicative DCS have so far been diagnosed in pre-modern societies. Here we propose evidence of a probable case of DCS syndrome in a bog body dating from the Roman period. It has often been suggested (e. g. Asingh 2007, 293) that a substantial number of the individuals that have been found in peat were killed before being deposited in the bog. Zweeloo Woman’s bones show at least 21 cuts made by a short blade instrument. There is however no evidence of any trauma, except possibly in the posterior aspect of the left shoulder, on the outer skin surface. Whether Zweeloo Woman was intentionally killed or died a natural death still remains unclear...|$|R
25|$|Although {{almost all}} ancient sources {{relating}} to crucifixion are literary, the 1968 archeological discovery just northeast of Jerusalem {{of the body}} of a crucified man dated to the 1st century provided good confirmatory evidence that crucifixions occurred during the Roman period roughly according to {{the manner in which the}} crucifixion of Jesus is described in the gospels. The crucified man was identified as Yehohanan ben Hagkol and probably died about 70 AD, around the time of the Jewish revolt against Rome. The analyses at the Hadassah Medical School estimated that he died in his late 20s. Another relevant archaeological find, which also dates to the 1st century AD, is an unidentified <b>heel</b> <b>bone</b> with a spike discovered in a Jerusalem gravesite, now held by the Israel Antiquities Authority and displayed in the Israel Museum.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, archaeologists {{discovered}} at Giv'at ha-Mivtar in northeast Jerusalem {{the remains of}} one Jehohanan, who had been crucified in the 1st century. The remains included a <b>heel</b> <b>bone</b> with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account {{of the length of}} the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that the man had been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5cm (4.53inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright. The skeleton from Giv'at ha-Mivtar is currently the only recovered example of ancient crucifixion in the archaeological record.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains were}} found accidentally in an ossuary with the crucified man's name on it, 'Jehohanan, {{the son of}} Hagakol'.

The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together {{to the front of the}} cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree. Since olive trees are not very tall, this would suggest that the condemned was crucified at eye level.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To gain {{experience}} with adalimumab therapy {{in patients with}} ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to clarify {{the effect of the}} drug on MRI-detectable inflammatory changes (IC) in the vertebral column and heel enthesis with the short-term use of this gene engineering biological. Subjects and methods. This open-label observation included 14 patients diagnosed as having AS in accordance with the modified New York criteria [4] and 3 patients with early undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (uSA). The ESSG criteria were used for the diagnosis of uSA. In addition to the BASDAI index, the new international index for disease activity in AS (ASDAS) proposed by the ASAS group in 2009 was first employed to assess the activity of AS. MRI-detectable IC in the thoracic spine, sacroiliac articulation, AND <b>heel</b> <b>bones</b> (in patients with heel enthesitis) was an additional criterion for AS activity. The results of adalimumab use were assessed at weeks 4 and 14 of the study. The efficiency of therapy was evaluated by the ASAS criteria, 40 % improvement was taken into account, 50 % improvement and partial remission were separately assessed; 50 % improvement was assessed by the BASDAI index. The number of patients who had achieved partial remission after 6 adalimumab injections is the major efficiency criterion. Results. The median (Ме) age of all the patients was 31. 6 years [range 22 - 56]; the Ме disease duration was 72 months [range 11 - 264]. HLA-B 27 was detected in 83 % of the patients. Peripheral arthritis and enthesitis were present in 12 and 9 patients, respectively. Partial remission was recorded in 17. 8 and 41 % of patients after 2 - and 12 -week adalimumab therapy, respectively; 40 % ASAS improvement was observed in 58. 8 and 76. 6 % of patients after 2 - or more and 6 -week therapy, respectively. The BASDAI activity index was decreased by 50 % or more in 47 and 86. 6 % of the patients with the baseline high index after 2 and 6 injections, respectively. The ASDAS activity corresponded to low activity in 67 and 75 % of the patients having the baseline high activity in this index (> 3. 0) after 2 - and 12 -week therapy, respectively. In 3 patients, 100 % clinical improvement in heel enthuses was achieved, as confirmed by MRI data. Although the Ме IC in the thoracic spine substantially diminished from 8 (9) to 0 (1) following 12 -week therapy, the differences were insignificant (p= 0. 07). After 12 -week therapy, thoracic IC completely disappeared in one patient. Conclusion. Adalimumab therapy-induced improvement was frequently seen after just the first two injections of adalimumab and preserved after 12 -week therapy. Adalimumab rapidly and considerably reduces the magnitude of inflammation in the spinal structures and entheses, as evidenced by МЫ data...|$|R

At the end of the study, the median daily vitamin D intake increased to 10. 4 (8. 7) μg (P <. 001), which is 70 % of the adequate intake (15 μg); and calcium density (mg/MJ) was higher over the study period compared with baseline (161 ± 5 mg/MJ vs. 142 ± 4 mg/MJ, P <. 001). Serum 25 (OH) D concentrations increased by 23 ± 2 nmol/L (83 (107) %, P <. 001), yet remained in the insufficient range (mean 45 ± 2 nmol/L). Consumption of greater than the median intake of milk (160 ml/day) (n = 54, 50 %) increased serum 25 (OH) D levels into the adequate range (53 ± 2 nmol/L) and reduced serum parathyroid hormone by 24 % (P =. 045). There was no effect on bone quality, bone turnover markers, muscle strength, or mobility. Consumption of fortified milk increased dietary vitamin D intake and raised serum 25 (OH) D concentrations, but not to the level thought to reduce fracture risk. If calcium-fortified milk also was used in cooking and milk drinks, this approach could allow residents to achieve a dietary calcium intake close to recommended levels.

Thus there are three phalanges in each of the lesser toes, and only two in the great toe, which answers to the thumb. There is a long bone, termed 'metatarsal', answering to the metacarpal, for each digit; and the 'tarsus', which corresponds with the carpus, presents four short polygonal bones in a row, which correspond very closely with the four carpal bones of the second row of the hand. In other respects the foot differs very widely from the hand. Thus the great toe is the longest digit but one; and its metatarsal is far less moveably articulated with the tarsus, than the metacarpal of the thumb with the carpus. But a far more important distinction lies in the fact that, instead of four more tarsal bones there are only three; and, that these three are not arranged side by side, or in one row. One of them, the 'os calcis' or <b>heel</b> <b>bone</b> ('ca'), lies externally, and sends back the large projecting heel; another, the 'astragalus' ('as'), rests on this by one face, and by another, forms, with the bones of the leg, the ankle joint; while a third face, directed forwards, is separated from the three inner tarsal bones of the row next the metatarsus by a bone called the 'scaphoid' ('sc').|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis is the {{greatest}} cause of quality-of-life reductions, morbidity and mortality among postmenopausal women, with growing incidence as populations age. Clinical tools like Osteorisk provide an easy-access and low-cost alternative method that helps physicians to {{reduce the need for}} dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the expensive gold standard examination for diagnosing osteoporosis. The aim here was to study the accuracy of Osteorisk using <b>heel</b> ultrasonography for <b>bone</b> mineral density (BMD). DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study, at Faculdade de Medicina do ABC. METHODS: A structured questionnaire was applied to 615 postmenopausal women, with anthropometric measurements, Osteorisk calculations and quantitative ultrasound on the heel using Sonost 2000 equipment. RESULTS: 461 women were included, with mean age 60 ± 9 years, weight 67. 6 ± 12. 9 kg and body mass index (BMI) 28. 8 ± 5. 0 kg/m². Their Osteorisk classifications were: 61. 0 % low-risk, 28. 4 % medium-risk and 10. 6 % high-risk. Quantitative ultrasound showed 81. 3 % low-risk, 10. 0 % medium-risk and 8. 7 % high-risk regarding osteoporosis. Statistically significant results were observed (p < 0. 001) when Osteorisk was correlated with age, years since menopause and BMI. Correlating these same variables with quantitative ultrasound, statistically significant results were observed for age (p < 0. 001), years since menopause (p < 0. 001) and BMI (p < 0. 006). The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value for Osteorisk were 64 %, 6. 7 %, 89 % and 30. 6 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Osteorisk is a valid tool for screening for women at low risk of osteoporosis, making it possible for these women not to have to undergo densitometry...|$|R
50|$|For example, high arches can {{contribute}} to Haglund's deformity. The Achilles tendon attaches {{to the back of}} the <b>heel</b> <b>bone,</b> and in a person with high arches, the <b>heel</b> <b>bone</b> is tilted backward into the Achilles tendon. This causes the uppermost portion of the back of the <b>heel</b> <b>bone</b> to rub against the tendon. Eventually, due to this constant irritation, a bony protrusion develops and the bursa becomes inflamed. It is the inflamed bursa that produces the redness and swelling associated with Haglund's deformity.|$|E
