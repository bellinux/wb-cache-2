Fossil {{evidence suggests that the}} preferred nursery sites of megalodon were warm-water coastal environments, where threats were minor and food plentiful. Nursery sites were identified in the Gatun Formation of Panama, the Calvert Formation of Maryland, Banco de Concepción in the Canary Islands, and the Bone Valley Formation of Florida. Given that all extant lamniform sharks give birth to live young, this {{is believed to have been}} true of megalodon also. Infant megalodons were around [...] at their smallest, and the pups were vulnerable to predation by other shark species, such as the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> (Sphyrna mokarran) and the snaggletooth shark (Hemipristis serra). Their dietary preferences display an ontogenetic shift: Young megalodon commonly preyed on fish, giant sea turtles, dugongs, and small cetaceans; mature megalodon moved to off-shore areas and consumed large cetaceans.|$|E

The shark uses its very large dorsal fin to help achieve lift, a habit {{that had previously been}} noted in captive specimens, and may spend up to 90% of its time in this swimming orientation. The technique is thought to save ~10% in drag and consequently movement costs.|$|R

50|$|The second-largest hammerhead shark {{after the}} <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark,</b> the smooth hammerhead can {{measure up to}} 5 m long. It is an active {{predator}} that takes {{a wide variety of}} bony fishes and invertebrates, with larger individuals also feeding on sharks and rays. As in the rest of its family, this shark is viviparous and gives birth to litters of 20 - 40 pups. A relatively common shark, it is captured, intentionally or otherwise, by many commercial fisheries throughout its range; its fins are extremely valuable for use in shark fin soup. This shark is potentially dangerous and has likely been responsible for a few attacks on humans, though it is less likely to encounter swimmers than other large hammerhead species due to its temperate habitat.|$|E
50|$|Shark Reef Aquarium was {{the first}} closed-system {{aquarium}} in North America to exhibit a <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark.</b> The female juvenile was less than four feet long when she was accidentally caught {{off the coast of}} Florida. The shark was successfully flown into Mandalay Bay in August 2001 on a record 16-hour flight in a special transportation tank designed specifically for it. It remained in a private quarantine tank for 2.5 years until the in-house aquarium husbandry team decided it had grown large enough where it would not fall prey to the other sharks in the exhibit tank. It measured six feet long when it was finally introduced among big public fanfare into the 1.3 million gallon tank on November 3, 2003 for public exhibition. After more than a year on exhibit, the specimen died suddenly and unexpectedly on December 16, 2004. A necropsy later attributed an intestinal infection as the cause of death. The specimen had grown to 6.5 ft and weighed in at 95 lb at time of death.|$|E

40|$|Animals exhibit various {{physiological}} and behavioural strategies for minimizing travel costs. Fins of aquatic animals play key roles in efficient travel and, for sharks, {{the functions of}} dorsal and pectoral fins are considered well divided: the former assists propulsion and generates lateral hydrodynamic forces during turns and the latter generates vertical forces that offset sharks' negative buoyancy. Here we show that <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> drastically reconfigure the function of these structures, using an exaggerated dorsal fin to generate lift by swimming rolled on their side. Tagged wild sharks spend up to 90 % of time swimming at roll angles between 50 ° and 75 °, and hydrodynamic modelling shows that doing so reduces drag-and in turn, the cost of transport-by around 10 % compared with traditional upright swimming. Employment of such a strongly selected feature for such a unique purpose raises interesting questions about evolutionary pathways to hydrodynamic adaptations, and our perception of form and function...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are known}} to eat a large range of prey {{including}} fish, squid, octopus, crustaceans, and other sharks. Stingrays are a particular favorite. These sharks are often found swimming {{along the bottom of}} the ocean, stalking their prey. Their unique heads are used as a weapon when hunting down prey. The <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> uses its head to pin down stingrays and eats the ray when the ray is weak and in shock.

50|$|Older studies {{based on}} {{morphology}} have generally placed the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> {{as one of}} the more derived members of its family, reflecting the traditional view that cephalofoil size gradually increased over the course of <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> evolution. However, this view has been refuted by phylogenetic analyses using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, which found that the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> and the smooth hammerhead (S. zygaena) form a clade that is basal to all other Sphyrna species. These results also show that the first hammerheads to evolve had large rather than small cephalofoils.|$|R
5|$|In 1950, Enrico Tortonese {{examined}} the Nice and Cayenne specimens of S. tudes (the Coromandel specimen having {{been lost in}} the interim) and concluded that they were not <b>great</b> <b>hammerheads,</b> but rather the same species as S. bigelowi. Carter Gilbert concurred in his 1967 revision of the <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks,</b> noting that while the lost Coromandel specimen was probably a <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead,</b> none of the existing material belonged to that species. Thus, Sphyrna tudes became the accepted name for the smalleye hammerhead, taking precedence over S. bigelowi because it was published earlier, and the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> received the next available name Sphyrna mokarran. Gilbert designated the Nice specimen as the lectotype that would define S. tudes, having priority over the Cayenne specimen (the paralectotype).

40|$|Preliminary {{validation}} of annual growth band deposition in vertebrae of <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> (Sphyrna mokarran) {{was conducted by}} using bomb radiocarbon analysis. Adult specimens (n= 2) were collected and thin sections of vertebral centra were removed for visual aging and use in radiocarbon assays.

A total of 10 samples were extracted from growth bands and analyzed for Δ 14 C. Calculated Δ 14 C values from dated bands were compared to known-age reference chronologies, and the resulting patterns indicated annual periodicity of growth bands up to a minimum age of 42 years. Trends in Δ 14 C across time in individual specimens indicated that vertebral radiocarbon is conserved through time but that habitat and diet may inf luence Δ 14 C levels in elasmobranchs. Although the age validation reported here must be considered preliminary {{because of the small}} sample size and narrow age range of individuals sampled, it represents the first confirmation of age in S. mokarran, further illustrating the usefulness of bomb radiocarbon analysis as a tool for life history studies in elasmobranchs...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> (Sphyrna mokarran) is {{the largest}} species of <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark,</b> {{belonging}} to the family Sphyrnidae, attaining a maximum length of 6.1 m. It is found in tropical and warm temperate waters worldwide, inhabiting coastal areas and the continental shelf. The <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> can be distinguished from other hammerheads by the shape of its [...] "hammer" [...] (called the [...] "cephalofoil"), which is wide with an almost straight front margin, and by its tall, sickle-shaped first dorsal fin. A solitary, strong-swimming apex predator, the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> feeds {{on a wide variety}} of prey ranging from crustaceans and cephalopods, to bony fish, to smaller sharks. Observations of this species in the wild suggest that the cephalofoil functions to immobilize stingrays, a favored prey. This species has a viviparous mode of reproduction, bearing litters of up to 55 pups every two years.|$|R
50|$|The {{streamlined}} {{body of the}} <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead</b> with the expanded cephalofoil {{is typical of the}} <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks.</b> Adult <b>great</b> <b>hammerheads</b> can be distinguished from the scalloped hammerhead and the smooth hammerhead by the shape of the cephalofoil, which has a nearly straight front margin (as opposed to arched), with prominent medial and lateral indentations. The width of the cephalofoil is 23 - 27% of the body length. The teeth are triangular and strongly serrated, becoming more oblique towards the corners of the mouth. There are 17 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} upper jaw with 2 - 3 teeth at the symphysis (the midline of the jaw), and 16 - 17 teeth on either side of the lower jaw and 1 - 3 at the symphysis.|$|R
5|$|Four {{other species}} of <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and bonnethead, and the large-sized {{scalloped}} <b>hammerhead</b> and <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead.</b> Little competition occurs between these species because of their differing habitats and dietary preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits the utility of vision (hence its smaller eyes). Adult males and juveniles of both sexes form schools of uniform body size; these schools {{do not appear to}} relate to reproduction or migration. Adult females are apparently solitary.|$|R

5000|$|Reproduction occurs {{only once}} a year for <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks,</b> and usually occurs with the male shark biting the female shark violently until she agrees to mate with him. The <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> exhibit a {{viviparous}} mode of reproduction with females giving birth to live young. Like other sharks, fertilization is internal, with the male transferring sperm to the female through one of two intromittent organs called claspers. The developing embryos are at first sustained by a yolk sac. When the supply of yolk is exhausted, the depleted yolk sac transforms into a structure analogous to a mammalian placenta (called a [...] "yolk sac placenta" [...] or [...] "pseudoplacenta"), through which the mother delivers sustenance until birth. Once the baby sharks are born, they are not {{taken care of by}} the parents in any way. Usually, a litter cosists of 12 to 15 pups, except for the <b>great</b> <b>hammerhead,</b> which gives birth to litters of 20 to 40 pups.
