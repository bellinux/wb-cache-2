5000|$|Western Idaho Fair's {{historical}} precursor was the Idaho Intermountain Fair, first held in 1897. As {{with many}} fairs of its era it was primarily an agricultural and livestock exhibition; sheep, cattle, horses and <b>hogs</b> were <b>shipped</b> to Boise {{from all over}} the West for the event.In the spring of 1902, the fair association purchased 84 acre of land on the present-day corner of Fairview and Orchard and moved the fair to that site. [...] This was also the year that the fair welcomed William S. Cody’s (a.k.a. Buffalo Bill’s) Wild West Show. [...] The fair of 1913 included its first full-fledged rodeo, called the Boise Stampede.

5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} long on keel and narrow of beam (width) {{to allow for}} {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit <b>hogging</b> (warping); the <b>ships</b> were given extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States Navy could not match the navies of the European states for size. He therefore designed his frigates {{to be able to}} overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|R

50|$|The town of Gibbs was an {{outgrowth}} of the Santa Fe Railroad, laid out in 1887 when the rail lines passed through southeastern Adair County. The name Gibbs was chosen in honor of Frank W. Gibbs, who donated land to the Santa Fe Railroad {{for the construction of a}} rail depot and stockyard. At the time of Gibbs' incorporation in 1894, it was anticipated that the town might become Adair County's main rail shipping point for the Santa Fe. This hope was bolstered by the fact that the road leading to Gibbs was the first all-weather road in the county. In the late 1800s a considerable amount of cattle and <b>hogs</b> were <b>shipped</b> from the Gibbs depot to packing houses in Chicago, along with seasonal carloads of fresh apples, strawberries, and eggs to points across America. Perrin & Company of Chicago also constructed a grain elevator trackside for the storage and shipping of corn, with lesser amounts of barley, oats, and wheat. The addition of a second Santa Fe trackline next to the existing one in 1908 added to Gibbs residents hopes for a bright future.|$|R

50|$|The village grew {{rapidly and}} {{within five years}} had a {{population}} of more than 300. In 1877, it was described as the railroad and trading point for a large section of farming country. Along with transporting people to and from the area the railroad would also transport timber, limestone and produce to markets throughout Michigan. In the early 1900s, the railroad also was used by local farmers to <b>ship</b> <b>hogs</b> and cattle to Detroit. Stages were also running daily from Saginaw to Caro. The depot served both railroads, as two train order boards were present. (One on a mast for the NYC and one on the building for the PM). Reese Crossing was not an interlocking but it was protected by a target that was set by approaching train crews. The east-west route is that of the Pere Marquette, and the north-south route going by the grain elevator is the Michigan Central branch line between Denmark Jct. and Bay City. The target was set vertical for a Michigan Central movement on the Denmark Jct. Branch.|$|R
5000|$|Townsend began {{farming in}} 1951 on a 225 acre tract, {{subsequently}} extended to a 2200 acre operation near Hartford City, {{the seat of}} Blackford County in east central Indiana. The farm spills over into neighboring Grant County. Townsend Farms maintains some 2,400 <b>hogs</b> and <b>ships</b> some 1,000 per week to the market. At the age of thirty-two, Townsend was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 1958, a heavily Democratic year nationally. Thereafter, he was elevated to the State Senate. He is a firm advocate of public education, having served on the team that worked for passage of the School Reorganization Act of 1959 and its reauthorization in 1965. Townsend recalls that his late father peppered conversations {{at the kitchen table}} with discussion of national and world affairs. Education was rooted in Townsend's upbringing even though neither of his parents went beyond the eighth grade. Despite limited family resources, Townsend completed a degree in agriculture at Purdue. He was also for eight years a trustee of Earlham College, a Quaker institution in Richmond, Indiana, before he was invited to join the Purdue board. In 2006, Townsend campaigned for his nephew, Joseph R. [...] "Joe" [...] Pearson (born 1943), a Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Republican Secretary of State Todd Rokita, who won a second term. Pearson, also from Hartford City, graduated from Ball State University in Muncie with a doctorate in education. Townsend declared that Pearson is [...] "cut from the same cloth" [...] as former Senator Bayh and former U.S. Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, the co-chairman of the 9-11 Commission. Prior to his failed statewide race, Pearson had been the assistant commissioner of agriculture under Governor Evan Bayh (now U.S. senator and son of Birch Bayh), and then Governors O'Bannon and Joe Kernan. In 2008 Joe Pearson was elected into the Indiana House of Representatives.|$|R

5000|$|Nichols was {{established}} in the early 1870s in an area of Section 15 of Pike Township known locally as Elephant Swamp. The community was intended as a rail town for the shipment of agriculture products and furs to distant markets, and had been constructed on land donated to the rail company by Samuel and Benjamin Nichols with the intention of establishing a rail depot. The lots for the future community were surveyed by county surveyor George Bumgardner in June, 1871. Two rail lines would eventually run through the town - the Muscatine & Western Railroad and the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railroad - which were both branches of the Rock Island system. The first rail line and rail depot was constructed in the early 1870s. Dr. S. H. Smith constructed the first building on the future site of Nichols in 1871, which Mr Smith used as both a drug store and as a home. Construction on the Muscatine & Western Railroad reached the site in 1873, and the rail company laid out an addition to the town, calling it Railroad Addition. At first many of the buildings and homes in the community were log cabins, which were then replaced by more permanent brick buildings. Benjamin Nichols established the first post office in 1870 and served as the first postmaster. The first school was built in 1872. In the winter of 1873-1874 a Christian church was organized with services being held in schoolhouses until the construction of the church in 1874, with services being conducted by Rev. John Powell. The German Evangelical Protestant Church was organized in 1874 by Rev. K. F. Obermann. The Catholic church - Church of St. Mary - was built in 1874 with Father Nicholas Dugan serving as its first pastor. A Methodist church was organized in 1875 by J. A. Bolton. The town soon grew with the addition of several banks, an opera house, and a town hall that had been constructed in 1897. The early economy of the community centered on the two rail lines that ran through the community as well as the buying and shipping of furs as well as agriculture. The Foley and Brugman Brothers operated two large grain elevators which held 15,000 bushels each. Cattle and <b>hogs</b> were also <b>shipped</b> out to markets through the rail lines.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{at the request}} of the Manitoba Pork Council in order to assess the impact of the Country Of Origin Labeling (COL) provisions of the US Farm Bill. The Council needs to know the consequences (economic and otherwise) of COL upon Manitoba hog farmers. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the Farm Bill) contains a provision that requires the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to issue country of origin labeling guidelines for voluntary use by retailers who wish to notify their customers of the country of origin of beef (including veal), lamb, pork, fish, perishable agricultural commodities, and peanuts. The Farm Bill also requires that a mandatory country of origin labeling program be in place by September 30, 2004. Development of this mandatory program will begin in April 2003 and will likely be based on these voluntary program guidelines from the current interim period as well as related input the USDA receives. The covered commodities include: muscle cuts of beef(including veal), lamb, and pork; ground beef, ground lamb, and ground pork; farm-raised fish and shellfish; wild fish and shellfish; perishable agricultural commodities (fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables); and peanuts. The law excludes food items from country of origin labeling when a covered commodity is an "ingredient in a processed food item. " The law does not apply to covered products sold at food service. In the case of beef, lamb, and pork products, the law states that a retailer may use a "United States Country of Origin" label only if the product is from an animal that was exclusively born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States. The country of origin for covered products produced in their final form outside of the United States is the exporting country. That is, fresh muscled pork from Canada would be considered "product of Canada", regardless of where the animal was born or raised. Products that were produced in both foreign markets and in the United States would be labeled to identify what production processes occurred in a foreign market and what production processes occurred in the United States. For example, a product could bear a label that states, "born in Canada, raised and processed in the United States". Another combination might be born and raised in Canada and processed in the United States. Permutations and combinations involving three countries are also possible. Retailers and their suppliers will have to maintain a verifiable audit trail on covered commodities to substantiate country of origin labeling claims. Records must be retained for two years. Retailers must ensure that a verifiable audit trail is maintained through contracts or other means, recognizing that suppliers throughout the production/marketing chain have a responsibility to maintain the necessary supporting records. The following are some of the key points derived from the George Morris Centre research into the issue: *The purpose of COL is to impede or restrict imports of the covered products or the live animal inputs. In that regard it is crucial to note that the Canadian pork industry depends on the US for 35 - 40 % of the market for hogs. *Very little is definitely known about the costs of COL and what it will take to comply with a mandatory program. Most industry participants in the US remain uncertain or uninformed about the true ramifications. *Most US packers will not buy Canadian hogs if COL is mandatory because cost is seen as being too high compared to simply handling US hogs. *US packers may try to help increase the number of sows in the US to maintain plant utilization by investing in sow operations *US retailers believe consumers don't care, the information is of no value, and will buy from Canada if their cost does not increase substantially. Therefore: 1. At best, Canadian packers will benefit because pork will trade with the US, but hogs won't. Canadian pork may be able to command a premium in the US or export market because it is labeled, and conforms to specified quality characteristics or protocols. However, in every situation in the past like this when US and Canadian hog prices were disconnected (eg countervail, strikes), hog prices fell in Canada relative to the US. 2. At worst, Canada will either lose a substantial export market or retain it only at a significant price discount. Based on this research, we identified alternative scenarios and estimated their economic consequences. In the negative scenario (2 above), we estimate: * Canadian hog and pork industry could lose over 450 hog farms and farm income totaling over $ 350 million. * Feed mills would close * A market for 250, 000 acres of cropland would be lost. * Including grain farms, losses could be up to $ 750 million in farm income could be lost along with over 3, 000 farms. Strategic Implications At the most general level, the obvious strategic objectives in response to COL are to put a process in place that maximizes the opportunity for Canadian pork to benefit from labeling, while minimizing the risk of the negative scenario. What does this mean in a practical sense? Maximizing Opportunities The opportunities are to increase sales of Canadian labeled, (likely branded) product on US or Asian retail shelves. The former builds on the labeling requirement. The latter, especially, builds on the fact that the US will likely have a shortage of supply if COL becomes mandatory and, therefore, will need to short some customers, most likely the export market. Both build on the assumption that Canadian pigs will not be shipped to the US, and will need to be slaughtered in Canada. Moreover, the nature of the COL regulations should make transactions costs lower for the Canadian industry than for the US. This will give Canadian product a cost advantage. Increased sales can also result from higher prices if there is a basis for product differentiation. Some or all of the following are required to maximize the opportunities: *Product information that can be used to successfully brand Canadian product. If such information exists, Canada may be able to benefit from both volume and price. Is there supportable research information on food safety, carcass quality, environmental benefits, etc that can be used as a claim for pork from Canada, or from a set of Canadian farms and plants? What protocols need to be put in place to ensure that the benefits claimed are actually delivered? If there is no scientific basis for claims, is there a marketing approach that will allow successful branding. *Shelf space incentives. Increasingly it is important to pay retailers incentives to secure shelf space. If Canada has the basis to brand and differentiate fresh pork, especially in the US market, then we also need to have the financial resources to secure shelf space. This suggests an industry approach that would, perhaps, include processors, with partially or fully matching dollars from a fund set up with producer, federal and provincial money. This may take the form of some of the funds the US established for market development in the most recent farm bill. *Finishing and nursery spaces. If Canadian <b>hogs</b> can't be <b>shipped</b> to the US, then the equivalent number of nursery and finishing spaces need to be built in Canada. With the risk afforded by the COL, financial institutions will be reluctant to make funds available. NIMBY issues because of environmental concerns need to be overcome. Therefore, two aspects of public policy need to be instituted: o Provincial governments need to quickly ensure that environmental requirements rigorously protect a environment, while supporting responsible economic development o Most likely, loan guarantees that are specific to the hazard presented by COL should be put in place to ensure the availability of capital. o Alternative pricing and risk management mechanisms need to be explored to replace the links to US futures and cash markets. Minimizing the Risk of COL By far the best way to minimize the risk that COL will not have the devastating consequences that are outlined above is to help the US decide that COL is not good for them. This includes: *Providing analysis that indicates the economic cost to the US. To date, the analysis in US has focused on the costs of compliance by their packers and farmers - ie the cost of segregation and paper work. It has not measured the economic costs of lost capacity utilization of packing plants and/or finishing operations, the costs to consumers, or, conversely, the economic and environmental costs of increasing the US sow herd enough to offset the loss in Canadian hogs. This can be done based on the same scenarios we used in the current study to estimate the impacts on Canada. *Ensuring that the analysis gets appropriately provided into the US political system. This likely means coordinating efforts by Canadian producer associations, federal and provincial governments, and US trade associations to hire lobbyists who will develop a lobbying strategy and implement the flow of information into the congressional and executive branches most effectively. *Investigate all possible avenues to prosecute COL under either NAFTA or WTO rules. This includes, if possible, the possibility of prosecution before it is mandatory: if not, any reparations may be unable to offset the damage. This likely needs to be done as part of the lobby effort listed above. Concluding Comment This is a preliminary exploration of strategic responses. There may be additional steps and some of those discussed here may require further analysis. However, they seem logical given the situation. What is clear is that this is a time when commitment is needed by the industry and government. COL is a clear threat to one of the most vibrant aspects of Canada's Agri-food sector. It needs to be dealt with quickly and with determination. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R
