40|$|A key {{contributor}} to excessive energy usage in UK domestic dwellings is the poor temperature regulation of fluid filled heat emitters {{that form the}} most common constituent of central heating systems. This is in-part due to oversizing of the heat emitters, and deficiencies in localised closed-loop temperature control.

Following previous reported work, therefore, this paper presents a new family of Recursive Modelling Model Predictive Controllers (RM-MPCs) for use with low cost thermic CRVs. The ability of the presented control methodologies to maintain superior temperature regulation despite the use of oversized heat emitters, is a key contribution of the paper.

40|$|Many of the {{building}} concepts for current and future-efficient buildings are based on highly-insulated envelopes, such passive houses, zero emission buildings or nearly-zero energy buildings (nZEB).

A reduction in this rate of heat loss can be achieved by replacing the single glazing by double glazing. However, a much lower capital-cost, energy-thrift option, which is considered here, merely requires installing a suitably designed horizontal shelf between the radiator and the window. By optimising the geometry of this shelf, placed between the two buoyancy-driven air flows, i. e. downwards from the window and upwards from the radiator, a reduction in the steady-state rate of heat loss through an experimental window of ~ 14 % of the radiator output has been achieved, resulting in a simple pay-back period for the installation of the shelf of ~ 2 years. The wide variations in the dimensions of windows and radiators as well as their relative placements and surface temperatures preclude a simple optimal thermal design of the horizontal shelf, which is suitable for all occasions, being proposed. However, significant improvements in the system's energy performance (i. e. lower rates of heat loss through the window) will be achieved when the following are employed: either (1) a straight horizontal shelf, protruding from the wall by 84 mm; or (2) a horizontal shelf, with a curved underside of radius 98 mm, when the protrusion from the wall is 98 mm. ...|$|E

At pixel temperatures higher than approximately 1500 - 2000 K, radiative losses will begin to dominate over conductive losses. We explore the physics of this regime and find that the peak temperature is determined primarily by the power input, emissivity and emitting area. The speed of radiatively limited pixels is also examined and found to be considerably more complicated than that of conductively limited pixels since both loss terms play significant roles in the pixel’s dynamic behavior. In order to attain the higher temperatures required, development work will be required on two fronts: materials science and advanced, higher power drive circuitry. Some of the critical issues related to these tasks are discussed...|$|R
