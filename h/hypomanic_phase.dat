40|$|Plasma {{cortisol}} suppression following 1 mg dexamethasone {{administration was}} investigated in patients with affective disorders. Twenty-nine depressed outpatients, 8 bipolar depressed inpatients during manic or <b>hypomanic</b> <b>phase,</b> and twelve healthy volunteers entered the study. Depressed patients were divided into 2 groups according to Research Diagnostic Criterio of Spitzer et al. (1978). The first group consisted of 10 patients affected by minor depressive disorders. The second group was formed of 19 patients with major depressive disorders (7 bipolar, 12 unipolar). No difference between patients and controls was found in baseline 4. 00 p. m. serum cortisol levels. Healthy volunteers, patients with minor depressive disorders and bipolar subjects in manic or <b>hypomanic</b> <b>phase</b> showed normal suppression. On the other hand, only 42 % of patients with major depressive disorders showed suppression. These results suggest that altered response to dexamethasone is a state-dependent phenomenon. Moreover, a dexamethasone suppression test is able to identify subgroups of suppressor in affected patients...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with bipolar {{disorder}} typically present to physicians in the depressed {{rather than the}} manic or <b>hypomanic</b> <b>phase</b> of illness. Because the depressive episodes in {{bipolar disorder}} may be indistinguish-able from those in major depressive disorder (MDD), misdiagnosis may occur. OBJECTIVES: To estimate from administrative claims data and a telephone survey the prevalence of potential misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder among patients with MDD and the humanistic (health-related quality of life [HRQOL] and disability) effects associated with misdiagnosis in a managed care setting. METHODS: Administrative claims data were used to identify patients with medical claims for MDD from a database of 9 million members of commer-cial health plans from 3 U. S. regions. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) adults aged 18 years or older; (b) at least 2 medical claims, includin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTEMPPO is an observational, {{cross-sectional}} and multicentre study, {{initiated in}} the French metropolitan territory in 2009. Set {{up from a}} random sample of 135 psychiatrists, it has observed the procedures for therapeutic management of a population (n= 619) of their outpatients (respectively 197 and 422 in public and private practice) with bipolar disorder type I or II disorders (DSM-IV). The patients who were followed were mostly very sick. Every patient received a pharmacological treatment. The prescription included at least one mood stabilizer or an antipsychotic (71 % atypical) in 78 % and 56 % of cases respectively. Treatment regimen changes were frequent (61 % of patients had at least one change in treatment during the last 12 months). A single molecule by therapeutic class was generally prescribed. The presence of an antipsychotic in combination therapy was often associated with the severity or difficulty of care of the patient (mixed states, severity of the global functioning impairment, manic states, high number of hospitalizations and history of suicide attempt). The combination of two antipsychotics is found only in the difficult situations of manic states. Patients with severe depressive phase are those who benefit from the combination mood stabilizer+antipsychotic+antidepressant (16 % of the sample). In this study, the prescription of antidepressants significantly differs from recommendations for good prescribing practices. Indeed antidepressants were commonly prescribed in mixed-phase (63 %), particularly as a monotherapy in 5 % of cases. It was also found in patients in euthymic phase (48 %), manic phase (12 %) and <b>hypomanic</b> <b>phase</b> (29 %). The prescription of atypical antipsychotics (monotherapy or combination) is now fully established in the management of all phases of the disease. The importance of non-pharmacological treatment is acknowledged by psychiatrists and proposed whether a psychotherapeutic support, information about the disease and/or lifestyle changes. The data collected in this study allowed to demonstrate that the participant psychiatrists have a pharmacological management of patients with bipolar disorder mostly in line with national and international guidelines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bipolar {{depression}} is more common, disabling, and diffi cult-to-treat than the manic and <b>hypomanic</b> <b>phases</b> that defi ne bipolar disorder. Unlike {{the treatment of}} so-called “unipolar” depressions, antidepressants generally are not indicated as monotherapies for bipolar depressions and recent studies suggest that-even when used in combination with traditional mood stabiliz-ers – antidepressants may have questionable value for bipolar depression. The current practice is that mood stabilizers are initiated fi rst as monotherapies; however, the antidepressant effi cacy of lithium and valproate is modest at best. Within this context the role of atypical antipsychotics is being evaluated. The combination of olanzapine and the antidepressant fl uoxetine was the fi rst treatment to receive regulatory approval in the US specifi cally for bipolar I depression. Quetiapine was the second medication to be approved for this indication, largely {{as the result of}} two pivotal trials known by the acronyms of BOLDER (BipOLar DEpRession) I and II. Both studies demonstrated that two doses of quetiapine (300 mg and 600 mg given once daily at bedtime) were signifi cantly more effective than placebo, with no increased risk of patients switching into mania. Pooling the two studies, quetiapine was effective for both bipolar I and bipolar II depressions and for patients with (and without) a history of rapid cycling. The tw...|$|R

Head-to-head studies are needed comparing quetiapine to the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination. Longer-term studies are needed to confirm the persistence of response and to better gauge effects on metabolic profiles across months of therapy. A prospective study of patients specifically seeking treatment for rapid cycling and those with a history of treatment-emergent affective shifts also is needed. Despite the caveats, as treatment guidelines are revised to incorporate new data, the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine monotherapy must be given serious consideration...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{determine}} the neural correlates of Bipolar Disorder (BD) using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in different {{phases of the}} illness. Methods Five fMRI studies were conducted in adult female BD patients and healthy matched comparison subjects. The first two studies examined patients with bipolar depression and hypomania using captioned-pictures to characterize mood-state related patterns of activation. The subsequent three studies investigated BD euthymia using emotional words and faces to identify a potential trait-marker. Results During depression, bipolar patients demonstrated additional subcortical activation in the thalamus, amygdala, hypothalamus and medial globus pallidus. In hypomania, patients again had additional subcortical activation involving the caudate and the thalamus. In both studies patients had prefrontal cortex activation, but the pattern differed from that in healthy subjects. These studies suggested a pattern of mood-state related subcortical recruitment for emotional processing in BD. The next set of studies examined euthymic BD patients to partition trait and state-markers. The first study used implicit positive and negative word-associated affect and found diminished responses to positive and negative affective words as compared to healthy subjects in both cortical and subcortical brain regions, in particular the cingulate, thalamus and caudate. The second study used the emotional Stroop task to elicit implicit affective processing and euthymic patients had less cortical and subcortical activation in response to affect, in particular decreased left ventral prefrontal cortex (BA 47) activation. The final study used explicit emotional processing of fear and disgust to examine affective responses, and showed that patients were generally less responsive to disgust, but had comparatively greater activations to fear. Conclusions BD patients have a likely deficit in the ventral prefrontal cortex that is evident in euthymia. Prefrontal cognitive appraisal of emotions is constrained in euthymic, depressed and <b>hypomanic</b> <b>phases,</b> reflected in subcortical changes that suggest additional processing. The likely cause for this is a functional prefrontal cortex deficit that results in compensatory changes in emotional processing systems. Treatment probably stabilizes these systems without normalizing them. Our studies demonstrate the benefits of examining BD in its different phases, and future studies should attempt to emulate this in medication-free patients...|$|R
