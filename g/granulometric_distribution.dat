40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to compare the solubility, {{wettability}} and <b>granulometric</b> <b>distribution</b> of a cocoa powder beverage, which went through the following process: simple blending; blending and lecithination (0. 3; 0. 5; 0. 8 and 1. 0 % of soy lecithin) and blending, lecithination (0. 3; 0. 5; 0. 8 and 1. 0 % of soy lecithin) and agglomeration. Comparing the product obtained with the simple blending process and the lecithinated product, the conclusion is that the presence of lecithin improves the powder beverage solubility in all the conditions used. The agglomeration process, after lecithination, improves the solubility of the product, which was determined in this article using the retention index - RI.

40|$|The {{objective}} of most data fusion algorithms is to combine information made available by various sensors synergistically {{in order to}} enhance the overall level of information. Since information obtained from data sources such as sensors is often incomplete or imprecise in nature, the application of data fusion techniques has evoked interest in a number of fields ranging from robotics to nondestructive evaluation (NDE). In NDE applications, such techniques can be used to integrate and fuse data obtained using multiple inspection modalities to produce a more comprehensive picture of the condition of the test specimen. As an example, ultrasonic and eddy current imaging techniques are used very widely to inspect a variety of materials. Each technique offers inspection capabilities and limitations that are dictated by the underlying material/energy interaction process. The information generated using the two methods can be construed either as complementary or redundant in nature. Ideally {{it should be possible to}} utilize the redundant information to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Likewise, it should be possible to fuse the complementary information from the two tests to increase the overall level of information made available to the analyst. Unfortunately the task of segmenting data as noise, redundant and complementary components of information can be frustrating. Consequently, most of the approaches proposed to date in NDE have relied on alternate methods;This dissertation proposes a new algorithm for fusing ultrasonic and eddy current images employing morphological imaging processing approaches. The fusion is accomplished in two stages. The first stage basically employs morphological approaches to reduce unwanted artifacts such as speckle noise in the ultrasonic image.

40|$|The city of Naples (Italy) is densely {{inhabited}} {{and rich}} in history, the area having been exploited for human settlements since the 7 th century BC (Fig. 1). Hence examining its geomorphological and palaeoenvironmental history {{is no simple}} task. For the last 20 years, archaeological excavations during {{the construction of the}} Naples metro have offered the possibility to conduct in-depth geoarchaeological research in the city and initiate fruitful collaboration between the Department of Earth Sciences, Environment and Resources of the University of Naples, the Archaeological Heritage Office of Naples and Pompei, and CEREGE, University of Aix-Marseille. During these years, geoarchaeological studies have sought to clarify the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the coastline to the east (Irollo, 2005; Ruello, 2008; Allevato et al., 2009, 2010; Amato et al., 2009; Carsana et al., 2009) and west of Naples (Romano et al., 2013) during the last 5000 years. Research has also led to speculation {{about the history of the}} relative sea level and local ground movements during the last 5000 years (Cinque et al., 2011; Romano et al., 2013) for the area now covered by the modern city. Here we present an overview of the different techniques used and the relative contributions made in reconstructing both the mid-late Holocene landscape evolution of the coastal sector of Naples and the palaeoenvironmental changes which occurred in the recently discovered Graeco-Roman harbour between the Hellenistic period and Late Antiquity. In particular two coastal sectors of Naples are analyzed, called “Bay of Chiaia” and “Municipio” (Fig. 2). The research started by examining the detailed computerized maps (1 : 1000) available for the city. In order to elaborate a digital elevation model of the topography (DEM), the cartographic base was loaded into specific map management software (ArcGis 9. 3). To begin DEM processing it was necessary to extract from the cartography only the elevation points and a few contour lines in order to create and organize a precise dataset. These data were integrated with others obtained from a photogrammetric survey (1 : 11500) performed during the 1990 s commissioned by the Department for Postseismic Intervention in Campania and Basilicata. To obtain a correct DEM, the elevation points of man-made structures like roads and buildings were eliminated from the data input. The procedure chosen for the interpolation was ‘Topo to Raster’, an interpolation method specifically designed for the creation of hydrologically correct digital elevation models. This method uses an iterative finite difference interpolation technique. It is optimized to have the computational efficiency of local interpolation methods, such as inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation, without losing the surface continuity of global interpolation methods, such as Kriging and Spline. It is also the only ArcGIS interpolator specifically designed to work with contour inputs. Water is the primary erosive force determining the general shape of most landscapes. ‘Topo to Raster’ uses the knowledge of surfaces and imposes constraints on the interpolation process that results in a connected drainage structure and correct representation of ridges and streams. The obtained DEM was used as input data to obtain a contour map in countering with equidistance between the contour lines of 1 m and a slope map. The morphological analysis carried out on DEM and on the topographic base obtained, combined with stratigraphic data from boreholes at various points in the city, was used to recognize and reconstruct the geomorphological setting and the palaeodrainage network in order to speculate about their origin and history. The bibliographic study of the archaeological finds and their relative location in the surrounding area gave the opportunity to obtain information about the evolution of both the topographic surface and the palaeomorphology. Each archaeological find was organized into a geoarchaeological dataset and accompanied by the geographic location in the UTM system, its description, elevation and literary source. Archaeological finds useful for palaeo-topographic reconstruction were plotted in specific geological sections in order to understand their relationship with palaeoenvironmental conditions. The rich and very detailed cartography from the many representations of the city at various periods in its history (i. e. Strozzi, 1473; Lafréry- Du Pérac, 1566; Baratta, 1629; Stopendael, 1663; Duke of Noja, 1775; Russo, 1815) was analysed in order to improve the reconstruction of the palaeodrainage network and the ancient morphologies (marine terraces, fault scarp etc.) deleted from the current very dense urban context. By this approach we were able to view the landscape changes connected with urban development in a time range between the Early Middle Ages and the Modern Era. The palaeoenvironmental reconstructions involved an intense and detailed phase of field surveys in the excavation areas (AM: Arco Mirelli dig, SP: San Pasquale dig; MN: Municipio dig) (Fig. 2). The latter were designed to investigate a large number of vertical sections in detail (scale 1 : 100 / 1 : 10). Sedimentary facies were defined by analyzing the external bedding and internal organization concerned with the properties of the clasts such as colour, dimension, degree of rounding, and with the properties of the sediments like sorting, presence or absence of sedimentary structures and global arrangement. Field surveys also helped define the relationship between the geological processes and human pressure in the palaeolandscape. Stratigraphic units were reconstructed and dated by means of their archaeological content. During the field surveys tephrostratigraphic analysis was also carried out. The pyroclastic deposits interbedded in the sequences were measured and described in order to assess their emplacement mechanism. Correlation of these with well-known tephra deposits from the two volcanic districts in proximity to Naples, the Phlegrean Fields and Vesuvius, was made on the basis of their lithology and mineralogy, providing other chronological constraints for the reconstructions. All field surveys were integrated with the palaeoenvironmental information derived from a large number of boreholes drilled in the coastal sector. To improve the palaeoenvironmental reconstructions obtained, laboratory techniques concerned with particle size, palaeontological (macro-microfauna) were conducted on stratigraphic logs. In particular, granulometric analysis was carried out by wet sieving in order to separate coarse, sand and fine (silt+clay) fractions. The results were plotted in vertical-depth diagrams in order to recognize the change in granulometric characteristics along the stratigraphic sequence and in triangular graphs to group sedimentological layers with the same granulometric characteristics. As regards palaeoenvironmental evolution in the area, macrofauna and microfauna (Ostracods) species were grouped according to their palaeoecological environment and plotted in vertical-depth diagrams of taxa <b>distributions.</b> <b>Granulometric</b> and biostratigraphic variables were treated by a statistical approach: for granulometric data, statistical parameters of Folk and Ward (1957) such as mean size, sorting, skewness and kurtosis were calculated in order to obtain precise information about transport capability and degree of sorting of the depositional means; biostratigraphic data were treated with compositional analysis techniques (PCA). In order to combine samples into homogeneous groups, cluster analysis techniques were used. Thanks to the contribution made by all these disciplines and techniques, we are able to offer insights into coastal changes between preprotohistoric times and the Modern Era, and shed light in particular on the actual location of the ancient harbour of Neapolis and its palaeoenvironmental evolution from its foundation to its filling. These results are represented by geological sections and by palaeogeographic scenarios reconstructed on the DEM illustrating the main geomorphological features and the shorelines positions for different temporal steps. Pre-protohistoric Age (Fig. 3) Bay of Chiaia: Throughout the prehistoric period, the Bay of Chiaia, in “Arco Mirelli” and “San Pasquale” digs is characterized by submerged beach environment, affected by sporadic alluvial episodes. It has been possible to show, for the period prehistoric, an high and rocky coast landscape, characterized by a backward paleofalesia with respect to the current coastline. At the end of the prehistoric period we see a paleoenvironmental change of Chiaia coastal sector, caused by the deposition of pyroclastic products of Agnano Monte Spina and Astroni Eruptions. Indeed, field evidences in the studied areas show an intertidal environment abrasion platform, corresponding to the pyroclastic products of Agnano Monte Spina and Astroni Eruptions. Such platform is then covered by the volcanic products of Pomici di Avellino Eruption. Municipio sector The maximum of the post-glacial sea level rise, along the east coast of Naples, extended from Piazza Municipio to Piazza Garibaldi, is well evidenced by the presence of transgressive coastal sediments that fill the torrential incisions onto Neapolitan Yellow Tuff substrate, immediately after its deposition. At the peak of the Versilian marine transgression (c. a. 5 ka) the paleo geographical scenario shows an high coast morphology, along the edge of Pendino. The shore line corresponding to the Middle Holocene period describes a bay right in the east of Mount Echia, in the area actually occupied by the dig "MN". Greek -Roman Age (Fig. 4) Bay of Chiaia: The Greek-Roman period shows a progressive change in the coastal paleoenvironmental context, with respect to previous time. Referring to this period sees a submerged marine environment establishing both in ‘San Pasquale’ and|$|R

Two kinds of data were used: data of an international field campaign, combined data from sunphotometer and optical particle counter, which was conducted in February-November 2006 under the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) framework; and data (October 2006 -January 2009) from a sunphotometer which was set up at Tamanrasset (Algeria) by the Izaña Atmospheric Research Center (Spain) in collaboration with l’Office Nationale de la Météorologie (Algeria). This study allowed to characterize this area of Sahara by: a) a bimodal <b>granulometric</b> <b>distribution</b> largely dominated by the coarse mode; b) a dominant component in Si, Al and Fe; c) a discrimination of two seasons: autumn-winter, characterized by low Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and high Angstrom Exponent (AE) and spring-summer, with strong and frequent mineral dust storms, characterized by high AOD and low AE...|$|E
