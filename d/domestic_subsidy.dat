Weak rules may lead Member governments to inefficiently use <b>domestic</b> <b>subsidies</b> for redistributive purposes or to lower market access granted to trading partners once tariffs are bound. On the other hand, excessive rigidity may inhibit tariff negotiations or induce governments to set inefficiently high tariffs, as strict regulations would reduce policy makers' ability to use <b>subsidies</b> to offset <b>domestic</b> market distortions.

We compare the properties of two types of international climate agreements when the inter-country externalities from R&D are not regulated through the climate agreement. With an international agreement on emission quotas, the equilibrium R&D subsidy is lower than the socially optimal subsidy. The equilibrium subsidy is even lower if the climate agreement instead dictates that a common carbon tax should be imposed in all countries. Under a quota agreement, total quotas should be set low enough for the price of carbon to exceed the Pigovian level, whereas the opposite may be true under a tax agreement. We also show that social costs are higher under a second-best tax agreement than under a second-best quota agreement. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present article is to {{consider}} optimal trade policies for biofuels, taking into account the potential for carbon leakage and the complex set of policies used or discussed for biofuels. First, the authors consider the case of optimal trade policies and find that the combination of an import standard and a border carbon adjustment welfare dominates using only a border carbon adjustment (BCA). The import standard should be set such that the emissions per unit of output is as if the foreign biofuels industry were subject to the globally optimal green house gas (GHG) emission tax. Second, the authors study the same trade policies {{in the context of a}} blending mandate, which significantly alters the way the market works. Given the suboptimal implementation of a blending mandate, the optimal BCA depends on the <b>domestic</b> <b>subsidy</b> to biofuels production.

40|$|Research PaperIn recent years, {{considerable}} {{attention has been}} given to the effects of removing trade restrictions on natural resource utilization and on poverty, especially in developing countries. Our paper adds to the growing body of conceptual work to show conditions under which a developing country that, in isolation, is unable to produce enough to meet subsistence consumption requirements of its residents can gain from participation in international trade. Using a small-country, two-sector, steady-state, general equilibrium model, we explore autarky conditions and the circumstances under which trade - perhaps supplemented by resource management - is able to lift all sectors of an economy out of poverty. Indeed, trade may be necessary for survival. However, if subsidies to subsistence sectors are required in order for such trade to take place, international prohibitions or restrictions could return the country to its autarky conditions and, with them, the return of poverty to some sectors. While the model abstracts considerably from "real world" conditions, it may help explain why some countries find it difficult to participate in free trade in the absence of <b>domestic</b> <b>subsidy</b> programs. Those in the more developed world holding expectations about WTO participation by developing countries may need to exercise caution in advocating policy reform that would preclude - or eliminate - such programs...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} trade {{liberalization}} {{and the increasing}} global nature of the world econ-omy have sparked much debate as to whether globalization is a vehicle for growth and de-velopment or a bane to society. The debate is not simply one between the informed and the uneducated. Some {{of the most respected}} economists in the world disagree as to the im-pacts of globalization. Stiglitz (2002) refers to “the devastating effect that globalization can have on developing countries. ” On the other hand, Bhagwati (2004) holds that globaliza-tion can be beneficial for both developed and developing countries. He postulates that, for this to occur, there must be a set of new poli-cies and institutions that will help developing countries handle increased volatilities result-ing from globalization. The agricultural sector is a central part of this issue, as the provision of agricultural sub-sidies has been a point of debate during recent trade negotiations. Most countries use some form of subsidies to protect their agricultural sector. Table 1 shows the levels of <b>domestic</b> <b>subsidies</b> provided to producers in selected de-veloped and developing countries.

40|$|Following the 1997 Asian Crisis, {{a number}} of economies have been {{burdened}} with so-called Twin Crises, facing both vulnerable exchange rates and a distressed financial sector. The three papers in this thesis examine the resolution of a twin crisis in one such country - Indonesia. In debt overhang and exchange rate collapse, I adopt the simplest representation {{of the economy and}} the Asian crisis. The model is a modified Hecksher-Ohlin framework with labour as the sole domestic factor. The crisis is triggered by a terms of trade shock. The analysis implies that workers have already suffered a wealth loss {{in the form of a}} wage cut. If they are inclined to pay all the overhang, they will take another cut - a large one - due to the so-called overhang multiplier. In Indonesian cronies' tardy crisis resolution skills, both the underlying model and the description of the crisis are made more realistic. The model has another domestic factor added to allow for the existence of domestic capitalists. The crisis is triggered by two additional factors; a loss of confidence by foreign investors and an end to a <b>domestic</b> <b>subsidy</b> on foreign capital. Until agreement is reached on the overhang, the economy suffers so-called corporate decay. I introduce the cronies, and show that it may be optimal for them to stall agreement, even if there is perfect information. Contrary to conventional wisdom, bankruptcy reforms do not necessarily hasten agreement, though they do improve the payoffs to the international creditors. In debt forgiveness, I examine the pessimistic scenario that Indonesia becomes like a Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC), so that all the issues related to debt forgiveness become relevant. I improve a contract arising from a workhorse model of debt forgiveness, showing a better way to provide reform incentives for countries heavily in debt. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Uruguay Round trade {{negotiations}} completed in April 1994 reduced beef trade barriers. Trade barriers for beef products {{have historically been}} significant. The Uruguay Round essentially converts many nontariff barriers (quotas) to tariffs (tariffication), includes safeguards for import surges, establishes minimum access commitments, reduces <b>domestic</b> <b>subsidy</b> supports, and provides special tariff allowances for developing countries. These provisions, commensurate with a growing world demand for animal source proteins, will likely increase U. S. fed beef exports and ground beef imports. The United States is a major world producer as well as exporter of beef. In 1996, the United States represented 35 percent of world beef production (ranked first) and 28 percent of world beef exports (ranked second to Australia). U. S. quantity share of the annual world beef export market averaged 5. 9 percent between 1980 and 1994 but has increased in recent years. In terms of beef and veal, the United States exports primarily higher-value beef cuts. The United States is the largest single-country beef importer. The U. S. annual quantity share of the world fresh beef import market averaged 16. 5 percent between 1980 and 1994. U. S. beef imports primarily consist of lower-quality, manufacturing-grade (ground) beef which is primarily used by the fast-food service industry. The Uruguay Round Agreement will reduce trade restrictions gradually over an implementation period (1995 – 2000). Specifically, Japan is to reduce its beef tariffs and South Korea will increase its beef import quota by the year 2000. In 2001, South Korean import quotas {{will be replaced by}} a tariff. The European Union has agreed to reduce quantities of subsidized exports. In 1995, the United States replaced import quotas with a tariff and a tariff-rate quota. The reduction in trade barriers will increase U. S. beef imports and exports. Because U. S. beef imports are primarily ground beef and exports are primarily table cut beef, beef trade liberalization will have different impacts on producers and consumers of these products. In general, increased imports decrease the price of ground beef and increase per capita ground beef consumption. However, increased beef imports reduce nonfed cattle prices and slaughter. Increased exports cause the prices of table cut beef, fed cattle, and feeder cattle to increase. Per capita consumption of table cut beef declines slightly, and fed cattle slaughter and feeder cattle production both increase. Researchers have estimated that the Uruguay Round Agreement could increase U. S. beef imports by 6 – 19 percent and U. S. beef exports by 10 – 75 percent over 1990 – 1994 average levels. For example, the ground beef price could decline by $ 0. 01 –$ 0. 04 /lb from average 1990 – 1994 levels because of increased imports. Thus, the price of nonfed cattle (which generally produce ground beef) could decline by $ 0. 71 –$ 2. 55 /cwt. Conversely, because the United States exports primarily table cut beef, the table cut beef price in the United States could increase by $ 0. 01 –$ 0. 09 /lb. Increased foreign demand for table cut beef would cause the price of boxed beef to increase by $ 0. 05 –$ 0. 10 /lb and the price of fed cattle to increase by $ 0. 62 –$ 5. 46 /cwt relative to average prices received during the 1990 – 1994 period. B extension, increased demand for fed cattle would increase feeder cattle price by $ 0. 61 –$ 5. 40 /cwt over average prices received during the 1990 – 1994 period.
