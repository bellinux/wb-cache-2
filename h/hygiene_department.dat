Leung was later arrested at the scene and was subsequently released on bail. Other candidates disagreed with the violent acts while Wong Sing-chi of the Third Side asked for an explanation from the Indigenous.|$|E

He collected thousands of blood samples throughout Transylvania, pioneering the study of serology and immunology, and publishing his findings in Western scientific journals. During this period, he also began writing articles about epidemiology and the healthcare system's organization. His monograph on Epidemiile din Transilvania ("Epidemics in Transylvania") was presented by Babeș to the Romanian Academy, earning Manuilă the Academy Prize for 1921. His project doubled as an inquiry into racial science: Manuilă followed Ludwik Hirszfeld's ideas about the [...] "racial index", concluding that there existed a distinct serological cluster of Balkan peoples, of which Romanians were a distinct subtype. The conclusion was discussed by other serologists: Gheorghe Popoviciu, who concluded that Manuilă's data were flawed, and that Romanians were not a race apart; and Petru Râmneațeanu, who believed that Manuilă was largely correct.|$|E
2500|$|John Cade {{was born}} in Murtoa, in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. [...] John's father David was Murtoa's general practitioner. [...] Ellen, John's mother, and younger {{brothers}} David and Frank completed the family. [...] When John was a small boy, his father left for World War I and served in Gallipoli and France. [...] On return from the war, his father suffered from 'war-weariness' and had difficulty in continuing in general practice. [...] Therefore, his father sold the practice and accepted a position with the Mental <b>Hygiene</b> <b>Department.</b> [...] Over the next 25 years, Dr Cade Sr became medical superintendent at several Victorian mental hospitals, namely Sunbury, Beechworth and Mont Park. [...] John and his brothers spent many of their younger years living within the grounds of these institutions, which had a great bearing on John's later deep understanding {{of the needs of}} the mentally ill. [...] John was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, matriculating in 1928. [...] He then studied medicine at the University of Melbourne, graduating at the age of 21 years with honours in all subjects. [...] He became a House Officer at St Vincent's Hospital and then Royal Children's Hospital before becoming severely ill with bilateral pneumococcal pneumonia. [...] While he was convalescing, John fell in love with one of his nurses, Jean. [...] They married in 1937.|$|E
6000|$|It might {{indeed have}} been said that Francis Ferguson cared for his own soul, as he cared {{for the rest of}} his property, and kept it {{carefully}} insured,--somewhat, perhaps, on the principle of Pascal's wager. That he had been a benefactor to his city no one would deny who had seen the facade that covered a whole block in the business district from Tower to Vine, surmounted by a red standard with the familiar motto, [...] "When in doubt, go to Ferguson's." [...] At Ferguson's you could buy anything from a pen-wiper to a piano or a Paris gown; sit in a cool restaurant in summer or in a palm garden in winter; leave your baby--if you had one--in charge of the most capable trained nurses; if your taste were literary, mull over the novels in the Book Department; if you were stout, you might be reduced in the <b>Hygiene</b> <b>Department,</b> unknown to your husband and intimate friends. In short, if there were any virtuous human wish in the power of genius to gratify, Ferguson's was the place. They, even taught you how to cook. It was a modern Aladdin's palace: and, like everything else modern, much more wonderful than the original. And the soda might be likened to the waters of Trevi,--to partake of which is to return.|$|E

He continued research into a variety of fields listed above as head of the Institute of Physiology in Munich from 1857 onwards. After numerous successful audiences with two of the kings of Bavaria he had helped found the first three <b>hygiene</b> <b>departments.</b> In 1879 he finally achieved his goal of the creation of a standalone Institute of Hygiene in Munich. This institution was larger than his previous accommodations in the department of Physiology and allowed him to continue to his research and to gather a large cohort of research students under his teachings. The founding of his Institute of Hygiene drew significant international attention and was considered a model for many later institutions including the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore.|$|R

50|$|Pettenkofer's name is most {{familiar}} {{in connection with}} his work in practical hygiene, as an apostle of good water, fresh air and proper sewage disposal. His attention was drawn to this subject by the unhealthy condition in Munich in the 19th century. Specifically he examined the field of hygiene and determined {{that there was a}} minimal amount of rigorous research. He was responsible for transitioning the field of hygiene into a research-oriented field. He is further responsible for the acceptance of hygiene as a science to be examined in medical schools and to be taught in specific <b>hygiene</b> <b>departments.</b> In 1865 his petitions to the government were accepted and three <b>departments</b> of <b>hygiene</b> were established in Munich, Würzburg, and Erlangen. By 1882 hygiene was included in examinations for medical students in every major city of Germany. As one of the principal proponents for the field of hygiene in Munich he was responsible for giving presentations to government officials in order to secure funding for public health projects.|$|R
40|$|Often a {{thorn in}} the flesh and the oh-so-tidy minds of city traffic and <b>hygiene</b> <b>departments,</b> food vendors serve a burdgeoning market {{and not just the}} poor amid annual city growth rates of 10 %. The sector, about as {{informal}} as can be, provides income for peri-urban farmers and for sizeable chunks of any city s population, often women, working from their street carts and little stands. Their food is fast, filling and familiar, and good value too. Recognised by nutrition workers in the mid- 1980 s as the best way to deliver nutrient supplements to many city dwellers, street vending still awaits broad recognition from city planners. Hope is at hand: 'breakthrough comin through', as one Jamaican vendor told Spore recently. Early in 2002, Ghana s Food Research Institute reported on its census of the Accra s food vending sector, undertaken with the Natural Resources Institute (UK). It employs 60, 000 people; its annual profits are US$ 24 million; turnover US$ 100 million. Two-thirds of Accra s workers take their main meals there; many children and students nowhere else. The Accra study, uncannily paralleled by another by Alice Mboganie Mwangi of Nairobi University, points to greater health risks than seen in earlier FAO studies a short decade ago. More food is being grown with waste grey water and contaminated soils. Storage, preparation and serving are at times unhygienic, as is waste disposal. The studies serve up their key message - better to improve the sector than forbid it in helpings of practical measures: provide vendors with access to running water, toilets and energy, and give them hygiene training on safe vending, just as the food giant Unilever did for 4, 000 vendors in Accra, in return for promoting their products. The critical measure to recognise and nurture the sector received a massive boost in mid-June when the International Labour Office decided to better address the needs of workers and enterprises in the informal economy.

40|$|Polio, as {{a social}} disease, was first noted in Italy after the First World War (1915 - 18), with a {{consistent}} upward trend {{in the number of}} reported cases (Table 1, Figure 1). This situation has led to important research being undertaken in several National <b>Hygiene</b> <b>Departments,</b> in particular those located in Milan (Giovanardi, Monaci, Bergamini), Genoa (Petrilli, Agnese, Crovari), Palermo (D’Alessandro, Dardanoni), and Padua (Vendramini, Majori, Gasparini). Studies such as these, have examined the epidemiological and virological character of the illness in order to determine modalities for disease prevention. These studies demonstrated that all three poliovirus serotypes were circulating in Italy, with a higher prevalence (as a cause of paralytic disease) of poliovirus type 1 (about 80 %), followed by type 3 (about 15 %) and then type 2 (about 10 %). The presence of healthy carriers of the virus was very common in children (2 - 3 %). The evidence of neutralizing antibodies in patients of different age groups confirmed that poliovirus infection was widespread. About 90 % of the population over 14 years of age had antibodies against all three serotypes. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Invasive mould infections {{represent}} a threat for high-risk patients hospitalized in haematology units. French guidelines recommend that fungal aerocontamination monitoring {{should be performed}} quarterly. Since 2002, Besançon University Hospital has expanded to include several new buildings. Consequently, environmental surveys have been re-inforced and are now performed on a weekly basis. AIM: To retrospectively assess the contribution of fungal aerocontamination measurement in haematology corridors and main hospital corridors as a sentinel to assess fungal exposure and risk of invasive mould infections. METHODS: Over a 10 -year period, 2706 air samples were taken by impaction every week in the same locations in haematology corridors and main hospital corridors. All fungal species were identified. The Haematology and Hospital <b>Hygiene</b> <b>Departments</b> were alerted systematically whenever a peak of opportunistic species was detected and corrective action was planned. Since 2007, each case of invasive aspergillosis {{has been reported to}} the French health authorities. Cuzick's test, Mann-Kendall's trend test, autocorrelation and Spearman's correlation rank test were used for statistical analysis. FINDINGS: Over 10 years of surveillance, 12 peaks of Aspergillus fumigatus (> 40 colony-forming units/m(3)) were observed in the main hospital corridors, and A.  fumigatus contamination was detected up to six times per year in the haematology corridors. In order to limit fungal exposure, {{the decision was made to}} perform additional checks on ventilation systems and heating, increase biocleaning and develop clear instructions. CONCLUSION: No significant link was observed between A.  fumigatus detection and invasive aspergillosis. Weekly surveys have helped to improve the vigilance of the medical teams. Nevertheless, 58 cases of invasive aspergillosis have been identified since 2007...|$|R
