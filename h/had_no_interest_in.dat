Schaefer stated that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> running, and threw his support behind Bishop Robinson, the former BPD Commissioner. Robinson chose not to run.|$|E
5|$|Although he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{politics}} at first, Dawson {{ran in the}} 1935 election as a Social Credit candidate in the riding of Little Bow, {{at the urging of}} a citizens' group. He defeated United Farmers of Alberta candidate and former speaker Oran McPherson by 66% of the vote. Dawson was re-elected seven consecutive times and held his seat for twenty-eight years.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{had envisioned}} Lance Henriksen portraying the {{character}} of Frank Black, long before he was ever contacted. Although Carter's colleagues responded positively to the selection, the Fox Network wanted someone younger {{to take the lead}} part. Fox asked William Hurt to play the lead role, but after finding out that Hurt <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> acting on television, Henriksen got the part.|$|E

5|$|Shea {{was born}} September 5, 1925, {{and grew up}} in the Bronx, the eldest son in a working-class Irish Catholic family. His father worked as a {{mechanic}} on the New York City Subway. As a child, Shea <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> engineering; he was a good runner and hoped to become a professional athlete. He attended a Catholic high school and graduated when he was only sixteen.|$|E
5|$|There were {{setbacks}} with distribution, however. United Artists, {{which had}} {{ownership of the}} movie, changed hands and the new owners <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the movie. Carradine bought the movie back from U.A., {{and set out to}} find a distributor. The picture was picked up by Crown International, which specialized in teen exploitation films. Just two weeks before the opening was scheduled, Carradine was still shooting some additional scenes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{working outside the}} film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear {{in a series of}} television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he {{would never be able to}} film his stories.|$|E

5|$|Coke {{was noted}} as {{deriving}} great enjoyment from and working {{hard at the}} law, but enjoying little else. He was versed in the Latin classics and maintained a sizeable estate, but the law was his primary concern. Francis Bacon, his main competitor, {{was known as a}} philosopher and man of learning, but Coke <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> such subjects. Notably, when given a copy of the Novum Organum by Bacon, Coke wrote puerile insults in it.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the {{political}} climate in Italy (under Mussolini) became unacceptable to Escher. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced {{at the age of}} nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.|$|E
5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E

5|$|Murray had {{repeatedly}} refused {{to become a}} Member of Parliament, saying he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> politics. In 1742, however, the government of Sir Robert Walpole fell, and Murray's brother-in-law, the Earl of Nottingham, became First Lord of the Admiralty in the new Cabinet. With this added political influence, Murray hoped to be appointed to a government office, and when Sir John Strange resigned as Solicitor General, Murray was made a Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge on 15 December 1742 and immediately succeeded Strange as Solicitor General.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the CHA and one of the teams that had {{rejected}} Renfrew. However, after a few poorly attended games showed that fans <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the league, Ottawa and the Montreal Shamrocks abandoned the CHA to join the NHA. Ottawa, the defending Stanley Cup champion and Wanderers' rival, was readily accepted by the NHA. This enabled Ottawa to continue the rivalry with the Wanderers and take in the gate revenues those games provided. The Wanderers won the championship in 1910, and Ottawa won in 1911 and 1915.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the village of Ashington was based entirely around coal mining, and though his family had a strong footballing pedigree, {{his father was a}} miner. The eldest of four {{brothers}} – Bobby, Gordon and Tommy – the tight finances of the family meant that all four siblings shared the same bed. His father, Bob, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> football, but his mother, Cissie, played football with her children and later coached the local schools team. As a teenager she took them to watch Ashington and Newcastle United play, and Charlton remained a lifelong Newcastle supporter.|$|E

5|$|While other {{companies}} marketed directly to foreign air forces, {{as part of}} the FX program, the F-5G could only be marketed by the State Department. Under this policy umbrella, Northrop had to submit every piece of marketing material to government review, which could take months. The State Department <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> selling the FX; from its perspective it was one aircraft among many, leading to a lackadaisical approach, and led to complaints from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, Manmohan had {{determined}} {{to pursue a}} literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations {{but to do so}} when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College. Aurobindo <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa's {{government}} would face {{an economic crisis}} and the 2001 riots, resigning two years later. De la Rúa thought that Duhalde had organized a coup d'état against him Rodolfo Terragno, De la Rúa's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, thought instead that the crisis was the exclusive result of keeping the peso-dollar parity despite the costs generated by it. Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that the party <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> removing De la Rúa from power, {{because he was so}} unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E

5|$|George {{donated the}} royal library to the British Museum in 1757, {{four years after}} the museum's foundation. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> reading, or in the arts and sciences, and {{preferred}} to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards. In 1737, he founded the Georg August University of Göttingen, the first university in the Electorate of Hanover, and visited it in 1748. The asteroid 359 Georgia was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's College in New York City, which later became Columbia University. The province of Georgia, founded by royal charter in 1732, was named after him.|$|E
5|$|Her friendships {{were limited}} to her ladies-in-waiting, and in {{particular}} Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa. She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
