25|$|Swedish media often speculated about {{upcoming}} engagements and marriages for Victoria. On 24 February 2009, rumours that wedding {{plans were}} imminent became particularly intense preceding an <b>information</b> <b>council</b> between the King and Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt. Under {{the terms of}} the Swedish Act of Succession, the Government, upon the request of the King, gives the final consent for a dynastic marriage of a Prince or Princess of Sweden. The prince or princess otherwise loses their right to the throne. Later that day, it was confirmed that permission had been granted and that Victoria would marry Daniel Westling in the summer of 2010. The wedding date was set in Stockholm Cathedral for 19 June 2010, the 34th anniversary of her parents' marriage. Her engagement ring features a solitaire round brilliant-cut diamond mounted on white gold.|$|E

2500|$|Suzuki {{says that}} despite this growing consensus, {{many in the}} public and the media seemed {{doubtful}} about the science for many years. The reason for the confusion about climate change, in Suzuki's view, was due to a well organized campaign of disinformation about the science involved. [...] "A very small number of critics" [...] denies that climate change exists and that humans are the cause. These climate change [...] "skeptics" [...] or [...] "deniers", Suzuki claims, tend not to be climate scientists and do not publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals but rather target the media, the general public, and policy makers. Their goal: [...] "delaying action on climate change." [...] According to Suzuki, the skeptics have received significant funding from coal and oil companies, including ExxonMobil. They are linked to [...] "industry-funded lobby groups", such as the <b>Information</b> <b>Council</b> on the Environment (ICE), whose aim is to [...] "reposition global warming as theory (not fact)." ...|$|E
