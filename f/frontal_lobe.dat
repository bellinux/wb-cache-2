5|$|Visuospatial or {{constructional}} abnormalities {{here may}} be associated with parietal lobe pathology, and abnormalities in executive functioning tests may indicate <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> pathology.

50|$|Lurias {{studies of}} the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> were {{concentrated}} in five principal areas: (1) attention, (2) memory, (3) intellectual activity, (4)emotional reactions, and (5) voluntary movements. Lurias main books for investigation of these functions of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> are titled, (a) The <b>Frontal</b> <b>Lobes</b> (1966), Problems of Neuropsychology (1977), and (c) Functions of the <b>Frontal</b> <b>Lobes</b> (1982, posthumously published).|$|R
40|$|The <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> {{constitute}} approximately {{one-third of}} the total brain area. It is not surprising then {{to learn that the}} <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> are important in a variety of functions. Research has shown us that the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> play a role in motor functions, divergent thinking, environmental control of behavior, temporal memory, spatial orientation, social behavior, olfaction, and face movements. Given this wide variety of functions, researchers have found it a difficult and puzzling task to tie them together into some sort of coherent framework that would describe an overall function of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes.</b> Is there any sort of 2 ̆ 7 family resemblance 2 ̆ 7 among these different functions? Are these various functions related in some way? Throughout this paper I will first discuss the functions of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> and second discuss the 2 ̆ 7 family resemblance 2 ̆ 7 among these functions...|$|R
25|$|The third theory predominates {{disturbed}} brain {{formation of}} the two <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> as the main issue behind synostosis. Limited growth of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> leads to an absence of stimuli for cranial growth, therefore causing premature fusion of the metopic suture.|$|R

Mulder has Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) subject the slice to a Kirlian photography test; the final image shows corona discharge that takes the appearance of human shoulders.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
40|$|The <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> play a {{critical}} part in the control of human behavior. We review evidence from neuropsychology and functional brain imaging on the cognitive functions subserved by the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> in working memory in the endogenous control of attention, in response selection, inhibition and response monitoring, and in responding to affective signals and reward-related aspects of the environment. Finally, we consider developmental disorders of cognitive that may be accounted for {{in terms of the}} abnormal control of attention mediated by the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The noted {{probable}} {{location of}} the SAS is in the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes,</b> more specifically in the prefrontal cortex. This follows in understanding that the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> provide a framework to reach attainable goals. The dorsolateral region of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> is involved in thinking and language, and organizes mental representations of content. The prefrontal cortex accommodates many systems and tasks working independently, dependently, and interacting with the SAS. The SAS functioning depends on multiple specific systems, and structures in the brain. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, much neuropsychological research {{was conducted on the}} <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Over time, the supervisory attentional system was incorporated into research on age, brain injuries, psychological disorders, degenerative diseases, substance abuse and more. The following section is a brief review on research involving the SAS.|$|R

5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> is dominant for language. If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E

50|$|Frontal release {{signs are}} seen in {{disorders}} that affect the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes,</b> such as dementias, metabolic encephalopathies, closed head injuries, and hydrocephalus.

5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe,</b> {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe.</b> The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} {{part of the human}} brain. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum.|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} {{view in the}} neuroscience {{literature is}} that the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> sustain our ability to process others' mental states such as beliefs, intentions and desires (this ability {{is often referred to}} as having 'theory of mind'). Here we report evidence from brain-damaged patients showing that, in addition to involvement of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes,</b> the left temporoparietal junction is necessary for reasoning about the beliefs of others...|$|R

2500|$|The first {{bilateral}} lobectomy {{of a human}} {{subject was}} performed by the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy in 1930. The neurologist Richard Brickner reported on this case in 1932, relating that the recipient, known as [...] "Patient A", while experiencing a flattening of affect, had suffered no apparent decrease in intellectual function and seemed, {{at least to the}} casual observer, perfectly normal. Brickner concluded from this evidence that [...] "the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> are not 'centers' for the intellect". These clinical results were replicated in a similar operation undertaken in 1934 by the neurosurgeon Roy Glenwood Spurling and reported on by the neuropsychiatrist Spafford Ackerly. By the mid-1930s, interest in the function of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> reached a high-water mark. This was reflected in the 1935 neurological congress in London, which hosted as part of its deliberations, [...] "a remarkable symposium... on the functions of the frontal lobes." [...] The panel was chaired by Henri Claude, a French neuropsychiatrist, who commenced the session by reviewing the state of research on the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes,</b> and concluded that, [...] "altering the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> profoundly modifies the personality of subjects". This parallel symposium contained numerous papers by neurologists, neurosurgeons and psychologists; amongst these was one by Brickner, which impressed Moniz greatly, that again detailed the case of [...] "Patient A". Fulton and Jacobsen's paper, presented in another session of the conference on experimental physiology, was notable in linking animal and human studies on the function of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes.</b> Thus, {{at the time of the}} 1935 Congress, Moniz had available to him an increasing body of research on the role of the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobes</b> that extended well beyond the observations of Fulton and Jacobsen.|$|R
5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{inferior}} <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> damage produce {{less and}} less intense facial expression when presented with emotional stimuli, and they also have problems reading fear and disgust in other people. People with left inferior <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> damage produced less facial expression and could not analyze emotional situations {{as well as those}} with right <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> damage especially with fear and disgust. The left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) {{plays an important role in}} anger while the right IFG plays a larger role in disgust.|$|E
25|$|Studies using {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) trace {{a slight increase in}} blood flow to the <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> in participants completing prospective memory tasks involving remembering a planned action, while performing other tasks. During these procedures, sites of brain activation include the prefrontal cortex, specifically the right dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and medial regions, as well as the median <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe.</b> The prefrontal cortex is responsible for holding the intention in consciousness and suppressing other internal thoughts. The median <b>frontal</b> <b>lobe</b> keeps attention focused on the planned action instead of the other tasks.|$|E
