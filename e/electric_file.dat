Optically anisotropic structures of N-methylformamide (NMF) {{and some other}} amides formed by the reformation of hydrogen bonds were observed when alternative electric current {{was applied to the}} neat liquid. When the frequency of the applied <b>electric</b> <b>filed</b> was low (< 170 Hz), the retardation oscillated at the double frequency of the applied electric field, which was typical behavior of Kerr effect. On the other hand, the <b>electric</b> <b>filed</b> with high frequency (10 MHz) induced much slower birefringence response compared to the frequency of the <b>electric</b> <b>filed.</b> In order to eliminate the influence of ionic impurity, birefringence, dielectric, and infrared measurements were carried out for NMF and some other amides applying alternative electric current of 10 MHz.

40|$|The {{influence}} of non-uniform <b>electric</b> <b>filed</b> on Fe 3 O 4 -Ethylene glycol nanofluid hydrothermal treatment {{in an enclosure}} with sinusoidal upper and moving lower walls is investigated in this study. Control Volume based Finite Element Method (CVFEM) is utilized to simulate in the presented model. Numerical investigation are conducted for the sundry parameters such as Reynolds number; nanoparticle volume fraction and supplied. Results show that supplied voltage can change the flow shape. Coulomb force causes isotherms denser near the moving wall. Heat transfer rises with augment of supplied voltage and Reynolds number.

We showed that graphene nanoribbons exhibit negative high-harmonic differential conductivity.

We also observe both even and odd high-harmonic negative differential conductivity at wave mixing of two commensurate frequencies. The even harmonics are more pronounced than the odd harmonics. A possible use of the present method for generating terahertz frequencies at even harmonics in graphene is suggested. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The dependences of the band structures on external electric field and interlayer separation are evaluated. The external <b>electric</b> <b>filed</b> induces a semiconductor-metal transition. At the same time, a larger interlayer separation, corresponding to a weaker interlayer interaction, makes an indirect-direct band gap transition happen for the heterojunction.
