5|$|As birds began nesting on the island, soil {{conditions}} improved, and more vascular plant species {{were able to}} survive. In 1998, the first bush {{was found on the}} island—a tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia), which can <b>grow</b> <b>to</b> heights of up to 4metres (13ft). By 2008, 69species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland. More species continue to arrive, at a typical rate of roughly 2–5new species per year.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, Diefenbaker {{had grown}} disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected comfortably {{in his home}} riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within two seats of {{matching}} the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield had been denied power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later in an election that saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority <b>grow</b> <b>to</b> 11,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|George's {{distrust}} of the Tories aided the passing of power to the Whigs. Whig dominance would <b>grow</b> <b>to</b> be so great under George that the Tories would not return to power for another half-century. After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the Septennial Act 1715, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in power could remain in such a position for a greater period of time.|$|E

It is the hope of both cities that the relationship will <b>grow</b> <b>to</b> include the exchange of delegations, including manufacturers, youth, academicians, scientists, artists, associations, clubs, tourists, technicians and others, which will result in enriching the cultures of the respective cities. As of 2001, the two cities have been sending high school age students on a three-week-long exchange to gain more knowledge about their differences in society and culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} that the filtering capacity of the lung has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles <b>grow</b> <b>to</b> a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{galaxies are}} giant {{elliptical}}s. Many elliptical galaxies {{are believed to}} form due to the interaction of galaxies, resulting in a collision and merger.
