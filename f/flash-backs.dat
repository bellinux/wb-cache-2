5|$|Barbara Gordon {{makes two}} cameo {{appearances}} in the first season of the animated series Young Justice, and is added as a recurring character in season two where she has adopted her Batgirl persona. Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series Birds of Prey (2002). Although this series focused on her role as Oracle, the series included <b>flash-backs</b> of the character's history as Batgirl. In the film Batman & Robin, Alicia Silverstone played {{a variation of the}} character: Barbara Wilson, Alfred Pennyworth's niece. She appears in The Lego Batman Movie voiced by Rosario Dawson. The character is introduced as Barbara Gordon taking over from her father Jim Gordon to become the new Police Commissioner of Gotham. Towards the end of the film, she dons her cowl and teams up with Batman as Batgirl in addition to her role as Commissioner.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{investigation}} of <b>flash-back</b> of flames on slit and cylindrical burners {{showed that there}} is a systematic difference of about 10 % between <b>flash-back</b> gradients of flames on slit and cylindrical burners with a burner diameter/width of 3. 8 mm. In addition, the critical gradients become almost equal for burners with a diameter/width larger than about 6 mm. In this paper the effect of the burner wall curvature on the behaviour of, for example, the temperature field and the stand-off distance is analysed. The analysis shows that the burner wall curvature has an effect on the quenching layer thickness near the burner wall for burners smaller than about 6 mm. When the decrease of the cylindrical stand-off distance with increasing burner size is used to calculate the critical <b>flash-back</b> gradient based on a linear velocity profile for the cylindrical burners, the critical gradients for cylindrical and slit burners become almost the same for burners larger than about 5 mm. The analysis shows that the differences between flames on cylindrical and slit burners near the <b>flash-back</b> limit are mainly caused by differences in conductive heat transfer towards the burner wall, induced by burner wall curvature...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} how Ndebele fiction employs the <b>flash-back</b> and flashforward techniques. It observes {{that use of}} letters, old pictures and unplanned meeting of old friends are the common tools of <b>flash-back</b> while dreams, omens and superstitions are used for flash-forward. It also evaluates {{the effectiveness of these}} techniques by examining a number of Ndebele novels and concludes by stating that {{it is important for the}} reader to have knowledge of Ndebele culture in order to gain access to the meaning of the various incidents communicated through those techniques...|$|R

40|$|The {{flashback}} of premixed flames in ducts is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. New experimental results, {{compatible with}} classical {{results on the}} subject, are presented. A minimal model for premixed flame propagation in a boundary layer is presented. The scales of the problem are derived from asymptotic considerations. Numerical results for the flame propagation velocity are given; in particular we give the critical condition for <b>flash-back.</b> The numerical results are compared to a first experimental visualization of the flow around a tilted flame stabilized in a tube close to the <b>flash-back</b> condition. The good qualitative and quantitative agreement between numerical simulations and experiments indicates that the model has captured the essential physical features...|$|R

50|$|The {{film has}} a {{non-linear}} construction with frequent <b>flash-backs</b> and flash-forwards (especially {{at the beginning}} of the film.) The title character is a young San Francisco socialite married to a savagely abusive man. She finagles a meeting with physician Archie Bollen, whom she first saw and with whom she became smitten as he treated an injured Mexican boy. Bollen is in the process of divorcing his wife, is sifting through new relationships with his ex, the new man in her life, his sons, and friends who knew him only as one-half of a couple.

50|$|His first self-produced {{film was}} The Embryo Hunts In Secret (extra=1966), {{a story of}} a man who kidnaps, tortures and sexually abuses a woman until she finally escapes and stabs him to death. Freeze-frames, <b>flash-backs,</b> {{hand-held}} camera and locations limited to two rooms and a hallway add to the film's disturbing, claustrophobic atmosphere. Vagabond of Sex (1967) was a parody of Imamura's A Man Vanishes (1967). In Wakamatsu's film, a man leaves his family in Tokyo to travel and engage in various sexual escapades. When he returns home he finds out that his wife is starring in Imamura's documentary about her search for her missing husband.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reviewer}} in The New York Times {{called the}} film [...] "a manful effort to extol the martial virtues and {{to defend the}} Academy against its detractors." [...] The reviewer continues: Ladd's performance is unrelievedly granite-jawed, but {{under the influence of}} Academy discipline, the granite is highly polished. Donna Reed, his leading woman, is creditably restrained in her depiction of a war widow. Coulouris' attack on Ladd and West Point is so unnecessarily malignant that one might almost suspect him of being an Annapolis man. As director, John Farrow has sometimes underlined the emotional content of the scenario unduly, but his technique of integrating <b>flash-backs</b> and present action is masterfully smooth.|$|E
5000|$|Warren Ellis {{introduced}} the character shortly after taking over writing duties on the Stormwatch title, {{when he had}} Apollo and Midnighter encounter the then-active Stormwatch team. The story was set in 1998, immediately after Bendix's fall, when Christine Trelane had cracked Bendix's old files and discovered evidence that two rogue former Bendix agents remained alive. In <b>flash-backs,</b> Apollo was introduced {{as a member of}} a [...] "black ops" [...] Stormwatch team so secret that no-one but the first Weatherman, Henry Bendix, knew of its existence. Apollo's solar-powered abilities - including super-strength, heat vision, and a high degree of invulnerability - were presented as the consequence of Bendix's bioengineering.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, {{he began}} {{referring}} to his division of canvas as Introspective Naturalism to describe {{the representation of the}} inner and outer world, with the outer world in a realistic manner placed {{in the center of the}} paintings’ surface and the inner world as an abstract expression on the edges of the painting’s surface. He wrote, “Any type of perception of the external world to the limit of our body is always mixed with the reality which is kept in our inner self: the state of mind, memories, drowsiness, wakefulness, lived images, excitement after a discussion, sun blinding effect which makes immediate after images like photonegatives, <b>flash-backs,</b> experience of cold or extreme heat, etc…”.|$|E

40|$|Premixed flames, {{stabilized}} {{near the}} outflow interface of a ceramic-foam surface burner {{are sensitive to}} <b>flash-back</b> into the foam, when applied in high-temperature combustion systems. This instable phenomenon is studied numerically for methane/air flames. The analysis is based on stationary and instationary computations using a 1 D numerical model, solving the conservation equations for a premixed flame interacting with a solid phase, taking into account complex chemistry and radiation inside the foam. It is shown that stabilization {{on top of the}} foam is impossible for a range of velocities if the radiation temperature of the environment becomes too large. A deeper stabilization induces a large increase in the effective burning velocity and as such a higher convective heat flow. When this convective heat production can not be compensated anymore by the increasing radiative heat loss of the foam to the environment, the flame becomes unstable, leading to instationary heating of the foam and flame movement inside the material. Stabilization plots are presented from which the <b>flash-back</b> regions can be determined...|$|R
