5000|$|... #Caption: Entries in Cassell's Cyclopedia of Photography, 1911. The {{terminology}} <b>diaphragm</b> <b>shutter</b> {{has since}} fallen from common use.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>diaphragm</b> <b>shutter</b> {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} an optical stop with a slit, near the focal plane of a moving-film high-speed camera.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{and film}} cameras share an optical system, {{typically}} using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device. The <b>diaphragm</b> and <b>shutter</b> admit {{the correct amount}} of light to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Most digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing.|$|R
5000|$|... 1947: Gamma Duflex (Hungary): first instant return mirror SLR, first metal {{focal-plane shutter}} SLR, first {{internal}} semi-automatic lens diaphragm SLR. Also had a mirror [...] "prism" [...] viewfinder, an intermediate step to a solid pentaprism. Reflex mirrors coupled to the shutter release had been spring actuated to rise automatically since the 19th century, but the viewfinder would remain blacked-out until the mirror was manually cocked back down. With an automatic, instant return mirror, the viewfinder blackout time {{might be as}} short as ⅛th second. The semi-auto diaphragm closed the lens <b>diaphragm</b> with <b>shutter</b> release, but {{it needed to be}} manually re-cocked open. The Duflex was very ambitious, but very unreliable and Gamma's first and last production SLR.|$|R
50|$|A <b>diaphragm</b> or leaf <b>shutter</b> (as {{distinct}} from the simple leaf shutter above) consists {{of a number of}} thin blades which briefly uncover the camera aperture to make the exposure. The blades slide over each other in a way which creates a circular aperture which enlarges as quickly as possible to uncover the whole lens, stays open for the required time, then closes in the same way. The larger the number of blades, the more accurately circular is the aperture. Flash synchronization is easily achieved with a pair of contacts that close when the shutter is fully open.|$|R
5000|$|All leaf shutter speeds {{are limited}} by {{the speed at which}} the leaves can move: {{typically}} 1/500th of a second for a high-specification <b>diaphragm</b> <b>shutter</b> and 1/125th of a second for a simple leaf shutter.|$|E
50|$|The Lynx 1000 was {{introduced}} in 1960. It has a 1:1.8 45 mm lens with 6 elements in 4 groups. The <b>diaphragm</b> <b>shutter</b> is capable of a maximum speed of 1/1000 second, an extra stop faster than most other diaphragm shutters. Light is metered using a small selenium photovoltaic cell behind a lens array, powering a galvanometer. The film speed for the metering system {{can be set from}} 10 to 800 ASA.|$|E
50|$|The C3 was {{constructed}} primarily of Bakelite plastic and metal castings. The design featured an unusual but simple <b>diaphragm</b> <b>shutter</b> {{built into the}} camera body, so the camera could make use of interchangeable lenses {{without the need for}} a complex focal plane shutter. The rangefinder was separate from the viewfinder and was coupled to the lens through a series of gears located {{on the outside of the}} camera body. The camera came equipped with a 50mm f/3.5 Cintar anastigmat triplet lens. The lenses were made under contract by Bausch & Lomb, Ilex, and Graf Optical, which was taken over by Argus in 1939, with varying quality.|$|E
50|$|The sticky shutter problem {{relates to}} a rubber washer which is {{involved}} in the operation of the shutter. With age and atmospheric conditions, it tends to deteriorate and become sticky, so that it impedes the operation of the shutter. Frequent use can delay the stickiness from 'glueing up' the shutter, but once started, the only long-term remedy is to have the shutter repaired, when the rubber washer is replaced, and so another 10 years or more can be enjoyed with the camera working correctly. A good short term solution is to lightly clean the <b>shutter</b> <b>diaphragm</b> with a cotton ball and lighter fluid.|$|R
5000|$|Looking for new employment, Waaske {{presented}} his compact camera to Ludwig Leitz and to Kodak, {{but to no}} avail. In January 1965 Waaske started working for Rollei in Braunschweig (Brunswyck). Having become Rollei's managing director only in March 1965, Heinrich Peesel accidentally got a first glimpse of his new employee's tiny prototype camera. Filled with enthusiasm, Peesel decided that the camera should immediately be further developed by Waaske for mass production, but, using only parts of Rollei's suppliers. Waaske's little camera was presented at photokina in 1966 as Rollei 35, with a better lens - the Zeiss Tessar 3.5/40mm lens, a state-of-the-art [...] CdS-exposure meter and a precision-made <b>diaphragm</b> <b>shutter</b> made by Compur, using Waaske's patented shutter design.|$|E
5000|$|The {{focal plane}} shutter {{consists}} of a rubberized flexible curtain with slits of varying widths that cross the film plane at speeds determined by the tension setting of the spring mechanism. There are 4 slits with widths of 1/8 in, 3/8 in, 3/4 in, 1 1/2 in and “T” (T = “time” setting, used when lens <b>diaphragm</b> <b>shutter</b> is used to control exposure duration. The {{focal plane shutter}} is left completely open until manually released. The opening covers the entire area of the film for {{the size of the}} camera.) [...] On Speed Graphic models, there are 6 tension settings, adjusted by a butterfly winding knob that increases the speed that the slit crosses the film plane. On Pacemaker Graphic models, there are only 2 settings (high and low). The combination of the slit width and the spring tension allows for exposure speeds varying from 1/10 to 1/1000 sec.|$|E
40|$|These days, {{development}} in camera {{has become very}} fast and has made the society easier to develop photography as their hobbies. This can happen especially with the digital era that does not need time to process the films and to print the photos. Nowadays, photographers just need to shoot, check the results, and delete them {{if they are not}} satisfied with the outcome, or, they can save them when the pictures meet their expectations. Basically, this really has made both advanced and amateur photographers easy to work better. However, if the user does not completely understand the basic exposure techniques in photography, then it will be such a pity. They {{will not be able to}} explore the techniques that can be maximized and used to have the alternatives when it comes to working in the field. By learning these techniques, photographers can make use of the background, surroundings, and the activities of the objects, in order to achieve variations and creativity in the outcome. This is possible when they have mastered and maximized the use of <b>diaphragm,</b> <b>shutter</b> speed, ISO, and all other techniques that can be formed using these basics features.     </p...|$|E
