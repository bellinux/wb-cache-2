500|$|Villa {{admitted}} that he came close to giving up football {{at the age of}} 14 after growing disillusioned and falling out with his coach. However, thanks to his parents' encouragement, he persisted in pursuing his dream, realising his talent could earn him a living. [...] "In those days I was a nobody, not earning a penny and after being made to sit on the bench all season <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away and play with my friends" [...] he said. [...] "But my dad always supported me and cheered me up until my career turned round." [...] He went on to begin his footballing career at UP Langreo and when he turned 17 he joined the Mareo football school.|$|E
500|$|... "When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I wanted {{to go out on a}} date with, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Threshold" [...] {{is about}} {{reaching}} one's limit {{with a person}} in a situation where one is about to break—and are about to blow up as they get [...] "under your skin", while [...] "Cast Down" [...] features a fallen angel who falls into drugs. [...] "God Send Death" [...] and [...] "Deviance" [...] take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really [...] "pissed him off", and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. He later admitted {{he was trying to get}} into that person's mind; [...] "why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into that mindset." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his mother's {{successful}} {{career as a}} divorce lawyer, {{the family moved to}} Beverly Hills, where Schwimmer attended Beverly Hills High School. Schwimmer admitted to being an outsider during his time at the school, recalling, [...] "When I was there I always felt: 'This is not me, I'm surrounded by people with a different value system. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of California.'" [...] He was best at the subjects of science and math and thought he would become a doctor. Schwimmer enrolled in a drama class, where he appeared in stage productions. Encouraged by his school drama teacher to further his acting, he flew to Chicago for an acting workshop. He noted that the experience was both [...] "enlightening and exhilarating". In 1984, Schwimmer graduated from Beverly Hills High and wanted to go straight into acting, but his parents insisted he go to college first so he would have something to fall back on. Schwimmer moved to Chicago to attend Northwestern University, where he had attended a summer drama course when he was 16 years old. At the university, he studied theater and was in an improv group with Stephen Colbert, the No-Fun Mud Piranhas. After graduating in 1988, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and speech, Schwimmer co-founded the Lookingglass Theatre Company. Subsequently, he returned to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.|$|E

It's meant to sound really big." [...] Jesse Johnson provided a guitar solo which was not used for the album version, but is featured in each of its remixes. The remixes have the added component of live drumming performed by Derek Organ of Switch, showcasing more of a heavy metal feel in the extended solo and double kick drums. Both versions omit the panther roar introduction and vocal refrain closing from the album edit.|$|E

Ahead of the Australian tour, [...] "Sex Is Not The Enemy" [...] was released to Australian radio. The end of the tour {{marked the end of}} active promotion for Bleed Like Me. The band confirmed that they were going [...] "on indefinite hiatus" [...] to dispel reports of a split. [...] "We were barely even speaking," [...] Manson later admitted. [...] "We didn't want to talk to anyone outside of the band about the problems we were having with our career, so of course it turned into this whole passive-aggressive thing between us. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the fuck out of there and go home." ...|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E
