5|$|As {{its first}} {{enforcement}} legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the law, {{though not the}} right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.|$|E
5|$|Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore {{guarantees}} to all persons equality {{before the law}} and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the law. The Article also identifies four forbidden classifications – religion, race, descent and place of birth – upon which Singapore citizens may not be discriminated for specific reasons. For example, discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or {{in the administration of}} any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.|$|E
5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution {{was adopted}} on July 9, 1868, {{as one of}} the Reconstruction Amendments. The {{amendment}} addresses citizenship rights and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the laws and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated Confederacy, which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress.|$|E

5|$|Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General is {{the name}} of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court {{decision}} delivered in 2008 and the 2009 judgment by the Court of Appeal. The main issue raised by the case was whether the Collector of Land Revenue had treated the plaintiffs (later appellants), who were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, unequally by compulsorily acquiring for public purposes the land on which the temple stood but not the lands of a Hindu mission and a Christian church nearby. It was alleged that the authorities had acted in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which guarantees the rights to equality before the law and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the law.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{also decided}} whether foreign {{corporations}} are also within {{the jurisdiction of}} a state, ruling that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court {{in which it was}} not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was within the jurisdiction and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the suit. When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, {{and they were not}} given an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them. This was contrary to natural justice, which requires a person to be given the right to be heard before his or her interest is violated. As natural justice is an essential aspect of both {{the rule of law and}} the equal treatment by the law of all persons, the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to a fair hearing was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to all persons equality before the law and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the law.|$|E
5000|$|Plaintiffs also {{allege that}} the {{executive}} order itself [...] "discriminates against Petitioners {{on the basis of}} their country of origin and religion, and without sufficient justification, and therefore violates the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> component <b>of</b> the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Additionally, the EO was substantially motivated by animus toward—and has a disparate effect on—Muslims, which also violates the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> component <b>of</b> the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment".|$|R

5|$|The Right to Equality {{is one of}} {{the chief}} {{guarantees}} of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14–16, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non-discrimination, and Articles 17–18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the law to all persons within the territory of India. This includes the equal subjection of all persons to the authority of law, as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E

25|$|The Court agreed {{by a vote}} of 8 to 1 {{with the}} petitioners’ first {{contention}} – that is, that the Alien Land Law, as applied in this case, did indeed deprive Fred Oyama of the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> California’s laws and of his privileges as an American citizen. Because this decision alone was grounds for reversal of the California Supreme Court decision, the Court saw no need to address the second and third contentions.|$|E

It also sought recognition of marriages performed legally in other jurisdictions. On September 7, Thurston County Superior Court Judge Richard D. Hicks ruled in Castle v. State that the state's marriage laws violated the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> privileges and immunities clause of the state constitution.|$|E
25|$|United States v. Antelope, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that American Indians convicted on {{reservation}} land were not deprived of the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the laws; (a) the federal criminal statutes are not based on impermissible racial classifications but on political membership in an Indian tribe or nation; and (b) the challenged statutes do not violate equal protection.

25|$|All persons born or {{naturalized}} in the United States, {{and subject}} to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.

25|$|Thus, {{although}} the Erie decision {{itself does not}} identify specific provisions of the Constitution violated by Swift, {{the language of the}} decision implies that Swift had stolen powers reserved to the states, in violation of the Tenth Amendment. Justice Brandeis also noted problems for <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the laws, but the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to states, and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause was not read to include an equal protection component until the 1954 decision in Bolling v. Sharpe.|$|E
25|$|Powers {{given to}} enforce the act were {{initially}} weak, but were supplemented during later years. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several {{different parts of the}} United States Constitution, principally its power to regulate interstate commerce under Article One (section 8), its duty to guarantee all citizens <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment and its duty to protect voting rights under the Fifteenth Amendment. The Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 2, 1964, at the White House.|$|E
25|$|In June 2005, a New Jersey state appeals court, in the {{decision}} Lewis v. Harris, upheld a state law defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman, in part, by accepting that the marriage procreation link although maybe not wise wasn't irrational. However, in 2006, the New Jersey state Supreme Court unanimously overruled that decision, requiring the state to make available to all couples in New Jersey the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> family laws irrespective of {{the gender of the}} participants but not necessarily the title.|$|E

25|$|After 1866, {{according}} to the Radical Reconstruction Acts of Congress, a rebelling state which had vacated its delegation in the U.S. Congress was required to constitutionally incorporate the 14th Amendment before it was allowed to participate again. That Amendment guarantees that all persons born in the United States are citizens both of the United States and of their state. States were no longer allowed either to curtail the privileges of their citizens or to deny <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> their laws to any citizen. The Radical Congressional Reconstruction legislation required the suffrage for black men.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2010, Tauro issued his rulings in both Gill and Massachusetts, {{granting}} {{summary judgment}} {{for the plaintiffs}} in both cases. He found in Gill that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act violates the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the laws guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In Massachusetts he held that the same section of DOMA violates the Tenth Amendment and falls outside Congress' authority under the Spending Clause of the Constitution. Those decisions were stayed after the DOJ filed an appeal on October 12, 2010.|$|E
25|$|In the Malaysian case Datuk Yong Teck Lee v.

It was argued that this provision was violated because parliamentarians who participated in illegal demonstrations were subject to a higher mandatory fine as compared to non-parliamentarians who had committed similar offences. The High Court of Malaya applied the doctrine of reasonable classification and identified a rational relation between the differentia and {{the object of the}} statute.|$|E
