5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this <b>effect.</b> <b>The</b> diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E

30|$|As {{result of}} the comparison, the {{following}} findings should be emphasized. First, the net wage in a destination country exerts a much larger positive <b>effect</b> on <b>the</b> migrant inflows than the public social expenditures. The coefficients in specification (5) indicate an <b>effect</b> of <b>the</b> net wage which is about 14 times as large as <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of <b>the</b> welfare state variable. In addition, the standard error {{of the welfare state}} coefficient points to a statistical insignificance of <b>the</b> <b>effect.</b> Under <b>the</b> assumption that the findings in specification (4) most accurately describe <b>the</b> reality, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of <b>the</b> net wage is still three times as large as <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of <b>the</b> social expenditure variable. In the case of the net replacement rate and the annual replacement income, the gap lies between those two extremes 23.
