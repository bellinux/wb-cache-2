40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} is to determine mutual converted value between unfinished leather to finished leather as commercial commodity. The raw materials are wet chrome tanned <b>goatskins</b> which are converted into jacket leather and chrome tanned <b>goatskins</b> into glace leather. Weight, wide, thickness is measured during this process, and the last is carried out in accordance with Indonesia Industrial Standard, for each step of the process. The sample taken in accordance with ISO. 2588 1973 is n = 0, 5 √N, where N is the number of cattle slaughtered. The sheeps taken were 148 sheets (197 sheets available) and the goats taken were 130 sheets (195 sheets available). The conclusion {{of this research}} are the conversion value of some sheepskins and <b>goatskins</b> from chrome tanned, sheepskins into glace and <b>goatskins</b> into jacket. ...|$|R

25|$|Berger Picards, {{with their}} crisp coats, were {{reportedly}} used to smuggle tobacco and matches across the Franco-Belgian border. The tobacco {{would be put}} in <b>goatskin</b> pouches, hairy side up, and attached to the dog's shaven back. From a distance, dogs carrying such loads would not draw attention, particularly at dusk or at night.|$|E
25|$|The same music {{used in the}} jumbie dance also accompanies country dances (also {{known as}} <b>goatskin</b> or drum dance). Country dances are {{strictly}} recreational, however, and use different songs and dances than the jumbie dance. Rum shops are frequently home to string bands, especially on Boxing Day, and ensembles of guitar, banjo, accordion and cuatro (ukulele).|$|E

25|$|December Festival parades {{formerly}} included {{music and}} masqueraders, and dancers in uniforms {{modeled on the}} Grenadier Guards. Music is provided by an ensemble of triangle, fife and two <b>goatskin,</b> deep-barreled drums called kettles or booms). This tradition is primarily African in style, with little Irish or British influence, and is very distinct from jumbie dance styles. The traditional music of the December Festival was last performed in 1988, in St. John's Village.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{had to be}} {{processed}} to preserve it. This was done by first churning it, using a <b>goatskin</b> or clay container to separate the butterfat from the whey. The butterfat was processed by boiling and then cooling it to make clarified butter, which could then be stored for a long time. Clarified butter was used principally for cooking and frying. Butter churns have been excavated at Beersheba, dating from the 4th century BCE, and other ancient Israelite sites.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlers}} of Fuerteventura {{are believed}} to have come from North Africa. The word Mahorero (Majorero) or Maho is still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura and is derived from the ancient word 'mahos', a type of <b>goatskin</b> shoe worn by these original inhabitants. They lived in caves and semi-subterranean dwellings, some of which have been excavated, revealing remnants of early tools and pottery. In antiquity, the island was known o.a. as Planaria, in reference to the flatness of most of its terrain.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the smaller}} scale farming of earlier centuries, the Olmos Carob Tree Forest {{supported}} goat herds that fed on carobs. The fine <b>goatskins</b> were tanned {{to create the}} fine, pale, leather known as [...] "cordoban" [...] or [...] "cordovan", from the Spanish town of Córdoba, where the process was developed. Goat fat was used to make soap.|$|R

25|$|The djembe has a body (or shell) carved of {{hardwood}} and a drumhead made of untreated (not limed) rawhide, {{most commonly}} made from <b>goatskin.</b> Excluding rings, djembes have an exterior diameter of 30–38cm (12–15in) and {{a height of}} 58–63cm (23–25in). The majority have a diameter in the 13 to 14inch range. The weight of a djembe ranges from 5kg to 13kg (11–29lb) and depends on size and shell material. A medium-size djembe carved {{from one of the}} traditional woods (including skin, rings, and rope) weighs around 9kg (20lb).|$|E
25|$|The djembe {{is headed}} with a rawhide skin, most {{commonly}} <b>goatskin.</b> Other skins, such as antelope, cow, kangaroo, or horse {{can be used}} as well. Thicker skins, such as cow, have a warmer sound with more overtones in the slaps; thinner skins have a sharper sound with fewer overtones in the slaps and are louder. Thick skins make it easier to play full tones but more difficult to play sharp slaps; for thin skins, the opposite applies. Thin skins are louder than thick ones. Thick skins, such as cow, are particularly hard on the hands of the player and cause more callousing than goatskins.|$|E
25|$|Her cult {{included}} the annual feeding of a sacred snake with barley cakes by virgin maidens. The snake dwelt {{in a deep}} cave within the precinct of the temple, on the arx of the city: the maidens approached the lair blindfolded. The snake was supposed to feed only on the cakes offered by chaste girls. The rite was aimed at ensuring agricultural fertility. The site of the temple {{as well as the}} presence of the snake show she was the tutelary goddess of the city, as Athena at Athens and Hera at Argos. The motive of the snake of the palace goddess guardian of the city is shared by Iuno Seispes with Athena, as well as its periodic feeding. This religious pattern moreover includes armour, <b>goatskin</b> dress, sacred birds and a concern with virginity in cult. Virginity is connected to regality: the existence and welfare of the community was protected by virgin goddesses or the virgin attendants of a goddess. This theme shows a connexion with the fundamental theological character of Iuno, that of incarnating vital force: virginity is the condition of unspoilt, unspent vital energy that can ensure communion with nature and its rhythm, symbolised in the fire of Vesta. It is a decisive factor in ensuring the safety of the community and the growth of crops. The role of Iuno is at the crossing point of civil and natural life, expressing their interdependence.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} tooled red <b>goatskin</b> binding is {{the earliest}} surviving intact Western binding, and the virtually unique survivor of decorated Insular leatherwork. [...] The decoration {{of the front}} cover includes colour, and the main motif is raised, which is unique among the few surviving Early Medieval bindings. [...] The panels of geometrical decoration with two-stranded interlace closely relate to Insular illuminated manuscripts, and {{can be compared to}} the carpet pages found in these. [...] Elements of the design also relate to Anglo-Saxon metalwork {{in the case of the}} general origin of interlace in manuscripts, and Coptic and other East Mediterranean designs.|$|E
500|$|Tuk {{bands are}} Barbadian musical ensembles, {{consisting}} of a bow-fiddle or pennywhistle flute, kittle triangle and a snare and double-headed bass drum. The kittle and bass drum provide the rhythm, while the flute gives the melody. [...] The drums are light-weight {{so they can be}} carried easily, and are made by both rural villagers and drummers using cured sheepskin and <b>goatskin.</b> Tuk bands are based on the British military's regimental bands, which played for many years for special occasions, like visiting royalty and coronations. The tuk sound has evolved over the years, as has the instrumentation, with the bow-fiddle used before being most commonly replaced by the pennywhistle flute. [...] Tuk bands are now most common in Landship events, but are still sometimes independent. On their own, tuk bands are generally accompanied by a range of iconic Barbadian characters, including [...] "shaggy bears", [...] "mother sally", [...] "the steel donkey" [...] and [...] "green monkeys". [...] The upbeat modern sound of tuk ensembles are a distinctly Barbadian blend of African and British musics.|$|E
50|$|Ko'sso is a fast-paced {{ball game}} {{played by the}} Afar.

500|$|The {{foremost}} document {{containing the}} work of Archimedes is the Archimedes Palimpsest. In 1906, the Danish professor Johan Ludvig Heiberg visited Constantinople and examined a 174-page <b>goatskin</b> parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD. He discovered {{that it was a}} palimpsest, a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as vellum was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes. The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On October 29, 1998 it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million at Christie's in New York. The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of On Floating Bodies in the original Greek. It is the only known source of The Method of Mechanical Theorems, referred to by Suidas and thought to have been lost forever. Stomachion was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest is now stored at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, where it has been subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of ultraviolet and [...] light to read the overwritten text.|$|E
500|$|The {{stitching}} of {{the binding}} uses [...] "Coptic sewing", that is [...] "flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round {{one another in}} a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)" [...] Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. [...] Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. [...] In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. [...] This is also in red <b>goatskin,</b> with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. [...] The first appearance of the cords or supports that these [...] "unsupported" [...] bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques. [...] The cords run horizontally across the spine, and are thicker than the threads that hold the pages together. [...] They are attached, typically by lacing through holes or glue, to the two boards of the cover, and the threads holding the gatherings are knotted to them, resulting in a stronger binding.|$|E

40|$|Alginic acid is {{renewable}} inexpensive non-toxic polysaccharide found {{abundant in}} nature, possessing {{high degree of}} functionalization. Alginic acid is modified and widely used as raw materials in various industries. Alginic acid on selective oxidation gives dialdehyde alginic acid (DAA), a biopolymeric dialdehyde. DAA could be explored as an alternative tanning system. The characteristic effect of this biopolymeric polyaldehyde as a tanning agent has been investigated. Thermal and enzymatic stability of collagen on treatment with the DAA at varied concentration, pH, time and temperature has been studied. DAA treatment of <b>goatskins</b> resulted in a maximum hydrothermal stability of 82 oC at pH 10. The DAA treated <b>goatskins</b> have shown resistance to collagenase. The formation of the crosslinked network between DAA and collagen has brought about significant stability to collagen against thermal and enzymatic degradation by collagenase. Scanning electron microscopic analysis showed a well-coated fibre matrix. The characteristic leather properties of DAA tanned leathers have been discussed and the conditions of tanning have been optimized. The optimized tanned leathers have been compared with chrome tanned leathers for organoleptic properties...|$|R
