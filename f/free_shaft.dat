50|$|The {{turbocharger}} {{is basically}} a compact and simple <b>free</b> <b>shaft</b> radial gas turbine which {{is driven by the}} piston engine's exhaust gas. The centripetal turbine wheel drives a centrifugal compressor wheel through a common rotating shaft. This wheel supercharges the engine air intake to a degree that can be controlled by means of a wastegate or by dynamically modifying the turbine housing's geometry (as in a VGT turbocharger).It mainly serves as a power recovery device which converts a great deal of otherwise wasted thermal and kinetic energy into engine boost.|$|E
50|$|In this setup, {{the most}} common, the speargun is {{attached}} to the shaft by a line. The line is usually a heavy monofilament (300-400 lb test), spectra, or other spectra-like material (braided line) with 400-600+lb rating. The line wraps around the bottom or side of the gun upon loading and releases via a mechanical release or tension release to allow the line to travel with the spear after firing. There are typically two different methods of connecting the line to the spear shaft, either a slide ring that travels up and down the shaft to machined stopping points or via a hole drilled through some portion of the shaft (usually the rear). This is the most common method for taking fish by speargun and the majority of the other types of setups use the mentioned connection options to the shaft. Some newer setups offer an option to quickly attach line to, or disconnect from, a shaft making for a line or <b>free</b> <b>shaft</b> option on a single speargun.|$|E

5000|$|Large scale {{electrification}} {{of factories}} began around 1900 after {{the development of}} the AC motor which was able to run at constant speed depending on the number of poles and the current electrical frequency. [...] At first larger motors were added to line shafts, but as soon as small horsepower motors became widely available, factories switched to unit drive. Eliminating line <b>shafts</b> <b>freed</b> factories of layout constraints and allowed factory layout to be more efficient. Electrification enabled sequential automation using relay logic.|$|R
40|$|An {{earlier study}} {{had shown that}} {{transition}} between stable and unstable behaviour for a heavy horizontal shaft (notating on lubricated bear?ngs) occurred when conditions where realized which permitted elliptical whirls of the shaft such {{that there was no}} increase {{of the value of the}} force due to the lubricant and acting on the journal, over the steady state value : in a sense the shaft was then floating freely on the bear?ng with no interference from the supports (except in so faras they provided the force equ?librating the weight); as a consequence rules of transition ?nvolved thenatural frequencies of the <b>free</b> <b>shaft.</b> These results where obta?ned under the assumption of complete lubrication; if cavitation occurs in thebearings, conditions change. In the present paper it is argued that at transition the excess of the value of the lubricant forces over the steady state value is then such that the exeess force s?mulates an elastic restraining force; as a consequence rules of transit?on involve the natural frequencies of the shaft resting on elastic supports of appropriate rigidity...|$|E
40|$|Most {{balancing}} {{procedures for}} flexible shafts involve {{the use of}} trial weights. The few techniques purporting to predict the shaft unbalance mathematically rely on modelling the system from measured characteristics. The bearings are dfficult to model and the technique presented in the present paper evades the necessityfor doing this.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the self-commissioning of {{synchronous}} reluctance motors. Previous work has demonstrated that the motor flux maps can be accurately identified at standstill by exciting the machine with square-wave voltage pulses of large amplitude, of the same order of the machine nominal voltage. This was made without the need of rotor locking and without using position sensors. The knowledge of the d and q axes position was obtained by a preliminary sensorless commissioning and then used for directing the d and q voltage pulses accordingly, in open-loop fashion. At <b>free</b> <b>shaft,</b> the position tends to oscillate under such alternated excitation, introducing position error and thus inaccuracy. For high values of the torque current component the rotor can even start spinning suddenly, thus stopping the identification. The loss of control impedes of identification of the flux maps above a certain limit, {{at least in the}} q direction. In the past, polynomial fitting was used to extrapolate the flux map in the missing parts of the dq current domain, with good results. In this paper, the rotor position is closed-loop estimated during the motor commissioning, so to counteract the occurrence of sudden spin and extend the explored current area in the q direction. An additional pulsating voltage, also of the square-wave type, is superimposed to the main excitation voltage, and the position is tracked through current demodulation. In this way, the area explored in the dq current plane is substantially extended, if compared to previous method. The proposed approach is verified through experimental results on one synchronous reluctance motor prototype...|$|E
50|$|France {{abandoned}} atmospheric {{nuclear testing}} in 1974 {{and moved to}} underground testing {{in the midst of}} intense world pressure which was sparked by the New Zealand Government of the time, which sent two frigates, HMNZS Canterbury and Otago, to the atoll in protest for a nuclear <b>free</b> Pacific. <b>Shafts</b> were drilled deep into the volcanic rocks underlying the atolls where nuclear devices were detonated. This practice created much controversy as cracking of the atolls was discovered, resulting in fears that the radioactive material trapped under the atolls would eventually escape and contaminate the surrounding ocean and neighbouring atolls. A major accident occurred on 25 July 1979 when a test was conducted at half the usual depth because the nuclear device got stuck halfway down the 800 metre shaft. It was detonated and caused a large submarine landslide on the southwest rim of the atoll, causing a significant chunk of the outer slope of the atoll to break loose and causing a tsunami affecting Mururoa and injuring workers. The blast caused a 2 kilometre long and 40 cm wide crack to appear on the atoll.|$|R
50|$|Operators of 18-wheelers, farm equipment, {{tractors}} and other heavy equipment learn to float the transmission {{in and out}} of gear, beginning with dis-engaging the clutch by pressing the clutch pedal only part way, enough to pull the transmission out of gear, re-engaging the clutch in neutral (between gears by letting the clutch pedal all the way back out) to let the engine revolutions decelerate enough for the idle sprockets to shift, and <b>free</b> gear <b>shafts</b> to slow their revolutions per minute (RPM), then dis-engage the clutch again (by pressing the clutch pedal only part way to the floor) a second time, and float the higher gear into engaging the drive coupling and flywheel and engaging the clutch plates. Professional operators of heavy equipment take extensive safety training before ever learning how to double-clutch. Once an operator is familiar with range, range selector, rpm, velocity, and torque of heavy equipment like an 18-wheeler, he can begin to anticipate when to shift gears. Operators become familiar with ranges of gears. They also learn not to leave their foot on the clutch while driving, because these types of transmissions use the clutch for some very different purposes. The depth the clutch is depressed to the floor will determine what the clutch will be doing as a synchronizing function.|$|R
5000|$|The {{buildings}} were sheds up to 2000 ft long lit either by glazed roofs or [...] "north-lit". Office accommodation was brick, and wherever possible faced a main road. These {{buildings were}} extremely adaptable and would remain {{part of the}} British industrial landscape for more than 50 years. One of the largest was Austin's Cofton Hackett, beside their Longbridge plant, started in August 1936. 1530 ft long and 410 ft wide, the structure covered 20 acre. Later a 15 acre airframe factory was added, then a flight shed 500 ft by 190 ft {{was attached to the}} airframe factory.The new factory buildings were models of efficient factory layout. They had wide clear gangways, good lighting and they were <b>free</b> of <b>shafting</b> and belt drives. The five shadow factories in Coventry were all in production by the end of October 1937 and they were all making parts of the Bristol Mercury engine. By January 1938 two of those shadow factories were producing complete airframes. In July 1938 the first bomber completely built in a shadow factory (Austin's) was flown in front of Sir Kingsley Wood, Secretary of State for Air. It was said eight shadow factories constructing aircraft components were in production in or near Coventry in February 1940.|$|R
50|$|The Douglas {{design team}} {{convinced}} the Army that modifying the XB-42 static test airframe {{into the first}} XB-43 was a relatively straightforward process that would save time and money compared to developing a brand new design. Douglas replaced the two Allison V-1710 engines {{with a pair of}} General Electric (GE) J35 turbojets (the first American axial-flow jet engines ever used), then cut two air intakes into each side of the fuselage, aft of the pressurized cockpit. Removing the propellers and drive <b>shafts</b> <b>freed</b> enough space for two long jet exhaust ducts. Without any propellers present, there was no chance of striking the blade tips on the runway, so the entire ventral fin/rudder unit of the earlier XB-42's full four-surface cruciform tail was omitted. Douglas compensated for the loss of yaw stability by enlarging the dorsal fin/rudder unit.|$|R
60|$|Now, it befel me that, {{fresh from}} the Tropic forests, and with their forms hanging always, as it were, in the {{background}} of my eye, I was impressed more and more vividly the longer I looked, with the likeness of those forest forms to the forms of our own Cathedral of Chester. The grand and graceful Chapter-house transformed itself into one of those green bowers, which, once seen, and never to be seen again, make one at once richer and poorer for the rest of life. The fans of groining sprang from the short columns, just as do the feathered boughs of the far more beautiful Maximiliana palm, and just of the same size and shape: and met overhead, as I have seen them meet, in aisles longer by far than our cathedral nave. The <b>free</b> upright <b>shafts,</b> which give such strength, and yet such lightness, to the mullions of each window, pierced upward through those curving lines, as do the stems of young trees through the fronds of palm; and, like them, carried the eye and the fancy up into the infinite, and took off a sense of oppression and captivity which the weight of the roof might have produced. In the nave, in the choir the same vision of the Tropic forest haunted me. The fluted columns not only resembled, but seemed copied from the fluted stems beneath which I had ridden in the primeval woods; their bases, their capitals, seemed copied from the bulgings at the collar of the root, and at the spring of the boughs, produced by a check of the redundant sap; and were garlanded often enough like the capitals of the columns, with delicate tracery of parasite leaves and flowers; the mouldings of the arches seemed copied from the parallel bundles of the curving bamboo shoots; and even the flatter roof of the nave and transepts had its antitype in that highest level of the forest aisles, where the trees, having climbed at last to the light-food which they seek, care no longer to grow upward, but spread out in huge limbs, almost horizontal, reminding the eye of the four-centred arch which marks the period of Perpendicular Gothic.|$|R
60|$|U---- and I {{walked out}} in the afternoon, {{and went into the}} Piazza del Campo, the {{principal}} place of the city, and a very noble and peculiar one. It is much {{in the form of an}} amphitheatre, and the surface of the ground seems to be slightly scooped out, so that it resembles the shallow basin of a shell. It is thus a much better site for an assemblage of the populace than if it were a perfect level. A semicircle or truncated ellipse of stately and ancient edifices surround the piazza, with arches opening beneath them, through which streets converge hitherward. One side of the piazza is a straight line, and is occupied by the Palazzo Publico, which is a most noble and impressive Gothic structure. It has not the mass of the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence, but is more striking. It has a long battlemented front, the central part of which rises eminent above the rest, in a great square bulk, which is likewise crowned with battlements. This is much more picturesque than the one great block of stone into which the Palazzo Vecchio is consolidated. At one extremity of this long front of the Palazzo Publico rises a tower, shooting up its shaft high, high into the air, and bulging out there into a battlemented fortress, within which the tower, slenderer than before, climbs to a still higher region. I do not know whether the summit of the tower is higher or so high as that of the Palazzo Vecchio; but the length of the <b>shaft,</b> <b>free</b> of the edifice, is much greater, and so produces the more elevating effect. The whole front of the Palazzo Publico is exceedingly venerable, with arched windows, Gothic carvings, and all the old-time ornaments that betoken it to have stood a great while, and the gray strength that will hold it up at least as much longer. At one end of the facade, beneath the shadow of the tower, is a grand and beautiful porch, supported on square pillars, within each of which is a niche containing a statue of mediaeval sculpture.|$|R
