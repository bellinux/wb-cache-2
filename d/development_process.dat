5|$|A {{major change}} in the <b>development</b> <b>process</b> of Perl 5 {{occurred}} with Perl 5.11; the development community has switched to a monthly release cycle of development releases, with a yearly schedule of stable releases.

5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} <b>development</b> <b>process,</b> {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be {{adequate}} in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the <b>development</b> <b>process</b> and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E

5|$|Details of {{the game}} were leaked in February 2007, shortly before Rare {{announced}} development later that month. During <b>development</b> <b>process</b> Rare attempted {{to ensure that the}} game did not feel too similar to the original Jetpac, whilst keeping the core mechanics. The game received mostly favourable reviews upon release. Critics praised the updated graphics and gameplay, however they criticised the overall repetitiveness {{of the game}} and its multiplayer mode. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

5|$|New {{drugs are}} the {{products}} of a long drug <b>development</b> <b>process,</b> {{the first step of}} which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|The {{attempt to}} improve {{mechatronic}} design processes is hindered by their complexity. The process complexity is {{mainly caused by}} an extensive process modularity and by the interdependencies of heterogeneous distributed processes which in turn are due to the interrelation of multidisciplinary domains. A new approach is proposed for planning and improving mechatronic design processes by modelling and simulating distributed <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> using object-oriented Petri Nets. For this purpose, this approach not only implements stochastic characteristics of <b>development</b> <b>processes.</b> It integrates design processes from different domains. In summary, a robust tool for planning and analysing mechatronic <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> is created...|$|R

By 2008, $27 billion had been spent on the program and another $27.2 billion was required to complete planned production numbers. Between 2008 and 2011, the estimated lifetime cost for maintaining the V-22 grew by 61 percent, mostly allocated to maintenance and support.|$|E
