5|$|Lupo the Butcher is a 1987 three-minute {{animated}} short comedy film {{directed and}} written by Danny Antonucci. The short follows {{the story of}} a psychotic butcher who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> temper and swears at his meat when the smallest things go wrong. Produced by Marv Newland's International Rocketship Limited, Lupo the Butcher was a successful short and has earned itself a cult following.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{is closely}} related to some other members of its genus. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are distinctive enough to be potential new species. It <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> range and large population, with no widespread threats, so it is classed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|When an {{aircraft}} carrier deploys, it takes a Strike Group, made up of several other warships and supply vessels which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of short range defensive weapons, used as a {{last line of defense}} against enemy missiles and aircraft. An aircraft carrier, as with all surface ships, is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines. An aircraft carrier is a very expensive, hard to replace and strategically valuable asset and therefore logically <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> target value.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E
5|$|The African crake <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{breeding}} range estimated at 11,700,000km2 (4,500,000mi2). Its population is unknown, {{but it is}} common in most of its range, and its numbers appear to be stable. It is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Overgrazing, agriculture {{and the loss of}} wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears to be under no real threat.|$|E

5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first instar {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge,</b> extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E
