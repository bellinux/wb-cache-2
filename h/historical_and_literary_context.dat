Neither the whole text nor any individual part can be understood without reference to one another, and hence, it is a circle. However, this circular character of interpretation does not make it impossible to interpret a text; rather, it stresses that the meaning of a text must be found within its cultural, <b>historical,</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>context.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore the}} textual {{strategy}} of feminist revision employed by contemporary women writers. After investigating Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea as {{a prototype of}} feminist revision, I focus specifically on Angela Carter’s “The Bloody Chamber” as a revision of Charles Perrault’s “Bluebeard,” Michèle Roberts’s The Book of Mrs Noah as a revision of the Old Testament Flood narrative, Margaret Atwood’s The Penelopiad as a revision of Homer’s Odyssey and the Troy narratives, and Ursula K. Le Guin’s Lavinia as a revision of Vergil’s Aeneid. Through investigating the <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>contexts</b> of each revisioned text, I identify the critical focus of the revision and analyse the textual effect produced by the revision. In each case, the feminist revision exposes the underlying ideological assumptions of the source text. By rewriting the canonical narrative from an alternative perspective, each revision extends beyond the source text, altering meaning and reinterpreting key symbols for feminist ends...|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{responds to}} an ongoing debate between feminist and traditional readings of sexually violent (SV) metaphors in the prophetic texts of Hosea, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and the New Testament book of Revelation. Whereas feminist scholars have often argued that such metaphors are built upon {{the exploitation of}} women 2 ̆ 7 s sexuality, traditionalist scholars have insisted that the metaphors are merely literary devices that should only be read within their <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>contexts.</b> Taking a moderate position, this analysis uses the cognitive metaphor theory to explain that the SV metaphors depend on cognitive associations of dangerous feminine sexuality to relate to historically-specific concerns of the original authors and audiences. This analysis then examines said historically-specific concerns to reveal the literary function of the metaphors in their original contexts. Finally, this analysis closes by considering current sociopsychological concerns that cause contemporary society to continue relying on the same cognitive associations of dangerous feminine sexuality as seen the SV metaphors...|$|R

40|$|The {{seventeenth century}} Benares-based intellectual, Nīlakantha Caturdhara, wrote {{what is still}} the most widely used Sanskrit {{commentary}} on the Mahābhārata. In the commentary Nīlakantha sometimes explains the epic's instruments of war in contemporary terms - as cannons and muskets, for example. He also uses terms from vernacular, even 'barbarous', languages in his glosses. Rather than 'typical' of 'traditional ' Sanskrit commentators, such interpretations by Nīlakantha should be understood as self-consciously innovative. The innovations appear primarily in the epic's descriptions of the fortifications of cities.

40|$|While often assumed, Gerard Manley Hopkins' {{influence}} on Dylan Thomas has needed substantiation. By placing {{the issue of}} Hopkins' {{influence on}} Thomas within critical, <b>historical,</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>contexts,</b> this study explores the issue and demonstrates Hopkins' influence. Summary and assessment of previous critical work {{on the issue of}} Hopkins' influence establish the ways in which this study continues, diverges from or completes work done in the past.

A discussion of Thomas' Welsh background relates his experience of Wales and Welsh prosody to Hopkins' corresponding experiences. The <b>literary</b> <b>context</b> of the issue of Hopkins' influence on Thomas is established by means of a two-part foundation. First, the possible influence of W. B. Yeats, Wilfred Owen, Hart Crane, and James Joyce on Thomas is distinguished from Hopkins' influence. Second, specifically Hopkinsian areas of influence on Thomas are discussed. These areas of influence serve as a critical framework within which six Thomas poems dating from 1934 to 1951 are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between identity - understood not as an essence, but rather a positioning - {{and the work of}} German-Jewish women authors. The period 1900 - 1938 provided them {{with a wide range of}} possible self-identifications, both between Jewish tradition (or 'Jewish renaissance') and acculturation, and between a traditional and modern understanding of the position of women. By examining their texts in the <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>contexts</b> in which they were written, the analyses in this book reveal traditions and positions that are not necessarily communicated directly by the German-Jewish authors themselves.

40|$|Official {{documents}} of the Roman Catholic Church make ample use of the Bible. The way the Scripture text functions in magisterial documents depends on the operative theology that underlies these texts. This paper investigates {{the changes that have}} occurred in the Church’s understanding and use of Scripture in Magisterial documents, more particularly in texts concerning the social teachings of the church. The study broadly classifies three paradigms of understanding Scripture, citing examples from official documents to illustrate their functioning: 1) The Bible as a collection of doctrinal propositions, 2) the Bible as a record of God’s saving actions in history and 3) the Bible as a vision of full communion with God and neighbour. The latter two paradigms are realised in nascent form in the Vatican II document Dei Verbum, while the former had been prevalent in pre-Vatican II documents and has reappeared after the Vatican II era. The understanding of the Bible as a collection of doctrinal propositions is shown to be relatively oblivious to the respective <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>contexts,</b> whereas the other two models demonstrate increasing sensitivity to them by emphasising transformation and communion as opposed to information. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This project {{explores the}} {{intersection}} between nineteenth-century British and Russian realist novels and philosophical accounts {{of how we}} realize the world through perception and cognition. Using an interdisciplinary methodology that combines Wittgensteinian philosophy with comparative reading practices, I argue that fiction is real insofar as it acts as a performative space that refracts the world through a purpose-driven interpretive and affective framework that allows readers to realize internal change. Treating readings as `moments of realization,' which participate in, reflect upon, and transform lived realities, I advocate reading practices that deploy critical self-reflection to promote ethical self-development. The first chapter argues that realism's seemingly objective descriptive style is significant not for the accuracy of its mimetic picture, but rather for organizing the world into an intersocially available space conceived in Kantian terms. Moving from an objective to subjective perspective, the second chapter explores the basis of psychological realism as a self-directed means for articulating one's position within society to oneself. The third chapter connects these outward and inward gazes {{to the development of}} becoming subjects who realize internal change in response to fiction. Finally, the fourth chapter raises ethical questions that arise {{as a result of this}} becoming-oriented approach. Woven through these reflections are extended dialogues with the <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>contexts</b> of the realist movement designed to promote interdisciplinary discussion...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} genre of Ovidian female-voiced {{complaint}} poetry and its tradition in early modern English literature. In looking at original poems, translations and receptions of Ovid’s Heroides, I argue that female as well as male writers throughout the early modern period engaged with the tradition of Ovidian female-voiced complaint poetry. By using case studies advancing chronologically throughout the period, I will also show how female-voiced complaint changes and develops in different <b>historical</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>contexts.</b> Nobody as yet has produced a study looking at a large sample of women writing female-voiced complaint. The criticism around complaint is diffuse, with {{only a small number}} of book-length studies which focus on complaint in general as a genre or discourse. There are many articles or chapters on individual complaint poems but not many which compare different female-voiced complaints of the same period, especially those written by women. When female poets write in the genre, the rhetorical trope of Ovidian female-voiced complaint (that the sex of the author is discontinuous with that of the speaker) must be renegotiated. This renegotiation by female poets is often the result of close and learned engagement with the traditions of complaint, both the classical precedents and the receptions and re-imaginations of the genre in early modern England. They are choosing a genre which has a productive potential in being female-voiced but which also has a tradition of male manipulation. However, rather than seeing women writers as existing separately from male writers, I argue that they work in parallel, drawing on the same Ovidian complaint traditions...|$|R
