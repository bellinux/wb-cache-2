50|$|Once a man {{was made}} a freeman and was no longer {{considered}} a common, he could {{become a member of}} the church (and would usually do so) and he could own land. The amount of land that he was able to own was sometimes determined by how many members there were in his family. As a freeman, he became a member of the governing body, which met in annual or semiannual meetings (town meetings) to make and enforce laws and pass <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> civil and <b>criminal</b> <b>matters.</b> As the colonies grew, these meetings became impractical and a representative bicameral system was developed. Freemen would choose deputy governors who made up the upper house of the General Court, and assistant governors who made up the lower house, who chose the governor from among their ranks and passed <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> civil and <b>criminal</b> <b>matters.</b> To hold one of these offices it was required, of course, for one to be a freeman. Thus, the enfranchised voters and office holders were landholding male church members. Non-Puritans were not made freeman.|$|R
