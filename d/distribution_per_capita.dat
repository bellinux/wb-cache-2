40|$|During {{the last}} year, the {{research}} field of spatial economic has rapidly increased. There is {{consensus that the}} economic performance of a region depends not only on its own potential, {{but also on the}} development of their neighbouring regions. Knowledge spillovers, which are non constant over space, should influence the evolution of the region specific productivity. The so called "folk theorem of spatial economics" states, that increasing returns to scale are essential for explaining the uneven economic distri- bution of specific economic activity, which implies that knowledge spillover, agglom- eration and <b>distribution</b> of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> productivity are closely linked. Thus, the aim of this paper is, to introduce a spatial regional growth model, which links first time knowledge spillover, agglomeration, <b>distribution</b> of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> productivity and the grasp of spillovers. Further, it is shown in a simulation study, how different regimes of returns to scale and grasps of knowledge affect agglomeration and <b>distribution</b> of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> productivity. One of key findings is, that grasp of knowledge affects dynamic <b>distribution</b> of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> productivity.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} {{economic}} growth {{have focused on}} the issue of persistent inequality across countries. In this paper we study mechanisms that may give rise to such a persistent inequality. We consider countries that maximize the present value of their future net income through a dynamic investment strategy, yet they may be heterogeneous with respect to certain characteristics. We show that the long-run dynamics of the heterogeneous countries can generate a twinpeaked <b>distribution</b> of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income. The twin-peaked distribution is seen to be caused by (1) locally increasing returns to scale in production and (2) capital market imperfections on the financial market. Those two forces give rise to a twin-peaked <b>distribution</b> of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income in the long run. In our model the dynamic decision problem of maximizing the present value is separated from consumption decisions. We treat the present value of the net income flow as constraint on consumption.

The approach used here exploits both the time-series and cross-section dimensions of the data by tracking the evolution over time of the entire cross-section distributions. Through the estimation of transition matrices for each of these welfare indicators, we are able to analyze changes in the external shapes of the distributions as well as the intra-distribution mobility of states. This allows us to analyze the long-run distributions by computing the invariant or ergodic distributions implied by the estimated transition matrices.

We combine analysis of a panel data set of 99 countries from 1971 to 2010 with analysis of some longer run historical data. Our key result is that over the last 40 years there has been a stable cross-sectional relationship between per capita energy use and income per capita with an elasticity of energy use with respect to income of less than unity. This implies that energy intensity has tended to decrease in countries that have become richer but not in others. We also find that over the last two centuries there has been convergence in energy intensity towards the current <b>distribution,</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> energy use has tended to rise and energy quality to increase, and, though evidence is limited, the cost share of energy has declined.

The impact of four policy instruments of SAP, i. e. reduction in budget deficit, increase in indirect taxes,adjusting the exchange rate and sliding down of subsidies, on employment, income distribution, per-capita income and inflation has been analyzed. It is found that the first policy instrument, i. e. decrease in budget deficit has affected employment, income distribution and inflation adversely. The second policy instrument of imposition of indirect tax negatively affected the employment, income <b>distribution,</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income and positively affected the inflation. The third policy instrument of SAP was adjustment of exchange rate. It is estimated that adjusting exchange rate has resulted into increased unemployment and inflation. The fourth policy instrument of shrink in subsidies augmented the unemployment, unequal distribution of income and inflation and dwindled the percapita income. It appears that SAP has adversely affected the major socioeconomic variables of the economy.

40|$|The {{strength}} of interactions between predators and their prey (interaction strength) varies enormously among species within ecological communities. Understanding the community-wide distribution of interaction strengths is vital, given that communities dominated by weak interactions {{may be more}} stable and resistant to invasion. In the oceans, previous studies have reported log-normal <b>distributions</b> of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> interaction strength. We estimated the distribution of predator–prey interaction strengths within a subtidal speciose herbivore community (45 species). Laboratory experiments {{were used to determine}} maximum <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> interaction strengths for eight species of herbivores (including amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and sea urchins) that graze on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) microscopic stages. We found that maximum <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> interaction strength saturated as a function of individual herbivore biomass, likely caused by predator/prey size thresholds. Incorporating this nonlinearity, we predicted maximum <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> interaction strength for the remaining herbivore species. The resulting <b>distribution</b> of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> interaction strengths was bimodal, in striking contrast to previous reports from other communities. Although small herbivores often had <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> interaction strengths similar to larger herbivores, their tendency to have greater densities in the field increased their potential impact as grazers. These results indicate that previous conclusions about the distributions of interaction strength in natural communities are not general, and that intermediate-sized predators can under realistic circumstances represent the most effective consumers in natural communities...|$|R
40|$|This article shows that, {{contrary}} to common wisdom, the insurgence of {{a multiplicity of}} clusters {{in the distribution of}} income is not necessarily against the hypothesis of absolute convergence.

Similarly, although the distributions for the EU regions and the US states are both unimodal, convergence is unambiguously taking place in the latter case only.

40|$|Summary. This paper {{examines}} spatial polarisation in {{the regional}} <b>distribution</b> of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income {{in a set of}} European Union countries over the period 1980 – 2001.

In addition, the empirical evidence presented clearly supports the key role played by national development processes in this context. The estimations show that, beyond a certain level of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income, regional polarisation decreases as the process of economic development advances. However, there are signs to suggest that regional polarisation increases once a relatively high level of <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income is attained, although this rise is less marked than the decrease experienced previously. In fact, these findings are robust to the inclusion of additional variables in the analysis and to the choice of the measure used to quantify regional polarisation. 1...|$|R
