50|$|The Chelford rail {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 22 December 1894 at Chelford railway station. The stationmaster was supervising shunting operations, during which a <b>high-sided</b> <b>wagon</b> was fly-shunted (i.e. run-off) into a siding in strong winds and rapidly fading light. As another six wagons were being run onto an adjoining road, the stationmaster saw the <b>high-sided</b> <b>wagon</b> being {{blown out of}} its siding by the wind to meet them. A collision occurred derailing the runaway {{in such a way}} that it fouled the main line just as the 16:15 Manchester to Crewe express approached, drawn by two locomotives, LNWR Waterloo Class 2-4-0 No 418 Zygia and Experiment Class No 518 Express. The stationmaster ran towards them waving a red lamp but the drivers thought he was signalling to the shunters and did not slacken speed. Zygia derailed and fell on her side whilst her tender ran up the platform ramp. Express remained upright but the first carriage demolished the front of a signalbox. In all, 14 passengers were killed and 48 injured.|$|E

Wagons with special bays or stalls were only used for the transport of racing horses whilst small livestock, such as sheep, goats, poultry and rabbits were transported in livestock wagons with slatted sides and/or hutches. Originally <b>high-sided</b> <b>wagons</b> were also used to move cattle as well as horses and pigs. For the transport of military horses in goods wagons, tethering rings were fitted. The transportation of large and small animals required special fittings - air vents, means of tethering, drinking facilities and viewing ports - {{in order to avoid}} quantitative and qualitative losses. Even troops were transported in covered goods wagons.|$|R
