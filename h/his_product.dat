5|$|Between 1959 and 1962, Balabushka {{handcrafted}} between 20 and 30 cues {{per year}} on a part-time basis. Because of the relative dearth of private cuemakers and the excellence of <b>his</b> <b>product,</b> Balabushka's name quickly became known amongst professional players. By the end of 1962, Balabushka was receiving more orders for cues than he could fill given his time constraints. Balabushka accordingly sold {{his interest in the}} pool room, converted his garage into a carpentry shop, and by 1964 was building cues full-time, while continuing to hone his cuemaking abilities.|$|E

After attending the schools of his birthplace, he moved west to Winnipeg with his family, and became involved in the family meat packing business, established by his father. He would soon move west again to what would later become the province of Saskatchewan, where he would continue his business, providing <b>his</b> <b>product</b> to the local police establishments and soldiers during the North-West Rebellion. After his contracts expired there, Gallagher would move again further west, to Edmonton, where he would permanently settle.|$|E

5000|$|In 1920, Crosley first {{selected}} independent local dealers as {{the best}} way to take <b>his</b> <b>products</b> to market. He insisted that all sellers of <b>his</b> <b>products</b> must give the consumer the best in parts, service, and satisfaction. Always sensitive to consumers, <b>his</b> <b>products</b> were often less expensive than other name brands, but were guaranteed.

50|$|In 1930, Crosley added {{refrigerators}} {{and other}} household appliances to <b>his</b> <b>products.</b> Because he had invested {{in his own}} businesses instead of the stock market, he was better able than many other industrialists to keep his employees working and <b>his</b> <b>products</b> {{available to the public}} during the Great Depression.|$|R

25|$|When Busch {{implemented}} pasteurization (1878) {{as a way}} to {{keep the}} beer fresh for longer, his company was able to profit from shipping beer across the country. Busch soon acquired breweries in Texas which allowed his operation to distribute to Mexico and California. Busch was an early adopter of bottled beer and founded the Busch Glass Company to make bottles for <b>his</b> <b>product.</b> In 1901 sales surpassed the one million barrels of beer benchmark.|$|E
25|$|If a {{manufacturer}} {{can not make}} money in competition with other concerns when using the same methods of figuring costs, he can only conclude that his goods or his marketing, or both of them, are costing him too much.

25|$|The prince {{next came}} across a railway {{switchman}} who told him how passengers constantly rushed {{from one place to}} another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. A merchant then talked to the prince about <b>his</b> <b>product,</b> a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again underscoring the materialism and lack of spirituality of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Hershey {{transferred}} {{the majority of}} his assets, including control of the company, to the Milton Hershey School Trust fund, to benefit the Industrial School.

The Milton Hershey School Trust also has 100% control of Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company, which owns the Hotel Hershey and Hersheypark, among other properties.

25|$|After {{the first}} four episodes, the show gained its initial sponsor when Dr. Jules Montenier paid to have <b>his</b> <b>product,</b> Stopette spray deodorant, {{featured}} in advertising on the program. This involved featuring the product in the show's opening, {{on the front of}} the panel's desk, above the sign-in board, and on Daly's scorecards. In his last years, Cerf explained to interviewer Robbin Hawkins that Dr. Montenier was ultimately ruined by his refusal to abandon or share sponsorship as the show entered new markets and became too expensive. After Dr. Montenier sold Stopette to Helene Curtis, the series was sponsored by a variety of companies which were either regular or rotating. Sponsors were accorded the same exposure on the set as Stopette. One of the first rotating sponsors, which actually came before Montenier's sale of Stopette to Helene Curtis (who continued to sponsor the program after the purchase and still promoted Stopette in their advertising), was the Remington Rand Corporation, who used their time to promote their line of electric shavers and business machines such as the UNIVAC.|$|E

500|$|In December 2001 Townsend announced, {{contrary}} to his earlier public statements, a new Strapping Young Lad album {{would be released}} in 2002. He emphasized he was not [...] "forcing" [...] <b>his</b> <b>product</b> upon fans to generate record sales, arguing his band—and its contract with Century—was never a lucrative endeavor. [...] Instead, Townsend's motivation was the [...] "creative anger" [...] sparked by the September 11, 2001 attacks and further cultivated during their 2001 tour. For the first time, the album would be a product of collaborative writing; the band wrote [...] "about half" [...] of the material on the 2001 Foot In Mouth Tour, and the rest at home, starting January 2002. After playing {{a small number of}} festivals in 2002, Strapping Young Lad entered the studio in September of that year, to record their third album.|$|E
500|$|After {{studying}} penmanship, bookkeeping {{and business}} law in North Central College (by then Northwestern College), he failed as {{an owner of}} a local hardware store.

[...] He then proved very successful in selling the company's product, and went on to start his own barbed wire manufacturing business, which eventually led to the production of steel. In the process, his company was purchased by J. P. Morgan's U. S. Steel. Gates was not invited {{to become part of the}} company, and he fought back at Morgan for many years through a series of business acquisitions and sales; both men were key figures in the Panic of 1907.|$|E
