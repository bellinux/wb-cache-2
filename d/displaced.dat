5|$|According to Serbian sources, some 120,000 Serbs were <b>displaced</b> from 1991 to 1993, and 250,000 were <b>displaced</b> after Operation Storm. The {{number of}} <b>displaced</b> Serbs was 254,000 in 1993, {{dropping}} to 97,000 {{in the early}} 1995 and then increasing again to 200,000 {{by the end of}} the year. Most international sources place the total number of Serbs <b>displaced</b> at around 300,000. According to Amnesty International 300,000 were <b>displaced</b> from 1991 to 1995, of which 117,000 were officially registered as having returned as of 2005. According to the OSCE, 300,000 were <b>displaced</b> during the war, of which 120,000 were officially registered as having returned as of 2006. However, it is believed the number does not accurately reflect the number of returnees, because many returned to Serbia, Montenegro, or Bosnia and Herzegovina after officially registering in Croatia. According to the UNHCR in 2008, 125,000 were registered as having returned to Croatia, of whom 55,000 remained permanently.|$|E
5|$|In total, the war caused 500,000 {{refugees}} and <b>displaced</b> persons. Around 196,000 to 247,000 (in 1993) Croats and other non-Serbs were <b>displaced</b> {{during the war}} from or around the RSK. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said that 221,000 were <b>displaced</b> in 2006, of which 218,000 had returned. The majority were <b>displaced</b> during the initial fighting and during the JNA offensives of 1991 and 1992. Some 150,000 Croats from Republika Srpska and Serbia have obtained Croatian citizenship since 1991, many due to incidents like the expulsions in Hrtkovci.|$|E
5|$|The war <b>displaced</b> a 192,000 people {{including}} both Ossetians and Georgians.

5000|$|When any boat <b>displaces</b> {{a weight}} of water equal {{to its own}} weight, it floats. This is often called the [...] "principle of flotation": A {{floating}} object <b>displaces</b> a weight of fluid equal to its own weight. Every ship, submarine, and dirigible must be designed to <b>displace</b> a weight of fluid at least equal to its own weight. A 10,000-ton ship's hull must be built wide enough, long enough and deep enough to <b>displace</b> 10,000 tons of water and still have some hull above the water {{to prevent it from}} sinking. It needs extra hull to fight waves that would otherwise fill it and, by increasing its mass, cause it to submerge. The same is true for vessels in air: a dirigible that weighs 100 tons needs to <b>displace</b> 100 tons of air. If it <b>displaces</b> more, it rises; if it <b>displaces</b> less, it falls. If the dirigible <b>displaces</b> exactly its weight, it hovers at a constant altitude.|$|R

5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become <b>displaced</b> from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was <b>displaced</b> from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation <b>displaced</b> from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E

5|$|People <b>displaced</b> by the 2010 {{earthquake}} are at {{an increased}} risk of sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally <b>displaced,</b> primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally <b>displaced,</b> which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} how configurations of urban railroads and highways influenced urban form in Chinese cities since 1990. Each radial highway <b>displaces</b> at least 5 percent of central city population to surrounding regions and ring roads <b>displace</b> an additional 20 percent. Each radial railroad <b>displaces</b> 26 percent of central city industrial GDP with ring roads <b>displacing</b> an additional 50 percent. The production of goods with high weight-to-value ratios is unresponsive to transport yet those with medium and low weight-to-value ratios decentralize {{in response to}} radial railroads and ring roads. Historical transportation infrastructure provides identifying variation in more recent measures of infrastructure...|$|R

5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 onward, the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants <b>displaced</b> by redevelopment or bombing.
