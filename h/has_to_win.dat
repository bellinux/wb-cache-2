5|$|Initially, Vortigaunts {{were planned}} to begin Half-Life as enemy non-player characters, which the player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> over as allies and lead in rebellion. This idea, however, proved {{impractical}} and was abandoned {{in favor of}} keeping the Vortigaunts as adversaries. The plan re-emerged for Half-Life 2, in which the species are active allies of the player. The Vortigaunts in Half-Life 2 were originally going to be fully integrated in City 17 alongside the humans under Combine rule. This did not reach fruition; due to the focus on developing the city combat, the resources to accomplish this were not available. As there were so few resulting Vortigaunts in the city, the developers instead decided to involve the Vortigaunts far more substantially in the sections of the game {{taking place in the}} countryside surrounding the city. The few Vortigaunts placed inside the city were used to hint at the story arc for the Vortigaunts later in the game. Midway through Half-Life 2, the player witnesses a scene with a deceased Vortigaunt in a prison. Originally, the developers were intending to feature this Vortigaunt as an ally character who, if players rescue him, would fight enemy characters alongside the player. The developers liked this idea, {{but it was too late}} in the development to attempt this; instead, the idea was preserved for use in Episode Two. The concept was later showcased in an Episode Two trailer shown at the Games Convention in 2006.|$|E

Under the MMP system each person has two votes; one is for electoral seats (including some reserved for Māori), {{and the other is}} for a party. Since the , there have been 71 electorate seats (which includes 7 Māori electorates), and the remaining 49 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote, although a party <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> one electoral seat or 5 percent of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats.

500|$|In 1998, the [...] "Final Four" [...] format {{used in the}} University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) {{was first}} applied: in a {{modified}} Shaughnessy playoff system, the two teams with the best records possess the [...] "twice to beat advantage" [...] in which they only have to win once {{to advance to the}} best-of-three finals while their opponents have to win twice.

At the introduction of the [...] "Final Four" [...] format the unbeaten team had an outright finals berth with the twice to beat advantage while the remaining three teams played in a single-elimination tournament; in 2008, the unbeaten team still had an outright finals berth but the finals was a best-of-three series.

60|$|Next {{after the}} fishing-boat--which, as I said, in the {{architecture}} of the sea represents the cottage, more especially the pastoral or agricultural cottage, watchful over some pathless domain of moorland or arable, as the fishing-boat swims, humbly {{in the midst of the}} broad green fields and hills of ocean, out of which it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> such fruit as they can give, and to compass with net or drag such flocks as it may find,--next to this ocean-cottage ranks in interest, it seems to me, the small, over-wrought, under-crewed, ill-caulked merchant brig or schooner; the kind of ship which first shows its couple of thin masts over the low fields or marshes as we near any third-rate sea-port; and which is sure somewhere to stud the great space of glittering water, seen from any sea-cliff, with its four or five square-set sails. Of the larger and more polite tribes of merchant vessels, three-masted, and passenger-carrying, I have nothing to say, feeling in general little sympathy with people who want to go anywhere; nor caring much about anything, which in the essence of it expresses a desire to get to other sides of the world; but only for homely and stay-at-home ships, that live their life and die their death about English rocks. Neither have I any interest in the higher branches of commerce, such as traffic with spice islands, and porterage of painted tea-chests or carved ivory; for all this seems to me to fall under the head of commerce of the drawing-room; costly, but not venerable. I respect in the merchant service only those ships that carry coals, herrings, salt, timber, iron, and such other commodities, and that have disagreeable odor, and unwashed decks. But there are few things more impressive to me than one of these ships lying up against some lonely quay in a black sea-fog, with the furrow traced under its tawny keel far in the harbor slime. The noble misery that there is in it, the might of its rent and strained unseemliness, its wave-worn melancholy, resting there for a little while in the comfortless ebb, unpitied, and claiming no pity; still less honored, least of all conscious of any claim to honor; casting and craning by due balance whatever is in its hold up to the pier, in quiet truth of time; spinning of wheel, and slackening of rope, and swinging of spade, in as accurate cadence as a waltz music; one or two of its crew, perhaps, away forward, and a hungry boy and yelping dog eagerly interested in something from which a blue dull smoke rises out of pot or pan; but dark-browed and silent, their limbs slack, like the ropes above them, entangled as they are in those inextricable meshes about the patched knots and heaps of ill-reefed sable sail. What a majestic sense of service in all that languor! the rest of human limbs and hearts, at utter need, not in sweet meadows or soft air, but in harbor slime and biting fog; so drawing their breath once more, to go out again, without lament, from between the two skeletons of pier-heads, vocal with wash of under wave, into the gray troughs of tumbling brine; there, as they can, with slacked rope, and patched sail, and leaky hull, again to roll and stagger far away amidst the wind and salt sleet, from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn, winning day by day their daily bread; and for last reward, when their old hands, on some winter night, lose feeling along the frozen ropes, and their old eyes miss mark of the lighthouse quenched in foam, the so-long impossible Rest, that shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more,--their eyes and mouths filled with the brown sea-sand.|$|E
