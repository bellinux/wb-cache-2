50|$|A regular icosagram, {20/9}, {{can be seen}} as a quasitruncated decagon, t{10/9}={20/9}. Similarly a <b>decagram,</b> {10/3} has a quasi{{truncation}} t{10/7}={20/7}, {{and finally}} a simple truncation of a <b>decagram</b> gives t{10/3}={20/3}.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, a <b>decagram</b> is a 10-point star polygon. There is one regular <b>decagram,</b> {{containing}} the vertices {{of a regular}} decagon, but connected by every third point. Its Schläfli symbol is {10/3}.|$|E
50|$|It has 12 pentagons and 12 <b>decagrams,</b> {10/3} faces.|$|R

50|$|In geometry, the {{truncated}} dodecadodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U59. It {{is given}} a Schläfli symbol t0,1,2{5/3,5}. It has 120 vertices and 54 faces: 30 squares, 12 decagons, and 12 <b>decagrams.</b> The central region of the polyhedron {{is connected to the}} exterior via 20 small triangular holes.|$|R
5000|$|The name {{truncated}} dodecadodecahedron {{is somewhat}} misleading: truncation of the dodecadodecahedron would produce rectangular faces rather than squares, and the pentagram {{faces of the}} dodecahedron would turn into truncated pentagrams rather than <b>decagrams.</b> However, it is the quasitruncation of the dodecadodecahedron, as defined by [...] For this reason, it {{is also known as}} the quasitruncated dodecadodecahedron. Coxeter et al. credit its discovery to a paper published in 1881 by Austrian mathematician Johann Pitsch.|$|R

Her poems have been translated into German, English, French, Spanish, Hungarian, Dutch, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Belarusian, Italian, Slovenian, Polish, Japanese, and Greek. Especially interesting is the publication entitled Staklena trava (Glass Grass), collection of seven poems in seven languages (French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Spanish), published by Agora, Zrenjanin, 2012. She is present in thematic and other anthologies home and abroad, representing Serbian poetry today, inter alia: Poesia Serbia hoy, Debats (institutció Alfons el Magnànim, Valencia, n.109 2010/4) and Les Poètes de la Mediterannée (preface by Yves Bonnefoy, Gallimar & Culturesfrance, 2010); Hundert grams Seele, Ten <b>Decagrams</b> of Soul, The Anthology of Serbian Poetry of the Second Part of the Twentieth Century (edited by Robert Hodel, Leipziger Literaturverlag, 2011), The Anthology of Serbian Poetry of XX and XXI Century (Herg Benet Publishers, Bucharest, 2012), El Color de la Esencia (Monográfico de Poesía Serbia Contemporánea—the Monography of Contemporary Serbian Poetry (Silvia Monrós de Stojakovic, Anfora Nova, Nova, Rute, Córdoba, Spain, 2013).|$|R

5000|$|A regular <b>decagram</b> is a 10-sided polygram, {{represented}} by symbol {10/n}, containing the same vertices as regular decagon.

50|$|In geometry, the crossed pentagrammic cupola {{is one of}} the nonconvex Johnson solid isomorphs, being topologically {{identical}} to the convex pentagonal cupola. It can be obtained as a slice of the great rhombicosidodecahedron or quasirhombicosidodecahedron. As in all cupolae, the base polygon has twice as many edges and vertices as the top; in this case the base polygon is a <b>decagram.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1795 {{a new law}} {{replaced}} the three names gravet, grave and bar by a single generic unit name: the gram. The new gram was equal to the old gravet. Four new prefixes were added to cover the same range of units as in 1793 (milligram, centigram, decigram, gram, <b>decagram,</b> hectogram, kilogram, myriagram). The brass prototype of the grave was renamed to provisional kilogram.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, the crossed pentagrammic cupola {{is one of}} the nonconvex Johnson solid isomorphs, being topologically {{identical}} to the convex pentagonal cupola. It can be obtained as a slice of the nonconvex great rhombicosidodecahedron or quasirhombicosidodecahedron, analogously to how the pentagonal cupola may be obtained as a slice of the rhombicosidodecahedron. As in all cupolae, the base polygon has twice as many edges and vertices as the top; in this case the base polygon is a <b>decagram.</b>|$|E
50|$|In geometry, the crossed {{pentagonal}} cupoloid or crossed pentagonal semicupola is {{one member}} of the infinite family of cuploids. It can be obtained as a slice of the great complex rhombicosidodecahedron. As in all cupolae, the base polygon has twice as many edges and vertices as the top; but in this case the base polygon is a degenerate {10/4} <b>decagram,</b> as the top is a {5/4} pentagon. Hence, the degenerate base is withdrawn and the triangles are connected to the squares instead.|$|E
50|$|The prefix {{was a part}} of the {{original}} metric system in 1795. It is not in very common usage, although the decapascal is occasionally used by audiologists. The decanewton is also encountered occasionally, probably because it is an SI approximation of the kilogram-force. Its use is more common in Central Europe. In German, Polish (deka, deko), Czech, Slovak and Hungarian, deca is common (and used as a word on its own always means <b>decagram).</b> A runway number typically indicates its heading in decadegrees.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{practical}} synthesis method of the reagent PhenoFluor on <b>decagram</b> scale, provide a new formulation of PhenoFluor as a toluene solution, which should decrease challenges {{associated with the}} moisture sensitivity of the reagent, and expand the substrate scope of deoxyfluorination with PhenoFluor to heteroaromatics...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} deoxyfluorination with novel deoxyfluorinating reagent PhenoFluorMix, {{a mixture}} of N,N'- 1, 3 -bis(2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) chloroimidazolium chloride and CsF, is presented. PhenoFluorMix overcomes the challenges associated with hydrolysis of PhenoFluor. PhenoFluorMix does not hydrolyze, is readily available on <b>decagram</b> scale, and is storable in air. In this paper, we demonstrate the practicality of the reagent and exhibit the deoxyfluorination {{of a variety of}} phenols and heterocycles...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a technique of projection onto the Coxeter plane of an arbitrary higher dimensional lattice {{described by the}} affine Coxeter group. The Coxeter plane {{is determined by the}} simple roots of the Coxeter graph I 2 (h) where h is the Coxeter number of the Coxeter group W(G) which embeds the dihedral group Dh of order 2 h as a maximal subgroup. As a simple application we demonstrate projections of the root and weight lattices of A 4 onto the Coxeter plane using the strip (canonical) projection method. We show that the crystal spaces of the affine Wa(A 4) can be decomposed into two orthogonal spaces whose point groups is the dihedral group D 5 which acts in both spaces faithfully. The strip projections of the root and weight lattices can be taken as models for the decagonal quasicrystals. The paper also revises the quaternionic descriptions of the root and weight lattices, described by the affine Coxeter group Wa(A 3), which correspond to the face centered cubic (fcc) lattice and body centered cubic (bcc) lattice respectively. Extensions of these lattices to higher dimensions lead to the root and weight lattices of the group Wa(An), n>= 4. We also note that the projection of the Voronoi cell of the root lattice of Wa(A 4) describes a framework of nested <b>decagram</b> growing with the power of the golden ratio recently discovered in the Islamic arts.
