5|$|Russula emetica {{is one of}} over 100 red-capped Russula species known worldwide. The related {{beechwood}} sickener (R.nobilis) {{is found}} under beech in Europe. Many, such as the bloody brittlegill (R.sanguinaria), are inedible; this species can be distinguished from R.emetica by the reddish <b>flush</b> <b>in</b> its stem. R.aurea, however, is edible. It has a yellow stem, gills and flesh under its red cap. The edible R.rugulosa—common in mixed woods in the eastern and northern United States—has a wrinkled and pimpled cap cuticle, cream spores, and mild taste. Another inedible species, R.fragilis, has notched gills, and its stem stains blue with naphthol. The uncommon European subspecies R.emetica longipes is distinguished by its longer stem and ochre gills. The paler European mushroom R.betularum, found in coniferous forests and moorland, is sometimes considered a subspecies of R.emetica. R.nana is restricted in distribution to arctic and subarctic highland meadows where dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) or alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) are abundant.|$|E

40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) {{seems to}} be {{involved}} <b>in</b> hot <b>flushes</b> <b>in</b> women and in castrated men. Therefore, we studied whether the plasma concentrations of CGRP changed during <b>flushes</b> <b>in</b> a group of healthy aging men. Twelve men (49 - 71 years) with no history of current or former prostate cancer or hormonal treatment reporting greater than= 20 flushes/week were investigated. Blood samples were drawn during and between flushes for analysis of CGRP and also androgen concentrations, that is, testosterone and bioavailable testosterone were analysed. Skin temperature and skin conductance were monitored. Thirty-five flushes were reported by 10 men. The plasma concentrations of CGRP did not increase during flushes. No significant change in skin temperature or conductance was found. CGRP is probably {{not involved in the}} mechanisms of <b>flushes</b> <b>in</b> healthy aging men. Therefore, <b>flushes</b> <b>in</b> aging healthy men seem to be different from <b>flushes</b> <b>in</b> men and women deprived of sex steroids where CGRP increases during flushes...|$|R

25|$|It is a {{commonly}} held misconception that when flushed, {{the water in}} a toilet bowl swirls one way if the toilet is north of the equator and the other way if south of the equator, due to the Coriolis effect – usually, counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. In reality, the direction that the water takes is much more determined by the direction that the bowl's rim jets are pointed, and it can be made to <b>flush</b> <b>in</b> either direction in either hemisphere by simply redirecting the rim jets during manufacture. On the scale of bathtubs and toilets, the Coriolis effect is too weak to be observed except under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.|$|E

25|$|The 1925 {{design was}} by Milwaukee Road Chief Mechanical Engineer C. H. Bilty, with detail design by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, who {{actually}} built them. They represented {{the best of}} American locomotive practice at the time, and were given all the latest devices and fittings. A Coffin feedwater heater was fitted, which was the Milwaukee's favorite type; this was installed <b>flush</b> <b>in</b> the extended smokebox, and thus {{was not at all}} obvious. Possibly because of this, the boiler lagging was continued over the smokebox, which was not common; most North American locomotives had bare smokeboxes which were graphited, rather than painted. The associated steam-driven centrifugal water pump was located under the cab at the left rear. The class F6-a was fitted with the tender-mounted Wilson Water Conditioner instead of the Coffin feedwater heater.|$|E
25|$|Green tea is {{processed}} and grown {{in a variety}} of ways, {{depending on the type of}} green tea desired. As a result of these methods, maximum amounts of polyphenols and volatile organic compounds are retained, affecting aroma and taste. The growing conditions can be broken down into two basic types − those grown in the sun and those grown under the shade. The green tea plants are grown in rows that are pruned to produce shoots in a regular manner, and in general are harvested three times per year. The first flush takes place in late April to early May. The second harvest usually takes place from June through July, and the third picking takes place in late July to early August. Sometimes, there will also be a fourth harvest. It is the first <b>flush</b> <b>in</b> the spring that brings the best-quality leaves, with higher prices to match.|$|E
25|$|The hull was a two-step design {{using the}} Linton Hope {{construction}} method. This used {{a system of}} circular formers separated by stringers {{and covered with a}} double layer of 0.125in (3.2mm) mahogany strips, the second at right angles to the first. This allowed the construction of smooth curved surfaces. The Pellet was a single-bay biplane without stagger and was often described as a sesquiplane because the lower wing was not only of smaller span but also of smaller chord. The lower wing was mounted {{on the top of the}} fuselage and carried wingtip floats mounted directly below the N-type interplane struts. There was another pair of these struts between the fuselage and upper wing supporting the engine, which was mounted tractorwise above the upper wing surface in a streamlined nacelle. The engine, a 450hp (340kW) Napier Lion was cooled with radiators fitted <b>flush</b> <b>in</b> the lower surface of the upper wing. The pilot sat in front of the propeller. At the rear of the aircraft, the braced tailplane was mounted about halfway up the single fin.|$|E

Leaves are similar, but the lobes at the leaf apex are regular and crenate (rounded) in A.cuneatus, but irregular and dentate (toothed) in A.stictus. Also, new growth {{does not have a}} red <b>flush</b> <b>in</b> A.stictus, and juvenile leaves of A.stictus are usually much larger than adult leaves, a difference not seen in A.cuneatus. The flowers of the two species are very similar, differing only subtly in dimension, colour and indumentum.|$|E

2500|$|The museum inaugurated {{an outdoor}} {{sculpture}} garden in 1993. The first piece {{to be placed}} in the garden was Robert Harrison's 1993 [...] "Gibson Gateway". The piece was submitted as part of a statewide competition held by PGSMA, which Harrison won. The brick and masonry work depicts an archway (painted blue) framed by a series of freestand brick walls. The second piece in the sculpture garden was Richard Swanson's [...] "Prairie Tops", added in 2001. The fluted, dreidel-like piece of aluminum (painted yellow) stands near the southeast corner of the building. In 2002, PGSMA commissioned a new work, titled [...] "Two Sisters", from Great Falls High School art teacher Lisa Easton. Funding for the piece came from PGSMA and the Meadowlark Foundation. The sculpture incorporates [...] of shonkinite (both as gravel and as carved stones of various size on top of the gravel) held by a steel basin <b>flush</b> <b>in</b> the ground. A curving fan of steel pushes through the gravel. Two more pieces were added in 2012. [...] The first is Theodore Waddell's untitled, undated piece which stands near the building's west entrance. The rectangular piece has an undulating upper surface, and is made of weathering steel (which gives it a brown patina). The other piece was local artist Mike Hollern's untitled, undated piece near the north entrance. This metal work is reminiscent of an upright chipped flint arrowhead with a fish's tail.|$|E
