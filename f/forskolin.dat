25|$|Cells produce GHB by {{reduction}} of succinic semialdehyde via succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSR). This enzyme appears to be induced by cAMP levels, meaning substances that elevate cAMP, such as <b>forskolin</b> and vinpocetine, may increase GHB synthesis and release. Conversely, endogeneous GHB production in those taking valproic acid will be inhibited via inhibition of the conversion from succinic acid semialdehyde to GHB. It is important to note, however, that direct administration of GHB or endogenous GHB already present in the body will not be affected by valproic acid. People with the disorder known as succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as γ-hydroxybutyric aciduria, have elevated levels of GHB in their urine, blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E

50|$|Rat {{pancreatic}} beta cells release neurotransmitters through kiss-and-run fusion. In endocrine and neuroendocrine cells, synaptic-like vesicles (SLVs) undergo kiss-and-run, but it's been controversial whether large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) also undergo kiss-and-run. Studies {{have shown}} that LDCVs do undergo kiss-and-run exocytosis. MacDonald et al. used multiple approaches to test for kiss-and-run exocytosis in rat beta cells. By monitoring membrane patches of intact rat beta cells {{in the presence of}} 10 mM glucose and 5 mM <b>forskolin,</b> MacDonald et al. found that some vesicles underwent kiss-and-run, as seen by an exocytotic event followed by an endocytotic event of a similar magnitude. Kiss-and-run events accounted for 25% of LDCV exocytosis and 28% of SLV exocytosis. Interestingly, while LDCV kiss-and-run occurred 25% of the time in the presence of <b>forskolin,</b> in the absence of <b>forskolin,</b> LDCV kiss-and-run fusion occurred only 7% of the time. Because <b>forskolin</b> raises cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, cAMP seemingly plays a very important role in the mechanism in LDCV kiss-and-run fusion in rat pancreatic beta cells.|$|E

50|$|Intestinal organoids {{grown from}} rectal biopsies using culture {{protocols}} {{established by the}} Clevers group {{have been used to}} model cystic fibrosis, and led to the first application of organoids for personalised treatment. Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that is caused by gene mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene that encodes an epithelial ion channel necessary for healthy epithelial surface fluids. Studies by the laboratory of Jeffrey Beekman (Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands) described in 2013 that stimulation of colorectal organoids with cAMP-raising agonists such as <b>forskolin</b> or cholera toxin induced rapid swelling of organoids in a fully CFTR dependent manner. Whereas organoids from non-cystic fibrosis subjects swell in response to <b>forskolin</b> as a consequence of fluid transport into the organoids' lumens, this is severely reduced or absent in organoids derived from people with cystic fibrosis. Swelling could be restored by therapeutics that repair the CFTR protein (CFTR modulators), indicating that individual responses to CFTR modulating therapy could be quantitated in a preclinical laboratory setting. Schwank et al. also demonstrated that the intestinal cystic fibrosis organoid phenotype could be repaired by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in 2013.|$|E

5000|$|GalP is a {{monosaccharide}} transporter {{that uses}} a chemiosmotic mechanism to transport its substrates into the cytoplasm of E. coli (1). Glucose, galactose and other hexoses are transported by GalP {{by the use of}} the proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain and reversible ATPase (1). GalP can bind specifically to the hexoses with preferential binding of galactose and glucose through the pores in each monomer (2,3). It transports these sugars at faster rates with a proton gradient but can still transport them in a leaky fashion without a proton gradient present (4). As stated before GalP shares similarities with GLUT1 {{and other members of the}} MFS and like GLUT1, GalP can be inhibited by the antibiotics cytochalasin B and <b>forskolin</b> (Figure 1a) (3), which competitively bind to the pore blocking sugar transport into the cell (2,3,4). <b>Forskolin</b> is a structural homologue of D-galactose (Figure 1a) (3) and therefore can bind with a similar affinity to the transporter. Cytochalasin B may bind to an asparagine residue (Asn394) in the pore, blocking saccharide uptake, which is also found in the GLUT1 transporter (2,3). GalP can transport lactose or fructose but with low affinity, only allowing these sugars to [...] "leak" [...] across the membrane when glucose, galactose, or other hexoses aren't present for transport (4).|$|E
50|$|<b>Forskolin</b> is {{commonly}} used as a tool in biochemistry to raise levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) {{in the study and}} research of cell physiology.Forskolin activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and increases intracellular levels of cAMP. cAMP is an important second messenger necessary for the proper biological response of cells to hormones and other extracellular signals. It is required for cell communication in the hypothalamus/pituitary gland axis and for the feedback control of hormones via induction of corticotropin-releasing factor gene transcription. Cyclic AMP acts by activating cAMP-sensitive pathways such as protein kinase A and Epac.|$|E
50|$|Generally, GLUT-1 {{acts as a}} facilitative {{transporter}} of glucose, transporter glucose {{along its}} concentration gradient. When glucose binds to GLUT-1, it stimulates a conformational change, allowing glucose to be released {{on the opposite side}} of the membrane (4,12). GLUT-1 is a bidirectional transporter and possesses glucose binding sites accessible on both the cytoplasmic and extracellular faces (4,12). On the rare occasion that GLUT-1 transports glucose against its concentration gradient, Glut-1 uses an energy source, typically ATP, to move the glucose. Like GalP, GLUT-1 is inhibited via the binding of cytochalasin B and <b>forskolin</b> (12).|$|E
50|$|Regulation of AANAT varies between species. In some, AANAT levels {{oscillate}} dramatically between {{light and}} dark periods, and thus control melatonin synthesis. In others, rhythm is regulated primarily on the protein level. One example is in rodents, where AANAT mRNA levels increase more than 100-fold in dark periods. In other species, cyclic AMP plays {{an important part in}} inhibition of proteolytic degradation of AANAT, elevating protein levels at night. Experiments using human AANAT expressed in a 1E7 cell line show an ∼8-fold increase in enzyme activity upon exposure to <b>forskolin.</b>|$|E

50|$|GPR126 is {{necessary}} for Schwann cell myelination. Knockouts of this adhesion GPCR in both Danio rerio and Mus musculus result in an arrest at the promyelinating stage. Schwann cells arise from the neural crest, which migrates to peripheral nerves to form either myelinating or non-myelinating cells. In GPR126 knockouts, these precursor cells develop to the promyelinating stage, where they have wrapped approximately 1.5 times. Myelination is arrested at the promyelinating stage and in fish no myelin basic protein can be detected. In fish this can be rescued by adding <b>forskolin</b> during development, which rescues myelin basic protein expression.|$|E

LY-404,039 is highly selective for group II metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR2 and mGluR3. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. LY-404,039 has been shown to act as a potent full agonist at group II mGluRs as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP, formation as a result of stimulation by <b>forskolin.</b> LY-404,039 has been shown to modulate glutamatergic activity in the limbic and forebrain areas, where group II mGlu receptors are most densely localized.|$|E

50|$|Numerous stimuli {{are able}} to alter melanogenesis, or the {{production}} of melanin by cultured melanocytes, although the method by which it works is not fully understood. Certain melanocortins have been shown in laboratory testing to have effect on appetite and sexual activity in mice. Vitamin D metabolites, retinoids, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, <b>forskolin,</b> cholera toxin, isobutylmethylxanthine, diacylglycerol analogues, and UV irradiation all trigger melanogenesis and, in turn, pigmentation. Increased melanin production is seen in conditions where Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) is elevated, such as Cushing's disease. This is mainly a consequence of alpha-MSH being secreted along with the hormone associated with reproductive tendencies in primates. Alpha-MSH is a cleavage product of ACTH that has an equal affinity for the MC1 receptor on melanocytes as ACTH.|$|E
5000|$|The Arc {{transcript}} {{is dependent}} upon activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase or MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade, a pathway important for regulation of cell growth and survival. [...] Extracellular signaling to neuronal dendrites activates postsynaptic sites to increase Arc levels through {{a wide variety of}} signaling molecules, including mitogens such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glutamate acting at NMDA receptors, dopamine through activation of the D1 receptor subtype, and dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). [...] The common factor for these signaling molecules involves activation of cyclic-AMP and its downstream target protein kinase A (PKA). As such, direct pharmacological activation of cAMP by <b>forskolin</b> or 8-Br-cAMP robustly increases Arc levels while H89, a PKA antagonist, blocks these effects as does further downstream blockade of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase sic (MEK).

5000|$|... miR-132 {{arises from}} the miR-212/132 cluster located in the intron of a non-coding gene on mouse {{chromosome}} 11. The transcription of this cluster {{was found to be}} enhanced by the transcription factor CREB (cAMP-response element binding protein). In neuronal cells BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) is known to induce the transcription of this cluster; the pathway is thought to involve the BDNF-mediated activation of ERK1/2, which in turn activates MSK, another kinase enzyme. MSK-mediated phosphorylation of a serine residue on CREB may then enhance production of miR-132. MSK knockout mice still produce miR-132 in response to BDNF, but at a significantly lower level, indicating that there may be an alternative pathway operating. [...] Activators of CREB phosphorylation, for instance <b>forskolin</b> and KSHV binding to endothelial cell targets, can also enhance miR-132 production in vitro. miR-132 levels are increased post-seizure, which strongly suggests a causal relationship between neuronal activation and miR-132 transcription. One example of this phenomenon is in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where miR-132 is thought be involved in resetting the circadian clock in response to light. [...] Inflammatory mediators such as Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are also implicated in inducing miR-132 expression.|$|E
5000|$|Seldin, Peterson, Byerly, Wei and Wong {{clarify that}} most myokines are also {{secreted}} by non-muscle cells.

Prior to (our) study, no myokine has been discovered to be preferentially expressed by skeletal muscle. While characterizing the metabolic function of the C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) family of proteins we recently uncovered, we identified myonectin (CTRP15) as a novel member of the family on the basis of sequence homology in the shared C1q domain, the signature that defines this protein family....

Circulating levels of myonectin were tightly regulated by the metabolic state; fasting suppressed, but refeeding dramatically increased, its mRNA and serum levels. Although mRNA and circulating levels of myonectin were reduced in a diet-induced obese state, voluntary exercise increased its expression and circulating levels. Accordingly, myonectin transcript was up-regulated by compounds (<b>forskolin,</b> epinephrine, ionomycin) that raise cellular cAMP or calcium levels.... In vitro results of myonectin expression in myotubes suggest that exercise-induced rises in intracellular calcium levels may also up-regulate myonectin expression in intact skeletal muscle....

40|$|The {{homologous}} and heterologous desensitization of rat Leydig-tumour-cell {{adenylate cyclase}} induced by lutropin (LH) was characterized {{with the aid}} of <b>forskolin</b> and cholera toxin. <b>Forskolin</b> stimulated cyclic AMP production in a dose-dependent manner, with linear kinetics up to 2 h. <b>Forskolin</b> also potentiated the action of LH on cyclic AMP production, but was only additive with cholera toxin. Preincubation of rat Leydig tumour cells with LH (1. 0 micrograms/ml) for 1 h produced a desensitization of the subsequent LH (1. 0 micrograms/ml) -stimulated cyclic AMP production, whereas the responses to cholera toxin (5. 0 micrograms/ml), <b>forskolin</b> (100 microM), LH plus <b>forskolin</b> or cholera toxin plus <b>forskolin</b> were unaltered. In contrast, preincubation with LH for 20 h produced a desensitization to all the stimuli tested. When rat Leydig tumour cells were preincubated for 1 h with <b>forskolin</b> or dibutyryl cyclic AMP, the only subsequent response that was significantly altered was that to LH plus <b>forskolin</b> after preincubation with <b>forskolin.</b> However, preincubation for 20 h with <b>forskolin</b> or dibutyryl cyclic AMP induced a desensitization to all stimuli subsequently tested.

The rate of desensitization induced by either <b>forskolin</b> or dibutyryl cyclic AMP was similar to the rate of heterologous desensitization induced by LH.
