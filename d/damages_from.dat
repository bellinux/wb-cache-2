Associated tornadoes in Mississippi damaged mobile homes and vehicles, and inflicted one injury. While Hermine {{was not of}} itself a particularly damaging storm, its effects combined {{with those of other}} tropical cyclones, and resulted in agricultural damage.|$|E

5|$|Bradley was {{unanimously}} {{chosen as}} a delegate-at-large to six consecutive Republican National Conventions. At the 1880 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he was unanimously chosen to second Roscoe Conkling's nomination of Ulysses S. Grant {{for a third}} term as president.

Brewster regarding the prosecution of these cases.|$|E
5|$|Drysdale also {{oversaw the}} first civil {{litigation}} trial, {{in which the}} owners of the two ships sought <b>damages</b> <b>from</b> each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{jury found}} for Heffernan and awarded him <b>damages</b> <b>from</b> the police {{officials}} and the city. Despite the verdict, Heffernan sought a retrial because Judge Peter G.

While considering these motions, Judge Sheridan became aware of a conflict of interest through a former law firm and set aside the verdict, setting a new date for trial before Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh.|$|E

5|$|Boeing {{issued a}} {{petition}} for bankruptcy 22 June 1971, which {{was carried out}} by Oslo District Court the following day. The two remaining Boeing aircraft were re-registered with Aer Lingus on 10 June. By late August the debt in the company had been assessed to NOK30 million, making it the largest bankruptcy till then in Norwegian history. The largest creditor was Boeing, which was owed NOK7 million. The creditors and shareholders lost all of their investments in the company because the airline's limited assets were used to pay outstanding wages.
