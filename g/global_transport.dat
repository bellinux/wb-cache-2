25|$|Another pathway of {{pollution}} occurs through the atmosphere. Wind-blown dust and debris, including plastic bags, are blown seaward from landfills and other areas. Dust from the Sahara {{moving around the}} southern periphery of the subtropical ridge moves into the Caribbean and Florida during the warm season as the ridge builds and moves northward through the subtropical Atlantic. Dust can also {{be attributed to a}} <b>global</b> <b>transport</b> from the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts across Korea, Japan, and the Northern Pacific to the Hawaiian Islands. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year; however, the flux is greater during positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The USGS links dust events to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|In {{many parts}} of the {{industrial}} world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity, after climate change, has become the destructive effect of invasive species. [...] Increasingly efficient <b>global</b> <b>transport</b> has facilitated the spread of organisms across the planet. The potential danger of this aspect of globalization is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like HIV AIDS, mad cow disease, bird flu and swine flu, but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native biodiversity. Non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where, in the absence of their natural predators, they are able to thrive. At the global scale this issue is being addressed through the Global Invasive Species Information Network but there is improved international biosecurity legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms. Also, through CITES legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species. Increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities, gardeners, the nursery industry, collectors, and the pet and aquarium industries, to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species.|$|E

40|$|Projectors are {{increasingly}} being used as light-sources in computer vision applications. In several applications, they are modeled as point light sources, thus ignoring the effects of illumination defocus. In addition, most active vision techniques assume that a scene point is illuminated only directly by the light source, thus ignoring <b>global</b> light <b>transport</b> effects. Since both defocus and global illumination co-occur in virtually all scenes illuminated by projectors, ignoring them can result in strong, systematic biases in the recovered scene properties. To make computer vision techniques work for general real world scenes, it is thus important to account for both these effects. In this paper, we study the interplay between defocused illumination and <b>global</b> light <b>transport.</b> We show that both these seemingly disparate effects can be expressed as low pass filters on the incident illumination. Using this observation, we derive an invariant between the two effects, {{which can be used}} to separate the two. This is directly useful in scenarios where limited depth-of-field devices (such as projectors) are used to illuminate scenes with <b>global</b> light <b>transport</b> and significant depth variations. We show applications in two scenarios: (a) accurate depth recovery in the presence of <b>global</b> light <b>transport,</b> and (b) factoring out the effects of illumination defocus for correct direct-global component separation. We demonstrate our approach using scenes with complex shapes, reflectance properties, textures and translucencies...|$|R

The present study {{was designed as a}} prospective, randomized, double-blinded, clinical pilot study to determine whether different doses of glibenclamide have any effects on norepinephrine requirements, cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, and <b>global</b> oxygen <b>transport</b> in patients with septic shock. We enrolled 30 patients with septic shock requiring invasive hemodynamic monitoring and norepinephrine infusion of 0. 5 mu g center dot kg(- 1 center dot) min(- 1) or greater to maintain MAP between 65 and 75 mmHg. In addition to standard therapy, patients were randomized to receive either 10, 20, or 30 mg of enteral glibenclamide. Systemic hemodynamics, <b>global</b> oxygen <b>transport</b> including arterial lactate concentrations, gas exchange, plasma glucose concentrations, and electrolytes were determined at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 h after administration of the study drug. Glibenclamide decreased plasma glucose concentrations in a dose-dependent manner but failed to reduce norepinephrine requirements. None of the doses had any effects on cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, <b>global</b> oxygen <b>transport,</b> gas exchange, or electrolytes. These data suggest that oral glibenclamide in doses from 10 to 30 mg fails to counteract arterial hypotension and thus to reduce norepinephrine requirements in catecholamine-dependent human septic shock...|$|R

40|$|The New World Economy {{presents}} business {{organizations with}} some special challenges {{that they have}} never met before, when they manage their activities in the global supply chain network. Business managers find that traditional managerial approaches, techniques and principles are no longer effective in dealing with these challenges. This dissertation is a study of how to solve new problems emerging in the global supply chain network. Three main issues identified in the global supply chain network are: production loading problems for global manufacturing, logistics problems for <b>global</b> road <b>transport</b> and container loading problems for <b>global</b> air <b>transport.</b> These problems involve {{a higher level of}} uncertainty and risk. Three types of dual-response strategies have been developed to hedge the uncertainty and short lead time in the above three problems. These strategies are: a dual-response production loading strategy for global manufacturing, a dual-response logistics strategy for <b>global</b> road <b>transport</b> and a dual-response container loading strategy for <b>global</b> air <b>transport.</b> In order to implement these strategies, the two-stage stochastic recourse programming models have been formulated. The computational results show that the two-stage stochastic recourse models have an advantage in comparison to the corresponding deterministic models for the three issues. However, the two-stage stochastic recourse models lack the ability of handling risk, which is particularly important in today's highly-competitive environment. We thus develop a robust optimization framework for dealing with uncertainty and risk. The robust optimization framework consists of a robust optimization model with solution robustness, a robust optimisation model with model robustness and a robust optimization model with trade-off between solution robustness and model robustness. Each type of the robust optimization models represents a different measure of performance in terms of risk and cost. A series of experiments demonstrate that the robust optimization models can create a global supply chain planning system with more flexibility, reliability, agility, responsiveness and lower risk...|$|R

These new approaches allow a new view of global dust distribution from dense dust layers near the strong source regions to the optically thin, but significant dust layers {{from the point of}} view of aerosol–cloud interactions, over the weak source regions, the transport areas, and the upper troposphere. The results will not only help us to better understand <b>global</b> dust <b>transport</b> and dust-cloud interactions, but also provide critical information for model evaluations and improvements...|$|R
