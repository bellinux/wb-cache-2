60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to Branksome much {{disturbed}} by this interview, and extremely puzzled {{as to what}} course I should pursue.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} how, {{after our}} third bout of talking, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> {{through the streets}} of Utopian London to rejoin the botanist at our hotel.|$|E
60|$|The curate {{stayed to}} tea with us, and {{afterwards}} <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> {{through the woods}} with him, for he was a sociable fellow, fond of company--even mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, Jack. Suppose you and <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> {{and see if}} we {{can locate}} the fellows," [...] {{suggested}} Fred. [...] "They don't know us, so they won't be suspicious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> with you?" [...] he asked. And {{when she}} had said that he might if he wanted, he {{observed}} {{that he had seen}} her and recognized her half a mile away.|$|R
6000|$|Persons of excitable {{temperament}} have a {{sense of}} ridicule, and a dread of it, unintelligible to their fellow-creatures who are made of coarser material. For the moment, Iris was angry. [...] "Why didn't you tell me of it," [...] she asked sharply, [...] "before I sent away the carriage? How can <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>back,</b> with everybody laughing at me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Feeling {{that this}} woman had the better of it, with her calm, polished, highbred sarcasms, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the 'pike, full of hopes of a sweet revenge.|$|E
60|$|I {{became aware}} of some one moving about in the passage, and went {{and shut the door}} of the room, then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the {{hearthrug}} and turned.|$|E
60|$|The {{fellow was}} overdoing it a little, I thought; then, when I {{had seen him}} safely locked up for the night, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the kitchen slowly and very thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|In {{another moment}} <b>I</b> had <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the raft {{and lifted her}} as tenderly and reverently {{as if she had}} been my sister--indeed more so--in my arms.|$|R
60|$|Jerry was {{satisfied}} {{to act as}} sentinel, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> leisurely <b>back</b> to the shore, believing that much time must elapse before we would get the desired opportunity.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{must have}} done so in this case, for <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> nearly <b>back</b> to Blacktown, and should have found the package if it had fallen from my pocket." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to my house. It {{was very}} silent, and as I passed {{up the stairs}} the {{servants}} shrunk back with averted faces, {{as if they were}} afraid to look at me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to {{the parade}} trying to reason my next step out, and muttering to myself, {{because there was}} {{something}} in that luminous wonderfulness that touched one's brain, and made one feel a little light-headed.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to {{our hotel}} with my nephew I passed my {{hand into his}} arm and put to him, by no {{roundabout}} approach, {{the question of whether}} he were in serious peril of love.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm going home--I shan't {{stay here}} to-day," [...] Biddy went on. Then to Peter: [...] "I {{came in a}} hansom, but <b>I</b> shall <b>walk</b> <b>back.</b> Come that way with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{doubt whether}} Sir Thomas or Lady Tringle {{would be at}} all {{inclined}} to make me welcome. As to the distance, <b>I</b> can <b>walk</b> that easily enough, and if the door is slammed in my face <b>I</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harry (Comes forward, {{slamming}} gate behind him). Just {{like old}} times. Nearly licked {{the life out}} of me for wanting to go away, and now I come back he shies a confounded old shovel at my head. (Fumes. Laughs a little). I wouldn't care, only poor little Ginger--Ginger's my chum up in London--he will starve while <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> all the way from here. (Faces Bessie blankly.) I spent my last twopence on a shave. ... Out of respect for the old man.|$|R
60|$|We {{found the}} boat {{hard and fast}} in the mud. Sam rowed me ashore. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to camp, and he stayed all night, and all the next day, waiting for the tide to float the boat.|$|E
6000|$|So Lady Delahaye {{drove away}} down the white dusty road, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the study from whence her coming had brought me. As I sat down to my {{interrupted}} work I smiled. How little she understood! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He either {{went down}} the stairs or else {{into one of the}} back rooms. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> after a minute or two, but I didn't see {{anything}} more of him, although I heard a door close and heard a key turn in a lock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} do it," [...] Bell replied. [...] "If I were taken over to Guestwick, I should be so uneasy that <b>I</b> should <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> to Allington the first moment that I could escape from the house." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had already}} gained the door; but, reader, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> back--walked <b>back</b> as determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I {{turned his face}} from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I {{smoothed}} his hair with my hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's true {{enough for}} some of them; but {{what would you have}} me do? <b>I</b> couldn't <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> to Mohill by his horse's side;--and I tell you if they attack him at all, it will not be at the house there, but on his way home." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} of that beatific day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to Edinburgh by some aÃ«rial and rose-clouded path not {{indicated}} on the maps. It led somehow to my lodgings, and my feet touched earth when the door was opened to me by Bethiah McRankine.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to Madame Bouvet's I {{made up my}} {{mind that}} there was but the one thing to do, to go at once to Monsieur de Saint-Gre's plantation. Finding Madame still waiting in the gallery, I asked her to direct me thither.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I met him on {{the road}} with Lady Hester Perrault, and I told them. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to Spinney Lawn with them. But," [...] as I began to thank her, and her voice went lower still, [...] "but--oh, Ursula, Lady Hester knew it!" ...|$|E
60|$|My curiosity was aroused to {{its highest}} pitch, {{and at the}} risk of being {{discovered}} by any one who might chance to be passing by <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> cautiously <b>back</b> along the hedge until I reached a clump of rose bushes that grew directly under one of the dining-room windows.|$|R
60|$|Thanking him, I groped my way {{downstairs and}} let myself {{out by a}} side door Monahan had shown me into an alleyway, thus {{avoiding}} the saloon. As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>back</b> to the office, seeking {{the shade of the}} awnings, the figure in the darkened room took on a sinister aspect that troubled me....|$|R
6000|$|Violet {{explained}} how short the distance was; but Lady Martindale {{seemed not to}} know how to let her go, nor how to relinquish the thought of seeing her grand-daughter. At last she said, {{as if it was a}} great resolution, lowering her voice, 'I wonder if <b>I</b> could <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> with you, just to see her.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the hotel, {{wondering}} how I could {{learn something about}} the Contessa Salvi-Scarabelli. In the doorway I found the innkeeper, and near him stood a young man whom I immediately perceived to be a compatriot, and with whom, apparently, {{he had been in}} conversation.|$|E
60|$|Such {{were the}} {{thoughts}} that passed {{through my mind}} as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> from the Vale of Bones {{by the side of}} the big-paunched Goza, whom I caught eyeing me from time to time as a curious crow eyes any object that has attracted his attention.|$|E
60|$|This story I {{would not}} have told, but that my whole life turned upon these accursed boots. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to school as proud as a peacock, and easily succeeded in {{satisfying}} the boys as to {{the manner in which}} I came by my new ornaments.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have only}} just {{time for the}} train," [...] he remarked. [...] "The car shall take you there. <b>I</b> prefer to <b>walk</b> <b>back,</b> and <b>I</b> have {{something}} further to say to Mr. Ducaine." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{said this}} {{as much to}} myself as to my companion, for <b>I</b> had <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> a little to look up the path. I could not see far, for it was growing dark. I was terribly worried about Rectus, and {{would have gone to}} look for him, but I was afraid that if I left Mr. Chipperton he would go off with the boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} not made up your mind to take my advice by the time <b>I</b> have <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to that door," [...] she said, [...] "I will {{put it out of}} your power to set me at defiance. I am used to be obeyed, and I will be obeyed. You force me to use hard words. I warn you before it is too late. Go!" ...|$|R
