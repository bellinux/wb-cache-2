In 1928 Hoskins, later Australian Iron & Steel, started a steelworks at Port Kembla, a few kilometres south of Wollongong. The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company (now BHP Billiton after merging with Billiton plc) acquired AI in 1935, but has since spun-out their steel division as a separate company, now known as BlueScope Steel. The steelworks has grown to become a world-class <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> steel producer, operating as a fully integrated steel plant with a production of around 5 million tonnes per year. Other industries to have {{set up in the}} massive Port Kembla industrial complex—the largest single concentration of heavy industry in Australia—include a fertiliser plant, an electrolytic copper smelter, a locomotive workshop, a coal export shipping terminal, a grain export shipping terminal and an industrial gases manufacturing plant.|$|E

40|$|Rolling load for a 17 pass, 125 x 125 mm carbon {{manganese}} steel billet hot {{rolled to a}} 16 mm diameter rod was simulated. Load calculations were obtained using the temperature values for rod rolling obtained by the “Phantom Roll” method. Investigations were carried out for four different starting mean rolling temperatures between 900 - 1200 oC, and four different rolling strain rates of 0. 8, 0. 4, 1. 2, and 1. 6 s- 1. Results obtained showed that for all cases, rolling in grooved rolls required more power (higher load) compared to rolling in <b>flat</b> <b>rolls.</b> Loads were higher for lower rolling temperatures for both <b>flat</b> <b>rolls</b> or grooved rolls. An increase in rolling speed also corresponded {{to an increase in}} load for both grooved and <b>flat</b> <b>rolls.</b> Straight-line equations fitted load against log 10 Z (where Z is Zener-Hollomon’s Parameter) at temperatures of 988 oC, 1094 oC, and 1095 oC while two straight lines fitted the highest temperature of 1191 oC in checking the combined effect of temperature and strain rate on load. This abnormal behavior is probably due to strain localization in two distinct zones caused by re-crystallization and incomplete recovery during working at the highest temperature of 1191 oC.

The material is then straight if properly processed. Several different types of these machines are available, ranging from position controlled to pressure controlled machines. Also, machines are available with automatic self checking features. If the material has residual stress as in toothed bandsaw blades, the rolls must not uniformly apply cross strain, as the inherent strain will distort the strip. In these cases, rolls exert corrective strain in a linear narrow strip inboard of the edge each side. In the case of sawblades with teeth on, the corrective squeezed strip on the toothed edge is located along the tooth gullet, and corrective squeeze on the toothed side must be about 2.5 times the corrective force on the plain edge.|$|E
