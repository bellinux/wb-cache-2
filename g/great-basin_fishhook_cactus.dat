50|$|Echinomastus johnsonii (syn.

It {{produces}} an egg-shaped or cylindrical stem up to 25 cm tall by 10 cm wide. It is covered densely in straight and curving spines which may be up to 4 cm long and come in shades of yellow, gray, lavender, and pink or red, with up to 24 per areole. The cactus may have yellow or pink flowers; the species is sometimes divided into two varieties on the basis of flower color. Flowers are up to 8 cm wide. The scaly, fleshy fruit is up to 1.8 cm long.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant was}} {{discovered}} in 1966 near Last Chance Creek south of the Fremont Junction in Utah. Today there are 15 known occurrences in Sevier, Wayne, and Emery Counties {{for a total of}} about 6000 plants. Some occurrences are in the San Rafael Swell and there is one in Capitol Reef National Park. The plants occur in sparsely vegetated openings in pinyon-juniper woodland habitat. They are generally restricted to pockets of shale lens soils surrounded by less hospitable soil types. The shale soil is derived from the Mancos Formation and is silty and alkaline. Other plants in the habitat include blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), black sagebrush (Artemisia nova), shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), and snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae). Other rare plants in the area include Despain's pincushion cactus (Pediocactus despainii), Wright's <b>fishhook</b> <b>cactus</b> (Sclerocactus wrightiae), and Barneby reed-mustard (Schoenocrambe barnebyi).|$|R

5000|$|In adulthood, <b>fishhook</b> barrel <b>cacti</b> {{generally}} lean southward, {{toward the}} sun, earning them the nickname [...] "compass barrel cactus." [...] One theory about why this happens is, {{the afternoon sun}} is so intense it slows the growth on the exposed side, causing the plant to grow unevenly. Older barrels can lean so far they uproot themselves and fall over, especially after heavy rains when the soil is loose. Its life cycle is 50-100 years.|$|R
