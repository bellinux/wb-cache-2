5|$|Critical {{reception}} towards Living Proof was mixed. Some music critics {{noted that}} it was <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Believe, while others criticized the excessive use of Auto-Tune. Commercially, the album did not reach the same success as its predecessor, debuting at number nine on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 82,000 copies. It was also received moderately in Europe, peaking within the top 30 in Sweden and the top 50 in the United Kingdom, despite being certified gold by both Swedish Recording Industry Association (GLF) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Living Proof is estimated to have sold {{more than a million}} copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Apu is {{angered by}} her mother's success in math, as she herself {{continues}} {{to fail to}} understand it. Chanda challenges Apu to achieve grades higher than hers in math; if she is successful, Chanda promises {{to drop out of}} school. With Amar's help and constant studying, Apu manages to complete the challenge. Her mother is overjoyed, but is heartbroken when Apu informs her that she performed well in school with the sole purpose of ensuring her mother's absence at school. In her anger, Chanda breaks her promise and returns to school, performing <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar recommends the job.|$|E
5|$|Much of Sibelius's reputation, {{during his}} {{lifetime}} and subsequently, derived from {{his work as a}} symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time {{there was no reason to}} suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> his Seventh.|$|E

5|$|Toy Story's first sequel Toy Story 2 was {{released}} in theatres November 24, 1999 and saw {{the return of the}} majority of the voice cast from Toy Story, and the film focuses on Buzz leading Andy's toys on a mission to rescue Woody after he is stolen by a greedy toy collector voiced by Wayne Knight. The film was equally well received by critics, many of whom thought it was <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the first installment, earning a rare 100% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 163 reviews. At Metacritic, the film earned a favorable rating of 88/100 based on 34 reviews. The film's widest release was 3,257 theaters and it grossed $485,015,179 worldwide, becoming the second-most successful animated film after The Lion King at the time of its release.|$|E
5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E

25|$|Wen Renmin (聞人敏), a {{man from}} the same {{hometown}} as Lu Mao, once visited the Wu capital. He received a grand reception that was <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> that normally received by nobles. Lu Mao thought that this was inappropriate according to Confucian rules of propriety because he believed the level of the reception should be based on the person's social status. He was proven right later. He died in 239.|$|E
25|$|The only {{currency}} {{strong enough}} to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions was the U.S. dollar. The strength of the U.S. economy, the fixed relationship of the dollar to gold ($35 an ounce), and {{the commitment of the}} U.S. government to convert dollars into gold at that price made the dollar as good as gold. In fact, the dollar was <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> gold: it earned interest and it was more flexible than gold.|$|E

25|$|On August 18, 1945, {{when the}} war ended, Lt. Williams was sent to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While in Pearl Harbor, Williams played {{baseball}} in the Army League. Also in that eight-team league were Joe DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, and Stan Musial. The Service World Series with the Army versus the Navy attracted crowds of 40,000 for each game. The players said it was <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the actual World Series being played between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs that year.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI): A diagnostic test that produces three-dimensional images of body structures using powerful magnets and computer technology. It {{can show the}} spinal cord, nerve roots, and surrounding areas, as well as enlargement, degeneration, and tumors. It shows soft tissues <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> CAT scans. An MRI performed with a high magnetic field strength usually provides the most conclusive evidence for diagnosis of a disc herniation. T2-weighted images allow for clear visualization of protruded disc material in the spinal canal.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers won the AFC Central with a 12–4 {{regular season}} record (including 8–0 at home), and {{advanced}} to their second consecutive Super Bowl and their fourth {{appearance in the}} last six seasons. Pittsburgh appeared to be <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> what they were in their three previous Super Bowl victories. leading the league with 6,258 yards in total offense, an average of 391 yards per game and just 31 yards short of an NFL record. The team also led the league in scoring with 412 points.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Robinson {{visited with}} fifth graders at Gates Elementary School in San Antonio and {{challenged}} them to finish school {{and go to}} college. He offered a $2,000 scholarship to everyone who did. In 1998, proving <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> his word, Robinson awarded $8,000 to each of those students who had completed his challenge. In perhaps his greatest civic and charitable achievement, David and his wife, Valerie, founded the Carver Academy in San Antonio, which opened its doors in September 2001. To date, the Robinsons have donated more than $11 million to the school.|$|E
25|$|The Redskins {{entered the}} game {{appearing}} to be <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the previous season when they defeated the Miami Dolphins 27–17 in Super Bowl XVII. The Redskins finished the regular season with a 14–2 record, {{the best in the}} NFL, and their two losses were only by one point each. In addition, the Redskins set new NFL records with 541 points (since broken by the 1998 Minnesota Vikings, the 2007 and 2012 New England Patriots, 2011 Green Bay Packers, and 2013 Denver Broncos), and also had a turnover margin of +43 and the top-ranked run defense.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{entry into}} the war seemed if {{anything}} to make Soviet-American cooperation at Cold Bay <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> before, and Maxwell and Popov worked to accelerate training and transfers to get ships into Soviet hands {{as quickly as possible}} in support of the Soviet offensive. Previously trained Soviet personnel returned to Cold Bay to serve as nucleus crews for newly transferred ships, and the training of their fellow crewmen was cut to the minimum necessary for the Soviet crews to take their vessels home. On 25 August 1945, Navy Detachment 3294 completed the final cycle of classroom training for Soviet personnel.|$|E

25|$|In Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, a 1998 {{documentary}} {{included on}} some DVD {{editions of the}} first Blues Brothers film, Cropper noted {{that some of his}} peers thought that he and the other musicians backing the Blues Brothers were selling out to Hollywood or using a gimmick to make some quick money. Cropper responded by stating that he thought Belushi was as good as (or <b>even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than)</b> many of the singers he had backed; he also noted that Belushi had, early in his career, briefly been a professional drummer, and had an especially keen sense of rhythm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> LWRs, CANDU can utilize a mix {{of uranium}} and {{plutonium}} oxides (MOX fuel), the plutonium either from dismantled nuclear weapons or reprocessed reactor fuel. The mix of isotopes in reprocessed plutonium is not attractive for weapons, but {{can be used as}} fuel (instead of being simply nuclear waste), while burning weapons-grade plutonium eliminates a proliferation hazard. If the aim is explicitly to burn plutonium or other actinides from spent fuel, then special inert-matrix fuels are proposed to do this more efficiently than MOX. Since they contain no uranium, these fuels do not breed any extra plutonium.|$|E
25|$|The atom or {{molecule}} which loses electrons {{is known}} as the reducing agent, or reductant, and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the oxidizing agent, or oxidant. Thus, the oxidizing agent is always being reduced in a reaction; the reducing agent is always being oxidized. Oxygen is a common oxidizing agent, but not the only one. Despite the name, an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. In fact, a fire can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen; fluorine fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant (it has a higher electronegativity and thus accepts electrons <b>even</b> <b>better)</b> <b>than</b> oxygen.|$|E
50|$|NAEFS {{has been}} the subject of {{meteorological}} research. A few such research studies have compared NAEFS with the THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE), a part of THORPEX, an initiative of the World Meteorological Organization to determine whether combining them can yield <b>even</b> <b>better</b> forecasts <b>than</b> either one individually.|$|R
