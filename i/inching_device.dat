40|$|Microprinting is {{utilized}} in {{many types of}} documents for authentication and anticounterfeiting purposes. Elements of microprinting are usually text and not readable to the human eye {{without the aid of}} magnification. A series of test targets were developed to evaluate the capability of the Kodak NexPress 2100, the HP Indigo 5000 and the Heidelberg Speedmaster 74 printing systems to render micro text. The primary criterion that determines the ability of a printing device to render micro elements are: addressability, spot size, font selection, workflow (e. g. file processing), and resolution. All three devices were capable of reproducing micro text. While the 600 spots per <b>inch</b> <b>device</b> was capable of reproducing acceptable results under specific conditions, the devices with higher addressability performed proportionally better under the same conditions. San-serif fonts found in Adobe Illustrator can be used for microprinting and the programming of custom Postscript fonts is not necessary.

40|$|The goal of {{this program}} was to reduce the long term {{technical}} risks that were keeping the lighting industry from embracing and developing organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology for general illumination. The specific goal was to develop OLEDs for lighting {{to the point where}} it was possible to demonstrate a large area white light panel with brightness and light quality comparable to a fluorescence source and with an efficacy comparable to that of an incandescent source. it was recognized that achieving this would require significant advances in three area: (1) the improvement of white light quality for illumination, (2) the improvement of OLED energy efficiency at high brightness, and (3) the development of cost-effective large area fabrication techniques. The program was organized such that, each year, a ''deliverable'' device would be fabricated which demonstrated progress in one or more of the three critical research areas. In the first year (2001), effort concentrated on developing an OLED capable of generating high illumination-quality white light. Ultimately, a down-conversion method where a blue OLED was coupled with various down-conversion layers was chosen. Various color and scattering models were developed to aid in material development and device optimization. The first year utilized this approach to deliver a 1 inch x 1 inch OLED with higher illumination-quality than available fluorescent sources. A picture of this device is shown and performance metrics are listed. To their knowledge, this was the first demonstration of true illumination-quality light from an OLED. During the second year, effort concentrated on developing a scalable approach to large area devices. A novel device architecture consisting of dividing the device area into smaller elements that are monolithically connected in series was developed. In the course of this development, it was realized that, in addition to being scalable, this approach made the device tolerant to the most common OLED defect [...] electrical shorts. This architecture enabled the fabrication of a 6 inch x 6 inch OLED deliverable for 2002. A picture of this deliverable is shown and the performance metrics are listed. At the time, this was the highest efficiency, highest lumen output illumination-quality OLED in existence. The third year effort concentrated on improving the fabrication yield of the 6 inch x 6 <b>inch</b> <b>devices</b> and improving the underlying blue device efficiency. An efficiency breakthrough was achieved through the invention of a new device structure such that now 15 lumen per watt devices could be fabricated. A 2 feet x 2 feet OLED panel consisting of sixteen 6 inch x 6 <b>inch</b> high efficiency <b>devices</b> tiled together was then fabricated. Pictures of this panel are shown with performance metrics listed. This panel met all project objectives and was the final deliverable for the project.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of applications, from hearing aids to {{microfluidic}} pumps, which utilize micro-scale actuating diaphragms. These MEMS (micro-electromechanical system) devices can be actuated by electrostatic forces, which utilize an induced electric field to pull two charged plates towards one another. Such devices were fabricated and electrostatic actuation of the diaphragms was performed to analyze its viability as a micro-speaker. The long-term performance of such products requires adequate diaphragm deflection to create audible pressure waves with relatively low maximum stresses to ensure a high cycle fatigue life. With these requirements, initial calculations and FEA (finite element analysis) were performed to establish the optimal square diaphragm side length combined with an attainable gap between electrodes to achieve an audible response. Optical and acoustic testing was then performed on 4, 5, and 7 mm side length square diaphragms with 10 μm thickness and a 70 μm electrode gap. For the 5 mm device and a 300 V applied potential, deflection was calculated to be 4. 12 μm theoretically and 3. 82 μm using FEA, although deflections based on optical test data averaged 30. 53 μm under DC conditions. The DAQ used for optical testing was extremely limiting due to its fastest sampling interval of 89 milliseconds, so this testing was performed at 2 and 5 Hz. Although the 7 mm device generated audible noise at 300 V and 2 kHz when the observer was within approximately 6 <b>inches</b> of the <b>device,</b> acoustic testing with a microphone placed 1 <b>inch</b> from the <b>device</b> did not yield any definitive results...|$|R

Responsive Web Design The technical team has seen a marked {{increase in the number of}} users accessing LIRN ® using mobile internet devices [...] predominantly tablets [...] over the past year. The use of these devices is projected to continue to grow substantially, thus the main focus of this Gateway release was to improve the support for these devices. After exploring various options for best supporting these devices, a web design technique known as Responsive Web Design was chosen. The use of Responsive Web Design allows LIRN ® to maintain a single set of web pages for desktop as well as mobile users, while customizing the way each page looks in a way that is appropriate for each device’s capabilities. For this release of the Gateway, the focus was supporting the 10 and 7 <b>inch</b> tablet <b>devices.</b> At this time, using a 4 inch smart phone screen is not considered viable user experience, as none of the LIRN ® vendors have currently optimized their web sites for screens of that size.

This is the first release of the Gateway to use this technology, and it will be incrementally refined and improved over the next few releases. Browser Information The LIRN ® IP Reporter functionality on the Training page has been replaced with a Browser Information tool. Now, users can use that tool to display important information about the web browser, operating system, screen size, IP address, and browser capabilities. This information can be very important to the technical team for diagnostics, especially if reporting a layout issue that may be related to the Responsive Web Design changes...|$|R
40|$|Planting {{trees that}} weigh over 200 pounds {{normally}} requires {{three or more}} able persons. Therefore, a device that allows a single person to easily and efficiently plant such trees possible by one person is highly desirable. During a Product Design class in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a group of 14 students developed a series of four concept models which culminated in a Final Prototype of such a product that can successfully lift, move and plant trees of over 200 pounds. This paper is aimed at documenting this series of designs and analyzing, testing and further developing the Final Prototype built in the course {{in order to make}} it marketable. Based on customer feedback, testing results, and user interaction, revisions to the next prototype of this device are proposed. Testing with trees of 170 and 370 lbs determined that the current outrigger stabilizing mechanism needs modification. The current outriggers, which are stored inside the frame, sustained maximum loads of 29 lbs for the 170 lbs tree, and 46 lbs for the 370 lbs tree. A sketch model built to simulate the outrigger mechanism suggests that the outriggers should be attached outside the base frame of the device rather than stored inside. (cont.) The revised device is also to include two stacked pipe clamps for securing the vertical member members of the outriggers. The upper and lower frames are to be reduced in width from 42 to 36 <b>inches,</b> making the <b>device</b> more compact while still accommodating tree root balls of up to 3 feet in diameter. Nylon insulation of the current winch wire is necessary to prevent damage to tree trunks while operating the device. These design revisions will improve the performance of the device Final Prototype and are believed to make the revised device commercially viable on the product market. by Sean J.

40|$|The {{advent of}} high resolution, {{physical}} model based computer graphics {{has left a}} gap in the design of input/output technology appropriate for interacting with such complex virtual world models. Since virtual worlds consist of physical models, it is appropriate to output the inherent force information necessary for the simulation to the user. The detailed design, construction, and control of a three degree freedom force output joystick will be presented. A novel kinematic design allows all three axes to be uncoupled, so that the system inertia matrix is diagonal. The two planar axes are actuated through an offset gimbal, and the third through a sleeved cable. To compensate for friction and inertia effects, this transmission is controlled by a force feedforward and a closed force feedback proportional loop. Workspace volume is a cone of 512 cubic <b>inches,</b> and the <b>device</b> bandwidth is maximized at 60 Hz for the two planar and 30 Hz for the third axis. Each axis is controlled by a motor/proportional magnetic particle brake combination fixed to the base. The innovative use of motors and brakes allows objects with high resistive torque requirements to be simulated without the stability and related safety issues involved with high torque, energy storing motors alone. Position, velocity, and applied endpoint force are sensed directly. Different control strategies are discussed and implemented, with an emphasis on how virtual environment force information, generated by the MIT Media Lab Computer Graphics and Animation Group BOLIO system, is transmitted to the device controller. The design constraints for a kinesthetic force feedback device can be summarized as: How can the symbiosis between the sense of presence in the virtual environment be maximized without compromising the interaction task under the constraints of the mechanical device limitations? Research in this field will yield insights to the optimal human sensory feedback mix for a wide spectrum of control and interaction problems.
