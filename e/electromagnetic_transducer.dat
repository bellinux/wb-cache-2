40|$|In {{order for}} an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>transducer</b> to operate well {{as either a}} {{mechanical}} shunt damper or as a vibration energy harvester, it must have good electromechanical coupling. A simple two-port analysis is used to derive a non-dimensional measure of electromechanical coupling, which must be large compared with unity for efficient operation {{in both of these}} applications. The two-port parameters for an inertial <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>transducer</b> are derived, from which this non-dimensional coupling parameter can be evaluated. The largest value that this parameter takes is approximately equal to the square of the magnetic flux density times the length of wire in the field, divided by the mechanical damping times the electrical resistance. This parameter is found to be only the order of one for voice coil devices that weigh approximately 1 kg, and so such devices are generally not efficient, within the definition used here, in either of these applications. The non-dimensional coupling parameter is found to scale in approximate proportion to the device's characteristic length, however, and so although miniaturised devices are less efficient, greater efficiency can be obtained with large devices, such as those used to control civil engineering structures. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Several {{types of}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>transducer</b> {{for the middle}} ear {{implants}} (MEIs) have been developed {{as an alternative to}} conventional hearing aids for the rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss. <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>transducer</b> type and design are thought to have a significant influence on their hearing compensation performance. To investigate these effects, a middle ear computational model was constructed based on a complete set of microcomputerized tomography section images of a human ear. Its validity was confirmed by comparing the model predicted motions with published experimental measurements. The result shows that the eardrum driving transducer (EDT) is superior to the floating mass transducer (FMT) in hearing compensation when the transducer mass is small but inferior to the FMT when the mass gets bigger. The incus body driving transducer (IBDT) is the most ineffective type of transducer for hearing compensation. Moreover, the masses of the EDT and the FMT decrease the transducer performance mainly at higher frequencies: the greater the transducer mass, the lower the displacement of the stapes excited by these transducers. On the other hand, the IBDT driving rod stiffness decreases transducer's performance severely at low frequencies and its adverse effect on transducer performance increases with the decrease of the stiffness of the IBDT driving rod...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a prototype energy harvesting autonomous sensor, called the Autonomous Wheel Speed Sensor (AWSS), that is targeted for {{operation in the}} Electronic Braking System (EBS) of vehicles. In order to monitor the rotational state of a wheel, the EBS currently uses a passive Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) which is a variable reluctance <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>transducer.</b> In the existing EBS setup, one WSS is used per wheel, {{each of which is}} connected to the EBS system using extensive cabling.
