25|$|Routing {{and milling}} are conceptually similar, and <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> {{can be used}} in routers, but routing wood is {{different}} from milling metal in terms of the mechanics involved; the chip formation is different, and the optimal tool geometry is thus different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and brittle materials, typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers may be run at extremely high speeds and so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood cutting mechanism of Type I chips cannot take place. The cutter edge angle is blunt, approaching 90°, and so a Type III chip is formed, with the waste material being produced as fine dust. This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials. The forces against the cutter are light, so routers may be hand-held.|$|E

The impact of <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool geometry on the surface roughness was determined by the testing the workpiece using Surface Roughness Tester. The machining time was determined by the CATIA V 5 software and by the real machining time.

This helps particularly in high-speed milling {{by reducing the}} effect of the machine tool mechanical structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip formation in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is becoming necessary for accurate kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this paper, chip formation during circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is studied with a major focus on feed per tooth and undeformed chip thickness along with their analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference in the feed per tooth formulation for <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> along linear and circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid formulation of the undeformed chip thickness in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory {{with a wide range of}} the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of undeformed chip thickness are validated with results of numerical simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> and also compared to the linear <b>end</b> <b>milling.</b> The close resemblance between analytical and numerical calculations of the undeformed chip thickness in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> suggests validity of the proposed analytical formulations.

40|$|AbstractIn {{determining}} the vibrations and deflections occurring during <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> process, the modeling and structural behavior {{plays an important}} role. The geometry of an <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool is complex. To overcome {{the complexity of the}} analysis, a simple beam model is considered. In this work the modeling of structure of an <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> is carried out and by the application of Finite Element Methods. The Static analysis has been performed {{in order to determine the}} deflection and suppress the vibration of <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> cutter so that the work piece will not have waviness on the surface, leading to minimization of chatter encountered during machining. The effect of dynamic response of the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool is studied with and without the application of MR damper. Metal cutting operation involves interaction of cutting forces of the tool with the regenerative forces of the material of work piece during metal cutting. To control the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool vibration and suppress the chatter, the method incorporates the unique features of a magnetic-rheological fluid, utilizes the damper input current to modify the magnetic field inside the coil of the damper and increase the variable stiffness and produce damping effect. In this work, the identification of chatter is done by means of the Bingham number of the magnetic-rheological fluid. The different metal cutting parameters are considered in experimental work and results are compared with and without the application of magnetic-rheological damping effect. The results show the enhancement of quality of the machined surface, reduction of deflection of the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool and decrease in the chatter marks on work piece by producing magnetic-rheological damping to the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool. The experimental tests were conducted with and without the application of the magnetic-rheological damper during machining, <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool deflection was determined.
