It is found that the electron states of quantum spheres have aspheric properties due to the interaction between the conduction band and valence band. The highest hole states are S (l = 0) states, when the radius is smaller than 9. 4 nm. the same as the lowest electron states. Thus strong luminescence from H-Te quantum dots with radius smaller than 9. 4 nm has been observed (Rogach et al 2001 Phys. Statits Solidi b 224 153). The bandgap of H-Te quantum spheres is calculated and compared with earlier experimental results (Harrison et al 2000 Pure Appl. Chem. 72 295).

25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Earl Hunt {{published}} in the journal Intelligence found that sex differences on tests can result from recruitment factors, so that gender differences are only representative of those that actually participate in the studies. He also contested that not only can there be individual variations that studies consistently recruit, but that these studies wouldn't be representative of the general population especially if the participants only represent college students. A 2009 study by researcher Dominika Dykiert published Intelligence also found that sex differences in mean IQ scores can be partly created by male variability in cognitive abilities and sample restriction. Dykiert highlighted the need for representative samples for studying sex differences in intelligence to eliminate skewed results created by male variance and restriction of sample. Studies have also indicated that tests used to measure sex differences such as Raven's Progressive matrices is not a pure indicator of general intelligence or <b>g</b> <b>factor</b> and only shares 50% of its variance. Tests like WAIS have also been criticized as not directly measuring <b>g</b> <b>factor</b> in a 2002 study published in Intelligence. Lead researcher Roberto Colom has strongly asserted that <b>g</b> <b>factor</b> or general intelligence is the correlation among different test scores and not the summed scores on different tests, such as Raven's or WAIS. Roberto Colom has also pointed out that Raven's Progressive matrices test is biased against females because of the visuospatial nature of the test which tends to favor those with stronger visuospatial skills (i.e. males) instead of <b>g</b> <b>factor.</b> Therefore, he concluded that sex difference research should not be based on a single test but instead on multiple tests loaded with fluid intelligence.|$|E

25|$|The current {{literature}} on sex differences produced inconsistent results {{depending on the}} type of testing used. Among the researchers who conducted studies on intelligence, many point that there are no sex differences in g (Jensen 1998, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2000, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2002, Camarata and Woodcock 2006), some found a difference favoring males (Lynn 1999, Lynn Irwing 2004, 2008) and some found a difference favoring females (Keith, Reynolds, Patel & Ridley 2006 and Reynolds, Keith, Ridley, Patel 2006). The issues remains unresolved if one uses standardized tests as Jensen (1998) and Colom, Garcia (2002) agrees that there might be a small insignificant sex difference in intelligence in general (IQ) but this may not necessarily reflect a sex difference in general intelligence (<b>g</b> <b>factor).</b> The difference between the two concepts is that IQ is a psychometric scoring system measured with standardized testing, while <b>g</b> <b>factor</b> is a latent scientific construct that correlates with all cognitive tests and achievements in life. Although most researchers distinguish between g and IQ, those that argue for greater male intelligence assert that IQ and g are synonymous (Lynn & Irwing 2004) and so the real division comes from defining IQ in relation to <b>g</b> <b>factor.</b> However, in 2008 Lynn and Irwing proposed that since working memory ability correlate highest with <b>g</b> <b>factor,</b> researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring sex differences on an n-back working memory task. The results found no sex difference in working memory capacity and thus contradicting the position pushed forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008) and more in line with those arguing for no sex differences in intelligence. The same results in the 2009 n-back working memory study have also been replicated in numerous other studies since.|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure, electron <b>g</b> <b>factors</b> {{and optical}} properties of InAs quantum ellipsoids are investigated, {{in the framework}} of the eight-band effective-mass approximation. It is found that the light-hole states come down in comparison with the heavy-hole states when the spheres are elongated, and become the lowest states of the valence band. Circularly polarized emissions under circularly polarized excitations may have opposite polarization factors to the exciting light. For InAs ellipsoids the length, which is smaller than 35 nm, is still in a strongly quantum-confined regime. The electron <b>g</b> <b>factors</b> of InAs spheres decrease with increasing radius, and are nearly 2 when the radius is very small.

25|$|In 2000, {{researchers}} Roberto Colom and Francisco J.

The tests conducted were on vocabulary, spatial rotation, verbal fluency and inductive reasoning. Roberto Colom in 2002 found that males' IQs were 3.16 points higher on the WAIS III test, but {{that there was no}} difference on the general intelligence factor (g) and therefore explained the differences as due to non-g factors such as specific group factors and test specificity. Responding to findings by Richard Lynn in 2002, researchers Roberto Colom and Oscar Garcia Lopez proposed that <b>g</b> <b>factor</b> is the variance of correlation among different IQ tests and not the sum of group scores published by Lynn in his studies. So measuring variance of Colom's study of 4,072 high school graduates, they found that females outperform males on the inductive Primary Mental Abilities reasoning test, males outperform females on the Raven's Progressive Matrices and that there is no difference on the Culture-Fair intelligence test and therefore concluded no difference in general intelligence. Using multi-group covariance and mean group structure analysis in 2006, researchers Sophie van der Sluis, Conor V. Dolan and Roberto Colom found that <b>g</b> <b>factor</b> couldn't explain any sex differences on the WAIS III. Later that year in another study, the same researchers concluded that sex differences on WAIS are due to primary factors or broad stratum abilities like working memory and perceptual organization not <b>g</b> <b>factor.</b> A study conducted by Jim Flynn and Lilia Rossi-Case (2011) found that men and women achieved roughly equal IQ scores on Raven's Progressive Matrices after reviewing recent standardization samples in five modernized nations. In 2010, researcher Emily Savage-McGlynn proposed that inconsistent results in sex differences are due to opportunity samples rather than samples that represent the general population. After a study with a nationally representative sample of 926 participants in the UK, no sex difference was found in the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.|$|E

Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence. Hereby, an individual's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure general cognitive ability indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis. In the same vein as g serves to display between-individual performance differences on cognitive tasks, collective intelligence research aims to find a parallel intelligence factor for groups c factor' (also called 'collective intelligence factor' (CI)) displaying between-group differences on task performance.
