This meant that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring leitmotiv played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of alto flutes.|$|E

Trưởng was shocked to discover, however, that the Airborne Division was to be removed to III Corps (unknown to Trưởng at the time, the Marine Division was also already slated for redeployment with both units then forming a new national reserve).|$|E
5|$|Foster {{returned}} to Lincoln in December, {{and a month}} later {{was told by the}} club that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> find another club after being deemed surplus to requirements at Sincil Bank. Shortly after, in January 2007, he mutually agreed to cancel his contract with Lincoln, enabling him to join Conference North side Stalybridge Celtic. He made his debut for Stalybridge in the FA Trophy, starting in a 1–1 draw against Kettering Town, scoring an own goal just before half-time. He scored his first goal for the club against one of his former employers, Alfreton, netting the winner in a 2–1 victory. He made six appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring once.|$|E

5|$|Having not {{featured}} for Cardiff {{during the}} opening months of the 2010–11 season, Comminges joined League One side Carlisle United on a short-term loan deal until 31 December 2010. Carlisle manager Greg Abbott hinted {{at the possibility of}} a permanent deal, should the loan be a success. However, Comminges failed to make a league appearance during his three-month loan spell, playing just 45 minutes in a 3–2 win over Conference National side Tamworth in the FA Cup. The adverse weather conditions during his loan agreement had resulted in a spate of postponements, and Comminges returned to his parent club earlier than agreed. On returning to Cardiff, he was told <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> find a new club with his contract expiring {{at the end of the}} season. He left the club by mutual consent, and subsequently joined League Two side Southend United on a free transfer in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|He went {{on trial}} with English League One clubs Northampton Town, Brighton & Hove Albion and Scunthorpe United, signing {{for the latter}} on 30 August 2006 on a two-year contract. He made his debut two days later {{starting}} a 2–0 away victory over Gillingham, but due to a hamstring injury that {{kept him out of}} action for 10 months his last appearance of 2006–07 came in November 2006. He made 10 appearances for a Scunthorpe team that won promotion to the Championship as 2006–07 League One champions. At the end of the season, McBreen was told by Scunthorpe manager Nigel Adkins that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> pursue a transfer to another club, despite having a year remaining on his contract.|$|E

He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E
5|$|Rabi chaired Columbia's physics {{department}} from 1945 to 1949, {{during which}} time it was home to two Nobel laureates (Rabi and Enrico Fermi) and eleven future laureates, including seven faculty (Polykarp Kusch, Willis Lamb, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, James Rainwater, Norman Ramsey, Charles Townes and Hideki Yukawa), a research scientist (Aage Bohr), a visiting professor (Hans Bethe), a doctoral student (Leon Lederman) and an undergraduate (Leon Cooper). Martin L. Perl, a doctoral student of Rabi's, won the Nobel Prize in 1995. When Columbia created the rank of University Professor in 1964, Rabi {{was the first to}} receive such a chair. This meant that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> research or teach whatever he chose. He retired from teaching in 1967 but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus until his death. A special chair was named after him in 1985.|$|E

He {{has worked as}} an international journalist for American magazines and newspapers, {{and at the time}} of writing the book was an Associate Professor of Journalism and Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona.

5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> leave, and Alvarado's parents {{were not allowed to}} be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|Following {{improvements}} to the River Arun in 1615, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham, they could also navigate part of the Rother, as far upstream as Fittleworth. The canal engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river below Petworth Mills in 1783, and was recalled in 1790, when he surveyed it below Midhurst. In the same year, {{the construction of the}} Arun Navigation was finished, and in 1791, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, who was based at Petworth House, obtained an Act of Parliament which would enable him to improve the Rother. The Act also authorised a branch canal to Petworth. Since he owned most of the land adjacent to the river, the precise route of the navigation was not specified, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> improve the channel or make cuts as he saw fit. The only restriction was that cuts could not be made through gardens or enclosed grounds. Compared to most other canals at the time, the charges for using the navigation were low, as the Earl wanted to develop the region rather than make a profit.|$|E
5|$|Prior to his suicide, Joseph Goebbels finally {{released}} Misch {{from further}} service; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> leave. Misch and mechanic Johannes Hentschel {{were two of}} the last people remaining in the bunker. They exchanged letters to their wives in case anything happened to either of them. Misch then went upstairs through the cellars of the Reich Chancellery to where Schädle had his office to report one last time. According to Hentschel, by that time Schädle's shrapnel leg wound had turned gangrenous. Misch told Schädle that Goebbels had released him. Schädle told Misch of the route he should take to try to get through the Soviet encirclement of the area. After helping Misch, Schädle shot himself. Misch fled the bunker in the early morning of 2 May, only hours before the Red Army seized it. He met up with some other soldiers and they travelled north through the U-Bahn tunnels. Shortly thereafter, they were taken prisoner by Red Army soldiers. Misch was brought to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, where he was tortured by Soviet NKVD officers in an attempt to extract information regarding Hitler's last days. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was extremely interested in learning of Hitler's fate and theories about possible escape. Misch spent eight years in Soviet forced labour camps.|$|E

5|$|Another {{source of}} crown income was {{represented}} by England's Jews. The Jews were the king's personal property, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> tax them at will. By 1280, the Jews had been exploited to a level at which {{they were no longer}} of much financial use to the crown, but they could still be used in political bargaining. Their usury businessa practice forbidden to Christianshad made many people indebted to them and caused general popular resentment. In 1275, Edward had issued the Statute of the Jewry, which outlawed usury and encouraged the Jews to take up other professions; in 1279, {{in the context of a}} crack-down on coin-clippers, he arrested all the heads of Jewish households in England and had around 300 of them executed. In 1280, he ordered all Jews to attend special sermons, preached by Dominican friars, with the hope of persuading them to convert, but these exhortations were not followed. The final attack on the Jews in England came in the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, whereby Edward formally expelled all Jews from England. This not only generated revenues through royal appropriation of Jewish loans and property, but it also gave Edward the political capital to negotiate a substantial lay subsidy in the 1290 Parliament. The expulsion, which was reversed in 1656, followed a precedent set by other European territorial princes: Philip II of France had expelled all Jews from his own lands in 1182; John I, Duke of Brittany, drove them out of his duchy in 1239; and in the late 1240s Louis IX of France had expelled the Jews from the royal demesne before his first passage to the East.|$|E
