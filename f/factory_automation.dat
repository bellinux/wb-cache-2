We have developed a heuristic to design the flow path of the automated guided vehicle system, so that minimized the total distance traveled by vehicles. We used A-STAR algorithm to find the shortest route between two points in a factory, and used the look-up table to reduce the processing time of the system when dealing with job requests. We adopted zone control techniques for traffic management, used attributed petri net (APN) to represent the current state and to generate future states of zone control AGV systems. We proposed an algorithmic procedure to predict in real time and to avoid deadlocks that were caused by sharing guide-path zones in zone-control AGV system. The background of the thesis was the project [...] -Shanghai Cigarette Factory Automatic Guided Vehicle transport system. Now, the system has been put into use and operated steadily for half a year. The application of AGV transport system promoted the transport efficiency, solved the safety problem ever existed, improved the <b>factory's</b> <b>automation</b> level and management level.
