5|$|Like all azhdarchid pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx was {{probably}} a terrestrially foraging generalist predator. It is significantly larger than any other terrestrial predator from Maastrichtian Europe; due to its large size in an environment otherwise dominated by island dwarf dinosaurs, with no large hypercarnivorous theropods in the region, {{it has been suggested}} that Hatzegopteryx played the role of an apex predator in the Haţeg <b>Island</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> The robust anatomy of Hatzegopteryx suggests that it may have tackled larger prey than other azhdarchids, including animals too large to swallow whole; similarly, some modern storks (particularly the marabou stork and the jabiru) are known to attack and kill large prey such as flamingoes, and occasionally children, with their beaks. Meanwhile, other giant azhdarchids like Arambourgiania would probably have instead fed on small prey (up to the size of a human), including hatchling or small dinosaurs and eggs. Another pterosaur, Thalassodromeus, has similarly been suggested to be raptorial.|$|E

30|$|Most {{of these}} {{previous}} studies focused on terrestrial ecosystems.

Islands are defined as “lands isolated by surrounding water and with {{a high proportion of}} coast to hinterland” (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2003). They have characteristics of both land and aquatic systems but are unique in many ways. Due to the special geographical environment, <b>island</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are very fragile and particularly vulnerable to disturbances (e.g., Shi et al. 2009).

25|$|Research by Australian Antarctic Division scientists, {{published}} in the 13 January 2009 edition of the British Ecological Society's Journal of Applied Ecology, suggested {{that the success of}} the feral cat eradication program has allowed the rabbit population to increase, damaging the Macquarie <b>Island</b> <b>ecosystem</b> by altering significant areas of island vegetation. However, in a comment {{published in}} the same journal other scientists argued that a number of factors (primarily a reduction {{in the use of the}} Myxoma virus) were almost certainly involved and the absence of cats may have been relatively minor among them. The original authors examined the issue in a later reply and concluded that the effect of the Myxoma virus use was small and reaffirmed their original position.|$|E

500|$|Apart from Hatzegopteryx, {{there are}} various other unusual [...] of the Haţeg <b>Island</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> Co-occurring pterosaurs {{included}} the small azhdarchid Eurazhdarcho, with a wingspan of an unnamed, small-sized short-necked azhdarchid with a wingspan of a somewhat larger and likewise unnamed azhdarchid, with a wingspan of and apparently small pteranodontids have been found as well. The robust, flightless, and possibly herbivorous avialan or dromaeosaurid Balaur, which had two enlarged claws on each foot, represents another highly specialized component of the fauna. The ecosystem contained a number of insular dwarfs, namely the titanosaurs Magyarosaurus and Paludititan, the hadrosaurid Telmatosaurus, and the iguanodontian Zalmoxes. Along with the nodosaurid Struthiosaurus, various small, fragmentary maniraptorans were present: Bradycneme, Elopteryx, and Heptasteornis. Crocodilian remains, belonging to the genera Allodaposuchus, Doratodon, and Acynodon have also been found. Non-archosaurian components include the kogaionid multituberculate mammals Kogaionon, Barbatodon, and Hainina; lizards such as the teiid Bicuspidon and the paramacellodid Becklesius; an unnamed madtsoiid snake; and the lissamphibians Albanerpeton, Eodiscoglossus, and Paradiscoglossus.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behavior}} of Balaur. Because of the lack of skull material, it is impossible to determine by the shape of the teeth whether Balaur was a carnivore or a herbivore. The original description assumed it was carnivorous because it had been found that it was closely related to Velociraptor. Csiki speculated in 2010 that it may {{have been one of the}} apex predators in its limited <b>island</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> because of larger theropods not even the teeth have ever been found in Romania. He also believed that it likely used its double sickle claws for slashing prey, and that the atrophied state of its hands indicates that it probably did not use them to hunt. One of the original discoverers indicated that it [...] "was probably more of a kickboxer than a sprinter" [...] compared to Velociraptor, and was probably able to hunt larger animals than itself. However, more recent studies by Denver Fowler and others have shown that the foot anatomy of paravians like Balaur indicate that they used their large claws to grip and pin prey to the ground while flapping with their proto-wings to stay on top of their victim. Once it was worn out, they might have proceeded to feast while it was still alive as some modern birds of prey still do. Due to the shape of the claws, they would not have been effective in slashing attacks. The very short, fused metatarsus of Balaur and enlarged first claw, strange even by dromaeosaur standards, are thought to be consistent with these newer studies, lending further support to the idea that Balaur was a predator.|$|E
