5|$|Traditionally, {{agriculture}} was {{the mainstay}} of the economy {{of this part of}} Wales, but with the Industrial Revolution, the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised. The advent of the railway running from Chester along the North Wales coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> made it easy for urban dwellers from Lancashire and Cheshire to visit the seaside towns of North Wales, and nowadays, tourism is the main source of income in Clwyd.|$|E
5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century.</b> The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E

As employment became available, many people moved {{to the area of}} the South Wales Coalfield; between 1851 and 1911 the population increased by 320,000. By 1913 the Welsh collieries were extracting 56.8million long tons of coal (63.6million short tons) a year, up from 8.5million long tons (9.5million short tons) in 1854; collieries in the region mined a fifth of all coal produced in the UK, and employed a fifth of its miners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century.</b> In 1913 Britain was responsible for 25 per cent of world coal production and 55 percent of all world coal exports.|$|E

The mastodon, found in a marl pit near Mannington, was sold by a local farmer to a travelling circus before it was acquired by Rutgers for display.|$|E
5|$|Trade in {{the region}} was {{negatively}} impacted {{by the development of}} an oceanic route from Europe around Africa to India, and in the tax registers of the late sixteenth century, Alanya failed to qualify as an urban center. In 1571 the Ottomans designated the city as part of the newly conquered province of Cyprus. The conquest further diminished the economic importance of Alanya's port. Traveler Evliya Çelebi visited the city in 1671/1672, and wrote on the preservation of Alanya Castle, but also on the dilapidation of Alanya's suburbs. The city was reassigned in 1864 under Konya, and in 1868 under Antalya, as it is today. During the 18th and 19th centuries numerous villas were built in the city by Ottoman nobility, and civil construction continued under the local dynastic Karamanid authorities. Bandits again became common across Antalya Province <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E

5|$|Henry Raeburn, {{most famous}} for his {{intimate}} portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and John Watson Gordon. Significant Glasgow artists included John Graham-Gilbert and Daniel Macnee. David Wilkie emerged as {{of one of the}} most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. Alexander Nasmyth helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including Horatio McCulloch, Joseph Farquharson and William McTaggart. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in coastal communities such as Pittenweem and Kirkudbright. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of genre painting, which was pursued by artists including John Burnet, Alexander George Fraser and Walter Geikie. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by William Allan, David Roberts and John Phillip.|$|E
5|$|In poor {{condition}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> {{the nave}} walls were leaning outward and the roofs decayed, so restoration was proposed in 1848 under R.K. Penson, but not actively pursued until the Reverend John Pugh became vicar in 1861, when new plans {{were made by}} William Butterfield. Butterfield however resigned in 1867 and the restoration was finally carried out 1867–84 by John Pollard Seddon. The church was substantially restored in stages {{at a cost of}} £8,500, and the roof was renewed, apart from the wagon roof over the chancel, which survives above Seddon's roof. The restoration work in general consisted of the reconstruction of the nave, the lifting and paving of the chancel, {{the construction of a new}} altar and the reconstruction of the north and south transepts. The nave was opened in 1869 and the tower and south transepts were opened in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance is {{a concept}} {{formulated}} by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> to describe the intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive {{the principles of the}} Greek and Roman classical worlds. It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude, a return to ideas of original sources and proportion and balance in art. The major ideas of the Renaissance are generally considered to have reached Northern Europe much later, in the late fifteenth century. Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is generally considered to have stretched into the early seventeenth century, when it was replaced by the grander styles of the Baroque. However, the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 {{to the end of the}} seventeenth century is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance.|$|E

50|$|After the Bolshevik Revolution, many Sunni Arabs {{residing}} in Bukhara {{and other areas}} of Central Asia ruled by Russians migrated to Afghanistan where they were better able to practice their religion without fear of religious persecution or discrimination.

50|$|As {{an area of}} {{absolute}} idealism, British idealism was a philosophical movement that was influential <b>in</b> Britain from <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century</b> to <b>the</b> early twentieth century.

Moore and Bertrand Russell, were brought up in this tradition and then reacted against it by pioneering analytic philosophy.|$|R
5|$|Following an {{increase}} in coin collecting among the public <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> there arose considerable demand for older American coins. Mint Director James Ross Snowden began selling restrikes of Gobrecht dollars and trading them for rare medals (especially those depicting or relating to former President George Washington), which were then added to the Mint's coin collection, then known as a coin cabinet. The money generated from selling the restrikes went toward purchasing new items for the coin cabinet. The restrikes created under Snowden's tenure were likely struck in 1859 and 1860, but the practice was largely halted after the eruption of a public scandal; other Mint employees were creating and selling restrikes of early American coins for their own profit. All Gobrecht dollar restrikes, when tilted on their axis, depict the reverse eagle flying level, rather than upward as it is depicted on the coins struck during the official production run. It is unknown precisely why {{the orientation of the}} eagle was altered, though it is believed by many numismatists that Snowden did this intentionally to make restrikes distinguishable from originals. Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggests that Snowden simply used the alignment because that was the same used on the Flying Eagle cent, which began production in 1856. Mint Engraver James B. Longacre, its designer, had borrowed Gobrecht and Peale's eagle reverse for the one-cent coin's obverse.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} revolution {{changed the}} traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers migrated from farms and smallholdings {{to the new}} industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), Highland landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. Whereas rents had often been paid in kind, the landlords turned to money rents. They displaced farmers to raise sheep and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-nineteenth</b> <b>century,</b> when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. One result of these changes was the Highland Clearances, by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the United Kingdom, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, and further afield to England, Canada, America and Australia. The potato famine of the 1840s, caused by potato blight, which devastated the population of Ireland, reached the Highlands in 1846. Although 150,000 people faced disaster, because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk), they were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland and prevented a major demographic crisis.|$|E

50|$|Although it is {{traditionally}} equated with or {{seen as a}} dialect of the Iroquoian Wendat (Huron), Wyandot became so differentiated as {{to be considered a}} distinct language.
