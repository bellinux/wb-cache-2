The idea behind this thesis is to investigate the effects of rate constraints on reservoir performance due to erosion of sand screens in a cased hole.

After investigation we found that there are only few studies of different {{fine particles}} composition on the effect of the sand control. Through the analysis of various oilfield formation data, we realized that the fine particle is more or less exists in the formation. As we know, the cost of <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> is several times higher than independent high quality screen, if the well completion is prevalent in <b>gravel</b> <b>packing,</b> this will increase not only the operation time, but also the cost of well completion. As we all know, the pre-packed screen is also one of many options of sand control methods. Based on the pre-packed screen design and numerous laboratory experiments, this paper is emphasis on the effects of the fine particle to jam the pre-packed screen.|$|E
30|$|The fine {{particles}} have significant influence for sand control mode selection. According to investigation and analysis, {{we learn that}} the <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> has been used widespread in sand control when the contents of {{fine particles}} are high. Based on designing the pre-packed screen, different fine particles sand control research is completed combining with test method. (1) We find that the sequence of fine particles flowing into the well has {{an enormous impact on}} the screen jam rate, and the smaller the fine particle diameter, the more obvious the screen plugging. The jam rate for the pure clay is five times with pure fine-silty sand, and four times with mixture of the fine-silty sand and the clay. When the experimental achieve octet stability, the Fluid Productivity Index Per-Meter (FPIPM) of the pure clay is pretty much equivalent with the mixture of the fine-silty sand and the clay. It is 70  % of the pure fine-silty sand FPIPM but has limited influence to effectiveness of the blockage. (2) Sand control selection in the offshore oilfield suggests the <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> will be applied when the fine particles content is over 5  %. Compared to this select range, it is conservative and experiments show that the fine particles content achieves 100  %, the pre-packed screen also can cope with sand control effectively. When comparing with experimental result about the <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> sand control under the same condition, the both FPIPM in steady is same.

30|$|During the {{productive}} process of production well, the weakly consolidated sands produce tiniest particles of clay {{at first and}} then free sand. When {{the productive}} velocity reaches a particular level, the formation suddenly produces a huge amount of sand. The whole experimental simulation {{is the same as the}} real sand production in the process of production wells, and the sand control design focuses on preventing free sand into the productive pipelines that cause the productive pipeline to be erosive. According to the experimental results, the pre-packed screen can block these clay and free sand outside the screen, gradually they accumulate a layer of mud cake commendably. When making a selection of sang control, especially to those deep-water oilfields (depth over 1500  ft), the field staff always tend to select the <b>gravel</b> <b>packing.</b> However, this method is relatively conservative, which increase both the operational time and the cost of well completion. Therefore, expanding the optimal principles of sand controlling should be considered, especially about select range of fine-silty sand.

40|$|The {{production}} of sand from poorly consolidated formation {{is a problem}} that has plagued {{the oil and gas industry}} for a long time. The problem of sanding can be alleviated by producing under the critical flow rate that triggers sand production. However, this critical production rate is usually small and uneconomical. Therefore, some from of sand control is employed of which the mechanical sand retention, i. e. <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> and sand control screen are the most popular. The use of sand control devices inevitably causes decline in well productivity, which is characterized by the additional pressure drop across the device(s). The drop in productivity is often aggravated by high velocity and two-phase flow. A computer simulation program will be developed to evaluate the prodcutivity of <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> and sand control screen with a few assumptions such as semi-steady state flow around the wellbore, perforations are treated as perfect cylinders and the annulus between the perforation and screen is completely filled with gravel.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study slurry transport in horizontal openhole <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> and to investigate the process of sedimentation, both inside work string and for alpha wave. An attempt to quantify the amount of gravel deposited in the work string is made, since control of the gravel consumption is vital for {{the outcome of the}} operation, and uncontrolled sedimentation can cause unnecessary confusion during the packing process. A practical and straightforward method to quantify the gravel deposition in horizontal section of the work string is presented. Sedimentation is strongly affected by internal pipe diameter and pump rate, and these parameters should be carefully evaluated through operational planning. The utilization of the presented model could aid in designing the slurry transport, by selecting the ideal pump rate and work string specifications. Modelling for typical pipe sizes shows a lower limit for the pump rate where sedimentation arises. Alpha wave design is a key factor for successful <b>gravel</b> <b>packing,</b> and the models typically used are either based on small-scale experiments or not specifically developed for <b>gravel</b> <b>packing.</b> Gruesbeck et al., Penberthy et al. and Oroskar and Turian models were used in this thesis to find the critical flow velocity. Estimating the actual flow velocity above alpha dune was performed using Gruesbeck et al. pressure drop balance and a proposed method for describing the flow rate split between the annuli. This allowed finding the corresponding alpha dune gravel fill for the distinct models. The true volumetric gravel fill percent was found based on data from the actual field case and compared to the modelled. Gruesbeck et al. showed the best fit. Oroskar and Turian model was not developed for <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> purpose, and results showed that it may not be suitable for the eccentric annular configuration encountered. Modelling of flow velocity was done using friction loss based on wall roughness, and it is believed to represent the overall friction, rather than characterize the borehole wall. Results from the work string modelling suggest that the phenomenon of bed surface friction needs to be investigated further for alpha wave. It is a considerable contributor to the frictional pressure loss, especially for higher gravel fill percentages. Using borehole wall roughness to calculate friction factor might not give the best representation of the reality.

Sand control technology has developed to meet demands for draining increasingly more difficult reservoirs, e. g. at grater depths, unstable formations and with stacked contacts. New approaches have developed and with new technology, new experiences have been gained and the key elements for success in operation and production have been updated. <b>Gravel</b> <b>packing</b> sand screens is the most demandings and control technique with regards to planning, cost and time. When other methods are found in adequate or risk and consequence of failure to prevent sanding is found unacceptable, the choice in most cases will be gravel packed sand screens. Planning well design and deducting operational parameters for open hole gravelpack (OHGP) requires involvement of experienced specialists from several disciplines. Successfully installed and producing gravel packed screens depends on all elements in the previous and following sections to be successful. Every operation contains insecurities and hence, potential for deviation from established plans. Therefore, operational phase requires close follow up. Engineering software has been developed to support the most common calculations in planning and operation. Having one application containing the most essential well data can simplify and enhance engineering support. The software can support drilling operations, but it has been specialized for horizontal <b>gravel</b> <b>packing.</b> Seamless functions - all calculations use the same source for each section: well data and work string data – enabling calculations with minimal user effort: Torque and drag Hydraulic Gravel pack calculations Gravel pack simulations combining all operational parameters Kick tolerance Well Schematic Other functions The quality and nature of the application can save time for engineering during planning and operation, especially for wells with open hole gravel pack. Planning wells that require <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> have some key elements that must be incorporated in the planning to ensure best chances for success. These key elements come from operational experience – what can practically done, what works and what fails. Hence, the industry use operational parameters often empirically deducted. The key elements are related to: the wellpath (trajectory), exposed formations properties, sizing of screens and gravel, gravel pack tool design, design of wash pipe (inner string), gravel pack design parameters (gravel feed, OH size, type of gravel, etc) and the properties of the drill-in fluid. The most central issue in horizontal <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> is the fluid velocity in the screen annulus. Most of the listed properties are there because of their influence on the fluid velocity. A robust well design must be made in the planning phase. Determining what is acceptable and not for the key elements and parameters must be acceptable for the drilling operation, production of the well and any well intervention. A well design for a typical subsea well has been discussed according to the industries practice for planning wells with OHGP.

The low permeability roughly estimated by recovery of background water pressure in Hole 2 may also be consistent with this zone.|$|R
