40|$|The {{importance}} of controlling respirable dust and methane gas levels in underground coal mining cannot be underestimated. While respirable dust can significantly affect the occupational health of underground coal miners, methane gas accumulations pose significant safety concerns for these same workers. Water sprays and machine mounted <b>dust</b> <b>scrubbers</b> offer effective control of respirable dust exposures and methane gas accumulations. Water {{must not only}} be applied carefully to avoid dust rollback to the machine operator but must create sufficient turbulence to remove dead zones that could contain high concentrations of methane gas. While the flooded-bed dust scrubber has been generally responsible for decreased worker exposures to respirable dusts, this device has proved effective in controlling methane levels at the face.

40|$|Dust is a {{major hazard}} in {{underground}} coal mines that threatens the work {{health and safety of}} coal miners. The dust issue becomes increasingly significant with the development of highly mechanized coal mining. This issue is particularly serious at the high longwall faces of the Sihe colliery in China as the concentration of dust, in particular respirable dust, at these faces far exceeds the regulatory dust limits. Field testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to understand the sources of dust generation and its dynamic movement in the # 5301 longwall face of high-cutting height at the colliery. The investigation results showed that shearer generated dust was minimal during the coal cutting operation; that face spalling and chock movement were the main dust generating sources, causing significant contamination to the walkway; and that the majority of dust particles from the face (regardless of source) eventually disperse into the main gate, where the dust concentration was greater than 500 mg/m 3. These findings were used to develop an effective coal dust mitigation system involving the installation of <b>dust</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> curtains, and venture and crescent sprays.

Muck from the excavated face, which is usually fairly wet when placed on the conveyor, dries out as it travels on the conveyor through the airstream. Water sprays placed at intervals along the conveyor will minimize dust from the conveyor contaminating the airstream. Conveyor transfer and drop points should be enclosed and provided with water sprays. Scraper and spray wash will wash return belts and idlers. 7. 5. 11 Airways, Haulage Ways, Mine Cars and Dumping Stations a) Airways and rail haulage ways Cleaning the walls and floors of airways and rail haulage ways, by periodically washing down or vacuuming, will remove many potential dust sources. Concrete lined openings facilitate cleaning. Residual dust and dirt {{should not be allowed}} to accumulate in the airways and haulage ways as these represent potential dust sources. b) Mine cars Keeping the muck in the mine cars wet reduces the potential for creating dust. Overloading cars must be avoided as it can lead to spillage which then becomes another potential dust source. Washing mine cars regularly will keep them free of dirt and dust, and parking a loaded mine car for a long periods should be avoided as this allows the muck to dry out. If feasible, major route of mine cars should not be along primary intake airways. c) Dumping Stations Subsurface muck car dumping stations represent major potential dust sources. Enclosure and bypass airways can be installed to avoid high velocity air/dust contact. Water spray at dump activated during dumping will wet the muck and suppress dust.

Using a full-scale mock-up of a continuous mining machine, preliminary work showed that these side sprays improved suppression of the dust cloud and redistributed this cloud under the cutting head. This led to reductions in dust levels around the machine and in down-wind airways for some positions of theminingmachine. This testing also showed that side spray effectiveness was in u-enced by the distance from the fresh air ventilation device to the cutting surface, termed the ventilation setback distance. These sprays produced larger reductions inmachine and re-turn dust levels at smaller setback distances than at larger setback distances.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} evaluations examined {{the impact of}} water spray pressure, curtain setback distance, and external and underboom spray use for controlling respirable dust levels and sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas concentrations around a continuous mining machine. This mining machine was equipped with a flooded-bed <b>dust</b> <b>scrubber</b> and was positioned in the box or slab cut. Exhaust line brattice was used for all tests. Dust levels were measured in the return airway and at locations representing the operators of the continuous mining machine and the standard and off-standard shuttle cars. Increasing water pressure or using the underboom sprays produced no significant impacts on dust levels, although their interactions did produce some significant impacts. Increasing curtain setback distance often elevated dust levels, likely by {{reducing the amount of}} airflow reaching the face. Use of the external sprays created additional airflow around the mining machine that pushed the dust cloud past the scrubber inlets. This significantly increased dust levels at all sampling locations. Tracer gas levels were measured on the off-curtain and curtain sides of the cutter head and in the return airway. Increasing water pressure generally led to significantly increased gas levels on the curtain side, although a slight decrease was observed on the off-curtain side with the machine in the box cut. Increasing setback distance elevated gas levels {{on both sides of the}} cutter head and in the return by limiting the quantity of ventilation airflow reaching the face. Use of the external sprays provided additional airflow along the off-curtain side of the machine, significantly reducing gas levels in this region. These sprays adversely impacted the dilution and removal of gas on the curtain side of the cutter head. Use of the underboom sprays adversely impacted gas levels on both sides of the cutter head. Use of the external sprays provided the best control of respirable dust and face gas concentrations. The smaller increases in miner operator dust levels produced by these sprays were offset by larger reductions in face gas levels on the off-curtain side of the cutter head. Although the underboom sprays minimally impacted respirable dust levels, use of these sprays was not recommended because they increased face gas levels...|$|R
40|$|On a {{continuous}} miner coal face methane concentrations {{are affected by}} the quantity of fresh intake air reaching the face. When mining the box cut on a 12. 2 -m (40 -ft) two-pass extended cut face, the continuous miner is always at the point of deepest penetration, and operation of the machine-mounted <b>dust</b> <b>scrubber</b> and water spray system improve the flow of fresh air {{to the end of the}} box cut. However, when the continuous miner leaves the box cut to begin cutting the 40 -ft slab, little is known about how much ventilation air reaches the end of the box cut. The Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted a full-scale study to answer this question. Tests were run to determine how much ventilation air reaches the end of the box cut with the continuous miner at three locations in the 40 -fttwo-pass extended cut mining sequence; at the end of the 40 -ft box cut, at the start of the 40 -ft slab cut, and 6. 1 m (20 ft) into the slab cut. During these tests, methane gas was uniformly released at the end of the 40 -ft box cut. Methane concentrations measured 0. 3 m (1 ft) from the roof and face of the box cut were used to estimate face airflow quantities. Fresh air flow rates of 1. 89 and 4. 72 m/sec (4, 000 and 10. 000 cfm), scrubber flow rates of 0, 4, 000 and 10, 000 cfm, water spray pressures of 0 and 3827 kPa (0 and 120 psi), and a blowing curtain setback position of 15. 2 m (50 ft) were used during these tests.

40|$|The {{development}} of Missouri's new lead belt {{within the past}} decade has provided an excellent opportunity to study the dissemination and effects of heavy metals in a deciduous forest ecosystem. Primary lead smelters within the new lead belt have been identified as potential sources of cadmium as well as lead, zinc, and copper. Sintering and blast furnace operations tend to produce significant quantities of small particulates highly enriched in cadmium and other heavy metals. At one smelter, samples of stack particulate emissions indicate that as much as 0. 21 lb of cadmium may be released to the atmosphere per hour. This is accompanied by 0. 44 lb zinc, 4. 66 lb lead, and 0. 01 lb copper/hr. These point-source emissions, {{as well as a number}} of other sources of fugitive (wind blown) and waterborne emissions contribute to a significant deposition of cadmium in the surrounding forest and stream beds. Mobilization of vagrant heavy metals may be significantly increased by contact of baghouse <b>dusts</b> or <b>scrubber</b> slurries with acidic effluents emanating from acid plants designed to produce H 2504 as a smelter by-product. Two separate drainage forks within the Crooked Creek watershed permit some comparisons of the relative contributions of cadmium by air-borne versus water-borne contaminants. Cadmium and other heavy metals have been found to accumulate in the forest litter and partially decomposed litter along stream beds. Greater solubility, lower levels of complexation with organic ligands in the litter, and greater overall mobility of cadmium compared with lead, zinc, and copper result in appreciable contributions of dissolved cadmium to the watershed runoff.

Although the washable filters can be reused, washing them generated personal and downstream respirable dust concentrations of 1. 2 and 8. 3 mg/m(3), respectively, for a 10 -min washing period. The scrubber's velocity-pressure-regulated variable-frequency-drive fan maintained relatively consistent airflow near the targeted 1. 42 and 4. 25 m(3) /s (3, 000 and 9, 000 ft(3) /min) airflow rates {{during most of the}} laboratory dust testing until reaching its maximum 60 -Hz fan motor frequency or horsepower rating at 2, 610 Pa (10. 5 in. w. g.) of filter differential pressure and 3. 97 m(3) /s (8, 420 ft(3) /min) of scrubber airflow quantity. Laboratory sound level measurements of the scrubber showed that the outlet side of the scrubber was noisier, and the loaded filters increased sound levels compared with clean filters at the same airflow quantities. With loaded filters, the scrubber reached a 90 dB(A) sound level at 2. 83 m(3) /s (6, 000 ft(3) /min) of scrubber airflow, indicating that miners should not be overexposed in relation to MSHA's permissible exposure level - under Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations Part 62. 101 - of 90 dB(A) at or below this airflow quantity. The scrubber's washable filters were not used during field-testing because of their lower respirable dust removal efficiency and the airborne dust generated by filter washing.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} into mine ventilation systems currently in use within Australian modern coal Longwall (LW) extraction mines. It reviews systems and discusses evolving changes being adopted to address the more complex challenges. There is a strong move to longer panels, wider faces, greater extraction heights, increased production rates, more efficient ventilation and decreased personnel. In addition mine workings are moving deeper which results in increased ventilation control issues such as higher total and respirable dust levels, greater seam gas contents in parallel with lower in situ permeabilities, spontaneous combustion and heat management issues. Currently {{there are a variety}} of LW panel ventilation circuits used in Australian underground coal mines due to various combinations of seam characteristics, gas emission rates, spontaneous combustion, geological features and surface constraints. The main issues usually addressed in the designing and planning of ventilation circuits for LW panels are airway velocity, gas concentrations, LW cutting methods (e. g. Bi-di, Uni-di or half web), ventilation of control devices, pressure differentials and leakage paths and understanding gas concentrations across the length and width of the goaf.

40|$|Dust {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} at six underground mines {{to determine if}} deep-cut mining practices expose face workers {{to higher levels of}} respirable dust by comparing levels during the first 20 ft of advance (regular-cut depth) during the deep cut to levels during the final 10 to 20 ft of advance (deep-cut depth). The studies were conducted at mines where the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) had approved an extended curtain setback distance with operation of a flooded-bed scrubber to permit taking deep cuts of up to 40 ft. In general, all of the selected mines exercised good dust control practices by maintaining water sprays, scrubber airflows, proper curtain setback distances and providing sufficient airflow to the active faces. These practices minimized variability in dust levels related to factors other than the depth of cut. To ensure proper scrubber functioning, the scrubber screen was back-flushed before commencing each cut. Both exhausting and blowing face ventilation configurations were studied. All of the operations surveyed for this study were able to successfully implement deep-cutting methods without significantly increasing the dust exposures of face workers during the cutting and bolting cycles. For exhausting face ventilation, field data indicate that scrubber airflow is the most important factor for controlling dust. Clogging of the scrubber screen can result in lower airflows; therefore, the screen must be periodically tapped and back-flushed. Data collected for this study indicate that 20 -mesh screens should be cleaned for every 40 ft of advance because 22 % of the deep-cut sequences surveyed for this study experienced a 20 % to 35 % decrease in scrubber airflow {{over the course of the}} cut. For blowing face ventilation, field and laboratory data indicate that maintaining a proper curtain-to-scrubber airflow ratio of 1. 0 and a curtain setback distance that allows the miner operator to stand at the mouth of the curtain helps control dust. Curtain airflows should be measured before activation of the scrubber regardless of ventilation type (exhausting or blowing) to avoid erroneously overinflating the ratio. The curtain setback variance should be greater than the maximum cutting depth to allow miner operators to maintain their position at the mouth of the curtain when the miner is fully extended into the cut. Greater curtain setback distances associated with deep-cutting methods may result in cuts that do not require ventilation curtain, such as the initial heading developments beyond the last open crosscut. For these cuts, dust levels were generally lower during development of deep cuts when compared to regular cuts. However, adequate ventilation of cuts without ventilation curtain is dependent on a properly functioning <b>scrubber.</b> <b>Dust</b> levels on the bolting faces did not appear to be affected by the longer cycles associated with deep-cut mining practices when curtain airflow was measureable and the curtain was periodically advanced in sync with the bolting machine.
