40|$|Hydrogen can be {{produced}} from many feedstocks with different production and delivery pathways. Production options include conversion {{from a variety of}} feedstocks and energy sources. Delivery modes for vehicle fueling include compressed gas in tube trailers and pipelines, liquefied hydrogen in trucks, or on-site production. Alternative carrier options such as chemical hydrides are also being investigated. The energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) were analyzed for different production pathways for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and comparable gasoline fueled vehicles. The results for on-site reforming of natural gas, central plant natural <b>gas</b> <b>reforming,</b> <b>petroleum</b> coke gasification, central plant biomass pyrolysis, and on-site electrolysis using a mix of natural gas based and renewable power are presented in this paper. Well to wheel energy inputs and GHG emissions were determined from primary energy inputs to the fuel cycle using analysis tools developed by TIAX, which account for the contribution of energy from natural <b>gas,</b> biomass, <b>petroleum,</b> and electric power...|$|R

A demand model is specified and estimated. The conclusions suggest that the unit price of natural <b>gas</b> (liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas)</b> is a factor impacting the quantity of natural <b>gas</b> (liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas)</b> demanded by farmers, but {{there is no indication that}} other types of energy are substitutes for natural <b>gas</b> or liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Additionally, the number of acres irrigated is an important factor driving the demand for natural <b>gas</b> and liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Finally, the estimated models of natural <b>gas</b> and liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> demand were structurally stable over the period 1971 - 1989. ...|$|R
