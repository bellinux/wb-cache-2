40|$|This guide {{promotes}} the use <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> to assist individuals with severe disabilities. The first two sections review the development <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> in the workplace, including changes in {{perspectives on the}} role of persons with disabilities, utilization issues, and the definition <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>supports.</b> A seven-step process reflecting the development <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> is presented that calls for identification of need, establishing the life activity areas affected, identifying the extant networks <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> examining the <b>natural</b> <b>support</b> resources available within those networks, enabling a decision to be made as to whether existing resources will resolve the need, putting a support plan into place, and evaluating the outcomes of the support activities. The next section proposes a five-step supports and outcomes design that involves: (1) developing the person's whole life goals; (2) completing an ecological inventory of supports; (3) conducting a discrepancy analysis between the person's needed and available <b>natural</b> <b>support</b> networks and resources; (4) accessing needed supports; and (5) evaluating the outcomes from the <b>natural</b> <b>support.</b> The last two sections examine the implications <b>of</b> using <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> and revie...|$|R
40|$|This study extends {{previous}} research {{by continuing to}} describe the <b>natural</b> <b>support</b> process. Specifically, we fo-cus on the roles that co-workers and job coaches assume in supporting a worker with a disability. First, we discuss research related to co-worker involvement in work set-tings and provide a rationale for considering various roles for co-workers and job coaches. Second, we pro-pose a framework for a continuum of six support strat-egies for co-workers and job coaches and show how prior research supports these strategies. Third, we offer suggestions for selecting an appropriate support strategy in a particular work setting. Finally, we discuss research areas that are still needed to clarify the <b>natural</b> <b>support</b> process. DESCRIPTORS: <b>natural</b> <b>supports,</b> supported em-ployment, co-workers, instructional strategies, culture <b>of</b> work settings <b>Natural</b> <b>supports</b> {{continues to be an}} important issue in the supported employment movement. Although there is still debate over whether <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> is a concept or a strategy (e. g., Butterworth, Hagner, Kier-nan, & Shalock, 1996; Mank, 1996; Test & Wood, 1996 a), and there is limited research about the effec-tiveness of its implementation (Test & Wood, 1996 a), <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> seems to be integrally meshed with supported employment services (Mank, 1996; West, Kregel, Hernandez, & Hock, 1997).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the ways in which}} workplace supports are conceptualized and implemented by four organizations that provide supported employment services. Data were collected during 2 -day site visits at each organization. Site visits included observations at a total of 39 work sites, semistructured interviews with a total of 126 primary stakeholders (supported employees, coworkers, employers/supervisors, and agency employment staff), document analysis (e. g., program descriptions, training and marketing materials), and a brief written survey about supported employment beliefs and practices. The findings indicate that each agency was driven by strong leadership and a cohesive vision and values. Each organization had a history of innova-tion and change. Staff were generally well trained, committed, and professional, and worked collaboratively {{with each other and with}} businesses. The involvement <b>of</b> work-place (or <b>natural)</b> <b>supports</b> was promoted in each organization, but there were a wide variety of interpretations and practices among staff. This article highlights areas with which these organizations struggle, including serving people with high support needs, developing a strong emphasis on person-centered approaches to planning and service delivery, assisting staff to facilitate workplace supports and social relationships, actively involving job seekers in the job search process, and increasing work hours and respon-sibilities of supported employees. ince the beginning of supported employment, integration has been a defining feature of good prac-tice. Both physical and social integration have been considered critical aspects of supported employment. Job coaches or employment consultants have also been a core feature of supported employ-ment. In recent years, the concept <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> has emerged, focusing on the importance of adhering to the typical norms and practices of work-places and tapping supports that exist or can be developed within workplaces. This effort to define, implement, and evaluate <b>natural</b> or workplace <b>supports</b> has addressed the rationale and scope <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> (Nisbet, 1992), the so-cial relationships between supported employees and their coworkers (Chad...|$|R

The interventions within this level are strength-based in that the complexity and intensity of the intervention plans directly reflect the complexity and intensity of the behaviors. Students within the tertiary level continue involvement in primary and secondary intervention programs and receive additional support as well. These supports could include use of full FBA, de-escalation training for the student, heightened use <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> (e.g., family members, friends of the student), and development of a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP).|$|R

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> during {{supported}} employment service delivery {{has emerged as}} a widespread practice of {{supported employment}} providers. Though a number of strategies for using <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> have evolved, evidence is clearly limited which describes the role of the employment specialist or other non-traditional support resources, such as family members, friends, and coworkers when <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> are utilized during supported employment. This investigation focuses on the activities of a supported employment program's initial efforts to document the activities of employment specialists and other non-traditional support providers when an emphasis in placed on using community and workplace supports during the provision of supported employment. Since its inception as a federal/state vocational rehabilitation program with the 1986 Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act (P. L. 99 - 506), supported employment has afforded an in-creasing number of individuals with severe disabilities, previously believed to be unemployable, an opportunity to enter and compete in our nation's work force. The national number of persons participating in supported employment programs has risen from 90, 000 in 1991 to 140, 000 in 1995 (Wehman, Revell, & Kregel, 1997).

40|$|Literature Review Supported {{employment}} {{is a strategy}} used to provide individuals with a learning disability the opportunity to gain and remain in paid employment. There has been criticism of the traditional job coach model of support and so the use <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>supports</b> has become common. <b>Natural</b> <b>support</b> is assistance given by staff, equipment or resources that is typical or culturally appropriate for that workplace. One of the main criticisms of the job coach model was {{that the presence of}} the job coach interfered with the supported employee’s opportunities to become socially included in the workplace. Studies have shown that workplaces where individuals with a learning disability have become socially included have certain cultural characteristics. Other studies have also shown that supported employment personnel have experienced difficulty in implementing <b>natural</b> <b>supports.</b> These results indicate that not all workplaces will fully include a supported employee. This has led to the conclusion that workplace culture should be analysed during the job match process to ensure individuals will be working in supportive environments. Research Proposal The aim of the proposed research is to investigate what perceived value supported employment personnel place on using workplace culture during the job match process. A generic qualitative approach will be used to gain an understanding of participants’ perspectives. Ten supported employment personnel will be chosen to take part in semi-structured interviews with the researcher before participating in a focus group. Data will then be analysed to gain an understanding of current practice in supported employment...|$|R
40|$|Coworker {{perceptions}} of facilitation strategies pro-vided by job coaches, and needed by coworkers, and discrepancies between facilitation strategies provided by job coaches and those {{perceived as being}} needed by co-workers were analyzed {{in relation to the}} types and fre-quency of problems reported to be exhibited by sup-ported employees (N = 83). The results of this prelimi-nary investigation indicated that when the frequency of work problems was low, the majority of the problems resulted in the need for and provision of less intensive facilitation strategies. Coworkers perceived they needed either low or a mixed level of support, not a high level of support, even when the frequency of work problems was high, except when the problems were related to challeng-ing behaviors such as self-injury and property destruc-tion. The most intriguing finding was that job coaches generally used the level of facilitation strategies that matched coworker needs.
