40|$|In a {{study of}} 92 {{patients}} undergoing carotid angiography under general anaesthesia, marked changes in arterial pressure were infrequent. Possible reasons for this include fewer poor-risk patients, a lighter level of anaesthesia involving controlled ventilation, and the replacement of uriodone (<b>Diodone)</b> by less toxic contrast media. There have been relatively few reports concerned with the changes in arterial pressure which may occur during cerebral angiography performed under general anaesthesia, although hypotensive responses, par-ticularly in patients with recent subarachnoid haemorrhage, have been observed by several authors (Brown, 1955; Stark, 1958; Brindle, Gilbert and McGrath, 1965). The hypotension has been attributed variously to {{the condition of the}} patient before operation, and the type and volume of contrast medium injected during angiography. In these earlier reports the anaesthetic technique involved spon-taneous breathing using nitrous oxide in oxygen plus a volatile agent such as trichloroethylene or halothane. During the last decade, the introduction of controlled hyperventilation for neurosurgical operations has resulted in a similar technique gaining widespread acceptance for neuroradiological procedures, and in particular for cerebral angiography. Samuel, Grange and Hawkins (1968) and Dallas and Moxon (1969) have commented on the good quality of the radio-graphs obtained when controlled hyperventilation is used. This has been the standard technique of general anaesthesia in this unit for almost 10 years and it has been our impression that marked decreases in arterial pressure during the procedure (whether carotid or vertebral angiography) were uncommon. In view of the earlier reports concerning the frequency of hypotension, the arterial pressure of 100 patients was monitored carefully before, and during, the investigation.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of inoperability of bronchial carcinoma by angiocardiography has received little attention in this country, {{and it is}} {{the purpose of this paper}} to discuss the value of this investigation by analysing our results in 31 cases at Leicester Chest Unit. Since the introduction of angiocardio-graphy by Robb and Steinberg in 1938 many authors have described its use in the differential diagnosis of lesions of the lungs and mediastinum, but it is not intended to discuss this aspect. The possibility of assessing the operability of bronchial neoplasm by angiocardiography was first suggested by Steinberg, Dotter, and Andrus (1950). Dotter and Steinberg in 1952 gave further details and results of their methods. In addition, Ander-sen, Andersen, Eltorm, Poulsen, Glistrup, and Petersen (1951) mentioned the use of this tech-nique in the {{assessment of}} operability in two cases of bronchial carcinoma and in one case of media-stinal tumour (nodal metastases from a breast carcinoma). TECHNIQUE Angiocardiography was performed in the supine position using an automatic serial changer which permitted eight films to be exposed in 10 seconds. The radiographic factors used were 75 - 85 kV, 300 mA, 0. 1 second with a tube-film distance of 36 in. using a stationary grid. A preliminary film was taken to ensure radiographs of diagnostic quality. The patients were prepared for the inves-tigation with "omnopon " and scopolamine; 50 ml. of the 70 % <b>diodone</b> solution was injected as rapidly as possible through a wide-bore cannula in the ante-cubital vein. No untoward reaction followed the injection in any patient of the series. RADIOLOGY In the angiocardiographic assessment of inoper-ability we have followed the principles of Dotte...|$|E
