Unlike traditional US municipal bonds, which are usually tax exempt, <b>interest</b> <b>received</b> on BABs is subject to federal taxation. However, as with municipal bonds, the bond is tax-exempt within the US state where it is issued. Generally, BABs offer significantly higher yields (over 7 percent) than standard municipal bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Grantor trusts are {{typically}} used in automobile-backed securities and REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits). [...] Grantor trusts {{are very similar}} to pass-through trusts used in the earlier days of securitization. An originator pools together loans and sells them to a grantor trust, which issues classes of securities backed by these loans. [...] Principal and <b>interest</b> <b>received</b> on the loans, after expenses are taken into account, are passed through to the holders of the securities on a pro-rata basis.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an owner}} trust, {{there is more}} {{flexibility}} in allocating principal and <b>interest</b> <b>received</b> to different classes of issued securities. [...] In an owner trust, both interest and principal due to subordinate securities {{can be used to}} pay senior securities. [...] Due to this, owner trusts can tailor maturity, risk and return profiles of issued securities to investor needs. [...] Usually, any income remaining after expenses is kept in a reserve account up to a specified level and then after that, all income is returned to the seller. Owner trusts allow credit risk to be mitigated by over-collateralization by using excess reserves and excess finance income to prepay securities before principal, which leaves more collateral for the other classes.|$|E
2500|$|Social Security {{taxes are}} paid into the Social Security Trust Fund {{maintained}} by the U.S. Treasury (technically, the [...] "Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund", as established by [...] ). Current year expenses are paid from current Social Security tax revenues. When revenues exceed expenditures, as they did between 1983 and 2009, the excess is invested in special series, non-marketable U.S. government bonds. Thus, the Social Security Trust Fund indirectly finances the federal government's general purpose deficit spending. In 2007, the cumulative excess of Social Security taxes and <b>interest</b> <b>received</b> over benefits paid out stood at $2.2 trillion. Some regard the Trust Fund as an accounting construct with no economic significance. Others argue that it has specific legal significance because the Treasury securities it holds are backed by the [...] "full faith and credit" [...] of the U.S. government, which {{has an obligation to}} repay its debt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shape of}} the yield curve {{indicates}} the cumulative priorities of all lenders relative to a particular borrower (such as the US Treasury or the Treasury of Japan), or the priorities of a single lender relative to all possible borrowers. With other factors held equal, lenders will prefer to have funds at their disposal, {{rather than at the}} disposal of a third party. The interest rate is the [...] "price" [...] paid to convince them to lend. As the term of the loan increases, lenders demand an increase in the <b>interest</b> <b>received.</b> In addition, lenders may be concerned about future circumstances, e.g. a potential default (or rising rates of inflation), so they demand higher interest rates on long-term loans than they demand on shorter-term loans to compensate for the increased risk. Occasionally, when lenders are seeking long-term debt contracts more aggressively than short-term debt contracts, the yield curve [...] "inverts", with interest rates (yields) being lower for the longer periods of repayment so that lenders can attract long-term borrowing.|$|E

With the reported criteria (χ 2 [*]=[*] 1491.3, df[*]=[*] 1173, p[*]<[*]. 000; number of estimated model parameters[*]=[*] 115; RMSEA[*]=[*]. 016 (90 % CI [...]. 014 /. 019); CFI[*]=[*]. 968; TLI[*]=[*]. 967), Model 1 was interpreted as suitable and showing a good fit. Self-reported test motivation was found to have a highly significant influence on the test score of [...]. 329 (p[*]<[*]. 001), and a highly significant correlation was found between self-reported test motivation and <b>interest</b> in <b>receiving</b> feedback [. 171; (p[*]<[*]. 001)]. This indicates that participants with a higher level of self-reported test motivation achieved higher scores on the test (H 1). Furthermore, it shows that participants with a generally higher level of self-reported test motivation were more likely to express <b>interest</b> in <b>receiving</b> feedback on their performance on the test (H 3). The correlation between the two indicators of test motivation was weak. Because <b>interest</b> in <b>receiving</b> feedback was coded dichotomously, little variance was found. 18 The very weak correlation between <b>interest</b> in <b>receiving</b> feedback and test scores (. 012; p[*]=[*]. 716) was not significant (H 2).|$|R
