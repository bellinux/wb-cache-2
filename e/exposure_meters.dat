50|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the ASA scale and similar to Weston film speed ratings another manufacturer of photo-electric <b>exposure</b> <b>meters,</b> General Electric, developed its own rating system of so-called General Electric film values (often abbreviated as G-E or GE) around 1937.|$|E
50|$|Weston's son Edward Faraday Weston (1878-1971) {{received}} several patents regarding <b>exposure</b> <b>meters,</b> also manufactured by the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation and widely distributed since the 1930s, and established {{the system of}} the Weston film speed ratings for the measurement of film speeds.|$|E
50|$|APEX made {{exposure}} computation {{a relatively}} simple matter; the foreword of ASA PH2.5-1960 recommended that <b>exposure</b> <b>meters,</b> exposure calculators, and exposure tables be modified to incorporate the logarithmic values that APEX required. In many instances, this was done: the 1973 and 1986 ANSI exposure guides, ANSI PH2.7-1973 and ANSI PH2.7-1986, eliminated exposure calculator dials in favor of tabulated APEX values. However, the logarithmic markings for aperture and shutter speed required to set the computed exposure were never incorporated in consumer cameras. Accordingly, no reference to APEX was made in ANSI PH3.49-1971 (though it {{was included in the}} Appendix). The incorporation of <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> in many cameras in the late 1960s eliminated the need to compute exposure, so APEX saw little actual use.|$|E

50|$|Canon's sudden {{switch from}} professionally {{oriented}} SLR cameras to advanced amateur cameras happened in March 1964 {{when they left}} the Canon Canonflex range and launched the Canon FX with the FL lens mount. It has a built in CdS <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> with a circular window on the right-hand camera front. The Canon FP without <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> was added later the same year. The cameras were well built, but the metering technology was several years behind the Minolta SR-7 which pioneered that technology in 1962. Then just half a year later, in the spring of 1965 Canon surprised the camera community with the remarkable Pellix. The new camera featured the much-expected TTL <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> facility, albeit employing the stop-down metering method.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{tested and}} {{frequently}} published speed ratings for most {{films of the}} time. Weston film speed ratings could since be found on most Weston <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> and were sometimes referred to by film manufactures and third parties in their exposure guidelines. Since manufactures were sometimes creative about film speeds, the company {{went as far as}} to warn users about unauthorized uses of their film ratings in their [...] "Weston film ratings" [...] booklets.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the ASA system, the system of Weston film speed ratings was {{introduced}} by Edward Faraday Weston (1878-1971) and his father Dr. Edward Weston (1850-1936), a British-born electrical engineer, industrialist and founder of the US-based Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation, with the Weston model 617, one of the earliest photo-electric <b>exposure</b> <b>meters,</b> in August 1932. The meter and film rating system were invented by William Nelson Goodwin, Jr., who worked for them and later received a Howard N. Potts Medal for his contributions to engineering.|$|E

Since his company name, Spiratone, had become fairly well known and the Japanese brands were completely unknown, the products that came out of these partnerships were sold under the Spiratone brand and Spira established rigorous quality assurance procedures to ensure that the merchandise that bore his name worked as intended.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{establishment}} of the production plant, preparations began for the immediate shift of the Rollei 35 production to Singapore. Since there were no suppliers in Singapore, all parts had to be manufactured there by Rollei or imported from Japan or Europe. The cameras received the engraving [...] "Made by Rollei Singapore". Now licensed lens production ("Made by Rollei") was used instead of the original Zeiss lenses, as well as Nissei <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> and Copal leaf shutters (both Japanese manufacturers). The retail price fell continuously because of low labor costs. This did not continue to be a noticeable advantage however, because of reduction in the cost of competing cameras, but unlike Rollei, through increasing use of electronics. The Rollei operation in Singapore closed down in 1981.|$|E
50|$|The {{fifth and}} final {{generation}} of folding Retina cameras (with capital-letter B or C suffix) {{was introduced in}} 1957, {{the same year as}} the Type 025 Retina Reflex system. These last Retina folders included the Type 019 Ausf II Retina IB, Type 029 Retina IIC, and Type 028 Retina IIIC. This group had slightly taller top housings, with upgraded single range <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> and the addition of a larger, bright-line viewfinder. The fixed-lens Type 019 Ausf I / Ausf II Retina IB featured an exposure meter, which was not included on the Type 018 Retina Ib. The Type 029 Retina IIC had a rangefinder but no meter though it was also taller housing than the Retina IIc; it was of limited production from 1957 to 1958 and not imported to the USA by Eastman Kodak Co.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} reflected-light <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> were wide-angle, averaging types, {{measuring the}} average scene luminance. Exposure meter calibration {{was chosen to}} result in the “best” exposures for typical outdoor scenes; when measuring a single scene element (such as {{the side of a}} building in open shade), the indicated exposure is in the approximate middle of the film or electronic sensor's exposure range. When measuring a scene with atypical distribution of light and dark elements, or a single element that is lighter or darker than a middle tone, the indicated exposure may not be optimal. For example, a scene with predominantly light tones (e.g., a white horse) often will be underexposed, while a scene with predominantly dark tones (e.g., a black horse) often will be overexposed. That both scenes require the same exposure, regardless of the meter indication, becomes obvious from a scene that includes both a white horse and a black horse. A photographer usually can recognize the difference between a white horse and a black horse; a meter usually cannot. When metering a white horse, a photographer can apply exposure compensation so that the white horse is rendered as white.|$|E

50|$|The <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> uses a {{circular}} CdS cell 8.5 mm in diameter (coverage with 50 mm lens = 21°), {{and having a}} sensitivity of -0 (some estimates claim -1) - 20 Ev at 100 ASA (0.3-0.4 asb at f/1.4 to 200 000 asb; 0,06 to 32.000 cd/m2). Information from the <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is displayed using a dual match needle system {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder. An additional illuminator window at the top of the viewfinder illuminates the readout bar. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> can be set from ISO 6/9° to ISO 3200/36°. The ASA/DIN film speed knob is designed to prevent inadvertent change. The meter's circuit is powered up by winding the camera, and shuts down when the shutter is released. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> required the PX625 1.35 V mercuric oxide coin type cell which was banned because of its mercury content. The M5 continues to run on a number of alternatives including the WeincellTM MRB625. The battery compartment is located between the strap lugs. It is accessed by using a coin slot type threaded cap and is superior in design to that of the bayonet caps that surfaced as of the M6.|$|R
