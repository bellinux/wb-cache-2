6000|$|She {{could not}} have said this two days later--for instance, on Tuesday, when she at last {{received}} a letter from Morris Townsend. It was an epistle of considerable length, measuring five large square pages, and written at Philadelphia. It was an <b>explanatory</b> <b>document,</b> and it explained a great many things, chief among which were the considerations that had led the writer to take advantage of an urgent [...] "professional" [...] absence to try and banish from his mind the image of one whose path he had crossed only to scatter it with ruins. He ventured to expect but partial success in this attempt, but he could promise her that, whatever his failure, he would never again interpose between her generous heart and her brilliant prospects and filial duties. He closed with an intimation that his professional pursuits might compel him to travel for some months, and with the hope that when they should each have accommodated themselves to what was sternly involved in their respective positions--even should this result not be reached for years--they should meet as friends, as fellow-sufferers, as innocent but philosophic victims of a great social law. That her life should be peaceful and happy was the dearest wish of him who ventured still to subscribe himself her most obedient servant. The letter was beautifully written, and Catherine, who kept it for many years after this, was able, when her sense of the bitterness of its meaning and the hollowness of its tone had grown less acute, to admire its grace of expression. At present, {{for a long time after}} she received it, all she had to help her was the determination, daily more rigid, to make no appeal to the compassion of her father.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>explanatory</b> <b>document</b> from Russia's presidential {{administration}} mentioned {{several reasons}} for its original suspension of compliance in 2007. First of all, Russia considered the linkage between the adapted treaty ratification and the withdrawal of troops from Georgia and Moldova as [...] "illegitimate" [...] and [...] "invented". Russia also considered the troop-withdrawal issue a bilateral Russia-Georgia and Russia-Moldova issue, not a NATO-Russia issue. Secondly, the three Baltic states, which border Russia {{unlike the rest of}} NATO (excluding Poland and Norway), were not covered under the original CFE treaty as they were still part of the Soviet Union when the treaty was signed. Also, the Baltic states like all NATO members did not ratify the adapted CFE treaty. Russia's wish for a speedy ratification and accession of the Baltic states to a ratified treaty, hoping to restrict emergency deployments of NATO forces there, was not fulfilled.|$|E
5000|$|Most likely, but not {{mentioned}} in Russia's <b>explanatory</b> <b>document,</b> the above-mentioned [...] "extraordinary circumstances" [...] referred to the US plans for a missile defense complex in Poland, with a radar component in the Czech Republic. Another likely reason is that NATO members refused to ratify the Adapted CFE Treaty due to the continuing presence of several hundred Russian troops in Moldova—something they considered {{as a violation of}} the obligations Russia assumed during the 1999 Istanbul summit. However, there was no legal connection between the Adapted CFE treaty and the Russian withdrawal from Georgia and Moldova. The linkage between these two security issues was a decision made by NATO member states to protest against the Second Chechen War and was used as a reason not to ratify the treaty. Russia never accepted this decision - a decision also made six months after the Istanbul summit. Russia also considered the original CFE treaty to be outdated and strategically flawed as it did {{not take into account the}} dissolutions of the Warsaw Treaty or the Soviet Union.|$|E

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to examine the main incentives that encourage {{the development of a}} shared language and procedures. After analyzing the interviews with various stakeholders, we determined that the acquisition of a common language and methods rests on three main pillars. First, the creation of institutional tools of various types allows parties to propose a vocabulary and processes that can be shared with organizations in their network. For example, some organizations developed a video explaining their particular response methods to inform other members of their network. Some government organizations also favor the production and publication of <b>explanatory</b> <b>documents</b> on good practices in their area of activity and on the related regulations. This approach contributes to the proposal and diffusion of a particular language that organizations want to share.|$|R

40|$|We are {{interested}} in building and maintaining semantic nets in general, and hierarchical semantic nets in particular. In [Mili, 1988], we developed a model of hierarchical semantic nets that generalizes taxonomic models by replacing the concept of property inheritance by a more general behavior of properties that we called regularity [Mili & Rada, 1990 a]. We are also interested in the generation of structured documents from hypertext. We argue that authors structure their descriptive documents based on personal but systematic traversals of {{a model of the}} domain of discourse [Mili & Rada, 1990 b]; when that model consists of a semantic net that exhibits regularity, the traversal can be rationalized and described concisely. Within the context of our research, we acquired an electronic copy of the Cyc knowledge base [Lenat & Guha, 1990] to: 1) use the semantic net underlying Cyc to support the generation of argumentative and <b>explanatory</b> <b>documents,</b> and 2) identify regularity patterns. Interestingly, the sheer size and richness of Cyc posed challenging performance problems to its designers, who had to constrain proof and inference procedures {{in such a way as}} to make it ill-adapted to the kind of open-ended lengthy logical inferences required for generation of argumentative text. The study of regularity patterns in Cyc led us to generalize the concept of regularity, and to formulate a number of hypotheses about the semantic structure of Cyc, and of common sense knowledge in general, proving once more that regularity is a powerful tool for managing the complexity of large knowledge bases...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{analysis}} {{presented in this article}} is the legal context and political debates regarding access of illegal migrants to health care assistance and institutions of public health. Consequences of non-regulated legal status significantly impair or even deny illegal migrants the most basic access to medical care. The main condition of entitlement to specialized medical care is legal residence within a state in accordance with its legal provisions. Fearing a growth in illegal migration and increased expenditure, EU countries are not interested in extending social benefits to irregular migrants. Fearing deportation, dismissal from work and the enormous costs of private health care, they usually do not ask for professional medical assistance. By analyzing the most important health risks for migrants the author has also highlighted the current legal and political debates on this issue. Lawful residence based on migration status and rules governing the welfare state must be coordinated with migrants' access to health care on the basis of universality and non-discrimination. In many EU countries such as Sweden and Denmark, the right of undocumented migrants to free emergency care and more advanced health care is restricted and may be subject to payment. Examining international treaties and <b>explanatory</b> <b>documents</b> from the Council of Europe and the United Nations, I try to analyze relevant international laws affecting several groups of undocumented migrants concerning the right to health and access to health care institutions. This article also highlights activities undertaken in recent years by NGOs with the aim of establishing access to health for undocumented migrants in EU countries and placing this issue on the international agenda...|$|R
40|$|The {{developing}} {{national and}} global information infrastructures (NII/GII) {{are being built}} upon the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) telecommunications protocol and associated protocol standards. These protocols are themselves under development through the telecommunications standards process defined by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which as a body is sanctioned by the United Nations. All telecommunications manufacturers use these standards to create products that can interoperate. The ITU has recognized the ATM Forum as the instrument {{for the development of}} ATM protocols. This forum is a consortium of industry, academia, and government entities formed to quickly develop standards for the ATM infrastructure. However, because the participants represent a predominately terrestrial network viewpoint, the use of satellites in the national and global information infrastructures could be severely compromised. Consequently, through an ongoing task order, the NASA Lewis Research Center asked Sterling Software, Inc., to communicate with the ATM Forum in support of the interoperability of satellite-terrestrial networks. This year, Dr. Raj Jain of the Ohio State University, under contract to Sterling, authored or coauthored 32 <b>explanatory</b> <b>documents</b> delivered to the ATM Forum in the areas of Guaranteed Frame Rate for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Available Bit Rate, performance testing, Variable Bit Rate voice over ATM, TCP over Unspecified Bit Rate+, Virtual Source/Virtual Destination, and network management.
