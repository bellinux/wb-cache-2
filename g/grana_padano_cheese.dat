5000|$|The museum, set in {{a medieval}} castle {{in the village of}} Castelbosco, was created by a local dairy farmer whose herd of 2,500 (some reports say 3,500) cows produce 30,000 L of milk a day, which is used to make <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese.</b> The cows also produce around 100,000 kg of dung, which is {{transformed}} into methane, fertiliser for the fields, as well as raw material for plaster and bricks. [...] The dung is used to generate power to run the operation. The museum has a symbiotic relationship with the farm and cheesemaking facility.

50|$|The two best-known {{examples}} of grana-type cheeses are Parmigiano-Reggiano and <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano.</b> The two <b>cheeses</b> are broadly similar, {{with the latter}} being less sharp, crumbly and grainy.|$|R
50|$|Like Parmigiano Reggiano, <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> is a semi-fat {{hard cheese}} which is cooked and ripened slowly {{for at least}} nine months. If it passes quality tests, it is fire-branded with the <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> trademark. The cows are milked twice a day, the milk is left to stand, and then {{partially}} skimmed. Milk produced in the evening is skimmed to remove the surface layer of cream and mixed with fresh milk produced in the morning. The partly skimmed milk is transferred into copper kettles and coagulated; the resulting curd is cut to produce granules {{with the size of}} rice grains, which gives the cheese its characteristic texture, and then warmed to 53 - 56 C. It is produced year-round and the quality can vary seasonally as well as by year. Though similar to Parmigiano Reggiano <b>cheese,</b> the younger <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheeses</b> are less crumbly, milder and less complex in flavor than their better known, longer-aged relative.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{modifications}} of water-matrix interactions in <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> (GP) <b>cheese</b> were studied using thermogravimetric techniques {{in order to}} provide an index of ripening. These techniques represent a simple and rapid method for determining water content and for monitoring its behaviour in ripening GP cheese. It is possible to evaluate the quantity of water present in the matrix, as well as the different types of water bound to it both qualitatively and quantitatively. Samples of traditional GP cheese produced in the winter season (same day), and collected at different ripening stages (5, 10, 14, 19 months), were investigated. When statistical models of the STARMAX (Space Time Autoregressive Moving Average exogenous variables) class, augmented with surface trends, were fitted to thermoanalytical data, valuable insights into the chemical nature of the ripening were acheived with good predictive performances.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that some tripeptides (mainly valyl-prolyl-proline and isoleucyl-prolyl-proline), {{originating}} from the degradation of milk proteins by proteinases from L. helveticus, has sustained ACE–inhibiting activity and significant antihypertensive effect in SHR. (Yamamoto et al., 1994). The Grana Padano, a typical Italian cow-milk based cheese, at moderate ripening degree (9 - 12 months), showed a potent (as measured by the spectrophotometric assay) in-vitro ACE-inhibitory effect. (Rossi et al, 2009) In this study we evaluate whether a daily dietary integration {{with a small amount of}} <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese</b> effectively reduced blood pressure (BP). In a randomized, open-label, controlled study, 45 hypertensive patients received a daily dose of 30 grams <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese</b> during a period of 2 months. BP was evaluated before and after treatment by using conventional sphygmomanometric, automated office BP (BpTRU) and ambulatory BP measurements (Takeda, 4220). The results have been compared with those obtained in a homogeneous control group of 15 hypertensive patients. Pharmacological treatments excluded ACE-inhibitors and ARB. A dietary manipulation was performed to maintain unchanged calorie, cholesterol and sodium intake. Preliminary results indicate that the patients who received Grana Padano presented with a statistically significant reduction of systolic and diastolic BP (p< 0. 05, Student’s t test), while no change was detected in the control group. No change in LDL-cholesterol, Calcium, Magnesium serum levels and urinary sodium excretion was observed at the end of treatment period. In conclusion, a moderate intake of mildly seasoned <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese</b> seems to be effective in lowering BP in hypertensive patients.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the possible correlation between egg protein allergy in paediatric age and sensitization to egg lysozyme, used for the preparation of <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese.</b> Methods The tolerability of <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese</b> has been evaluated in paediatric patients allergic to egg proteins through an oral provocation test with increasing amounts of cheese containing, or not, lysozyme at 12 months and 24 months of aging. Results When lysozyme sensitized children received 12 -months aged and lysozyme-containing cheese, several immediate and late adverse reactions such as itching, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, dermatitis, rhinitis, bronchial asthma, urticaria, angioedema, were seen in 5 out of 21 subjects; only 1 out of 21 children showed an adverse reaction after challenge with 24 -months ripened lysozyme-containing cheese. Conclusions There is a possible relationship between the severity of allergic reactions and the lysozyme-specific IgE level in blood. In particular vomiting, hypotension and abdominal pain were present when IgE level was higher than 7 kU/L. A ripening time of 24 months may reduce allergy problems when lysozyme-containing cheese is given to sensitized subjects, probably due to the hydrolysis of antigenic epitopes during aging...|$|E

The characteristics of milk including its clotting ability evaluated with modern procedure based on near infrared technology was considered with the aim to develop an equation to predict yield of PDO <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese.</b> Twenty nine raw milk samples were collected monthly (from July to October 2008). For each sampling, milk was put in 2 tanks for creaming and was divided into copper vats to obtain PDO <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese.</b> Samples were representative of the collected milk daily used in an Italian cheese making factory; they were evaluated for: fat and caseins percentage, αs 1, β and k-casein amount, α-lactoalbumin and β-lattoglobulin concentration (determined by official methods of analysis), protein amount (as the sum of serum protein and casein concentration) and for the aptitude to coagulate (measured by Optigraph, Ysebaert Dairy Division, Frepillon-France) based on NIR principles (measure at 890 nm).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of {{chemical}} composition, coagulation properties, pH, and titratable acidity (TA, SH°/ 50 ml) of vat milk on <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese</b> yield (CY) under field conditions. Twelve cheese-making sessions were carried out from February to December 2009 in a dairy cooperative of Grana Padano Consortium (Italy), for a total of 96 vats of milk processed. For each vat, samples of raw milk were collected and analysed for quality traits (fat, protein, and casein contents), pH, TA, and milk coagulation properties (MCP), measured as rennet coagulation time (RCT, min), curd-firming time (k 20, min), and curd firmness (a 30, mm). Cheese yield was expressed as kilograms of cheese per 100 kg milk transformed, and was measured after 2 d of drainage. Fat, protein, and casein contents were positively and strongly correlated with CY (coefficients of correlation, r= 0 · 72, 0 · 88, and 0 · 84, respectively; P< 0 · 001). Coagulation properties were moderately and significantly (P< 0 · 001) related to CY: milk that coagulated earlier and had stronger a 30 was associated to greater CY. Cheese yield was analysed with a model that accounted for fixed effects of cheese-making day, fat and protein content, TA, and a 30. Significance was found for all the effects (P< 0 · 05). Milk characterised by high values of a 30 resulted in higher CY than milk with low values of a 30, indicating that MCP could be used as indicators of cheese-making efficiency. Future research should investigate the relationships between MCP and quality of cheese, and explore the feasibility of including MCP in multiple component milk pricing system for <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese</b> production...|$|E

The main objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of hot season on milk protein fractions and cheesemaking properties of milk for <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese</b> production. The study was carried out in a dairy farm with a cheese factory for transforming the milk to <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> <b>cheese.</b> The study was carried out from June 2012 to May 2013. Temperature and relative humidity of the inside barn were recorded daily during the study period using 8 electronic data loggers programmed to record every 30 min. Constant managerial conditions were maintained during the experimental periods. During the experimental period, feed and diet characteristics, milk yield, and milk characteristics were recorded in summer (from June 29 to July 27, 2012), winter (from January 25 to March 8, 2013), and spring (from May 17 to May 31, 2013). Milk yield was recorded and individual milk samples were taken from 25 cows selected in each season during the p. m. milking. Content of fat, proteins, caseins (CN), lactose and somatic cell count (SCC), titratable acidity, and milk rennet coagulation properties were determined on fresh samples. Milk protein fraction concentrations were determined by the sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. Data were tested for nonnormality by the Shapiro-Wilk test. In case of nonnormality, parameters were normalized by log or exponential transformation. The data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA using a mixed model procedure. For all the main milk components (fat, protein, total solids, and solids-not-fat), the lowest values were observed in the summer and the greatest values were observed in the winter. Casein fractions, with the exception of Î³-CN, showed the lowest values in the summer and the greatest values in the winter. The content of IgG and serum albumin was greater in summer than in the winter and spring. A mild effect of season was observed for milk SCC, with greater values in summer than in the winter and spring. A worsening of milk coagulation properties was observed in summer season. The alteration of cheesemaking properties during hot season seems strictly linked with changes of milk protein fractions mainly with the decrease of Î±S-CN and Î²-CN and the increase of undefined proteins...|$|E
