25|$|The rails were {{delivered}} by boat to Bideford Quay by the S.S. Snipe in May 1898 and the sleepers also {{arrived at the}} quay, coming from West Hartlepool in September. Wood blocks were used on the quay, flush with the road surface to <b>deaden</b> the noise, as was the practice on roads with heavy horse and cart traffic in many places. The wood became very slippery and caused accidents in wet weather, the company not always being as careful with the application of sand and gravel {{as it should have}} been.|$|E

25|$|Given this history, and the {{antiseptic}} properties {{known to}} creosote, it became popular among physicians in the 19th century. A dilution of creosote in water {{was sold in}} pharmacies as Aqua creosoti, {{as suggested by the}} previous use of pyroligneous acid. It was prescribed to quell the irritability of the stomach and bowels and detoxify, treat ulcers and abscesses, neutralize bad odors, and stimulate the mucous tissues of the mouth and throat. Creosote in general was listed as an irritant, styptic, antiseptic, narcotic, and diuretic, and in small doses when taken internally as a sedative and anaesthetic. It was used to treat ulcers, and as a way to sterilize the tooth and <b>deaden</b> the pain in case of a tooth-ache.|$|E
25|$|To {{create the}} ruby slippers, the shoes were dyed red, then {{burgundy}} sequined organza overlays {{were attached to}} each shoe's upper and heel. The film's early three-strip Technicolor process required the sequins to be darker than most red sequins found today; bright red sequins would have appeared orange on screen. Two weeks {{before the start of}} shooting, Adrian added butterfly-shaped red strap leather bows. Each of the Art Deco-inspired bows had three large, rectangular, red-glass jewels with dark red bugle beads, outlined in red glass rhinestones in silver settings. The stones and beads were sewn to the bows, then to the organza-covered shoe. Three pairs of the surviving slippers had orange felt glued to their soles to <b>deaden</b> the sound of Garland dancing on the Yellow Brick Road.|$|E
25|$|Later, Lensky mischievously invites Onegin to Tatyana's name day celebration {{promising}} a small gathering with just Tatyana, Olga, and their parents. When Onegin arrives, he finds instead a boisterous country ball, a rural parody of and {{contrast to the}} society balls of St. Petersburg he has grown tired of. Onegin is irritated with the guests who gossip about him and Tatyana, and with Lensky for persuading him to come. He decides to avenge himself by dancing and flirting with Olga. Olga is insensitive to her fiancé and apparently attracted to Onegin. Earnest and inexperienced, Lensky is wounded to the core and challenges Onegin to fight a duel; Onegin reluctantly accepts, feeling compelled by social convention. During the duel, Onegin unwillingly kills Lensky. Afterwards, he quits his country estate, traveling abroad to <b>deaden</b> his feelings of remorse.|$|E

25|$|In both {{town and}} country, {{means of access}} between the main house and the servant's wings were kept to a minimum, often the single door would be lined with green baize to <b>deaden</b> any sound. Long and {{complicated}} passages linking kitchens with dining rooms were devised; in some houses the tortuous route through corridors and staircases from kitchen to dining room could be an eighth of a mile – an absence of cooking smells taking priority over hot food. Even the doors linking to the connecting corridors would be covered by screens, sometimes disguised as bookcases with dummy books, or just simply covered in the same wallpaper as that with which the room was decorated, as the existence of servants {{was not to be}} acknowledged. Cleaning had to be performed {{in the early hours of}} the morning while the employers were asleep, and in the grander houses only male servants were allowed to be visible, and then only when required.|$|E
500|$|On 17 December, the {{day before}} Quest was due to leave Rio, Shackleton fell ill. He may have {{suffered}} a heart attack; Macklin was called, but Shackleton refused to be examined and declared himself [...] "better" [...] the next morning. On the ensuing voyage to South Georgia he was, from the accounts of his shipmates, unusually subdued and listless. He also began drinking champagne each morning, [...] "to <b>deaden</b> the pain", contrary to his normal rule of not allowing liquor at sea. A severe storm ruined the expedition's proposed Christmas celebrations, and a new problem with the engine's steam furnace slowed progress and caused Shackleton further stress. By 1 January 1922, the weather had abated: [...] "Rest and calm after the storm – the year has begun kindly for us", wrote Shackleton in his diary.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Law, in {{a review}} {{published}} in the Gerry Anderson-centric fanzine Andersonic, considers The Day After Tomorrow an [...] "oddity" [...] and an [...] "uncharacteristically lacklustre entry in the Anderson canon", commenting that the programme [...] "cracks along at a fair old pace, but the educational content does tend to <b>deaden</b> {{the first half of}} the story and limits the room for character development." [...] Although he credits the production for [...] "getting its science lesson across in a superficial way", he expresses a negative view of the narration, remarking that [...] "at times Ed [...] comes across like a presenter of one of those old schools programmes from the 70s, just imparting a string of dry facts." [...] He believes that Jane is the only character who develops over the course of the special. The adults, by contrast, are [...] "pretty much peripheral", while David can be considered a [...] "miniature Spock" [...] who [...] "lurks around the ship either brandishing his slide rule, threatening to calculate something, or staring out of the porthole (a nice touch!) dribbling about pulsars." ...|$|E

50|$|A stripped-out {{interior}} {{devoid of}} power windows or seats, rear seats, air conditioning, cruise control, sound <b>deadening</b> or a stereo system (optionally fitted) and new racing-bucket front seats {{were part of}} the package. The trunk hood was made of aluminum, the chassis was seam welded and sound <b>deadening</b> was deleted. Wheels were made of magnesium and the glass was thinner in the doors and rear window. The Carrera RS is approximately 345 pounds (155 kg) lighter than the US version Carrera 2 model. Also available were a heavier Touring variant (with sound <b>deadening,</b> power seats (optional), undercarriage protection and power windows) and an N/GT racing variant with a stripped, blank metal interior and a roll cage. They also came with optional lights on the visors.|$|R

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{believes}} Schopenhauer's ethical {{point of}} view is that the individual succeeds in seeing through the wretchedness of existence and then decides to <b>deaden</b> or mortify the joy of life. As a result of this complete asceticism, one reaches contemplation: the individual does this out of sympathy. He sympathizes with all the misery and the misery of others, which is to exist. Kierkegaard here is probably referring to the pessimistic nature of Schopenhauer's philosophy. One of Kierkegaard's main concerns is a suspicion of his whole philosophy: ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the fall}} of 1769, Ebenezer Zane {{explored}} the Wheeling area and established claim to the land via [...] "tomahawk rights." [...] (This process meant to <b>deaden</b> a few trees near {{the head of a}} spring, and mark the bark with the initials of the name of the person who made the claim). He returned the following spring with his wife Elizabeth and his younger brothers, Jonathan and Silas; they established the first permanent European settlement in the Wheeling area, naming it Zanesburg. Other families joined the settlement, including the Shepherds (see Monument Place), the Wetzels, and the McCollochs (see McColloch's Leap).|$|E
2500|$|Explicitly {{addressing}} {{the question of}} inability to believe, Pascal argues that if the Wager is valid, the inability to believe is irrational, and therefore must be caused by feelings: [...] "your inability to believe, because reason compels you to [...] and yet you cannot, [...] from your passions." [...] This inability, therefore, can be overcome by diminishing these irrational sentiments: [...] "Learn from those who were bound like you[...] [...] [...] Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and <b>deaden</b> your acuteness.—'But this is what I am afraid of.'—And why?

2500|$|As {{a pioneer}} in radio broadcasting, KDKA {{struggled}} in particular with studio acoustics, especially for large groups of performers. An early attempt to broadcast a concert by Westinghouse employees from a local auditorium found that the sensitive microphones picked up echoes from the walls, causing severe distortion. Moving the performers outdoors eliminated the echoing, so a tent was erected on the building roof, {{and for a time}} concerts were performed from this location. Eventually the tent was blown down in a storm, so it was moved indoors, where it was found the tent material helped <b>deaden</b> the echoes. This led to modern studio design, including walls covered with noise-absorbing material, initially [...] "monks cloth" [...] (which {{turned out to be a}} fancy name for burlap).|$|E
2500|$|Attaching a small metal, rubber, leather, or wooden {{device called}} a mute, or sordino, {{to the bridge}} of the violin gives a softer, more mellow tone, with fewer audible overtones; the sound of an entire orchestral string section playing with mutes has a hushed quality. The {{conventional}} Italian markings for mute usage are con sord., or con sordina, meaning 'with mute'; and senza sord., meaning 'without mute'; or via sord., meaning 'mute off'. Larger metal, rubber, or wooden mutes are widely available, known as practice mutes or hotel mutes. [...] Such mutes are generally not used in performance, but are used to <b>deaden</b> the sound of the violin in practice areas such as hotel rooms. (For practicing purposes there is also the mute violin, a violin without a sound box.) Some composers have used practice mutes for special effect, for example, at the end of Luciano Berio's Sequenza VIII for solo violin.|$|E
2500|$|The strongest drug in {{the early}} Tour de France was strychnine. Other than that, riders would take {{anything}} to survive the tedium, {{the pain and the}} exhaustion of stages that could last more than 300km. That included alcohol, which was already strong in French culture and sometimes purer than water after World War I destroyed water pipes and polluted water tables, and ether. There are photographs of riders holding ether-soaked handkerchiefs to their mouths, or leaving them knotted under the chin so the fumes would <b>deaden</b> the pain in their legs. The smell, enough to turn a man's stomach said Pierre Chany, discouraged some but also showed the extent of suffering by others. Roger Lapébie, winner of the Tour in 1937, said he smelled ether [...] "in the bunch near the finish; it used to be taken in a little bottle called a topette." [...] Its use lasted decades; riders were caught using it as late as 1963.|$|E
