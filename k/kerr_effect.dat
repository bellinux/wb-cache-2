25|$|Now let us assume we have {{a medium}} that shows only {{nonlinear}} <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect</b> but its refractive index {{does not depend on}} frequency: such a medium does not exist, but it's worth considering it to understand the different effects.|$|E
25|$|After Zeeman {{passed the}} {{qualification}} exams in 1885, he studied {{physics at the}} University of Leiden under Kamerlingh Onnes and Hendrik Lorentz. In 1890, even before finishing his thesis, he became Lorentz's assistant. This allowed him {{to participate in a}} research programme on the <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect.</b> In 1893 he submitted his doctoral thesis on the <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect,</b> the reflection of polarized light on a magnetized surface. After obtaining his doctorate he went for half a year to Friedrich Kohlrausch's institute in Strasbourg. In 1895, after returning from Strasbourg, Zeeman became Privatdozent in mathematics and physics in Leiden. The same year he married Johanna Elisabeth Lebret (1873–1962); they had three daughters and one son.|$|E
25|$|Coming back to {{the first}} picture, we see that the two effects {{introduce}} a change in frequency in two different opposite directions. It is possible to make a pulse so that the two effects will balance each other. Considering higher frequencies, linear dispersion will tend to let them propagate faster, while nonlinear <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect</b> will slow them down. The overall effect will be that the pulse does not change while propagating: such pulses are called temporal solitons.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe χ(3) {{nonlinear}} {{properties of}} slotted hybrid silicon photonic waveguides infiltrated with third-order nonlinear materials (NM) are studied by modelling the self-phase modulation (SPM). The broadness {{and intensity of}} SPM spectrum are investigated through nonlinear FOM TPA optimization to inhibit the detrimental two-photo absorption in slot waveguides, which demonstrates slot waveguides with higher FOM TPA could perform as wide but much more intense broadened spectrum than those with low FOM TPA, even though high FOM TPA slot waveguides intrinsically have larger effective mode areas, namely weaker <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects.</b> This study will draw attention to future nonlinear optimization of hybrid silicon waveguides to make balance between effective mode areas related <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects</b> and FOM TPA related TPA inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Rotation of {{polarization}} {{of light on}} transmission and reflection at materials with time-reversal breaking (Faraday and <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects,</b> respectively) have been studied for over a hundred years. We add to such phenomena by studying optical properties of magneto-chiral states which are loop currents with topological Hall effect. These break time-reversal and are chiral but the product of chirality and time-reversal is preserved. Qualitatively new features arise in reflection and transmission through such a state. This state is shown to be induced in underdoped cuprates given the observed magneto-electric loop-current order in cuprates and certain other specified condition. These results explain the observation of <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects</b> with unusual properties in the underdoped cuprates and help further confirm {{the nature of the}} symmetry breaking in underdoped cuprates...|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} applied scheme {{to achieve a}} tunable index of refraction is electro-optical tuning. Here the change in refractive index is proportional to either the applied electric field, or {{is proportional to the}} square modulus of the electric field. These are the Pockels <b>effect</b> and <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects,</b> respectively.|$|R
25|$|In 1896, {{three years}} after {{submitting}} his thesis on the <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect,</b> he disobeyed the direct orders of his supervisor and used laboratory equipment to measure the splitting of spectral lines by a strong magnetic field. He was fired for his efforts, but he was later vindicated: he won the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of what has now {{become known as the}} Zeeman effect. As an extension of his thesis research, he began investigating the effect of magnetic fields on a light source. He discovered that a spectral line is split into several components {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. Lorentz first heard about Zeeman's observations on Saturday 31 October 1896 at the meeting of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam, where these results were communicated by Kamerlingh Onnes. The next Monday, Lorentz called Zeeman into his office and presented him with an explanation of his observations, based on Lorentz's theory of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E

40|$|Beams that {{experience}} third-harmonic generation (THG) also experience <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects.</b> With <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects,</b> beams {{do not take}} simple Gaussian shapes, but exhibit nonlinear dynamics. These nonlinear dynamics {{have an effect on}} the THG accumulated by focusing and then diverging beams. We formulate a self-consistent and complete set of nonlinear Schroedinger equations for a pair of coupled beams [...] a fundamental and its third-harmonic. Numerical simulations show that the Kerr nonlinearities allow some third-harmonic to propagate to the far-field even for zero or negative phase-mismatch. This is because the nonlinear dynamics break the beams' reflection symmetry about the focal plane and therefore increases far-field THG by changing some of the interference from destructive to constructive. THG conversion efficiencies are computed as functions of several beam parameters. Comment: About 6 pages. 7 Figures. Accepted to Physical Review...|$|R

Self-organisation and pattern formation {{due to a}} combination of electromagnetically induced transparency, close-to-resonance <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects</b> and diffraction is demonstrated. Self-focusing in the peaks of the resulting Turing pattern leads to localised amplification of the input pump.

2500|$|In {{the absence}} of active stabilization, the {{repetition}} rate and carrier–envelope offset frequency {{would be free to}} drift.

50|$|High {{frequency}} (5 MHz-1 GHz) {{electromagnetic fields}} {{can be detected}} by induced nonlinear effects in fiber with a suitable structure. The fiber used is designed such that the Faraday and <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects</b> cause considerable phase change {{in the presence of}} the external field. With appropriate sensor design, this type of fiber can be used to measure different electrical and magnetic quantities and different internal parameters of fiber material.|$|R
2500|$|In high {{repetition}} rate Ti:sapphire ring lasers, which often use double-chirped mirrors to control dispersion, modulation of the pump power using an acousto-optic modulator {{is often used}} to control the offset frequency. [...] The phase slip depends strongly on the <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect,</b> and by changing the pump power one changes the peak intensity of the laser pulse and thus the size of the Kerr phase shift. This shift is far smaller than 6 rad, so an additional device for coarse adjustment is needed. A pair of wedges, one moving in or out of the intra-cavity laser beam can be used for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out to analyse the effect of high {{frequency}} (20nbsp&MHz-1nbsp&GHz) external magnetic field induced nonlinear <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect</b> on Single mode optical fibre of considerable length (50–100nbsp&m) to compensate group velocity dispersion (GVD) and subsequent [...] evolution of soliton pulse ( [...] peak energy, narrow, secant hyperbolic pulse). [...] Generation of soliton pulse in fibre is an obvious conclusion as self phase modulation due to high energy of pulse offset GVD, whereas the evolution length is 2000nbsp&km. (the laser wavelength chosen greater than 1.3 micrometers). Moreover, peak soliton pulse is of period 1–3nbsp&ps so that it [...] is safely accommodated in the optical bandwidth. Once soliton pulse is generated it is least dispersed over thousands of kilometres length of fibre limiting the number of repeater stations.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{variation of}} four-wave-mixing-based frequency combs {{is known as}} Kerr frequency comb. Here, a single laser is coupled into a microresonator (such as a microscopic glass disk that has whispering-gallery modes). This kind of structure naturally has a series of resonant modes with approximately equally spaced frequencies (similar to a Fabry–Pérot interferometer). Unfortunately the resonant modes are not exactly equally spaced due to dispersion. Nevertheless, the four-wave mixing effect above can create and stabilize a perfect frequency comb in such a structure. Basically, the system generates a perfect comb that overlaps the resonant modes as much as possible. In fact, nonlinear effects can shift the resonant modes to improve the overlap with the perfect comb even more. (The resonant mode frequencies depend on refractive index, which is altered by the optical <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect.)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} Raman and Kerr gain in crystalline microresonators and determine the conditions required to generate modelocked frequency combs. We show theoretically that strong, narrowband Raman gain determines a maximum microresonator size allowable to achieve comb formation. We verify this condition experimentally in diamond and silicon microresonators and show that there exists a competition between Raman and <b>Kerr</b> <b>effects</b> {{that leads to the}} existence of two different comb states...|$|R

The <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect</b> is distinct from the Pockels effect in that the induced index change is directly proportional to the square of the electric field instead of varying linearly with it.

50|$|Kerr's most {{important}} experimental work was {{the discovery of}} double refraction in solid and liquid dielectrics in an electrostatic field (1875) and of the so-called <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect.</b> In the <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect,</b> a change in refractive index {{is proportional to the}} square of the electric field. Where the relationship is linear, the effect is known as the Pockels effect. Kerr also demonstrated a similar phenomenon for magnetic fields, and it is now called the magneto-optic <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect.</b> Light from lasers allows the achievement of the effect using the light's own electric field, the AC <b>Kerr</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
