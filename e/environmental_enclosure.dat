2500|$|The {{insulation}} was {{cut away}} for additional inspection, revealing two additional 9-inch metal cracks {{on either side}} of an underlying structural rib called [...] "stringer S-7-2". NASA managers then decided to cut away additional foam and observed two more cracks on a stringer known as S-6-2 adjacent to the two original cracks. They were found on the far left of removed foam on the flange area between the intertank and the liquid oxygen tank. However, these cracks appeared to have suffered less stress than the others found. No cracks were found in stringers on the right side. NASA suspected the use of a lightweight aluminum-lithium alloy in the tanks contributed to the crack problem. Repairs commenced while the shuttle remained on the pad. [...] An <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure</b> was erected around the known damage site to facilitate the ongoing repairs and eventually to apply fresh foam insulation. On 18 November, as part of the repairs, technicians installed new sections of metal, called [...] "doublers" [...] because they are twice as thick as the original stringer metal providing additional strength, to replace the two cracked stringers on Discoverys external tank.|$|E

By integrating the Raman micro-spectrometer with an <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure,</b> RMS {{can be used for}} non-invasive monitoring time-dependent molecular changes in live cells and can provide on-line information regarding the cells and their phenotypic characteristics. RMS may be a useful technique for monitoring bioprocesses and help the refinement and standardisation of differentiation protocols to induce the efficient differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Such non-invasive techniques are needed to help overcoming the current bottlenecks in the manufacturing and quality assessment of stem cell populations, which are key factors for the future advancement and widespread clinical use of regenerative medicine therapies. In addition, information regarding molecular changes during differentiation can advance the understanding of stem cell differentiation and the development of in vitro models for embryo development. RMS can also provide an invaluable platform for further fundamental studies on stem cells and the effect of various stimuli on their differentiation (eg. mechanical stimulation for osteoblasts), as well as in-vitro testing of new pharmaceuticals on cell models.|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} wireless acoustic {{measurement system}} (WAMS) {{is one of}} two main subsystems of the Acoustic Prediction/ Measurement Tool, which comprises software, acoustic instrumentation, and electronic hardware combined to afford integrated capabilities for predicting and measuring noise emitted by rocket and jet engines. The other main subsystem is described in the article on page 8. The WAMS includes analog acoustic measurement instrumentation and analog and digital electronic circuitry combined with computer wireless local-area networking to enable (1) measurement of sound-pressure levels at multiple locations in the sound field of an engine under test and (2) recording and processing of the measurement data. At each field location, the measurements are taken by a portable unit, denoted a field station. There are ten field stations, each of which can take two channels of measurements. Each field station is equipped with two instrumentation microphones, a micro- ATX computer, a wireless network adapter, an <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure,</b> a directional radio antenna, and a battery power supply. The <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure</b> shields the computer from weather and from extreme acoustically induced vibrations. The power supply is based on a marine-service lead-acid storage battery that has enough capacity to support operation for as long as 10 hours. A desktop computer serves as a control server for the WAMS. The server is connected to a wireless router for communication with the field stations via a wireless local-area network that complies with wireless-network standard 802. 11 b of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The router and the wireless network adapters are controlled by use of Linux-compatible driver software. The server runs custom Linux software for synchronizing the recording of measurement data in the field stations. The software includes a module that provides an intuitive graphical user interface through which an operator at the control server can control the operations of the field stations for calibration and for recording of measurement data.

40|$|Scanning beam {{interference}} lithography (SBIL) is {{a technique}} developed at MIT in 2003. The SBIL system, {{referred to as the}} Nanoruler, could fabricate grating patterns with around ten-nanometer phase repeatability. There were many factors which limit its precision and thus limit its utility for applications which require more precise phase control. In this thesis the main sources of error impairing the Nanoruler's patterning precision, which include thermal error of the <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure</b> and the measurement error of a critical mirror in the stage interferometry system, have been identified. A digital PI-lead compensation controller has been designed to improve the air temperature stability of the <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure.</b> A digital low-pass filter is utilized to reduce high spatial-frequency noise in the stage mirror non-flatness measurement. A factor that causes another kind of the mirror measurement error, which is an apparent location-dependent mirror non-flatness measurement, has been determined. A corresponding solution is developed to reduce this kind of error. Afterwards, as an application of ultra-high precision patterning, multiple-exposure SBIL is utilized to multiply the spatial frequency of patterns over large areas. The high nonlinearity of photo resists and the excellent pattern repeatability of the Nanoruler enable higher line densities to be achieved by applying a nonlinear process (development) between exposures of the Nanoruler. A phase control technique for accurately overlaying interference lithography exposures has been developed. Accurate phase control over large areas during spatial frequency multiplication by utilizing a surrounding alignment grating has been achieved. Three key factors- the angle, period, and phase of the alignment grating- have been accurately measured and utilized to position subsequent patterns with respect to previous patterns. (cont.) Some factors that can dramatically diminish the accuracy of phase control, such as particle-induced substrate distortion and nonlinear distortion of the alignment grating, have also been considered and minimized in order to improve the accuracy of phase control. For spatial frequency doubling with a 574 nm principal pitch, we achieved overlay phase errors with a mean of - 1. 0 nm ± 2. 8 nm(la) between overlaid grating patterns over a 25 x 32. 5 mm 2 area. Utilizing the same technique, we fabricated 50 nm-pitch gratings with spatial frequency quadrupling starting from a principal pitch of 200 nm. by Yong Zhao. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Net flux densities were measured at heights 5 and 10 m above an agricultural field with short corn plants and large amount of exposed bare soil between the rows. Large upward eddy fluxes of NO{sub 2 } were seen, and strong NO emissions from the soil were measured by collaborators using <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosures</b> on the soil surface. Data indicate that about 50 % of the nitrogen emitted from the soil as NO was converted into NO{sub 2 } at 5 m.

40|$|Abstract—Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} no difference in micronucleus (MN) frequencies between wild rodents chronically exposed to the environmental radiation contamination of the Chornobyl (Ukraine) exclusion zone and those inhabiting reference populations. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test the hypothesis that a population of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) has developed radioresistance as a result of 14 years of chronic, low-dose radiation exposure. Naive voles were placed in <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosures</b> in the Red Forest region of the exclusion zone for 30 d. Blood samples were obtained at regular intervals, and the MN assay was used to assess chromosomal damage. Additionally, radionuclide uptake was monitored throughout the study, and dose was documented for each individual as well as for their offspring. Total dose for the voles experimentally exposed in this environment averaged 1. 09 Gy (36. 20 mGy d � 1) for the 30 -d study period. Our results indicate that exposure to radiation levels well above regulatory statutes did not result in an increased MN frequency. Furthermore, our results do not support the hypothesis that voles chronically exposed to these radiation levels have developed a genetic basis for radioresistance that is unique from that present in naive populations. The use of C. glareolus as a sentinel species for environmental studies of radiation contamination and the question of whether the MN assay is an appropriate endpoint for studies of low-dose, chronic radiation exposure are also discussed.

Discussion. The Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) is currently listed as endangered due to Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD). Attempts to save the Tasmanian devil from extinction include {{the establishment of a}} captive insurance population, with many individuals housed in managed <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosures</b> (MEEs). These enclosures are intended to closely resemble natural conditions for the devil, and aim to preserve natural behaviours within the captive population. To investigate if stable dominance hierarchies exist among devils in MEEs, 70 group-feeding events were audio-video recorded across six reproductive enclosures at Devil Ark (Barrington Tops, NSW) over a 4 -month period (April - July 2014). Interactions between a devil approaching food and devils already feeding were analysed according to three possible outcomes: failure, displacement and mutual tolerance. Based on these outcomes, dominance scale scores (BBS method) were calculated for the devils in each enclosure for each month. Results revealed that none of the enclosures exhibited stable dominance hierarchies. However, life history traits of the devils, and time spent feeding did influence contest outcomes, with similar trends having been observed in wild devil populations. The results presented here, when compared with wild observations, reflect positively on the captive environment at Devil Ark both in recreating wild conditions and conserving natural behaviours.

The two units were nearly identical in appearance, but one was built with structural insulating panels (SIP), {{and the other}} was built using standard frame construction. The primary objective of these tests was to compare the thermal performance of buildings using SIP and standard frame construction. Both units were tested under carefully controlled steady-state conditions in the NREL large-scale <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure.</b> They were then moved outdoors where Short-Term Energy Monitoring (STEM) tests were performed, and long-term heating and cooling energy use was measured. A secondary objective was to evaluate the accuracy of the NREL STEM method by comparing the results of outdoor STEM tests to steady-state indoor test results. STEM is a method developed by NREL to determine key thermal parameters of a building in-situ, based on a 3 -day test sequence. The indoor test facility also provided the opportunity to investigate the phenomenon of infiltration heat recovery in a real building, under carefully controlled conditions, to evaluate the stability of the concentration decay method of tracer gas-based infiltration monitoring, and to compare the blower-door method with the tracer-gas technique in determining infiltration.

40|$|Abstract—Environmental {{contamination}} {{resulting from}} the Chornobyl, Ukraine, disaster offers {{a unique opportunity to}} examine the in vivo biological effects of chronic, low-dose exposure to radiation. Laboratory studies of acute exposure to ionizing radiation have been used to estimate risk and potential human health effects by the extrapolation of laboratory data to situations of lowdose environmental radiation exposure. Few studies, however, have explored the biological consequences of low-dose exposure via in situ environmental radiation in a sentinel species. In the present study, laboratory strains of Mus musculus (BALB/c and 57 BL/ 6) were placed in <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosures</b> in the Red Forest region of the Chornobyl exclusion zone. Blood samples were obtained every 10 d, and the micronucleus (MN) test was employed to assess the potential for cytogenetic damage from exposure to Chornobyl radiation. Radionuclide uptake was monitored throughout the study, and dose was estimated for each individual as well as for their offspring. Total dose for the mice experimentally exposed to this environment averaged 1162 mGy for BALB/c (30 d) and 1629 mGy for C 57 BL/ 6 (40 d). A higher MN frequency for both strains was observed at day 10, although this change was only statistically significant in the C 57 BL/ 6 mice (� 2 3 � 13. 41, p � 0. 003). Subsequent samples from C 57 BL/ 6 resulted in values at or less than the initial frequencies. In BALB/c mice, an increase in MN was also evident at day 30 (� 2 2 � 10. 38, p � 0. 006).

Instrumental development includes the design of optics and software for automated measurement. The experiments involve data collection and development of mathematical methods for analysis of the data. Chapter One provides an overview of techniques used in cell biology, with a special focus on Raman spectroscopy. It also highlights the importance of experiments on living cells, especially at the single cell level. Chapter Two explains the theoretical background of Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, it presents the Raman spectroscopy techniques suitable for cell and biological studies. Chapter Three details the instrumentation and software development. The main parts of the confocal Raman micro-spectrometer, as designed for studying living cells, are: inverted microscope, 785 nm laser and high quality optics, <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure</b> for maintaining physiological conditions during measurements of cells, and fluorescence wide-field microscopy facility for validation and confirmation of biochemical findings by Raman studies.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} analysis of a system for patterning large-area gratings with nanometer level phase distortions. The novel patterning method, termed scanning beam interference lithography (SBIL), uses the interference fringes between two coherent laser beams to define highly coherent gratings in photo resist. The substrate is step and scanned under the interference pattern to expose large gratings. Our experimental system, the "Nanoruler", employs interference lithography optics, an X-Y air bearing stage, column referencing displacement interferometry, refractometry, a grating length-scale reference, a beam alignment system, and acousto-optic fringe locking. Supporting systems also include an <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure,</b> a beam steering system, and vibration isolation with feedforward. The system can pattern 300 mm diameter substrates. The errors are categorized and analyzed. The image-to-substrate motion during writing is comprised of "servo error", which is calculated from interferometric measurements, and unobservable error. The Nanoruler contains a built-in metrology capability where it can measure directly the image-to-substrate motions, which includes the unobservable error. In this special metrology mode, measurements can be performed at all substrate locations and on the fly - a capability possessed by no other patterning machine. This feature is {{used to assess the}} image-to-substrate motions. On-the-fly writing and metrology is further noted to be important because periodic errors in the interferometry can be eliminated. I control the fringe placement with a novel system of stage control and acousto-optic fringe locking. The experimentally verified system performance allows control of the servo error to the limits of quantization and latency. (cont.) The impacts of stage controller performance and vibration isolation feedforward performance on unobservable errors are modeled and verified. Extremely high resonant frequency metrology frames were designed that provided unusual insensitivity to disturbances. The vibration errors are estimated to be sub angstrom (0 to 100 Hz). Based on my results and modeling, it is concluded that SBIL is capable of satisfying sub nanometer placement requirements. In my work I have demonstrated long term (1 hour) fringe placement stability of 1. 4 nm, 3 (0 to 1. 4 Hz). Also, the short term placement stability is less than 4 nm, 3 (O to 5 kHz). When considering the integrated intensity of the scanned image traveling at 100 mm/s, the dose placement stability is 2. 1 nm, 3. The wafer mapping repeatability was shown to be 2. 9 nm, 3 a while measuring a 100 mm substrate. The repeatability is consistent with error models. The index of air uniformity and the thermal stability of assemblies currently limit the repeatability. An improved system of thermal control, enclosed beam paths, and lower coefficient of thermal expansion components is critical for achieving sub nanometer placement error. by Paul Thomas Konkola.

Current challenges for remote sensors include minimizing the size, mass, and power requirements for cheaper, smaller, and more deployable instruments without affecting the measurement performance. One area that is often overlooked is sensor calibration design that is optimized to minimize the cost, size, weight, {{and power of the}} payload. Yet, an on-board calibration system is essential to account for changes in the detector response once the instrument has been removed from the laboratory. The Calibration Systems project at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is aimed towards developing and demonstrating compact quantum cascade (QC) laser-based calibration systems for infrared sensor systems in order to provide both a spectral and radiometric calibration while minimizing the impact on the instrument payload. In FY 05, PNNL demonstrated a multi-level radiance scheme that provides six radiance levels for an enhanced linearity check compared to the currently accepted two-point scheme. PNNL began testing the repeatability of this scheme using a cryogenically cooled, single-mode quantum cascade laser (QCL). A cyclic variation in the power was observed that was attributed to the thermal cycling of the laser's dewar. In FY 06, PNNL continued testing this scheme and installed an auxiliary liquid nitrogen reservoir to limit the thermal cycling effects. Although better repeatability was achieved over a longer time period, power fluctuations were still observed due to the thermal cycling. Due to the limitations with the cryogenic system, PNNL began testing Fabry-Perot QCLs that operate continuous-wave (cw) or quasi-cw at room temperature (RT) in FY 06. PNNL demonstrated a multi-level scheme that provides five radiance levels in 105 seconds with excellent repeatability. We have continued testing this repeatability in FY 07. A burn-in effect appears in which the power increases over a certain time period. Repeatability better than 1 %, however, is demonstrated for most of the radiance levels after this initial burn-in. In FY 06, PNNL also began investigating a fiber-coupled RT QCL for a compact IR calibration source. PNNL demonstrated a uniform beam profile by measuring a time-averaged response and modulating the fiber optic with a motor to minimize the effects of speckle. In FY 07, PNNL examined the power stability of fiber-coupled QCLs. Feedback appears to degrade the stability so that anti-reflective coatings for fibers may be essential. In FY 07, PNNL continued to investigate the stability of room temperature QCLs as well as the measurement technique to provide a quantitative estimate for the measurement uncertainty. We designed and built a custom <b>environmental</b> <b>enclosure</b> to reduce the measurement uncertainty. After an initial burn-in, we have achieved uncertainties better than 0. 1 % for data collected over almost 100 hours of operation. We also built a bench-top system to demonstrate how the QC laser can be used to calibrate a microbolometer array and illustrated the importance of a multi-point calibration...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{why and how}} wasteland development narratives persist {{through an}} evaluation of wasteland development policies in India from 1970 -present. Integrating critical scholarship on <b>environmental</b> narratives and <b>enclosures,</b> I find that narratives of wastelands as “empty” spaces available for “improvement” continue because they are metaphors for entrenched struggles between the government’s shifting visions of “improvement” and communities whose land use practices contradict these logics. Since the 1970 s, “improvement” has meant establishing different types of tree plantations on wastelands to ostensibly provide energy security. These projects have dispossessed land users by enclosing common property lands and providing forms of energy incommensurate with local needs, a trend I term “energy dispossessions. ” Factors enabling energy dispossessions include the government’s increased attempts to establish public-private partnerships to carry out “improvement” and a “field of observation” constructed to obscure local livelihoods. Unveiling these logics will help to problematize and contest future iterations of wasteland development...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{revival of}} debates {{concerning}} livestock development in Africa follows the more widespread acceptance of paradigm shifts within rangeland science, and maintaining pastoral mobility is now recognised as fundamental {{for the future}} survival of pastoralism and sustainability of dryland environments. However, in southern Africa communal pastoral drylands continue to be enclosed and dissected by large-scale barrier fences designed to control livestock diseases, thus protecting lucrative livestock export agreements. This interdisciplinary research examines {{the extent to which}} these veterinary cordon fences have changed people’s access to, and effective management of, natural resources in northern Botswana and how fence-restricted resource use by livestock, wildlife and people has changed the natural environment. Critical political ecology informed the approach, given its emphasis on socio-political and historical influences on resource access, mobility and user relationships. This enabled the biophysical effects of social changes to be investigated fully, thereby moving beyond a tradition of discipline-based studies often resulting in severely repressive rangeland policies. The research demonstrates how enclosure by veterinary cordon fences restricts patterns of resource access and mobility within pastoral drylands, with serious implications for both social and <b>environmental</b> sustainability. <b>Enclosure</b> increases the vulnerability of people to risks and natural hazards, while resource access constraints and pastoral adaptations to enclosure have favoured the increasing commercialisation of livestock production, thus obstructing pathways into pastoralism. While widespread environmental change in livestock areas cannot be attributed thus far to enclosure, the curtailment of wild migratory herbivores at the wildlife–livestock interface has caused some large-scale structural vegetation changes and there are indications that fence induced sedentarisation could be accentuating existing degradation trends. Given these changes, future rangeland policies in Africa should be aware of the social and environmental impacts associated with export-led disease management infrastructure and consider alternative, less intrusive, approaches to livestock development and disease control in extensive pastoral drylands. </p...|$|R
40|$|Chronic upper {{respiratory}} tract diseases are severe problems in captive orangutans (Pongo abelii, P. pygmaeus), but the etiology and pathogenesis are unknown. This study recorded the prevalence of such diseases in captive European orangutans (201 animals; 20 zoos) and investigated possible predisposing factors. Bornean orangutans (P. pygmaeus) showed chronic respiratory signs (13. 8 % of all animals) significantly more often than Sumatran (P. abelii; 3. 6 %), and male animals more often (15. 8 %) than females (3. 9 %). Hand-reared animals developed more air sacculitis (21 %) than parent-reared animals (5 %). Diseased animals were more often genetically related to animals with respiratory diseases (93 %) than to healthy animals (54 %). None of the <b>environmental</b> conditions investigated (<b>enclosure</b> size and structure, climate, human contact) {{had a significant effect}} on disease prevalence. The present results suggest a higher importance of individual factors, including inheritance, for the development of {{upper respiratory}} tract diseases than environmental conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Handling can {{compromise}} {{the quality of}} life of wild animals in captivity. Welfareincaptive animals canbe assessed through recording of abnormal behaviors. The relationship betweentwomanagement strategies and animal welfare (measured as frequency of abnormal behaviors) for 5 Cebus monkeys of three species (4 males and 1 female) captive at a biological station in ElísioMedrado, Bahia, Brazil is analyzed. This is relevant because capuchin monkeys areveryabundant in captivity worldwide and different species are often housed togetherdue to taxonomic uncertainties. Also, many zoos lack an animal welfare program and simple management practices might help welfare improvement. Stereotyped behaviors werequantified undertwo management strategies: a) daily-movement and b) social-housing. Furthermore, an environmental enrichment was added under the social-housing strategy to test its effect on abnormal behaviors. Frequencies were compared through a Wilcoxon test, which did not show statistical differences intotalabnormal behaviors between different management strategies. However, there was a tendency towards improvement in social behaviors following the social-housingstrategy. Food enrichmentwas useful to diminish stereotyped behaviors, but represented a source of stress for the most subordinate animals. Betterenclosure quality is not enough to promote animal well being, but environmental enrichments are good alternatives for reducing stress in non subordinates.
