25|$|About 80% of {{production}} involves suspension polymerization. <b>Emulsion</b> <b>polymerization</b> {{accounts for about}} 12%, and bulk polymerization accounts for 8%. Suspension polymerization affords particles with average diameters of 100–180μm, whereas <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymerization</b> gives much smaller particles of average size around 0.2μm. VCM and water are introduced into the reactor along with a polymerization initiator and other additives. The contents of the reaction vessel are pressurized and continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is exothermic and thus requires cooling. As the volume is reduced during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to the mixture to maintain the suspension.|$|E
25|$|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (conjugate base perfluorooctanoate), {{also known}} as C8, is a {{synthetic}} perfluorinated carboxylic acid and fluorosurfactant. One industrial application is as a surfactant in the <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymerization</b> of fluoropolymers. It {{has been used in}} the manufacture of such prominent consumer goods as polytetrafluoroethylene (commercially known as Teflon). PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities. It is also formed by the degradation of precursors such as some fluorotelomers.|$|E
25|$|When {{surfactants}} {{are present}} above the {{critical micelle concentration}} (CMC), they can act as emulsifiers that will allow a compound that is normally insoluble (in the solvent being used) to dissolve. This occurs because the insoluble species {{can be incorporated into}} the micelle core, which is itself solubilized in the bulk solvent by virtue of the head groups' favorable interactions with solvent species. The most common example of this phenomenon is detergents, which clean poorly soluble lipophilic material (such as oils and waxes) that cannot be removed by water alone. Detergents clean also by lowering the surface tension of water, making it easier to remove material from a surface. The emulsifying property of surfactants is also the basis for <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymerization.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymerization,</b> adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E

40|$|The rate {{coefficient}} for radical entry into latex particles in <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymerizations</b> is measured for styrene systems {{in which the}} entering species are anionic (from persulfate) and cationic (from 2, 22 ̆ 7 -azobis(2 -methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride, or V- 50). These entry {{rate coefficient}}s p are obtained by measuring rates in seeded <b>emulsion</b> <b>polymerizations</b> where the seeds have either cationic or anionic groups on the surface; "zero-one" conditions are employed, because these offer the advantage that particle size is sufficiently small (approximate to 70 nm diameter) that intraparticle termination is not rate-determining. Data comprise steady-state rates with chemical initiator, combined with loss rates obtained using gamma-radiolysis initiation and following the relaxation behavior after removal from the radiation source. Values for p {{as a function of}} initiator concentration can be meaningfully compared for different initiators through the dependence of initiator efficiency f(entry) on primary radical generation rate (radical flux). For the anionic latex, this dependence is seen to differ depending {{on the nature of the}} initiator used. This may be explained by the entry model [Maxwell, I. A.; Morrison, B. R.; Napper, D. H.; Gilbert, R. G. Macromolecules 1991, 24, 1629] wherein the rate-determining steps in entry are assumed to be only aqueous-phase propagation and termination to form surface-active z-meric oligomeric radicals; entry is solely by z-mers, for which actual entry into the particle is so fast as not to be rate-determining. The cationic latex shows a high rate of spontaneous initiation, which can be explained in terms of amidino radical chemistry; this can be reduced by heat treatment. Accurate f(entry) values are obtained using the heat-treated cationically stabilized latex for seeded studies. The f(entry) data are also consistent with the model for both cationic and anionic species entering the cationic latex. Values of z so inferred (approximate to 2 for persulfate, approximate to 1 for amidinium) can be understood in terms of the hydrophobic free energy of these species. The results refute alternative models in the literature that suppose entry is controlled by double-layer (colloidal) interactions, surfactant displacement, or diffusion control...|$|R

A class of adhesives called pressure-sensitive adhesives (or PSAs) is characterized by instantaneous adhesion upon application of light pressure.

Operating conditions like feed composition, temperature, and solid content will affect latex properties such as copolymer composition, molecular weight distribution (MWD) and particle size distribution (PSD).
