500|$|Like other Iridomyrmex species, {{the meat}} ant is an omnivore, {{retrieving}} food sources from various insects it tends, including caterpillars and various sorts of butterflies, particularly the larvae of the Waterhouse's hairstreak (Jalmenus lithochroa). Meat ants usually feed on honeydew from sap-sucking insects, flower nectar, sugar and other sweet substances. In captive colonies, workers prefer to consume {{small pieces of}} grapes rather than honey solutions and other sweet foods. These ants prey on various insects and animals, collecting both live and dead invertebrates and acquire meat from dead vertebrates. Insects the meat ants prey on include giant lacewings, which they swarm up trees to kill, the butterfly genoveva azure Ogyris genoveva, <b>Indian</b> mealmoths, <b>almond</b> moths, the Western Australian jarrah leafminer and the larvae of the wasp Trichogramma. Large and developed larvae of the [...] cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) are attacked more effectively by meat ant workers than those of other Iridomyrmex species. On sandy beaches, this species is observed preying on the polychaete annelid worm, Armandia intermedia, causing high mortality rates on them (rates of 30 percent). These ants will feed {{on a number of}} dead or alive animals, including metamorphic crucifix toads, snakes, lizards, and birds. On some occasions, swarms of workers have been found on dead foxes. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on fresh guano. The collection of guano by a nearby meat ant colony shows the opportunistic nature of the species. Observations show that trails of workers in groups of two to four were found collecting the guano under an active bat roost within an abandoned mine and proceeded to return it to the nest. The collection of guano by any Australian ant colony was never recorded prior to these observations, but it is unknown why meat ants collect fresh guano.|$|R

5000|$|Feeding {{is also a}} group activity. It {{begins to}} feed in the morning, and is more active during the cooler parts of the day. Loud calls from males {{indicate}} the group is ready {{to move to another}} tree to feed. This monkey is mainly a foliovore, and on average, half of the leaves consumed are young leaves. [...] They also eat leaf shoots, seeds, flowers, and unripe fruit. It has also been found eating bark, dead wood, and soil. It {{is one of the few}} species that do not eat ripe fruits; it has a sacculated stomach with four chambers specific for breaking down plant materials, however it cannot digest the sugars contained in mature fruits. Because the monkey feeds on young leaves (though not limited to them), there are instances where it consumes charcoal, which is believed to aid their digestion of the toxins (possibly phenolic compounds) found in the young leaves of the <b>Indian</b> <b>almond</b> tree and mango tree. The habit of consuming charcoal is thought to be a learned behavior presumably passed on from the mother to her offspring.

40|$|The {{treatment}} for ectoparasitic diseases in freshwater fish with formalin seems at present to be ineffective. For this reason it is evidently a useless cost. In addition, formalin possibly leaves toxic residues in fish flesh {{and in the}} environment which are eventually harmful to consumers. The alternative way {{to solve this problem}} is to use traditional medicinal plants instead. The purpose of this research is to determine the possibility of using garlic (Allium sativum) and <b>Indian</b> <b>almond</b> (Terminalia catappa) as optional chemicals to treat fish ectoparasites, Trichodina sp. The results showed that crude extracts of either garlic or <b>Indian</b> <b>almond</b> at 800 mg/l significantly (P < 0. 05) eliminated Trichodina sp. infections in tilapia (average weight 3. 62 ± 0. 06 g each).

40|$|Various {{parts of}} Terminalia catappa, the <b>Indian</b> <b>almond,</b> are claimed useful in trado-medicine for the {{treatment}} of bacterial infections and some other ailments. The development of resistance to the antibiotics in current clinical use is a big concern. In view of this, the phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of the leaf extracts of Terminalia catappa were evaluated using ethanol and hot water as solvents to determine the active components, antibacterial potency of the leaf extracts and the minimum effective concentration so as to reduce harm. Cold maceration method was adopted in extracting the active principle, having pulverized the leaves. Phytochemical analysis of the crude extracts indicated the presence of carbohydrates, saponins, tannins, steroids and terpenes. Antibacterial screening with 24 hours cultures of clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi, and type cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, using agar-cup diffusion method indicated that P. aeruginosa was the most sensitive while S. typhi the least; ethanolic extract was relatively more active than water extract. Minimum bactericidal concentration test showed that ethanolic extract exerted bactericidal effect at 62. 5 mg/ml on S. aureus, but was static on the rest test microorganisms at the said concentration.

(Noctuidae: Lepidoptera) and the Asian armyworm, Spodoptera litura (Fab.) (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera) on castor (Ricinus communis L.) plants were studied by leaf disc bioassay method. The acetone extract applied to the leaf disc showed toxicity to the S. litura and feeding deterrency to the A. janata. Insecticidal and feeding deterrent activities of the crude extract acted in a dose dependent manner against the test insects. At a higher dose of 2. 5 mg/cm 2, 3 rd instar larvae of S. litura died within 24 h of treatment. The treated larvae were dehydrated and shrunken before death. Lower doses (0. 5 mg/cm 2) also exhibited toxic effects to S. litura but with time delayed process. However, the same compound has produced 100 % feeding deterrent activity to A. janata at 4. 0 mg/cm 2. At lower doses employed, i. e. 2. 0 mg/cm 2 a moderate percentage (20 %) of feeding deterrent action was found after 24 h treatment.

Interest in the latter spectacle was so great that Cinesound News Review sent a unit from Sydney to film it (17 May 1933) and recorded that one bull delivered a "glancing blow" to the lower abdomen of the matador, though the other bulls were so "lethargic " that stockmen were reduced to chasing them with stock whips.

40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, the {{spiralling}} whitefly (Aleurodicus dispersus) has become an important international pest. The movement of plants and parts of plants (such as fruits) in international trade and tourism, and by natural dispersal, has favoured its introduction to new areas. In common with others whiteflies of economic importance, the immature and adult stages cause direct feeding damage by piercing and sucking of sap from foliage, and indirect damage following the accumulation all over host plants of honeydew and waxy flocculent material produced by the insects. Spiralling whitefly is a pest of tropical and subtropical crops, and highly polyphagous. Up to the 1970 s, it had been recorded on 44 genera of plants, belonging to 26 botanical families (Mound & Halsey, 1978). This situation changed with the dispersal of the pest to new areas. Nowadays, the spiralling whitefly {{is one of the}} major pest of vegetable, ornamental and fruit crops around the globe (Lambkin, 1999). Important host crops include: banana (Musa sapientum), Citrus spp., coconut (Cocos nocifera), eggplant (Solanum melanogena), guava (Psidium guajava), Hibiscus rosa sinensis, <b>Indian</b> <b>almond</b> (Terminalia catappa), papya (Carica papaya), Rosa sp. and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) (Saminathan & Jayaraj, 2001). Spiralling whitefly has its origin in the tropical Americas, including Brazil. Although the pest has been recorded only once in Brasil, in the 1920 s in the state of Bahia (Bondar, 1923), it now has official quarantine status because of its economic importance. In the Cape Verte Islands, on the West African coast, the pest was initially introduced in the first half of 2000; it has since become established, reaching urban, natural and agricultural areas of the islands that constitute the archipelago. Since then, the pest has been causing damage to many native plants, ornamentals and cultivated food crops (Anon., 2001; Monteiro, 2004). The present study was done in order to produce an inventory of the most common host plants of spiralling whitefly in this new habitat...|$|E
