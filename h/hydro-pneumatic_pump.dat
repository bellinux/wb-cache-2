Background: A novel {{technique}} of thermoablation, using a microtube to deliver pulses {{of hot water}} vapour, was tested on a large animal model in order to evaluate its efficacy and potential adverse effects. Materials and Methods: The medical device consisted of a microtube extension connected to a <b>hydro-pneumatic</b> <b>pump.</b> Pulses of pure water were injected though the microtube where they were heated and delivered as vapour into the target zone. The method was tested on the liver of 12 healthy pigs, either during open surgery or percutaneously under ultrasounds. Results: The technique was efficient and well-tolerated by the animals. Large volumes of necrotic tissue were created in a significantly short time compared to concurrent thermoablative techniques. Conclusion: Anticipating human application, this experimental study demonstrated a safe and efficient innovative thermoablation technique. The first human applications have bee...|$|E
