25|$|Shia {{scholars}} are unanimous that Ali ibn Abu Talib possessed a personal {{transcript of the}} Quran, which he collected six months after Muhammad's death, {{and that this was}} the ﬁrst compilation of the Quran.

25|$|Rashi wrote {{commentaries on}} all the books of Tanakh except Chronicles I & II.

Rashi's students, Rabbi Shemaya and Rabbi Yosef, edited the final commentary on the Torah; {{some of their own}} notes and additions also made their way into the version we <b>have</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{subspecies}} of F. vesca were identified: F. sylvestris alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens. The {{introduction of}} F. virginiana from Eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century {{is an important}} part of history because this species gave rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712, it introduced the strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry that we <b>have</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

25|$|The tittle (dot) on {{the letter}} {{i of the}} Latin {{alphabet}} originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish i from the minims (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It {{first appeared in the}} 11th century in the sequence ii (as in ingeníí), then spread to i adjacent to m, n, u, and finally to all lowercase is. The j, originally a variant of i, inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of Roman type it was reduced to the round dot we <b>have</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Jewish scriptures were {{translated}} into Greek {{in the two}} centuries immediately before the birth of Christ. The Greek version of these books is called the Septuagint. The Jewish Bible in Hebrew is called the Masoretic text (meaning passing down after a Hebrew word Masorah; for Jewish scholars and rabbis curated and commented on the text). The Greek (Septuagint) version of Ezekiel differs considerably from the Hebrew (Masoretic) version – it is shorter and possibly represents an early interpretation of the book we <b>have</b> <b>today</b> (according to the masoretic tradition) – while other ancient manuscript fragments differ from both.|$|E
25|$|The Stars did {{not have}} an {{official}} team logo as professional and collegiate teams <b>have</b> <b>today.</b> It was not common practice for teams to have such standardized team symbols in the 1930s and 1940s. The Stars wore uniforms with red and navy blue decoration. The cap most commonly associated today with the Stars is their 1938 cap, seen above, which has a navy crown, red brim, and white star with a red sanserif P. For most of their history, they wore a white cap with a red brim, and red sanserif P as seen to the left. Another style cap worn by the Stars was an all navy cap with a red P.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, public system's {{institutions}} are regarded in general as having higher quality and accountability, but private institutions have developed quickly after the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974, and some <b>have</b> <b>today</b> a great reputation. There are {{both public and}} private institutions considered of the highest standard and quality. However, a large majority of Portuguese students attend public schools, universities and colleges because it is considerably less expensive than the private ones, the public system has a much older implantation, and for the other side it covers well the entire territory. There are also some students who simply desire and can afford to attend an elite private institution, even if they have availability to attend one of the largest or most renowned public institutions.|$|E

To these brave priests and many others who suffered we owe a great tribute of thankfulness and praise, for it was through their determination to stand by the Church in her hour of peril that we have won the tolerance and liberty we <b>have</b> <b>today.</b> The Act of Parliament under which these priests suffered {{is still on the}} Statute Book, but for all practical purposes it is dead.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} it was a common belief that fairy {{folklore}} evolved from folk memories of a prehistoric race. It was suggested that newcomers drove out the original inhabitants, and the memories of this defeated, hidden people developed into the fairy beliefs we <b>have</b> <b>today.</b> Proponents of this theory claimed to find support in the tradition of cold iron as a charm against the fairies, which was viewed as a cultural memory of invaders with iron weapons displacing inhabitants who had only flint and were therefore easily defeated. Some 19th-century archaeologists thought they had found underground rooms in the Orkney islands resembling the Elfland in Childe Rowland. However the idea of a fallen vanquished race in hiding has fallen out of favour with scholars.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Todd County's {{original}} European settlement, the forested areas of the Long Prairie River watershed were substantial. The Marshner Pre-European Settlement Vegetation Map shows that 65.5% of the area was covered {{by a variety of}} hardwoods and pines. The first commercial logging began about 1866 and continued through the mid-1890s. Eagle, Moran, Fish Trap, and Turtle creeks were all large enough, at that time, to power mills and float logs to the Long Prairie River where they joined other log rafts {{on their way to the}} Crow Wing and to the Mississippi. As most of the trees were harvested, the sandy soils in these areas were left unprotected, increasing erosion, and gradually filling the streams with sediment. The result is the very much smaller streams we <b>have</b> <b>today.</b> The 1990s Land Use map shows only 21% of the area forested, much restored due to reforestation plantings, and over 60% of the area as cultivated, hay, pasture or grassland.|$|E
25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we <b>have</b> <b>today</b> and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E
25|$|Inland {{from the}} coast {{there is a great}} deal of housing development: some of this has little infrastructure, while most is more expensive, {{especially}} in areas such as Kozyatağı and İçerenköy. These districts house many of İstanbul's upper-middle class residents. These neighbourhoods are mainly built around wide avenues and tree-lined streets, with four to six-storey apartment buildings that have sizable gardens and car-parking around them. Especially in Kozyatağı, there are old Ottoman houses nearly in every houses' garden (Each house or apartment has a big garden with parking lots and arbours while these gardens used to be the old house's). Kozyatağı, Suadiye and Kazasker used to be one of the most popular summer areas for wealthy İstanbul residents. Today, Kozyatağı has tree-lined streets, especially magnolia, linden and fruit trees such as medlar trees, plum trees, cherry, mulberry and quince trees, lots of large greenfields, parks, children parks. These areas, Suadiye, Bağdat Caddesi, Kalamış, Kozyatağı, Fenerbahçe <b>have</b> <b>today,</b> upper-middle or upper class residents. There are many schools, hospitals, shops and restaurants in these areas. There is also a large Carrefour and Bauhaus store on the E5 highway in this part of Kadıköy.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea for}} an {{automated}} defibrillator was first conceived by Dr. Arch Diack, a surgeon in Portland, Oregon. His prototype, literally assembled in a basement, utilized a unique defibrillatory pathway – tongue to chest. There was a breath detector {{that was a}} safeguard to prevent shocking breathing persons. The electrode was essentially a rate counter, far cruder than today’s sophisticated VF detectors. The production model weighed 35pounds and gave verbal instructions. It was an idea ahead of its time. Most people viewed it as a curiosity. By the late 1980s, however, other manufacturers entered the field leading to the automated external defibrillators (AEDs) we <b>have</b> <b>today.</b> Current AEDs, like regular defibrillators, use electrode pads attached to the chest. AEDs are programmed to guide the operator (with a series of voice prompts) through the procedure. The pads once attached automatically detect the type of heart rhythm and if VF is present the AED instructs the operator to press a button (usually flashing red) to shock the patient. From EMT defibrillation with AEDs, there was a natural and logical progression to first responder defibrillation (AEDs used by police or security personnel), next widespread Public Access Defibrillation (AEDs used by lay persons in public locations such as airports, schools, exercise facilities, etc.) and finally home AED including the opportunity to purchase AEDs over the counter without a prescription.|$|E
