He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke.

40|$|Was it Al Gore’s {{election}} to lose? Most political scientists, including us, believed that peace and a booming economy would give Gore a significant {{advantage in the}} 2000 presidential race. The election outcome – a virtual dead heat in the popular vote – has prompted two reactions that seem to us to be quite wrong-headed. On one hand, many journalists and some political scientists have interpreted the 2000 result as casting doubt on the basic premise of presidential vote models, that economic and political “fundamentals ” play a systematic and largely predictable role in shaping presidential election outcomes. If Gore was supposed to win easily but didn’t, doesn’t that <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that the so-called “fundamentals ” are less important than they seem and that every election is a unique political event, {{beyond the reach of}} simple-minded historical regression analyses?

This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem to be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E

[...] Although admitting that the overall episode [...] "is not one of Friends best", Bianco explained that [...] "The wedding changed all that, and in remarkable fashion." [...] While BuzzFeed ranked Monica and Chandler the 23rd best television couple, E! placed the couple second on its ranking of the greatest Friends couples, with author Sydney Bucksbaum writing, [...] "It's {{hard to imagine a}} time when Monica and Chandler weren't together, but it took them four seasons to actually get together.

Author Rikky Rooksby, in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, compared the song with those of Cyndi Lauper because of Madonna's shrill voice in the song. He added that the song was a [...] "pungent satire on the Reagan/Thatcher young-guns-go-for-it era. Which <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that pop music and irony don't mix." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said that [...] "Material Girl" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that made Madonna an icon, the other being [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] from the same album, both remaining as a definitive statement. He added that both tunes overshadow the rest of the record, [...] "because they are a perfect match of theme and sound." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone, felt that the song portrayed Madonna as a more practical girl than previous female singers. Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly, while reviewing the album in 1995, felt that the song came off a bit repetitious and immature when compared to the present context. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly felt that the song provided then critics a way to criticize Madonna's work. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Madonna had [...] "defined a generation with hits like 'Material Girl'." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine compared the song with [...] "Everything She Wants" [...] by Wham!. Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the song sustained a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum."

40|$|Wer vom Marxismus der Frankfurter Schule spricht, der muss sich überlegen, ob es überhaupt einen derartigen motivischen Kulminationspunkt gibt, an dem die von verschiedenen Persönlichkeiten repräsentierten theoretischen Ansätze inhaltlich zusammenlaufen, jedenfalls ihm zustreben. Mir scheint er weitgehend mit der Faszination von Dialektik gegeben. Wer sich dialektischem Denken verschreibt, der sieht die Gegenwart des Elends und der Entfremdung doch zugleich mit einer besseren Zukunft angereichert, ja vielleicht das Gute im Schlechten. Was ich zeigen möchte, ist etwas davon, wie diese Faszination sich in die theoretischen Ansätze der Frankfurter Schule umsetzt und wie sich der der Marxismus der Kritischen Theorie unter dem Eindruck neuer Herrschaftsformen sukzessive auflöst in ein Konzept der Dialektik ohne Reverenzen gegenüber der historischen Gestalt des westlichen Marxismus. Gesucht ist die Hauptlinie dieses Abrückens. Dabei sind diverse Distanzen von Anfang an gegeben. Am Ende aber treten theoretische Figuren auf, die den Boden des Marxismus verlassen - auch den eines undogmatischen. The Critical Theory in {{its early}} version {{conceived}} of itself {{as a form of}} Marxist theory, and endeavored to cast itself in an up-to-date theoretical form appropriate to its historical context - one which {{by the end of the}} first half of the 20 th century had taken a dramatic turn for the worst. Thus the principal propounders of the Critical Theory found themselves departing more and more from orthodox Marxism and devizing provisional positions that were revisionistic in nature. This essay focuses on reconstructing the principal waystations this revisionistic logic passed through, placing the lapse from orthodoxy in its intellectual history context. The central object of attention is the change in status undergone by economic theory and its dialectical structure. Grossmanns law of disintegration exemplifies admirably the attempt to preserve the body of theory in its orthodox form, notwithstanding the deep-reaching changes in the social configurations of the times. Pollock, on the other hand, wishes to embark on a provocative new theoretical construction. Of central concern are his theses on state capitalism, against which Neumann once again mounts a very powerfully argued defense of the theoretical tradition (i. e. one going considerably beyond the Pollock-Neumann controversy of such great importance to fascism theory). In the light of this scrutiny, Fromms own revisionistic effort, analytic social psychology, is revealed as essentially an addendum focusing on the decay and reconstruction of the revolutionary subject -and indeed emerges as being strikingly compatible with Horkheimers own position. Horkheimer it was too who took Pollocks thesis of the primacy of politics and reworked it to yield the bizarre racket theory - which <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>just</b> how far the Frankfurt School had distanced itself from traditional Marxism (or at least this was the case prior to the Institutes return to Germany from its American exile) ...|$|R
5000|$|O'Brien was {{described}} as a [...] "dedicated socialist", and a skilled orator and author, drawing comparisons to prominent activists Bill Haywood, Jack London and Eugene V. Debs, in terms of his impact in Socialism in Canada. O'Brien ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 1909 in the new Rocky Mountain constituency, and, despite not garnering union support, was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1909 Alberta general election {{as a member of the}} Socialist Party of Alberta, narrowly defeating Liberal John Angus Macdonald by 32 votes. He was the first Socialist member elected to the Alberta Legislature. It was said that O'Brien's election to the legislature [...] "reflected a growing radicalization" [...] of coal miners in Alberta; O'Brien's constituency at the time was also mainly miners. The Coleman Miner however down-played his election, saying: [...] "The election <b>just</b> past <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>just</b> what little interest was taken in the affairs of the province by the thinking people, especially the votes of the Rocky riding. The Socialists deserve great credit for the way every man of them got out and hustled; also the supporters of the Independent who were made up of, principally, the working classes - including Dagos and Salvs who neither read, speak, our languafe. These people are herded to the polls like so many cattle and voted according to instructions from their leaders who are paid well for the service rendered. The services of these men are always at the disposal of the highest bidder. Surely this is a disgraceful state of affairs, never-the-less true. The Coleman Miner, March 26, 1909 During his term in office, he worked to improve conditions for the miners, having run on that platform in his election bid. In December 1910, he introduced an amendment to the existing Coal Mines Act, proposing many additional safety measures in the industry. O'Brien also initiated a bill permitting the Alberta government to protect an apparent Russian fugitive (charged with murder for assassination of a Russian governor and arson) by refusing to extradite him back to Russia if investigation showed that he faced political persecution back in Russia. He would also participate in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway debate. Owing to his speech skills, O'Brien would set a provincial legislative record during this term, delivering a speech to the house on February 13, 1912 which was 5 hours and 50 minutes in length, still having not finished his speech when the session was adjourned for the day.|$|R
