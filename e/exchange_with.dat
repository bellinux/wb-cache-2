5|$|Australia was {{a member}} of the {{international}} coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team; in total about 750 personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait. Some ADF personnel serving on <b>exchange</b> <b>with</b> British and American units did see combat, and a few were later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq.

Method: Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging, baseline positive and negative <b>exchanges</b> <b>with</b> partners, children, other family and friends were linked to 2 -year changes in depression on the eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: Positive and negative <b>exchanges</b> <b>with</b> partners and with children were independently associated with depression, adjusting for age, gender, wealth, and baseline depression.

At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, secondary radar contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E

5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The <b>exchange</b> <b>with</b> the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E
