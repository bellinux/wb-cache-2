25|$|A 2007 cable {{reports a}} meeting between several {{agricultural}} biotechnology companies (Dow Chemical Company, DuPont, Monsanto) where they raise concerns to the French governments stance on agricultural biotechnology. The concerns included the destruction of test fields by activists, whether French police will enforce vandalism laws, whether French farmers will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a public list saying they are growing GMOs, and whether France will follow EU approval guidelines. Also the cable discussed an approval dispute about a genetically modified potato variety from BASF which the French government showed signs of approving, but later ruled against. No United States government representatives were involved.|$|E

The first position is a checkmate by the bishop, {{with the black}} king in the corner. The bishop can be on other squares along the diagonal, the white king and knight <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> squares that attack g8 and h7. The second position is a checkmate by the knight, with the black king on a side square next to the corner. The knight can be on other squares that check the black king. The white king must be on a square to protect the bishop and cover a square {{not covered by the}} knight.|$|E
25|$|At the Berghof {{conference on}} 31 July, the Luftwaffe were not represented. Raeder said barge {{conversions}} would take until 15 September, leaving {{the only possible}} 1940 invasion dates as 22-26 September, when weather {{was likely to be}} unsuitable. Landings would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a narrow front, and would be better in spring 1941. Hitler wanted the invasion in September as the British army was increasing in strength. After Raeder left, Hitler told von Brauchitsch and Halder that the air attack was to start around 5 August; eight to fourteen days after that, he would decide on the landing operation. London was showing new-found optimism, and he attributed this to their hopes of intervention by Russia, which Germany was to attack in the spring of 1941.|$|E

25|$|Since {{officers}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> call-out {{most of the}} day, {{they may}} be assigned to regular patrol duties. To decrease response times to situations that require a SWAT team, {{it is now a}} common practice to place SWAT equipment and weaponry in secured lockers in the trunks of specialized police cruisers. Departments that often use this style of organization are county sheriffs, due to the different sizes of counties, and the predominance of back-roads. In places like Los Angeles, where traffic may be heavy, the LAPD use cruisers such as this to respond with their officers so {{they do not have to}} return to a police station to armor up. However, heavier duty equipment may be needed depending on the situation that arises.|$|E
25|$|Green, swing {{promoting}} {{and humid}} conditions {{sums up the}} construction of English pitches but everything depends on weather e.g. in summer it may behave like Indian pitches too. Early in the season, most batsmen <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> their guard as English pitches prove to be most fickle, like the country's weather. Later in the summer, the pitches tend to get harder and lose their green. This makes the task easier for batsmen and only genuine fast bowlers like those bowling in range of (135–150km/h) and spinners can contain. Spinners prove less effective {{in the first half}} of the season and tend to play their part only in the second half. The humid conditions and little dust makes the grounds ideal place to practice reverse swing with a 50-over old ball. Of all grounds, The Oval is the most dangerous as the ball reverse swings most there. Another reason for this is traditionally it hosts the last international test match of a touring side in a summer.|$|E

[...] Although the Wallenberg family was rich, he worked at odd jobs in his free time and joined other young male students as a passenger rickshaw handler at Chicago's Century of Progress. He used his vacations to explore the United States, with hitchhiking being his preferred method of travel.

500|$|On January26, 1945, Lapham {{traveled}} from his location near the prison camp to Sixth Army headquarters, [...] away. He proposed to Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's intelligence chief Colonel Horton White that a rescue attempt {{be made to}} liberate the estimated 500POWs at the Cabanatuan prison camp before the Japanese possibly killed them all. Lapham estimated Japanese forces to include 100–300soldiers within the camp, 1,000 across the Cabu River northeast of the camp, and possibly around 5,000 within Cabanatuan City. Pictures of the camp were also available, as planes had taken surveillance images as recently as January 19. White estimated that the I Corps would not reach Cabanatuan City until January 31 or February 1, and that if any rescue attempt were to be made, it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> January 29.

The left-center and center field brick wall with [...] "457 FT" [...] and [...] "436 FT" [...] painted on it still stands at its original location, along with the stadium's flagpole, adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh's Mervis and Posvar Halls.

[...] This portion of the wall remained after Forbes Field was torn down, and was refurbished in 2006 {{in time for the}} All-Star Game hosted in Pittsburgh. In addition, a wooden replica of an entrance to the stadium, including a ticket window and players entrance, was constructed and placed near the remaining wall in 2006. [...] The home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall. However, its location has been altered; author John McCollister wrote, [...] "Had architects placed home plate in its precise spot about half of the Pirates fans could not view it. The reason: it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> display in the fifth stall of the ladies' restroom." [...] However, {{the original}} location of the home plate has been more recently determined by others to be approximately 81 feet away from its current display, just inside the GSPIA/Economics Library, and not in a restroom as has been popularly believed.|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc.

But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
