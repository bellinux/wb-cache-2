It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela {{would have preferred to}} develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible {{as a result of the}} international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.|$|E

None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth,</b> and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} the theory of choice under uncertainty is to asset markets, and an important property in these markets is a preference for portfolio diversification. If an investor is an expected utility maximizer, then he is risk averse if, and only if, he exhibits a preference for diversification. This paper examines the relationship between risk aversion and portfolio diversification when preferences over probability <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> do not have an expected utility representation. Although risk aversion is not sufficient to guarantee a preference for portfolio diversification, it is necessary. Quasiconcavity of the preference functional (over probability <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth),</b> together with risk aversion, does imply a preference for portfolio diversification.

40|$|The Surplus Theory of Social Stratification {{explains}} inequality <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> {{in terms}} <b>of</b> (1) the fugitivity <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> not needed {{to sustain the}} production <b>of</b> more <b>wealth,</b> (2) the tendency <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> to flow {{into the hands of}} those who are already dispro-portionately wealthy, and (3) the ability of workers in an industrial society to re-tain a greater share <b>of</b> the <b>wealth</b> they produce than workers in societies with more primitive technologies. Size <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> from societies at different lev-els of technology can be fitted by a family <b>of</b> gamma <b>distributions,</b> whose shape pa-rameter is related to a society's level of technology. The Surplus Theory implies a stochastic process that generates gamma-like <b>distributions.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> this pro-cess, the Inequality Process, explains many facts about size <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> per-sonal <b>wealth.</b> This paper presents a general theory <b>of</b> the size <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>wealth.</b> The paper shows that the Surplus Theory of Social Stratification implies a stochastic process, called here the "inequality process, " that re-produces the major features <b>of</b> size <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>wealth</b> in societies at various technological levels. This paper brings together two literatures without cross-citations. These are (1) the literature on the fitting of probability density functions to size <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>wealth,</b> and (2) the literature in anthropology, social archeology, and sociology on the emergence of inequality as populations of hunter/gatherers developed agriculture, the literature of the Surplus Theory of Social Stratification.

40|$|Housing {{wealth is}} the largest source <b>of</b> {{household}} <b>wealth,</b> but we know little about the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> housing <b>wealth</b> and how institutions have shaped this distribution. Subsidies for homeownership, privatisation of social housing and mortgage finance liberalisation {{are likely to have}} influenced the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> housing <b>wealth</b> in recent decades. To examine their impact, we describe housing wealth inequalities across occupational classes for two birth cohorts aged fifty and older. The analysis is conducted across 16 European countries with divergent welfare states and housing systems using the fourth wave of the survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe (SHARE; 2011 / 2012). Our results indicate that the expansion of homeownership in a market-based housing system is associated with a more unequal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> housing <b>wealth</b> across occupational classes, as an increasing number of ‘marginal’ owners are drawn into precarious homeownership. Such a pattern is not found in housing wealth accumulation regimes with a less market-based provision of housing. When the state or the family drive homeownership expansion, a de-coupling of labour market income and housing consumption results in a more equal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> housing <b>wealth...</b>|$|R

25|$|Community and {{equality}} are mutually reinforcing... Social capital and economic inequality moved in tandem {{through most of}} the twentieth century.

Record highs in equality and social capital coincided. Conversely, the last third of the twentieth century was a time of growing inequality and eroding social capital... The timing of the two trends is striking: somewhere around 1965–70 America reversed course and started becoming both less just economically and less well connected socially and politically.|$|E
