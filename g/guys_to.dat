I don't know what that's about, but enjoy the game tonight.” At the time, Flames defenseman Dion Phaneuf was dating Avery’s ex-girlfriend, actress Elisha Cuthbert (the pair married in 2012), and Kings center Jarret Stoll was dating model Rachel Hunter (the pair was engaged in 2009, but the wedding was called off), another ex-girlfriend.|$|E

For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... We all know that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{win against}} Matthysse, {{negotiations}} {{for a fight}} against Kaizer Mabuza began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train <b>guys</b> <b>to</b> be like me. I help <b>guys</b> <b>to</b> {{do the things that}} work for them. If I can teach you how to hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and do it the way that Zab knows how to do it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E

500|$|Three {{years later}} on the Blond Ambition World Tour, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was again {{performed}} before the encore. Madonna, her backup singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory were portrayed as being seduced by three macho guys in leather jackets. The girls asked the <b>guys</b> <b>to</b> [...] "prove their love to them" [...] and wondered if they would wear a condom when necessary. After that, they sing the Shep Pettibone extended remix of [...] "Into The Groove".

500|$|The music used in {{the segment}} of the episode where Squidward's marching band is playing while coming down the street was from Nick Carr, the series' music editor. He found a piece of marching band music that was a band {{intentionally}} playing poorly, but sound designer Jeff Hutchins said, [...] "You could still discern the tune." [...] Hutchins thought [...] "Well, let's take this one step further. What if they couldn't even play their instruments, let alone a tune?" [...] He brought his portable DAT recorder to a musical instrument retail store and met two men who worked on its loading dock, packaging and shipping the instruments. Hutchins made the two men play most of the instruments terribly. He said, [...] "I got these two <b>guys</b> <b>to</b> squeak, blast, and squawk {{on most of the}} instruments they sold." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} 300 writer Frank Miller said, [...] "The inaccuracies, {{almost all of}} them, are intentional. I took those chest plates and leather skirts off of them for a reason. I wanted these <b>guys</b> <b>to</b> move and I wanted 'em to look good. I knocked their helmets off a fair amount, partly so you can recognize who the characters are. Spartans, in full regalia, were almost indistinguishable except at a very close angle. Another liberty I took was, they all had plumes, but I only gave a plume to Leonidas, to make him stand out and identify him as a king. I was looking for more an evocation than a history lesson. The best result I {{can hope for is}} that if the movie excites someone, they'll go explore the histories themselves. Because the histories are endlessly fascinating." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{had long}} been a dream in the Scrubs writer's room to do a musical episode. Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence is a self-confessed musical theatre [...] "nerd," [...] as are many of the writers. In addition, many of the cast members have had {{backgrounds}} in musical theatre. According to Lawrence, [...] "I knew that Donald [...] and Judy [...] were Broadway-style singers and dancers. I knew Sarah [...] could dance, because she danced when she was young. I knew Zach [...] loved musical theater. I had actually seen Ken Jenkins in Big River on Broadway when I was a kid. Neil Flynn and John C.

500|$|On {{references}} to the larger MCU, Ramirez said [...] "those little Easter eggs that come along the way are fun", but {{there were times when}} the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series' narrative and characters.

That’s really what we’re interested in." [...] He explained that the real life New York City [...] "has a larger than life presence" [...] with celebrities that live there—"If you see Derek Jeter walking down the street, that’s great, but then you turn the corner and you get into an argument with the guy who overcharged you for a pretzel.

500|$|Though {{the initial}} {{growth of the}} fandom {{may have come from}} 4chan {{participants}} enjoying the ironic nature of grown men enjoying a show for girls, the fandom continues to grow based on sincere appreciation of the work.

For a guy to like My Little Pony, it's so out there that it becomes almost avant garde. It has a hip quality to it." [...] According to Angela Watchcutter of Wired, the fandom is an example of internet neo-sincerity, where these older viewers watch the show [...] "un-ironically" [...] and [...] "without guilt" [...] breaking gender stereotypes, furthermore creating new material around it.
