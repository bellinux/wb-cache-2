5|$|After {{witnessing}} {{a bright light}} in the sky (which most historians <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> as Halley's Comet, visible in Ethiopia in 1456), Zara Yaqob founded Debre Berhan and made it his capital {{for the remainder of}} his reign.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks {{includes}} 22 songs. Although {{the album}} provides no track information, fans and researchers <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> {{the artists and}} song names. The table below includes both the original romanized Khmer titles and English translations.|$|E
5|$|Most {{critics and}} publications, such as The New York Times, Rolling Stone, NME, MusicMight, IGN and PopMatters, <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> Lavigne as {{a mix of}} {{alternative}} rock, pop rock and pop punk, influenced by a post-grunge sound.|$|E

25|$|Delany <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> as gay since adolescence, {{though his}} {{complicated}} marriage with Hacker (who {{was aware of}} Delany's orientation and <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> as a lesbian since their divorce) has led some authors to classify him as bisexual.|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} almost-collisions in 2005 in similar {{circumstances}} {{in the tunnel}} between Foggy Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> the faulty circuit after installation. However, by 2009, Metro engineers were unaware of this incident or the tests developed to detect the failure condition.|$|E
5|$|After {{witnessing}} {{a bright light}} in the sky which most historians <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> as Halley's Comet, Zara Yaqob, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1434 to 1468, founded the city of Debre Berhan (tr. City of Light) and made it his capital {{for the remainder of}} his reign.|$|E
5|$|Although Fleming {{provided}} no dates within his novels, two writers <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both {{of whom have}} written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—put the events of Casino Royale in 1951; Griswold allows a possible second timeframe and considers the story could {{have taken place in}} either May to July 1951, or May to July 1952.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{is valued}} for its peppery flavor and eaten after {{suitable}} preparation in Russia and Finland, {{the species is}} highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including ergosterol and derivatives thereof, and the pungent-tasting velleral.|$|E
5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{researchers}} <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants {{from historical}} records. The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and {{little is known}} about them {{due to the lack of}} detailed records.|$|E

5|$|On 5 September 2012, the {{excavators}} {{announced that}} they <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> Greyfriars church and two days later that they <b>had</b> <b>identified</b> the location of Robert Herrick's garden, where the memorial to Richard III stood in the early 17th century. A human skeleton was found beneath the Church's choir.|$|R
50|$|Paxinos has {{published}} 46 research books, 145 refereed journal articles, 30 book chapters, and 17 CDROMs. He <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> 90 nuclei (areas) in the rat and human brains. Comparing rats and humans, he <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> 61 homologous nuclei. He <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> 180 nuclei and homologies in birds. He {{was the first}} to produce a reliable stereotaxic space for the brain of rats, mice, and primates — a factor fueling the explosion in neuroscience research since the 1980s. He developed the first comprehensive nomenclature and ontology for the brain, covering humans, birds, and developing mammals.|$|R
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed, but generally negative. Contemporary historians, such as Charles B. MacDonald, praised the work– although some did comment on its length. Modern reviewers <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> inconsistencies or {{errors in the}} material, based on later declassified records. Also, some of Brown's personal conclusions have been questioned.|$|E
5|$|DNA studies <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> close genetic {{relationships}} between Limousin cattle and other south-west European breeds. One study reported a possible common origin or recent gene flow between the Limousin and Charolais cattle breeds. whereas other studies {{indicated that a}} closer genetic relationship exists between Limousin, Gasconne, Aubrac, Bazadais, Salers, and Blonde d'Aquitaine cattle.|$|E
5|$|Madison Hemings' {{family were}} the only Hemings {{descendants}} who continued {{to identify with the}} black community. They intermarried within the community of free people of color before the Civil War. Over time, some of their descendants are known to have passed into the white community, while many others <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> within the black community.|$|E

5|$|Some {{studies of}} older {{children}} <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behavior in infancy can {{develop into a}} child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organized, but the behaviour is treated by researchers {{as a form of}} 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organized according to parenting authority.|$|E
5|$|The many {{sedimentary}} layers on this coastline {{are rich}} with fossils, {{the remains of}} the animals and plants present in the area whose tissues became immersed in deposits of mud which later hardened into rock. At Lyme Regis, for example, geologists <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> 71 layers of rock, each one containing fossils of a different species of ammonite.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many sources}} <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> {{him as a}} native of the rural town of Bisacquino, where he was raised, he was {{actually}} born in the city of Palermo. His parents, Accursio Cascioferro and Santa Ippolito, were poor and illiterate. The family moved to Bisacquino when his father became a campiere (an armed guard) with the local landlord, Baron Antonino Inglese, a notorious usurper of state-owned land. The position of campiere often involved Mafiosi. According to other sources, at an early age, the family moved to Sambuca Zabut, where he lived for approximately 24 years before relocating to Bisacquino, his recognized power base in the Mafia.|$|E

50|$|After work on {{plant and}} {{microbial}} oxygenases, he studied uncharacterized human oxygenases. His research <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> unanticipated roles for oxygenases in regulating gene expression, importantly in the cellular hypoxic response, and has revealed new post-translational modifications to chromatin and RNA splicing proteins. The work <b>has</b> <b>identified</b> {{new opportunities for}} medicinal intervention.|$|R
5|$|Although {{some historians}} <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> Garrard {{as a member}} of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, Kentucky, from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the Club's {{official}} membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge for membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.|$|E
5|$|Appaloosas have an eightfold {{greater risk}} of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Eightypercent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. Researchers may <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{genome-wide}} {{linkage analysis}} has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes on pathways {{that lead to}} inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis. Genome-wide association scans <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. Some of these genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.|$|E
