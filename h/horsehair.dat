5|$|Petticoats made of <b>horsehair</b> {{crinoline}} appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to <b>horsehair</b> crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the <b>horsehair</b> textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by <b>horsehair</b> petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in that they too enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.|$|E
5|$|Mayfly nymphs {{may serve}} as hosts for parasites such as {{nematodes}} and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs' behaviour {{in such a way}} that they become more likely to be predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the <b>horsehair</b> worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Scott (who had seen one ghost, if not two, and {{had heard a}} [...] "warning") states that Miss Anne Robinson managed the Stockwell {{disturbances}} by tying <b>horsehairs</b> to plates and light articles, which then demeaned themselves as if possessed.|$|R
50|$|This festivity {{takes place}} the first Sunday of July {{except that the}} first of July coincides on Sunday then it celebrates the second Sunday in the Buio Mountains. It is an old {{tradition}} according to which people cut the <b>horsehairs,</b> brand the horses and break in them.|$|R
60|$|Various {{other of}} the myths common to American boyhood, were held in perfect faith by Den and Ellis and Ed, myths which made every {{woodland}} path an ambush and every marshy spot a place of evil. <b>Horsehairs</b> would turn to snakes if left in the spring, and a serpent's tail would not die till sundown.|$|R
5|$|Red {{parasitic}} mites sometimes attach {{themselves to}} the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly affect them. The <b>horsehair</b> worm Paragordius varius is an internal parasite and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water, where the parasite continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly Sarcophaga kellyi develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of Rhopalosoma lay their eggs on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs.|$|E
25|$|Three {{types of}} padding {{commonly}} used in boxing gloves are <b>horsehair</b> padding, foam padding or a mix of both. Foam padding gloves use latex and PVC foam with shock absorber. <b>Horsehair</b> gloves last longer than foam padding gloves and are environmentally friendly, but are less protective.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, bows {{are made}} from pernambuco or brazilwood. Both {{come from the same}} species of tree (Caesalpinia echinata), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the {{heartwood}} of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. <b>Horsehair</b> is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut <b>horsehair</b> is drawn over the strings to produce the cello's characteristic tone. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the <b>horsehair.</b> The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is not being used. The amount of tension a cellist puts on the bow hair depends on the preferences of the player, the style of music being played, and for students, the preferences of their teacher.|$|E
40|$|The design {{purpose of}} {{developing}} the movie character Harley Quinn was interestingly interpreted into the garments. The checkered patterns and bias stripes were all connected with each stripe, interweaving the pieces together to create the pattern. <b>Horsehairs</b> were used, and a petticoat was made to create the structured silhouette of the top and the bottom. The three colors and patterns were interestingly combined, creating the fun and mysterious look. ...|$|R
50|$|William Hone in his The Every Day Book (1825) {{revealed}} that Ann Robinson later admitted she had faked the phenomena. She had attached <b>horsehairs</b> and wires {{to move the}} crockery, thrown the other objects and made the noises herself. The Stockwell ghost was sensationalized by Catherine Crowe in The Night-Side of Nature (1848) as a genuine poltergeist incident. She had failed to cite the confession of fraud that was documented by Hone.|$|R
50|$|His {{interest}} in painting was blatantly noticeable since his early childhood days, for he would skip classes {{from time to}} time to go outside and make drawings of the surrounding fields. This resulted in a number of predicaments both at school and at home. During those early days, due to the poverty in which his family lived, he found a way to create his own painting materials. For instance, when he needed something to draw or paint with, he would manufacture his own paintbrush out of a few <b>horsehairs</b> tied up on a twig.|$|R
25|$|Sini is a style {{developed}} in China. The shape is {{greatly influenced by}} Chinese calligraphy, using a <b>horsehair</b> brush instead of the standard reed pen. A famous modern calligrapher in this tradition is Hajji Noor Deen Mi Guangjiang.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine lyra is {{sometimes}} informally called a medieval fiddle, or a pear-shaped rebec, or a kemanche, terms {{that may be}} used today to refer to a general category of similar stringed instruments played with a <b>horsehair</b> bow.|$|E
25|$|Sweat With Horse ring (1992), {{a wooden}} chess piece and a golden ring loosely connect {{to form a}} {{wearable}} ring. The chess piece needs to be balanced continuously though by the wearer. There is <b>horsehair</b> attached to the side to absorb sweat.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} is held vertically, with the soundbox {{resting in the}} player's lap or between the calves. The bow is grasped sideways, with the little, ring and middle fingers pressing on the <b>horsehairs,</b> while the thumb and index fingers hold the rightmost wooden edge of the bow. The leftmost strings of the instrument unite into a single course to form a doubled-string which is tuned to a unison that is lifted slightly from the bridge. This is where all melodic playing takes place. The rest are sympathetic strings numbering from 4 to 6 which are tuned to the octave, fifth and/or fourth of the main doubled-string.|$|R
5000|$|The gusle {{consists}} of a wooden sound box, the maple being considered as the best material (therefore often the instrument {{is referred to as}} [...] "gusle javorove" [...] - maple gusle), covered with an animal skin and a neck with an intricately carved head. A bow is pulled over the string/s (made of horsetail), creating a dramatic and sharp sound, expressive and difficult to master. The string is made of thirty <b>horsehairs.</b> The instrument is held vertically between the knees, with the left hand fingers on the neck. The strings are never pressed to the neck, giving a harmonic and unique sound. The most common and traditional version is single-stringed, while a much less-common version is the two-stringed found in Bosanska Krajina and in Lika[...]|$|R
50|$|The {{musician}} rests {{the body}} of the instrument on the left upper thigh, close to the belly, with the table directed diagonally across the body and the neck leaning away. The thumb of the left hand rests upright along the neck of the instrument. <b>Horsehairs</b> of the arched, bamboo bow are divided into two sections so that one section passes over the bass string and the other over the top string. The bow is held underhand with a loose wrist. The index finger rests on the wood, and the bow hairs pass between middle and ring finger to both regulate the tension of the hairs and direct them. To sound the thick string one has to pull one section of bow hairs with the ring finger, and to sound the thin string, to push the other section. Strings are touched lightly on top by the fingertips. In modern ensemble orchestras, there are small-, medium- and large-sized huchir.|$|R
25|$|Historic bowed zithers of China, {{including}} the Xiqin, Yazheng, and Yaqin, {{and also the}} Korean Ajaeng, were originally played by bowing with a rosined stick, which created friction against the strings. As soon as the <b>horsehair</b> bow was invented, it spread very widely.|$|E
25|$|In court, barristers {{are often}} visibly {{distinguished}} from solicitors by their apparel. For example, in Ireland, England, and Wales, a barrister usually wears a <b>horsehair</b> wig, stiff collar, bands, and a gown. Since January 2008, solicitor advocates {{have also been}} entitled to wear wigs, but wear different gowns.|$|E
25|$|When {{wearing the}} full {{bottomed}} wig, Queen's Counsel {{have a black}} rosette hanging {{from the back of}} the neck, which was originally intended to catch oil and powder that might otherwise mark the silk gown. Modern wigs, however, are made of <b>horsehair</b> and so there is no longer any oil or powder.|$|E
6000|$|He {{used to talk}} {{to himself}} when he was little, but one day his mother said to him jokingly, [...] "Don't {{you know that he}} who talks to himself has the devil for a listener?" [...] and after that he never dared whisper above his breath when he was alone, though his father and mother had both taught him that there was no devil but his own evil will. He shuddered when he heard a dog howling in the night, for that was a sign that {{somebody}} was going to die. If he heard a hen crow, as a hen sometimes unnaturally would, he stoned her, because it was a sign of the worst kind of luck. He believed that warts came from playing with toads, but you could send them away by saying certain words over them; and he was sorry that he never had any warts, so that he could send them away, and see them go; but he never could bear to touch a toad, and so of course he could not have warts. Other boys played with toads just to show that they were not afraid of having warts; but every one knew that if you killed a toad, your cow would give bloody milk. I dare say the far forefathers of the race knew this too, when they first began to herd their kine in the birthplace of the Aryan peoples; and perhaps they learned then that if you killed a snake early in the day its tail would live till sundown. My boy killed every snake he could; he thought it somehow a duty; all the boys thought so; they dimly felt that they were making a just return to the serpent-tribe for the bad behavior of their ancestor in the Garden of Eden. Once, in a corn-field near the Little Reservoir, the boys found on a thawing day of early spring knots and bundles of snakes writhen and twisted together, in the torpor of their long winter sleep. It was a horrible sight, that afterwards haunted my boy's dreams. He had nightmares which remained as vivid in his thoughts as anything that happened to him by day. There were no poisonous snakes in the region of the Boy's Town, but there were some large blacksnakes, and the boys said that if a blacksnake got the chance he would run up your leg, and tie himself round your body so that you could not breathe. Nobody had ever seen a blacksnake do it, and nobody had ever seen a hoop-snake, but the boys believed there was such a snake, and that he would take his tail in his mouth, when he got after a person, and roll himself along swifter than the fastest race-horse could run. He did not bite, but when he came up with you he would take the point of his tail out of his mouth and strike it into you. If he struck his tail into a tree, the tree would die. My boy had seen a boy who had been chased by a hoop-snake, but he had not seen the snake, though for the matter of that the boy who had been chased by it had not seen it either; he did not stop to see it. Another kind of snake that was very strange was a hair-snake. No one had ever seen it happen, but every one knew that if you put long <b>horsehairs</b> into a puddle of water and let them stay, they would turn into hair-snakes; and when you drank out of a spring you had {{to be careful not to}} swallow a hair-snake, or it would remain in your stomach and grow there.|$|R
25|$|Bonnets {{could be}} made {{of a variety of}} materials. Bonnets formed from buckram and wire and covered with fashion fabric were very popular. During the warmer seasons, bonnets made of straw, woven <b>horsehair,</b> or {{gathered}} net were also seen. Heavier materials like velvet were favored for winter bonnets, though quilted winter hoods were much more practical and warm.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} stringed {{instruments were}} mostly plucked (for example, the Greek lyre). Two-stringed, bowed instruments, played upright and strung and bowed with <b>horsehair,</b> may have {{originated in the}} nomadic equestrian cultures of Central Asia, in forms closely resembling the modern-day Mongolian Morin huur and the Kazakh Kobyz. Similar and variant types were probably disseminated along East-West trading routes from Asia into the Middle East, and the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
25|$|To print, {{the block}} is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round <b>horsehair</b> inking brush and applies ink with a {{vertical}} motion. The paper is then {{laid on the}} block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done {{on one side of}} the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Thomas Coyle {{was born}} on 25 July 1869 in Taunton, to Thomas and Ann Coyle. He was one of seven {{children}} in a Roman Catholic family, and his first work was for the family business, making a coarse <b>horsehair</b> fabric. He married Mary Philomena Colvin in 1891 in Taunton, before the pair moved Northumberland in 1896, where Coyle could play professional cricket. He appeared for Chester-le-Street from 1897 to 1900, also playing for Northumberland County Cricket Club during his time there. He moved to Halifax, West Yorkshire {{to set up a}} sports outfitters, while continuing his cricket career.|$|E
25|$|Bow hair is {{traditionally}} <b>horsehair,</b> though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw {{to pull the}} frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. Rosin is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. Baroque style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound.|$|E
25|$|Barring {{illustrations}} of harps in the 9th century Utrecht psalter, only thirteen depictions exist in Europe of any triangular chordophone harp pre-11th century, and all thirteen {{of them come}} from Scotland. Pictish harps were strung from <b>horsehair.</b> The instruments apparently spread south to the Anglo-Saxons, who commonly used gut strings, and then west to the Gaels of the Highlands and to Ireland. The earliest Irish word for a harp is in fact Cruit, a word which strongly suggests a Pictish provenance for the instrument. The surname MacWhirter, Mac a' Chruiteir, means son of the harpist, and is common throughout Scotland, but particularly in Carrick and Galloway.|$|E
25|$|The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, {{named after}} the common trait of growth by {{moulting}} or ecdysis. The largest animal phylum belongs here, the Arthropoda, including insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water. A number are important parasites. Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or <b>horsehair</b> worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.|$|E
25|$|Spartan hoplites {{were often}} {{depicted}} bearing a transverse <b>horsehair</b> crest on their helmet, which was possibly {{used to identify}} officers. In the Archaic period, Spartans were armored with flanged bronze cuirasses, leg greaves, and a helmet, often of the Corinthian type. It is often disputed which torso armor the Spartans wore during the Persian Wars, though it seems likely they either continued to wear bronze cuirasses of a more sculptured type, or instead had adopted the linothōrax. During the later 5th century BC, when warfare had become more flexible and full-scale phalanx confrontations became rarer, the Greeks abandoned most forms of body armor. The Lacedaemonians also adopted a new tunic, the exōmis, which could be arranged so that it left the right arm and shoulder uncovered and free for action in combat.|$|E
25|$|Koledari {{prepared}} themselves during {{several days}} {{before the start of}} the koleda: they practiced the koleda songs, and made their masks and costumes. The masks could be classified into three types according to the characters they represented: the anthropomorphic, the zoomorphic (representing bear, cow, stag, goat, sheep, ox, wolf, stork, etc.), and the anthropo-zoomorphic. The main material from which they were produced was hide. The face, however, could be made separately out of a dried gourd shell or a piece of wood, and then sewn to hide so that the mask could cover all the head. The moustache, beard, and eyebrows were made with black wool, <b>horsehair,</b> or hemp fibers, and the teeth with beans. Zoomorphic and anthropo-zoomorphic masks might have white, black, or red painted horns attached to them. The costumes were prepared from ragged clothes, sheepskins with the wool turned outside, and calf hides. An ox tail with a bell fixed at its end was sometimes attached at the back of them.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{toothbrush}} {{originated in}} China. The first bristle toothbrush resembling the modern one {{was found in}} China. Used during the Tang Dynasty (619–907), it consisted of hog bristles. The bristles were sourced from hogs living in Siberia and northern China because the colder temperatures provided firmer bristles. They were attached to a handle manufactured from bamboo or bone, forming a toothbrush. In 1223, Japanese Zen master Dōgen Kigen recorded on Shōbōgenzō that he saw monks in China clean their teeth with brushes made of horsetail hairs attached to an oxbone handle. The bristle toothbrush spread to Europe, brought from China to Europe by travellers. It was adopted in Europe during the 17th century. The earliest identified {{use of the word}} toothbrush in English was in the autobiography of Anthony Wood who wrote in 1690 that he had bought a toothbrush from J. Barret. Europeans found the hog bristle toothbrushes imported from China too firm and preferred softer bristle toothbrushes made from <b>horsehair.</b> Mass produced toothbrushes made with horse or boar bristle continued to be imported to England from China until the mid 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Unlike earlier Roman helmets, {{the skull}} of the ridge helmet is {{constructed}} {{from more than one}} element. Roman ridge helmets can be classified into two types of skull construction: bipartite and quadripartite, also referred to as Intercisa-type and Berkasovo-type, respectively. The bipartite construction method is usually characterized by a two-part bowl united by a central ridge running from front to back and small cheekpieces, also it lacks a base-ring running around the rim of the bowl. Some examples of the bipartite construction also utilize metal crests, such as in the Intercisa-IV and River Maas examples. The second type of helmet has a quadripartite construction, characterized by a four-piece bowl connected by a central ridge, with two plates (connected by a reinforcing band) {{on each side of the}} ridge, and a base-ring uniting the elements of the skull at the rim of the helmet; this type is further characterised by large cheekpieces. Many examples of this helmet also have a nasal. An example from Budapest may also have had attachments for a <b>horsehair</b> plume. In all types it is believed that the cheekpieces were attached to skull by a helmet liner and the separate neck guard was attached by flexible leather straps, the buckles of which survive on some examples.|$|E
500|$|A {{crinoline}} [...] is a stiffened or structured petticoat {{designed to}} hold out a woman's skirt, popular at various times since the mid-19th century. Originally, crinoline described a stiff fabric made of <b>horsehair</b> ("crin") and cotton or linen which was used to make underskirts and as a dress lining.|$|E
500|$|The <b>horsehair</b> fabric called {{crinoline}} {{was first}} noted by 1829, {{when it was}} offered for lining and dress-making. That year, Rudolph Ackermann's Repository of Fashions described the new textile as a [...] "fine clear stuff, not unlike in appearance to leno, but of a very strong and durable description: it is made in different colours; grey, and the colour of unbleached cambric are most in favour." ...|$|E
500|$|These {{stories were}} {{executed}} in canvaswork or in coloured silks in a uniquely English style called raised work, usually {{known by its}} modern name stumpwork. Raised work arose from the detached buttonhole stitch fillings and braided scrolls of late Elizabethan embroidery. [...] Areas of the embroidery were worked on white or ivory silk grounds {{in a variety of}} stitches and prominent features were padded with <b>horsehair</b> or lambswool, or worked around wooden shapes or wire frames. [...] Ribbons, spangles, beads, small pieces of lace, canvaswork slips, and other objects were added to increase the dimensionality of the finished work.|$|E
