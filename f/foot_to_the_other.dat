500|$|Hull was {{promoted}} to flying officer on 16 April 1938. As war loomed, the squadron began to prepare for combat in late 1938, and in December that year was re-equipped with Hawker HurricaneMkIs. Hull reacted to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in September 1939 with great excitement; according to Hector Bolitho, No. 43 Squadron's intelligence officer, the Rhodesian leapt from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in the officer's mess, repeating the words [...] "wizard, wizard".|$|E
2500|$|The ISUCF'V'MB {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} and traditional marching style during its pregame presentations. The high-step march (used {{for the majority of}} pregame) incorporates a high leg/knee motion combined with a downward toe point. In addition, a similar half-height, double-time version of the high-step, called 'X'ing, is used to enter the field for pregame performances. The swing cadence the band uses to march into the tunnel is also an ISUCF'V'MB signature; members move in a half-time while jumping from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> to cadence in a motion that is similar to hopping. For halftime performances the band uses [...] "glide step", which allows it to maximize its musical and marching output. This is the step the band uses during parades.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Laudrup was {{acclaimed}} for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep {{passes and}} dribbling ability. In regard to his vision, Jorge Valdano, the Argentinian coach of Laudrup in Real Madrid, said, [...] "e has eyes everywhere." [...] His trademark move– looking {{one way and}} passing the other– fooled countless opponents during his career. The Laudrup dribble, a feint {{also known as the}} croqueta, was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> away from the defender. His skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. This led to the expression [...] "Made in Laudrup", widely used in Spain about his creative style of play. Numerous teammates of his have said, [...] "Just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball." ...|$|E
60|$|He rode onwards {{amongst the}} guards with a freedom {{which showed that}} his change of faith had put him upon a very {{different}} <b>footing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> prisoners.|$|R
50|$|The North Ridge is an inhospitable place. Besides {{being at}} 28,000 feet, {{it is located}} along a severe ridge line, {{dropping}} off 10,000 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> one side and 7,000 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Oxygen and proper equipment are virtually essential.|$|R
5000|$|Heartbreaker: An {{upside-down}} stair-like cliff 25 {{feet high}} is climbed to jump across 7 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side where a sword is drawn out <b>to</b> signify <b>the</b> {{completion of the}} obstacle. In 2007, part of the obstacle was put in the 3rd stage of Sasuke and was renamed as the Spider Flip.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Soles {{shifted her}} weight from one slippered <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
60|$|Laban {{shifted his}} weight where he stood from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
60|$|The baby did not hush. Meg {{rose from}} her chair and stood rocking the baby in her arms, swaying from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{first time}} around the walls Tarzan thought he {{detected}} a strange phenomenon for a room with no windows but a single door. Again he crept carefully around close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall. No, {{he could not be}} mistaken! He paused before the center of the wall opposite the door. For a moment he stood quite motionless, then he moved a few <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> one side. Again he returned, only to move a few <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side.|$|R
60|$|What {{then could}} be done? Godfrey peered over the edge. The man was {{swinging}} {{not more than}} two feet below its brink, that is <b>to</b> say, <b>the</b> updrawn loop of his stout leather belt, <b>to</b> which <b>the</b> rope was fastened, was about that distance from the brink, and {{on either side of}} it he hung down like a sack tied round the middle, quite motionless in his swoon, {{his head to one side}} and his <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{school at}} Aspatria is {{on a very}} {{different}} <b>footing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> institutions mentioned and is doing very good work in admitting students at lower fees. If anything is done to encourage schools of this kind the claims of Aspatria stand in the first rank, for in consequence of the lowliness of its fees it is struggling under great difficulties, but {{is a type of}} school which would be of great use <b>to</b> <b>the</b> small farmer class for their sons." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{shifted his}} weight from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> [...] "Well, it's a pretty rough old village, Flo--a pretty rough place for you and mother." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Podgers's eyes blinked {{behind his}} gold-rimmed spectacles, {{and he moved}} uneasily from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> while his fingers played nervously with a flash watch-chain.|$|E
6000|$|Then he rose {{up in his}} littleness, {{and began}} to dance slowly from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> waving his lean arms over the fire, and singing, in the secret {{language}} of the Mulla-mulgars, as loud as ever he could: ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{abundant}} {{reason for}} uneasiness; the cutter astern certainly going through <b>the</b> water four <b>feet,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other's</b> three. Manned with her regular crew, with everything in order, and with men accustomed <b>to</b> pull together, <b>the</b> largest boat, and rowing ten oars <b>to</b> <b>the</b> six of my mate's, I make {{no doubt that}} the cutter of the Black Prince would have beaten materially in an ordinary race, more especially in the rough water over which this contest occurred. But, nearly a tenth full of water, the boat of the fugitives had a greatly lessened chance of escape.|$|R
6000|$|... "They lay {{on their}} backs, {{disposed}} orderly along three sides of <b>the</b> room, their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls--against <b>the</b> <b>other</b> wall, farthest from the door, stood {{my bed and}} the chair. All the faces were covered, but under their white cloths {{the features of the}} two bodies that lay in the square patch of moonlight near the window showed in sharp profile as to nose and chin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say," [...] says Bob, {{bending over}} her shoulder, [...] "here, take your two {{feet in the}} parlor, and put two more <b>feet</b> on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> hall stairs;" [...] and he dashes heavily with his pencil.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Lige listened, and {{he shifted}} from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> {{and rubbed his}} hands, which were red. Some odd trick of the mind had put into his head two people--Eliphalet Hopper and Jacob Cluyme. Was he like them? ...|$|E
60|$|This did {{not seem}} to {{encourage}} the witness at all: he kept shifting from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.|$|E
60|$|ANNA--[The exultation {{again in}} her voice.] I love it! I don't give a rap if it never lifts! [CHRIS fidgets from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> worriedly. ANNA {{continues}} slowly, after a pause.] It {{makes me feel}} clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.|$|E
50|$|When Attack on Pearl Harbor occurred, Lieutenant Morehead {{was in the}} hospital, {{recovering}} from injuries sustained in a midair training collision, in which Morehead jumped out of his cockpit and parachuted 400 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> safety. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> pilot, 2nd Lt. William E. Scott, 22, died in the crash. Had he been fit, {{he would have been}} dispatched with his unit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines; many of his comrades in the unit were captured there by the Japanese and died on the Bataan Death March.|$|R
5000|$|Procopio {{was arrested}} in 1863 for {{stealing}} a lot of cattle from a farmer named Pope at a ranch on the Arroyo Vaya. Constable O.B. Wood from San Leandro tracked Procopio to Alvarado, where Procopio sold Pope's cattle to a local butcher, August Maye. [...] Constable Wood drew his gun on Procopio {{as he was in}} the act of receiving money from the butcher, but holstered his weapon when Procopio claimed to be unarmed. Procopio drew a pistol and shot Wood in the arm. A crowd of armed citizens pursued Procopio, cornering him at a bridge outside of the town. Procopio took his pistol between his teeth, dove into the river and swam 50 or 60 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. <b>The</b> crowd chased him into a salt marsh where a gunfight ensued. [...] Procopio surrendered after his ammunition was used, and he was tried and convicted in San Leandro of stealing Pope's cattle. [...] At his trial, Procopio accepted took the entire blame for the theft, thereby exonerating his accomplice Narciso Bojorques. [...] He was convicted and sentenced to nine years in the state prison at San Quentin.|$|R
60|$|As {{is always}} the case in struggles of this kind, the female {{population}} were more enthusiastic in their partisanship and more pronounced in their opinions than the men; and although, upon {{the arrival of a}} troop of cavalry or a detachment of <b>foot</b> belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side, <b>the</b> master of the house would impartially offer what hospitality he was capable of, it was not difficult <b>to</b> perceive, by <b>the</b> warmth or coldness of the female welcome, what were the private sentiments of the family.|$|R
60|$|As St. Clare {{turned to}} go back his eye fell upon Tom, who was {{standing}} uneasily, shifting from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> while Adolph stood negligently leaning against the banisters, examining Tom through an opera-glass, with an air that would have done credit to any dandy living.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Behold! The {{spirits of}} our fathers have arisen and great deeds are afoot this night!' He stepped back, and another young man {{somewhat}} diffidently came forward, pushed on by his comrades. He towered a full head above them, his broad chest defiantly bared to the frost. He swung tentatively from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
60|$|Abel Hunt stood {{shifting}} uneasily {{from one}} <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> {{half a dozen}} paces distant, as if deliberating whether he would have further speech {{with me on the}} subject of breeding, and I fancied, perhaps because I hoped it might be so, that he was eager to turn his attention to something more diverting than acting as a shadow to Pierre and me.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} local {{variations}} on this group dancing, including the following. One person will typically call out a variation (such as turning 360 degrees {{in place on}} counts 5-8), which is then done by everyone beginning the next measure and again for the following 2 measures. If the caller doesn't call another step immediately, <b>the</b> dancers return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> (default) basic step. Switching sides is sometimes called, upon which the dancers hop on <b>the</b> left <b>foot</b> across <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side on counts 5-8, turning 180 degrees <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was another}} hour before Marshal Illo {{produced}} the document {{and passed it}} round for signature. Many of those to whom it was handed signed it at once without reading the engagement; but one more sober than the rest insisted on reading it through, and at once rising <b>to</b> his <b>feet,</b> announced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> that <b>the</b> important words [...] "as long as Wallenstein shall employ the army for the emperor's service," [...] which had been inserted in the first draft agreed to by Wallenstein and the deputation, had been omitted.|$|R
6000|$|... "You cursed French dog!" [...] swore the viscount presently, {{between his}} teeth, {{and as he}} spoke he made a ringing parade, feinted, beat the ground with his <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> draw off <b>the</b> <b>other's</b> attention, and went in again with a {{full-length}} lunge. [...] "Parry that, you damned maitre-d'armes" [...] he roared.|$|R
60|$|Sheldon {{held the}} rifle {{on him and}} waited. The black glanced around at his fellows, but none moved to aid him. They were intent upon the coming spectacle, staring fascinated at the white man with death in his hands who stood alone on the great veranda. Sheldon has won, and he knew it. Astoa changed his weight irresolutely from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> He looked at the white man, and saw his eyes gleaming level along the sights.|$|E
60|$|Little Frenchie patted {{me on the}} shoulder; but {{remained}} silent. Saul stood shifting uneasily from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> not attempting to bid me good-bye, nor even to meet my gaze, and I understood that he was saying to himself with shame that he ought at least have striven to act the part of messenger, rather than held his peace, which was {{much the same as}} showing that he did not dare make the venture.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gradually, a few at a time, {{the little}} meadow people crept {{out from their}} hiding places and formed a great circle around the old dead stump. With old Mother Nature there they felt sure that no harm could come to them. Then they began {{to laugh at the}} funny sight of fierce old Mr. Owl hopping from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> on top of the old dead stump. It was the first laugh on the Green Meadows for a long, long, long time.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the same}} moment he drew his <b>foot</b> back <b>to</b> kick <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in <b>the</b> face. Watson blocked the kick with his crossed arms and sprang <b>to</b> his <b>feet</b> so quickly {{that he was in}} a clinch with his {{antagonist}} before the latter could strike. Holding him, Watson spoke <b>to</b> <b>the</b> onlookers: ...|$|R
60|$|My boy's {{brother had}} a good many friends who were too old for my boy to play with. One {{of them had a}} father that had a flour-mill out at the First Lock, and for a while my boy's brother {{intended}} to be a miller. I do not know why he gave up being one; he did stay up all night with his friend in the mill once, and he found out that the water has more power by night than by day, or at least he came to believe so. He knew another boy who had a father who had a stone-quarry and a canal-boat <b>to</b> bring <b>the</b> stone <b>to</b> town. It was a scow, and it was drawn by one horse; sometimes he got <b>to</b> drive <b>the</b> horse, and once he was allowed <b>to</b> steer <b>the</b> boat. This was a great thing, {{and it would have been}} hard to believe of anybody else. The name of the boy that had the father that owned this boat was Piccolo; or, rather, that was his nickname, given him because he could whistle like a piccolo-flute. Once the fellows were disputing whether you could jump halfway across a narrow stream, and then jump back, without touching your <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> shore. Piccolo tried it, and sat down in the middle of the stream.|$|R
50|$|The Ahmeek Station {{is one of}} the {{original}} trolley stops of the Houghton County Traction Company, which served Ahmeek and the surrounding location. The original stop in Ahmeek was a simple shelter. However, in 1909 the Allouez Mining Company leased land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Houghton County Traction Company to construct a sub-station and waiting at this location. A building was constructed that year, but almost immediately outgrew its space. In 1910, the Traction Company constructed a small addition, which has since been removed. In 1931, Highway 41 was widened by the Michigan Department of Transportation, and the entire building was moved approximately 40 <b>feet</b> west <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> railroad tracks.|$|R
