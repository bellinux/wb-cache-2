25|$|Mathematical PID loop tuning induces {{an impulse}} in the system, and then uses the {{controlled}} system's frequency response {{to design the}} PID loop values. In loops with response times of several minutes, mathematical loop tuning is recommended, because trial and error can take days just to find a stable set of loop values. Optimal values are harder to find. Some <b>digital</b> <b>loop</b> controllers offer a self-tuning feature in which very small setpoint changes are sent to the process, allowing the controller itself to calculate optimal tuning values.|$|E
