50|$|Blind {{embossing}} {{does not}} include the use of ink or foil to highlight the <b>embossed</b> <b>area.</b> The change in the dimensional appearance of the material is the only noticeable difference resulting from the embossing. The blind embossing process provides a clean and distinctive or subtle image on paper stock. It is best used to create a subtle impression or low level of attention to the piece, yet provide some slight form of differentiation for the finished work.|$|E
50|$|Glazing {{refers to}} an <b>embossed</b> <b>area</b> that has a shiny or {{polished}} appearance. Most often this process is accomplished with heat that is applied with pressure {{in order to create}} a shiny impression on the stock. Dark colored heavy weight stocks generally work best with glazing because the polished effect is much more noticeable and the dark color of the stock helps to eliminate or soften any burned appearance that may result from the application of the heat. When used in conjunction with foil, the process can provide the foil with a slightly brighter appearance.|$|E
50|$|Combination {{embossing}} is {{the process}} of embossing and foil stamping the same image. It involves imprinting and aligning foil over an embossed image to create a foil emboss. A sculptured die, generally made of brass is used for this procedure. The process requires close registration that must be controlled to keep the image and foil matched precisely. The process of embossing and foil stamping is accomplished in one operation {{with the use of a}} combination die. The combination die has a cutting edge around the perimeter to cleanly break the excess foil away from the <b>embossed</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} four species of Pelargonium L’Hérit. in the section Campylia (Sweet) DC. have {{embossed}} ‘warty areas’ at the bases of the posterior petals of the zygomorphic flowers. In Pelargonium tricolor Curt, these <b>embossed</b> <b>areas</b> are most distinctive. The significance of these <b>embossed</b> <b>areas</b> in the attraction of insect pollinators is discussed. From repeated observations of P. tricolor it is concluded that these areas are false nectaries {{and that they are}} effective in attracting dipteran pollinators. Megapalpus capensis Wiedemann (Diptera: Bombyliidae), in particular, exhibits strong association with these false nectaries. It is further predicted that the <b>embossed</b> <b>areas</b> on the petals of the remaining three species in the group, namely P. capillare (Cav.) Willd., P. ocellatum J. J.

40|$|We {{report the}} novel use of {{thermoplastic}} acrylic lacquer (automotive paint) {{in the hot}} embossing of nanoscale structures. Replicas of grating arrays have been produced in coatings of acrylic lacquer using a standard embossing process. The master dies for the experiments comprised grating arrays fabricated by electron beam lithography. Grating patterns with a pitch of 0. 7 - 1. 3 µm were configured to produce diffractive images over an area of ~ 25 × 25 mm. The embossing experiments used a replicated Ni shim as a die and were performed at 100 - 150 °C and 80 kN force. A temperature above the glass transition temperature for the lacquer, T = 120 - 150 °C, was {{required in order to}} achieve a uniform impression across the <b>embossed</b> <b>area</b> of ~ 80 × 80 mm.

5000|$|Mid-1983 {{marked the}} {{introduction}} of a controversial plate, as it used a tourism slogan with implied religious ties to the Society of Friends, more commonly known as the Quakers. The slogan on the yellow on blue plates was [...] "You've Got a Friend in Pennsylvania." [...] Issuance of these plates was quickly dispatched with once Bob Casey, Sr. took office and replaced them with ones saying [...] "KEYSTONE STATE" [...] as well as the old [...] "Pennsylvania" [...] dies (this dating back from the 1977-1983 plates and originally from the 1965-1971 plates); however, the plates were not recalled. These plates used a [...] "filled in" [...] keystone as opposed to the [...] "hollow" [...] keystone on the 1977-1983 plates. These yellow on blue bases plate also were reflective, however it was the <b>embossed</b> <b>areas</b> that were. This was done using glass beads in the paint as opposed to the Scotchlite sheeting of the previous base plate. In 1991, a fourth digit was added after the plates reached ZZZ-999, resetting itself to AAA-0000 and saw the use of a smaller keystone {{to make room for the}} extra digit. The keystone was recycled from both the 1958-1964 and the 1965-1971 plates as a divider.|$|R

Daktari Diagnostics is a startup located in Cambridge, MA that seeks to introduce a lab-on-a-chip device for monitoring HIV in patients. This work investigates hot embossing as a prototyping process for Daktari's microfluidic device. A hot embossing machine was designed and built for the purpose of prototyping a critical feature of their microfluidic network. The machine was designed for an <b>embossing</b> <b>area</b> of 6 square inches, and was found to have a maximum positional repeatability of 43 microns. The microfluidic feature that was prototyped is known as the assay channel. This feature is a high aspect ratio channel with a depth of 50 microns and width of 4 mm. A 10 - micron ridge is adjacent to the channel. Several measurement methods were evaluated with gage repeatability and reproducibility studies to determine the methods most capable of quantifying the quality of embossed parts. The end determination was that quality of parts should be defined by the completeness of formation of the ridge lining the channel. The height and width measurements of the ridge were used as quality metrics. The precision to tolerance ratio (P/T ratio) of the measurement method used for finding ridge height was found to be 0. 44 and the P/T ratio of the ridge width measurement method was found to be 0. 33. by Nicholas Ragosta.

30|$|These “Poem” {{prints are}} part of a {{distinctive}} artistic group of works created in the late 1960 s to early 1970 s, a period when Maki’s key work, Festive Wine, was receiving international recognition [1]. The series bears the striking contrast of colors, dramatic embossing, and innovative textural effects that are hallmarks of Maki’s prints, bringing his ancient subject matter into a modern print vernacular. These visual properties were created using a printmaking technique that involved building up cement around the carved designs on a traditionally prepared woodblock [2]. The technique used for creating the “Poem” series was slightly modified from his other kanji prints. Laminated sheets of damp paper were laid over the uninked, cement-enhanced woodblock and passed through the press a number of times to deeply emboss the figural elements and to impart the cement’s texture. Velvety black poster color was then applied to the entire surface of the paper {{with the exception of the}} margins. Laying a stencil over the matte black areas, Haku Maki applied colored inks over <b>embossed</b> <b>areas.</b> In the scant contemporary literature on Maki’s printmaking [1, 2], he is reported to have relied on Portland cement modified with a chemical bond additive to create his hard textural surfaces and a coating of shellac to prevent water penetration into the block. His colors were comprised of poster paints, oil paints thinned with turpentine, and full-bodied offset printing inks diluted with a thinner spread ink to prevent the paper from sticking to the block or to create a glossier appearance. Other than this meagre description, little definitive information is known about his choices of pigments or media.|$|R

The system was validated for alignment, measurement procedure and the process control. The measuring procedure was analyzed to find the best possible metric which could serve as a response variable for the performance of the process. The 'Fill ratio' of height and width were chosen as metrics for the experimental design which had precision to tolerance ratios of 0. 44 and 0. 33 respectively. An analysis of the factors affecting the hot embossing process was carried out using experimental design and the optimal parameters were identified. The tool temperature, pressure and the holding time were the most significant in that order. The Cp for the process with respect to the height fill was found to be 4. 71 and for the width fill ratio was found to be 1. 97. Using the optimal parameters the process variation of six standard deviations was found to lie within the specification limits. Hot embossing was recommended as a possible method for rapid prototyping of the assay channel and the complete cartridge at Daktari Diagnostics. by Viren Sunil Kalsekar. Thesis: M.

50|$|The process used {{a special}} {{panchromatic}} black-and-white film stock {{used with the}} emulsion away from the lens. The film base {{in front of the}} emulsion was embossed with a mass of tiny lenses, the purpose of which was to form small images of a striped filter which was attached to the camera lens. The filter had three colored stripes (red, green and blue-violet); when an exposure was made the varying proportion of each color reflected from the subject passed through the filter and was recorded on the film beneath each of the <b>embossed</b> lenses as <b>areas</b> of strips in groups of three, each strip varying in density according to the received color value (Dufaycolor used similar principles, but had the filter as part of the film itself).|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To develop {{methods for}} uniform imprint of micron and submicron-scale features. Design/methodology/approach: The first is gas-assisted imprint technique. In use of gas to exert {{isotropic}} pressure in hot embossing, uniform <b>embossing</b> throughout the <b>area</b> is achieved. Another {{approach is the}} electromagnetic force-assisted imprinting technology, which employs the electromagnetic force to pull the magnetic stamp with submicron-scale structures into a UV-curable resist on the substrate. The liquid photopolymer is then cured by UV-irradiation at room temperature. Furthermore, the ferromagnetic UV-curable material is made of nano-Fe powder and UV-curable polymer. The micron and submicron-scale magnetic features can be fabricated. Findings: Uniform <b>embossing</b> throughout the <b>area</b> is achieved. Under the condition of 180 ˚C, 40 kgf/cm 2 and 90 seconds, high quality and uniformity of micro-optical components can be fabricated. For electromagnetic force-assisted imprinting technology, a large area of sub-micron pattern with a line width of 502 nm and a pitch of 1 um can be successfully fabricated under the condition of pressure of 1. 6 kgf/cm 2 for 30 seconds and UV curing for 0. 5 minute. Using ferromagnetic UV-curable resist, the structures can be successfully fabricated {{under the pressure of}} 0. 92 kgf/cm 2 with the same UV-curable time. These results indicate good uniformity and controllability on both the gas-assisted hot embossing and electromagnetic force-assisted imprinting for efficient fabrication of micron- or submicron-scale structures. Practical implications: The facilities have been designed, constructed and tested. The effects of processing parameters including the processing temperature, pressure, and time on the replication quality were investigated. Originality/value: There are advantages of high uniformity, low pressure and low temperature for various applications in micron and sub-micron features and other micro-optical components such as gratings and waveguides etc...|$|R
40|$|A {{machine was}} {{designed}} to pattern thin films of liquid by liquid embossing. 10 designs were prototyped and evaluated according to pattern transfer, alignment, and ability to <b>emboss</b> large <b>area.</b> The final design utilizes a PDMS stamp cast such that it seals an air cavity, which is then pressurized to slightly bow the stamp. The cavity is clear so alignment {{can be accomplished by}} optical feedback using a camera and microscope objective. The theory of liquid embossing is discussed. PDMS has a very high contact angle with most fluids and so it is able to clear liquid from channels approximately 5 [mu]m wide. The wettability of the substrate is modified after being in contact with PDMS so the liquid does not reflow into the channels. Sub-micron alignment between layers was achieved. Vector plots of runout between layers are given. Electrical yield was found to be 89 % and was not negatively correlated by stamp age up to 1000 dry stamps. The stamps were found to wear, but due to their conformal nature this did not affect pattern transfer. Structures created by the liquid embossing machine include electrostatic actuators, test patterns with 100 nm features, vias, under-etched metal layers, and released cantilevers. by Eric J. Wilhelm.

40|$|In {{recent years}} hot {{embossing}} {{technology has been}} intensively investigated as a promising cost-efficient alternative to lithography for creating sub-#mu#m patterns. In close co-operation between industry and university this technology was developed to an industrially applicable process {{in the framework of}} this project. Main tasks of micro resist technology GmbH were the development of polymers dedicated for large <b>area</b> <b>embossing</b> and their physical characterisation. Higher etch resistance compared to PMMA and a high thermal stability were required for the hot embossing process. Two groups of polymers were investigated: thermoplastic polymethacrylates and thermosetting allyl polymers. The polymethacrylates were synthesized by solution and suspension polymerization. Polymers with different molecular weights were obtained by controlling the polymerization conditions. The suspension polymerization is the more cost-efficient method. But its reproducibility is less satisfactory for molecular weights < 400 000 g/mol compared to the solution polymerization. Thus, the solution polymerization is the preferred procedure. Methacrylate polymers with defined glass transition temperature were synthesized by co-polymerization of different monomers with specified monomer feed ratio. The synthesis of a thermosetting allyl polymer was elaborated to a stable procedure with a good reproducibility. For the use as stamps the allyl polymer was modified by epoxy groups to improve chemical bonding of an anti sticking layer. Polymer stamps obtained by hot embossing can be an economic alternative to the expensive and time-consuming stamp production by e-beam lithography. The flow behaviour of the thermoplastic and thermosetting polyerms was characterized by rheological measurements providing important conclusions concerning the imprint conditions. (orig.)

40|$|The {{superelastic}} {{nature of}} bones requires matching biomechanical properties from the ideal artificial biomedical implants {{in order to}} provide smooth load transfer and foster the growth of new bone tissues. In this work, we determine the biomechanical characteristics of porous NiTi implants and investigate bone ingrowth under actual load-bearing conditions in vivo. In this systematic and comparative study, porous NiTi, porous Ti, dense NiTi, and dense Ti are implanted into 5 mm diameter holes in the distal part of the femur/tibia of rabbits for 15 weeks. The bone ingrowth and interfacial bonding strength are evaluated by histological analysis and push-out test. The porous NiTi materials bond very well to newly formed bone tissues and the highest average strength of 357 N and best ductility are achieved from the porous NiTi materials. The bonding curve obtained from the NiTi scaffold shows similar superelasticity as natural bones with a deflection of 0. 30 - 0. 85 mm thus shielding new bone tissues from large load stress. This {{is believed to be the}} reason why new bone tissues can penetrate deeply into the porous NiTi scaffold compared to the one made of porous Ti. Histological analysis reveals that new bone tissues adhere and grow well on the external surfaces as well as exposed areas on the inner pores of the NiTi scaffold. The in vitro study indicates that the surface chemical composition and topography of the porous structure leads to good cytocompatibility. Consequently, osteoblasts proliferate smoothly on the entire implant including the flat surface, <b>embossed</b> region, exposed <b>area</b> of the pores, and interconnected channels. In conjunction with the good cytocompatibility, the superelastic biomechanical properties of the porous NiTi scaffold bodes well for fast formation and ingrowth of new bones, and porous NiTi scaffolds are thus suitable for clinical applications under load-bearing conditions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
