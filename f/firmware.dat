5|$|Device <b>Firmware</b> Upgrade (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent {{mechanism}} for upgrading the <b>firmware</b> of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) {{a way for}} <b>firmware</b> bugfixes to be deployed. During the <b>firmware</b> upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a PROM programmer. Any class of USB device can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications.|$|E
5|$|The console has {{a number}} of {{internal}} features made available from its hardware and <b>firmware</b> components. The hardware allows for extendability (via expansion ports), while the <b>firmware</b> (and some software) can receive periodic updates via the WiiConnect24 service.|$|E
5|$|Several {{flavors of}} the Linux kernel exist for each port. For example, the i386 port has flavors for IA-32 PCs {{supporting}} Physical Address Extension and real-time computing, for older PCs, and for x86-64 PCs. The Linux kernel does not officially contain <b>firmware</b> without sources, although such <b>firmware</b> {{is available in}} non-free packages and alternative installation media.|$|E
5|$|Some early {{polycarbonate}} MacBook models {{suffered from}} random shutdowns; Apple released a <b>firmware</b> update to resolve them.|$|E
5|$|BootX was {{superseded}} by another nearly identical bootloader named boot.efi and an Extensible <b>Firmware</b> Interface ROM on {{the release of}} the Intel-based Mac.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its intended legitimate purposes, DFU can also be exploited by uploading maliciously crafted <b>firmware</b> that causes USB devices to spoof various other device types; one such exploiting approach is known as BadUSB.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro {{comes with}} EFI 1.1, a {{successor}} to Apple's use of Open <b>Firmware</b> and the wider industry's use of BIOS.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 (excluding PlayStation 3 Slim) also {{supports}} running Linux OS on <b>firmware</b> versions prior to 3.21 {{without the need}} for buying additional hardware purchase. Yellow Dog Linux provides an official distribution that can be downloaded, and other distributions such as Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu have been successfully installed and operated on the console. The use of Linux on the PlayStation 3 allowed users to access 6 of the 7 Synergistic Processing Elements; Sony implemented a hypervisor restricting access to the RSX. The feature to install a second operating system on a PlayStation 3 was removed in a <b>firmware</b> update released in 2010.|$|E
5|$|An {{embedded}} microprocessor {{governs the}} overall {{operation of the}} VFD controller. Basic programming of the microprocessor is provided as user-inaccessible <b>firmware.</b> User programming of display, variable, and function block parameters is provided to control, protect, and monitor the VFD, motor, and driven equipment.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of these developments, a {{dedicated}} community, centered on forums such as XDA Developers, emerged surrounding the creation of custom <b>firmware</b> ("ROMs") built from the Android source code. Projects such as CyanogenMod continued to produce ports of newer versions of Android for the Dream and later Android devices, while adding their own features and enhancements to the operating system as well.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI <b>firmware,</b> and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control plug and play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and <b>firmware.</b>|$|E
5|$|The TRIM command {{also needs}} {{the support of}} the SSD. If the <b>firmware</b> in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs {{received}} with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a <b>firmware</b> upgrade to the user, or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by the user. The user could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E
5|$|After the Dream's {{bootloader}} was dumped, {{work began}} on modifying {{it so that}} it could install third-party <b>firmware,</b> and on converting official Android update files into a format that could be installed using the modified bootloader. Around the same time, Google made the Android Dev Phone 1 available for registered Android developers; the Dev Phone 1 was a SIM- and hardware-unlocked version of the HTC Dream that came pre-configured for superuser access to the internal files of the phone, allowing users to completely replace the bootloader and operating system.|$|E
5|$|Apple v. Franklin {{established}} the fundamental basis of copyright of computer software, {{even if it}} was provided only as object code or in <b>firmware.</b> In 1982, Apple filed a lawsuit against Franklin Computer Corp., alleging that Franklin's ACE 100 personal computer used illegal copies of the Apple II's operating system and ROM. The case was decided in Franklin's favor but reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.|$|E
5|$|As with Windows 8, all {{certified}} devices must {{ship with}} UEFI Secure Boot enabled by default. Unlike Windows 8, OEMs {{are no longer}} required to make Secure Boot settings user-configurable, meaning that devices may optionally be locked to run only Microsoft-signed operating systems. A supported infrared-illuminated camera is required for Windows Hello face authentication. Device Guard requires a UEFI system with no third-party certificates loaded, and CPU virtualization extensions (including SLAT and IOMMU) enabled in <b>firmware.</b>|$|E
5|$|Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) was {{released}} in February 2011, introduced Debian GNU/kFreeBSD as a technology preview, featured a dependency-based boot system, and moved problematic <b>firmware</b> to the non-free area. Debian 7.0 (Wheezy) {{was released}} in May 2013, featuring multiarch support and Debian 8.0 (Jessie) {{was released in}} April 2015, using systemd as the new init system. Debian 9.0 (Stretch) was released in June 2017. , Debian is still in development and new packages are uploaded to unstable every day.|$|E
5|$|In October 2017, it was {{reported}} that a flaw in a code library developed by Infineon, which had been in widespread use in security products such as smartcards and TPMs, enabled private keys to be inferred from public keys. This could allow an attacker to bypass BitLocker encryption when an affected TPM chip is used. Microsoft released an updated version of the <b>firmware</b> for Infineon TPM chips that fixes the flaw via Windows Update.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the iMac series of Macintoshes, the <b>firmware</b> was updated. The ROM was reduced in size to 1MB, called BootROM, and the {{remainder}} of the ROM was moved to the file Mac OS ROM in the Mac OS System Folder, stored on the hard drive. This ROM used a full implementation of the OpenFirmware standard (contained in BootROM) and was named the New World ROM.|$|E
5|$|According to Quirky, Wink {{products}} were in 300,000 homes by 2015. In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that made {{many of its}} hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue a recall. The recall caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub. Due to financial difficulties, {{due in part to}} the recall, Quirky began looking for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of <b>firmware</b> and hardware. Wink continues to operate as an independent subsidiary of Flex. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.|$|E
5|$|Early {{models of}} the Wii are fully {{backwards}} compatible with GameCube software {{and most of its}} accessories; the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini iterations lack GameCube support. Early versions of the PlayStation 3 and all {{models of the}} Xbox 360 only offer partial support and use software emulation for backwards compatibility. Current versions of the PS3 do not offer PlayStation 2 compatibility, though PS1 compatibility is retained. Some models of the first generation of the PS3 offered full backwards compatibility for PS2 games. The Xbox 360's compatibility is increased through game-specific patches automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website and the PS3's compatibility is expanded with <b>firmware</b> updates.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of <b>Firmware</b> 2.7 on April 25, 2006, a {{downloadable}} demo of LocoRoco was released on the game's Japanese website {{and was the first}} Sony-sanctioned user-downloadable game for the PSP. A demo localized for western countries was released in June 2006, shortly before the game's full European release. It includes one level that will take the player around 5–15 minutes to complete, depending on the number of secret areas the player encounters. A special Halloween-themed demo was released for download on October 26, 2006, It featured some exclusive graphics and objects, like Jack-o-lanterns, spirits, and more. Few puzzles were implemented. A Christmas-themed demo was released for download on December 11, 2006. It featured some exclusive graphics like Santa's sleigh and more. A unique LocoRoco song is implemented.|$|E
5|$|The DualShock series {{consists}} of four controllers: the DualShock which was the fourth controller released for the PlayStation; the DualShock 2, the only standard controller released for the PlayStation 2, and the DualShock 3, the second and current controller released for the PlayStation 3, and the DualShock 4, which went through a massive redesign and is the default input of the PlayStation 4, and upon release was compatible with the PS3 originally only via USB and eventually with a <b>firmware</b> update, Bluetooth connectivity was enabled. The Sixaxis was the first official controller for the PlayStation 3, {{and is based on}} the same design as the DualShock series (but lacking the vibration motors of the DualShock series of controllers).|$|E
5|$|The MacBook Pro {{comes with}} the {{successor}} to BIOS, Extensible <b>Firmware</b> Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers, but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported. This is {{made possible by the}} presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.|$|E
5|$|The peak random write {{performance}} on an SSD {{is driven by}} plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected, secure erased, 100% TRIMed, or newly installed. The maximum speed will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller, {{the efficiency of the}} <b>firmware,</b> and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page. During this phase the write amplification will be the best it can ever be for random writes and will be approaching one. Once the blocks are all written once, garbage collection will begin and the performance will be gated by the speed and efficiency of that process. Write amplification in this phase will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience.|$|E
5|$|A port to iOS devices {{done by the}} 2K China {{studio was}} {{released}} on August 27, 2014. The iOS version is content complete and functionally equivalent to the original Xbox 360 and Windows version, featuring either the use of touch-screen virtual gamepad controls {{or the use of}} a Bluetooth-enabled controller, and with a graphics engine optimized for iOS devices. The game was later delisted from the App Store in September 2015; the game had become unplayable for many that upgraded to iOS 8.4 on their devices, and while a patch had been discussed, a 2K representative stated that the decision to remove the game came from the developer. 2K later clarified that they will be working on resolving the issues with the game's compatibility with the new <b>firmware</b> and will re-release the title once that has been completed. However, by January 2017, 2K officially stated that it will no longer support the title, the game will remain on the App Store, but will not receive additional updates.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary, {{in-house}} engine {{referred to}} as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, Daxter (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The camera system was modified to cater to the fixed cinematic camera for God of War gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222megahertz (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the clock speed of the PSP on account of the difference to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released a <b>firmware</b> upgrade that allowed games to use the full 333MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|Prior to release, {{the game}} had been playtested {{multiple}} {{times by the}} general public. An alpha version of Evolve, called the 'Big Alpha' was released for Xbox One on October 31, 2014, The alpha version of Evolve was originally set to be released for the PlayStation 4 a day later on October 31, 2014, but was delayed to November 3, 2014 due to technical issues related to PS4's <b>firmware</b> update. As compensation, {{the duration of the}} demo was extended by a day, and ended on November 4, 2014 for all platforms. Players can play as the four classes of Hunters as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the alpha version. Turtle Rock expected 100,000 people to participate in the alpha. The team hoped that through the alpha testing, they could test the functionality of the game's servers, and make adjustments to the game's balance. Open beta trials of Evolve on Xbox One were held January 14–19, 2015. A limited test for the PlayStation 4 and PC was held January 16–19, 2015. Players could play as the first eight Hunters as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the beta. The Evacuation mode was also added to the beta on January 17, 2015.|$|E
25|$|Intel Macs {{employ a}} {{different}} Intel technology for <b>firmware,</b> Extensible <b>Firmware</b> Interface, not the Open <b>Firmware</b> Apple had been using. EFI removes the traditional PC {{reliance on the}} BIOS while providing more functionality.|$|E
25|$|The first updates to the <b>firmware</b> added sharing {{features}} (send, community, list nearby Zune users) {{as described}} in FCC filings. <b>Firmware</b> 1.1 allowed the device to inherit sharing capabilities described by codename Pyxis. Early <b>firmware</b> releases patched software bugs. About a year later, the much anticipated 2.2 <b>firmware</b> release added support for DVR-MS (Media Center Recorded TV) files, lossless playback, added wireless syncing, and GUI interface improvements.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} <b>firmware</b> is a freely redistributable binary blob, that is closed-source. A minimal {{open source}} <b>firmware</b> is also available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Firmware</b> version 01.01.29, {{released}} in May 2008, enabled Ogg Vorbis compatibility for the Sansa Clip. The 01.01.30 <b>firmware</b> update improved OGG support and added FLAC support. The latest <b>firmware</b> packages for the Sansa Clip are 01.01.35 and 02.01.35, which {{depend on the}} hardware revision.|$|E
25|$|With {{the change}} in architecture, a change in <b>firmware</b> became necessary. Extensible <b>Firmware</b> Interface (EFI) is the firmware-based {{replacement}} for the PC BIOS from Intel. Designed by Intel, it was chosen by Apple to replace Open <b>Firmware,</b> used on PowerPC architectures. Since many operating systems, such as Windows XP and many versions of Windows Vista, are incompatible with EFI, Apple has released a <b>firmware</b> upgrade with a compatibility support module that provides a subset of traditional BIOS support with their Boot Camp product.|$|E
25|$|A <b>firmware</b> rootkit uses device or {{platform}} <b>firmware</b> {{to create}} a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, network card, hard drive, or the system BIOS. The rootkit hides in <b>firmware,</b> because <b>firmware</b> is not usually inspected for code integrity. John Heasman demonstrated the viability of <b>firmware</b> rootkits in both ACPI <b>firmware</b> routines and in a PCI expansion card ROM. In October 2008, criminals tampered with European credit card-reading machines before they were installed. The devices intercepted and transmitted credit card details via a mobile phone network. In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation. A few months later they learned that some laptops are sold with a legitimate rootkit, known as Absolute CompuTrace or Absolute LoJack for Laptops, preinstalled in many BIOS images. This is an anti-theft technology system that researchers showed can be turned to malicious purposes.|$|E
25|$|To support {{third-party}} <b>firmware,</b> Linksys has re-released the WRT54G v4, {{under the}} new model name WRT54GL (the 'L' in this name allegedly stands for 'Linux'). It is also possible to replace the 2MB flash chip in the WRT54G with a 4MB flash chip. The Macronix International 29LV320BTC-90 is a suitable part although others may work as well. The user must first install a JTAG header and use a JTAG cable {{to back up the}} <b>firmware,</b> then replace the chip and restore the <b>firmware</b> with the JTAG cable. After testing for proper functionality of the modified unit, third-party <b>firmware</b> can be flashed using the JTAG cable and a suitable image file.|$|E
25|$|Independent of {{the host}} computer, a {{hardware}} device might have embedded <b>firmware</b> to control its operation. <b>Firmware</b> is used when the computer program is rarely or never expected to change, or when the program must not be lost when the power is off.|$|E
25|$|Apple uses {{a subset}} of the {{standard}} PC architecture, which provides support for Mac OS X and support for other operating systems. Hardware and <b>firmware</b> components that must be supported to run an operating system on Apple-Intel hardware include the Extensible <b>Firmware</b> Interface.|$|E
