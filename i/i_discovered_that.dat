At first we had been giving out relief at such a rate that I had to tell the chairman that he was providing the smelter men with more than they had had while at work.

25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E

Brisingr takes place long before the industrial revolution, which Paolini said [...] "limits not only the things my characters use and do, but it also informs their worldview. This constraint extends to more recent words and phrases as well. For example, in Brisingr, I was going to use the description [...] When I researched its origins, however, <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> it was coined to describe modern cooking: a short-order cook." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{has made}} sculptures of David Hume and Adam Smith, {{philosophers}} of the Scottish Enlightenment, which {{stand in the}} Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Hume is depicted in a [...] philosopher's toga, representing the timelessness of philosophical thought, a decision which was criticised as atavistic after the unveiling in 1996, though Stoddart remained stoic, [...] "So here <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the right thing, done in public, will often earn one great disapproval: a lesson for life – in the modern age at least." [...] Local philosophy students soon began a tradition of rubbing the statue's toe to absorb some of his knowledge. Though Stoddart placed the foot {{over the edge of}} the plinth to encourage such engagement, the irony of the practice given Hume's critiques of superstition has been remarked upon.|$|E

500|$|Lody {{began an}} {{apprenticeship}} at {{a grocery store}} in Halle in 1891, before moving to Hamburg two years later to join {{the crew of the}} sailing ship Sirius as a cabin boy. He studied at the maritime academy in Geestemünde, qualifying as a helmsman, and immediately afterwards served with the Imperial German Navy for a year between 1900 and 1901. Subsequently joining the First Naval Reserve, he enlisted as an officer on German merchant ships. In 1904 he returned to Geestemünde, where he successfully obtained a captain's licence. He fell seriously ill with what he later said was a stomach abscess, [...] "caused from a very badly cured typhoid attack of fever from which I suffered in Italy on account of the bad water at Genoa." [...] An operation was required, which weakened his left arm and his eyesight. As Lody put it, [...] "Consequently, my career as a seaman was closed as soon as <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that,</b> and my doctor told me that I could not go any further." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Nasri {{admitted}} {{he was determined}} to re-capture his form that resulted in Arsenal signing him two years prior. He also {{admitted he}} did not take missing out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup well, stating, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> I wasn't part of the squad for the World Cup, I got a big slap in the face." [...] However, after speaking to Arsène Wenger, who informed him he should use the non-call-up as motivation, Nasri was reassured. Nasri started the campaign well. He was named in Arsenal's starting line-up to play against Liverpool for the first match of the season on 15 August 2010. Nasri played the entire match in a 1–1 draw. After the match, Arsenal confirmed Nasri had suffered a knee injury that would keep him out for a month. However, the player returned to the team after just three matches to help Arsenal defeat Braga 6–0 in the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League group stage on his return. On 21 September, he scored a double in the club's 4–1 extra time victory over North London derby rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Both goals were converted from the penalty spot. Fours days later, Nasri scored another double in a 3–2 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion.|$|E

2500|$|Peano's {{symbolic}} notation took Russell {{by storm}} in 1900, but Russell’s Principles {{was still in}} unrelieved prose.

Then, on 21 April 1982, after a {{landmine}} {{killed an}} Israeli officer {{while he was}} visiting a South Lebanese Army gun emplacement in Taibe, Lebanon, the Israeli Air Force attacked the Palestinian-controlled coastal town of Damour, killing 23 people. Fisk reports further on this incident: [...] "The Israelis did not say what the soldier was doing ... <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> he was visiting one of Haddad's artillery positions (Christian militia) and that the mine could have been lain [...] {{as long ago as}} 1978, perhaps even by the Israelis themselves".|$|E

Among the techniques I use are rhythm exercises, work on transposition, and work on score-reading. In addition I sight- read the Mozart and Beethoven sonatas and sight-read with other musicians to increase the volume and difficulty of the material. My sight-reading improved somewhat but time constraints prevent me from giving substantial results...|$|R

While performing {{in the musical}} Half a Sixpence, Cleese met future Python Terry Gilliam, as well as American actress Connie Booth, whom he married on 20 February 1968. At their wedding at a Unitarian Church in Manhattan, the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language. [...] "The only moment of disappointment," [...] Cleese recalled, [...] "came {{at the very end}} of the service when <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> I'd failed to excise one particular mention of the word 'God.'"

2500|$|Describing the {{anthology}} as a [...] "flawless jewel of science fiction", Shaenon K.

[...] Katherine Dacey also praised the [...] "intensely Romantic quality of all three stories" [...] and their artwork, particularly Hagio's representation of the characters' memories and emotional states with [...] "symbolically rich imagery" [...] and a [...] "dream-like quality". Dacey cited Hagio's [...] "unique ability to mix the sublime with the ridiculous", such as the characters' names and costumes and the sex-change drug.|$|E
2500|$|As {{recounted in}} his 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers {{came to know}} Lore because they both {{reported}} to rezident Markin: [...] He described him as follows: [...] Lore was an old Bolshevik. He had been a Socialist before the Russian Revolution. In those pre-revolutionary days, {{he had been the}} friend of Trotsky, then a New York Socialist journalist. After the Revolution, Lore had managed an American speaking trip for Alexandra Kollontai, the author of Red Love, later the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. [...] Bukharin, in his New York days, had eaten and slept in the apartment on 55th Street in Brooklyn, where Lore, his outspokenly anti-Communist wife and three wholly American sons still lived. [...] He describes the Lore family with some detail: [...] I was introduced to Lillian Lore, Ludwig's remarkable wife, who in large part provided those meals, and, by some economic miracle, had kept that amazing household together during the long, lean years, had fed the endless procession of guests. [...] "Die unvergessliche Lores-the unforgettable Lores," [...] a German friend had called them... I have seldom seen a happy family life so explicit in the characters of all who shared it... I soon came to regard the Lores' house as a kind of second home. [...] For Ludwig I developed an almost filial feeling as of a younger for an older revolutionist. [...] The kindness of all the Lores to me was personal, and in spite of politics, for all {{the other members of the}} family, except Ludwig, were outspoken in their detestation of the Communist Party. [...] Chambers also describes a defector's fear of retribution from the Soviet Underground, which Lore and he shared: [...] I did not know that at the very time I was visiting him most frequently, Lore was under surveillance. [...] He was being watched, not by the American authorities, but by the Russian secret police... <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> he was afraid to walk alone with me on the street at night and that he was terrified to get into an automobile alone with me. Then I knew that there was something seriously amiss. But I had been out of the Communist Party six or seven years, and Lore was dead, before <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the old Bolshevik, in whom, as a younger man, I respected the older revolutionist, had denounced me (around 1941) to the F.B.I. I learned it not from the FBI, but from another security agency of the Government. [...] I respected Lore all the more for that act. My feeling for him and for all the Lores remained unchanged.|$|E

2500|$|This story echoes Mildred's [...] "Seashell ear-thimbles" [...] (i.e., a {{brand of}} in-ear headphones) that act as an {{emotional}} barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that Fahrenheit 451 is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature. Regarding minorities, {{he wrote in his}} 1979 Coda:There is {{more than one way to}} burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, Mattachine/Four Square Gospel feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse. Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel Fahrenheit 451, described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever. Only six weeks ago, <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that,</b> over the years, some cubby-hole editors at Ballantine Books, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. Judy-Lynn del Rey, one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.|$|E
