500|$|The Golden Age of Grotesque is {{the final}} studio album to feature {{longtime}} keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy and guitarist John 5, who would both acrimoniously quit the group over the following years. John 5's relationship with Manson had soured {{over the course of}} the Grotesk Burlesk Tour. According to John, Manson spoke to him only once during the entire tour: [...] "It was on my birthday and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Happy birthday, faggot'—then walked away." [...] Manson also displayed hostility towards the guitarist on stage. During a performance of [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] at the 2003 Rock am Ring festival, Manson kicked and then shoved John, who responded in anger by throwing his guitar to the ground and raising his fists to Manson, before resuming the song. Gacy, who was also the band's last remaining original member – excluding Manson – quit shortly before the recording of the band's next studio album, Eat Me, Drink Me (2007). He would later file a $20 million lawsuit against Marilyn Manson for unpaid [...] "partnership proceeds", accusing the vocalist of spending money earned by the band on [...] "sick and disturbing purchases of Nazi memorabilia and taxidermy, including the skeleton of a young Chinese girl." ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{surveyed}} {{and criticized}} the whole troop, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|The girovago talked continually. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{holding the}} handful of sausages.|$|E
60|$|And he {{breathes}} his name. Then <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{and gives}} me mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I hands 'em to him. He reads one of 'em, {{and then}} he reads the other, which he needn't 'a' done, for they was both alike, an' then <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> an' says he: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was peeking {{through his}} glasses at the camp, and I was helping pepper, the General's sow-belly--just as usual--when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> quick and says, 'Almighty! How all these Englishmen are liars! You cannot trust one,' he says. 'Captain Mankeltow tells our Johanna he comes not back till Tuesday, and to-day is Friday, {{and there he}} is! Almighty! The English are all Chamberlains!' ...|$|R
60|$|By this time, when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> he had {{regained his}} usual expression.|$|E
60|$|He got up, plainly agitated, {{and walked}} to the window. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> appealingly.|$|E
60|$|We {{drove on}} in the same {{direction}} as before. When we had started <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'You rascal, Pico!' {{answered}} Lorenzo, also laughing. 'And what is {{your opinion}} of love, Messer?' <b>he</b> added, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|And I was {{determined}} that when that time came <b>he</b> should <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as the drowning man <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> the straw.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} got the lamps!" [...] he almost shouted. [...] "My {{reasoning}} was right after all. Come to the library, where we will be alone, and {{tell me all about}} it! And while he does it, Ross," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "do you, like a good fellow, get the key from the safe deposit, so that I may {{have a look at the}} lamps!" ...|$|R
60|$|Without ceasing to eat <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> his florid, barocco apostle's {{face with}} an {{expression}} of inquiry.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Magg {{made another}} note upon {{the sheet of}} paper in front of him. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|George watched, and {{his face}} slowly {{gathered}} expression. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> his dark eyes alive with horror and despair.|$|E
6000|$|... "With all my heart," [...] says he. [...] "Then, madam," [...] adds <b>he,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "I {{shall be}} near you, and {{have time to}} tell you a story which will be very long, and yet many ways very {{pleasant}} to you; how troublesome that devilish fellow, the Jew, has been <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on your account, and what a hellish snare he had laid for you, if he could have found you." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{called to}} a waiter, and was {{particular}} in his instructions as to my order. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> back <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't answer him, Augustus," [...] put in {{my uncle}} sternly. [...] "What right have you to cross-question my son?" [...] <b>he</b> demanded, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|My friend {{spoke in}} his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|When at last {{we reached}} the house and stood inside the hall, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and spoke for the first time.|$|E
6000|$|M. Fourtou's friend {{read this}} note, and shuddered. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and said, with a {{suggestion}} of severity in his tone: ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Fancy old George {{talking about}} work!” he laughed; “why, about half-an-hour {{of it would}} kill him. Have you ever seen George work?” <b>he</b> added, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'So he is,' ses Bob, 'and to {{the best}} wife in London. I know where she lives. Mine's a bottle o' Bass,' <b>he</b> ses, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I will," [...] said Mr. Chipperton,--"I believe I will. You say {{you have}} one more room. All right. I'll take it. This will be very pleasant, indeed," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "It will be quite a party. It's ever so much better to go to such places in a party. We've been {{thinking}} of going for some time, and I'm so glad I happened in here now. Good-bye. We'll see you this afternoon at the dépôt." ...|$|R
60|$|Stroeve gave {{a little}} gasp. He wiped his face. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for support, but I {{did not know what}} to say.|$|E
60|$|Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{tapped his}} {{forehead}} three times, {{shook his head}} solemnly, and hurried away.|$|E
6000|$|He made no {{immediate}} response, {{but at last}} <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> solemnly. [...] "Can you look upon a beautiful woman with reverent eyes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{not only}} {{satisfied}} about her eyes--he was triumphant. [...] "Soh!" [...] <b>he</b> grunted, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Why is Mr. Sebrights not here to look at this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Welcome, then, my brother,' said {{my husband}} a little gravely, as I thought. 'My love,' <b>he</b> added, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'let <b>me</b> present <b>to</b> you my brother-in-law, the Chevalier d'Aubepine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a good}} thing," [...] {{retorted}} Northmour in his ugliest manner. [...] "You {{might end}} by wearying us.--What {{were you going to}} say?" [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Corbeck grunted; he was {{not pleased}} at having given himself away. All at once <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said in his natural way: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me, mon ami, {{you were}} not {{precisely}} sympathique." [...] <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> earnestly. [...] "Tell me--you see now that he must not be arrested?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Of {{course this}} threw the abbot {{into a good}} deal of a consternation. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with the signs of it in his face, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, yes,' said <b>he,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'we {{are very}} much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims {{so far as to}} cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be {{extremely}} obliged.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a good}} thing," [...] {{retorted}} Northmour in his ugliest manner. [...] "You {{might end}} by wearying us. What {{were you going to}} say?" [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> pistol <b>me.</b> I sprang, {{and drew}} [...] The sabre from his flank, And 'twixt his nape and shoulder, ere he knew, [...] I struck, and dead he sank.|$|R
