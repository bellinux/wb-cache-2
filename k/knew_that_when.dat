After this, she became fluent in English. Sotomayor has {{said that she was}} first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the Perry Mason television series. [...] She reflected in 1998: [...] "I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I was ten. Ten. That's no jest." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{the final}} scene of the film that made Shinkai glad he had cast Hanazawa. He <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Yukari cried, {{it had to be}} {{something}} impressive in order to emphasize an intense release of emotion. According to Shinkai, music alone could not produce the needed effect, and Hanazawa performed perfectly and without instruction. In an interview, he said, [...] "I believe that Ms. Hanazawa's acting on that crying scene alone completes the film." [...] This final scene, which was recorded perfectly on the first take, played a pivotal role in the casting decision for Takao's character. Though many Japanese voice actors could portray a naïve 15-year-old boy, Shinkai immediately recognized that only Miyu Irino could produce the intense emotion needed for the closing scene. Irino had also played Shun and Shin in Shinkai's Children Who Chase Lost Voices.|$|E
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.' I always thought that was a nice way to say, 'Once more.|$|E

500|$|The French {{recognised}} that Watt's talents {{were not}} being fully utilised due to his ineligibility to lead a squadron, and recommended that he transfer to the Australian Flying Corps. Watt did so on 1March 1916, with the rank of captain. Posted to Egypt in May, he was made commander of BFlight, No.1 Squadron, and {{took charge of the}} unit's first contingent of Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s the following month. No.1 Squadron was engaged mainly in aerial reconnaissance and army co-operation duties, but the two-seat B.E.2 proved inferior to German Fokkers and Rumplers in speed, time-to-climb, and manoeuvrability. [...] In September 1916, Watt was promoted to major and given command of No.2 Squadron, which was formed in Kantara. He was mentioned in despatches by General Archibald Murray, Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, on 13October; the commendation was promulgated in the London Gazette on 1December. No. 2 Squadron's personnel was composed largely of former Lighthorsemen, as well as thirteen mechanics from the Australian Flying Corps' first combat formation, the Mesopotamian Half Flight, led by Flight Sergeant George Mackinolty. Watt personally trained the force in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying it to the Western Front that September. [...] He was [...] "a born leader of men", according to one officer, while another recalled that [...] "In the things that mattered, his men knew he stood for absolute obedience. They also <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> discipline could be safely relaxed he would be quick to grant them some relief from the strain." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon the {{announcement}} that Steven Moffat would leave the show in December 2017 and be replaced by new showrunner Chris Chibnall, this decision led to speculation over whether Capaldi would remain in the role or leave alongside Moffat. A month before this, Capaldi stated [...] "This could be my final year it's terrifying, I love Doctor Who {{but it can be}} an insular world and I do want to do other things. There will come a time when this is over, but I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I started.

2500|$|Silas is {{described}} as [...] "sinister" [...] and [...] "scary". Rawle said that Silas is [...] "very interesting" [...] and complex. Hollyoaks series producer, Paul Marquess, called him mild-mannered and likened him to a bogeyman. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy described Silas as a dual role of the affable older man and sinister killer. Rawle explained that Silas is [...] "old-fashioned" [...] and dislikes women who have loose morals. Silas actually appeared to enjoy killing people and although he mockingly apologised {{to some of his}} victims, he clearly didn't mean those apologies. There are only two known murders that he actually felt regret for; murdering his own daughter and killing India but these instances have not stopped him from killing people. The official Hollyoaks website said of Silas: [...] "Eep! Who <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Heidi’s cuddly dad Silas showed up in the village he {{would turn out to be}} the local serial killer with a penchant for strangulation?" [...] They also call him a [...] "killer grandad". Silas becomes more unstable and in October 2011, Rawle said [...] "He's a psychopath and he has slightly lost the plot now. He's very dangerous. He thinks he hasn't got a lot of time left to live and feels he has nothing to lose." ...|$|E
