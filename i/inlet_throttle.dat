40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedA single-stage transonic research compressor and test rig {{are to be}} used to obtain data on the effect of inlet flow distortion on compressor (and therefore engine) stall. Auxiliary injection was examined as a technique for generating distortion in inlet stagnation pressure, or temperature, or to simulate the more complex effects of engine steam ingestion from a catapult launch. Engineering analyses were developed and programmed in EES to relate inlet conditions to the compressor characteristics, for both pressure and temperature distortion. An injection duct area of 8 % was selected to limit the required heater power. A CFD analysis was carried out to predict the compressor inlet flow field and hence position the injection duct exit. It was found that a broad range of distortion parameters could be generated by simply ducting (and heating) atmospheric air (or steam) through an auxiliary <b>inlet</b> <b>throttle</b> valve...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} state-of-the-art steam turbine-generator {{developed to}} serve as the power conversion subsystem for the Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories' Solar Total-Energy Project (STEP) is described. The turbine-generator, which is designed to provide 400 -kW of net electrical power, represents the largest turbine-generator built specifically for commercial solar-powered cogeneration. The controls for the turbine-generator incorporate a multiple, partial-arc entry to provide efficient off-design performance, as well as an extraction control scheme to permit extraction flow regulation while maintaining 110 -spsig pressure. Normal turbine operation is achieved while synchronized to a local utility and in a stand-alone mode. In both cases, the turbine-generator features automatic load control as well as remote start-up and shutdown capability. Tests totaling 200 hours were conducted to confirm the integrity of the turbine's mechanical structure and control function. Performance tests resulted in a measured <b>inlet</b> <b>throttle</b> flow of 8, 450 pounds per hour, which was near design conditions...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedOperational experience indicates that steam escaping from carrier catapults {{has the potential}} to induce stall or surge in the compressors of jet aircraft during takeoff. As the carrier fleet ages and the Navy transitions to the single engine F- 35 C variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, further investigation of steaminduced surge phenomena is necessary to avert undue risks to pilots and to obviate stall related damage to Navy aircraft. This study investigated the effects of both throttle-induced surge and steam-induced surge in a transonic compressor stage at 70 %, 80 %, 90 %, 95 %, and 100 % of the compressor design speed. The primary goals of this research were to quantify changes in the compressor stall margin as a result of steam ingestion and to develop pressure contour maps to analyze the transformation of shock structures in the blade passages as they relate to <b>inlet</b> <b>throttle</b> settings. The results of this experiment confirmed that the introduction of high-pressure steam consistently reduced the observed compressor stall margin over the entire operating range of the transonic stage and produced reliable representations of the shock structure present along the compressor casing.

The industry's response to the need for CO 2 reduction has been to develop the gasolene direct injection concept.

A simplified linear differential equation of second order, which involves the parameters estimated from the states of steady combustion, has been suggested to discuss theoretically the nature of oscillatory combusion about a two-dimensional combustion chamber. Its validity has been testified by comparing calculated results with experimental ones. Results obtained have indicated that factors markedly affecting the low-frequency oscillatory combustion are primary volumetric air-fuel ratio, duct length of combustion side, shape of burner and <b>inlet</b> <b>throttles.</b> But outlet throttle gives {{little effect on the}} stability of combustion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{advancement}} {{in the study of}} thermal-hydraulic dynamic instabilities with reference to the helical-coiled tube geometry. A full-scale open-loop experimental facility simulating a helically coiled steam generator was built and operated at SIET labs in Piacenza (Italy). The facility comprises two helical tubes (1 m coil diameter, 32 m length, 8 m height), connected via lower and upper headers. Nearly 100 flow instability threshold conditions were identified, in a test matrix of pressures (80 bar, 40 bar, 20 bar), mass fluxes (600 kg/m 2 s, 400 kg/m 2 s, 200 kg/m 2 s), inlet subcooling (from − 30 % up to ∼ 0), and <b>inlet</b> <b>throttling</b> (four different entrance resistance conditions). The long test section feature and the helical-coiled tube geometry render the present facility a quite unique test case in the outline of two-phase flow instability experimental studies. Parametric effects of the operating pressure, flow rate, inlet subcooling and <b>inlet</b> <b>throttling</b> on the threshold power are discussed. The period of oscillations is also discussed. Superimposition of Density Wave Oscillations (DWOs) with Ledinegg flow excursions is finally described. Theoretical modelling of DWO occurrence in helical pipes was addressed by means of a lumped parameter analytical model, which was exploited to highlight some peculiarities of DWO phenomena and respective stability boundary with respect to classical straight geometry. In the end, numerical simulation results with RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 3 code were compared...|$|R
40|$|High {{efficient}} inlet prototype including supersonic inlet and subsonic large curvature diffuser {{was developed}} and chosen for supersonic business aircraft with M∞= 1. 6 cruise flight. Preliminary deceleration of incoming airflow and boundary layer control are provided {{by means of a}} swept wedge placed in front of inlet due to forming transverse pressure gradient. Further compression is realized in a system of 3 -D shocks with terminal normal one. Numerical modeling based on solution of 3 -D Navier-Stokes equations allowed obtaining the results of inlet flow at throttle modes under M∞= 0. 8 - 1. 8 and confirmed flow stability at 1. 5 [...] 5 -fold increased pressure in subsonic diffuser outlet section in comparison with external free stream pressure. Parametric flow calculations are organized and <b>inlet</b> <b>throttle</b> performance is determined with subsonic diffuser at M∞= 0. 8 - 1. 8 and boundary layer suction in a throat. It is received that using the boundary layer control with air suction rate Gsuct/Ginlet = 2 … 5 % the total pressure recovery coefficient σ grows up to σ = 0. 89 … 0. 97 for considered M ∞ range.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedSteam leakage from {{an aircraft carrier}} catapult is sometimes ingested by the aircraft's engines upon launch which may induce compressor stall. Investigation of the phenomenon known as a "pop stall" is of particular importance as the Navy prepares to field the F 35 C, the aircraft carrier variant of the joint strike fighter. The single engine design of the F- 35 C makes this aircraft particularly susceptible to steam-induced stall during catapult launch. The present project examined compressor stall and included steady-state as well as transient measurements in the inlet of a transonic compressor prior to and during a steaminduced stall. Hotwire measurements of the inlet flow field were taken to determine an inlet turbulence intensity of 2 - 3 % during both subsonic as well as transonic compressor operation. A 95 % speed line was established from data taken from open throttle to near stall. Hot-film and Kulite pressure data taken near stall showed {{the existence of a}} stall precursor which appeared near half rotor speed. Steam was injected into the inlet; however the initial method added mass to the system and did not induce a stall. A decrease in the amplitude of the pressure trace was observed however. A stall was induced by steam ingestion ahead of the existing <b>inlet</b> <b>throttle,</b> with upstream transient measurements taken using both hot-film and Kulite pressure transducers...|$|E
40|$|An engine {{with double}} cooling {{circuits}} operating at two temperature levels {{has been developed}} at Volvo Cars. In this thesis the cooling circuit at the lower temperature level is studied and a model estimating the coolant temperature in this circuit has been developed in Simulink/TargetLink. The model is to be implemented in the engine control unit and used for function based diagnosis of the cooling system. The cooling system consists of the following components: a water cooled air cooler {{which is used to}} cool the charged air entering the engine, turbochargers in two-stages with cooled bearings systems and a cooled compressor house in one of the turbochargers, an <b>inlet</b> <b>throttle</b> (ETM) cooled for component protection, an SCR injector also cooled for component protection, and a radiator used to cool the coolant. After an investigation of the average heat transfer rate from each component, the ETM was excluded from the model. The SCR injector was also excluded since this component had not yet been installed in the studied engine. The model was formulated with a physical foundation, using energy balances of the system as well as experimentally obtained heat transfer relationships. An overall energy balance was used to calculate the coolant temperature in each discrete time step, based on heat transfer from the modeled components in the system (the water cooled air cooler, turbochargers and radiator). Model evaluation was performed using vehicle data obtained from real time measurements in a four cylinder diesel engine with extra measurement sensors installed in the air system and cooling system. The developed model estimates the temperature with a total mean error of − 0. 2 C. The 95 th and 5 th percentile for all simulated data is 1. 4 C respectively − 2. 8 C. The model was also shown to be robust against input errors in a sensitivity analysis done for a representative test case...|$|E
40|$|Air bearing sliders in the Tango class use {{load bearing}} pads with inlet-throttled lending edges {{to control the}} mass flux and lift. The {{influence}} of leakage or diffusion effects is always present in real sliders. In some designs such as railed taper flat designs leakage is dominant. The behavior of such sliders must be determined with numerical methods that obscure deeper understanding. Many aspects {{of the behavior of}} Tango class sliders can be understood with the vast simplification allowed by <b>inlet</b> <b>throttling.</b> In this paper such a simplified analysis is applied to describe a complete air bearing slider composed of two pads. The conditions for static level Fight are determined as well as the linear stability of heaving and pitching oscillations. Both stable and unstable modes are identified Either damping or amplification can result from convective effects in the absence of mechanical damping. In real implementations of Tango class sliders instability has not been observed thanks to diffusion. The present analysis can serve as a guide to select initial choices for the operating parameters that correspond to maximum corrective damping...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the prediction of flow stability in heated channels containing supercritical water by the use of computational fluid-dynamics techniques. The long term aim of the research is to qualify a methodology for analyzing stability by CFD codes, basing on previous preliminary experience by the FLUENT code and making use of the present capabilities of the STAR-CCM+ code. The effect of using first and second order schemes with different time-step size for a simple thermal-hydraulic problem is firstly checked, mainly making use of the implicit transient coupled scheme available in STAR-CCM+; this step was required in order to clarify the effect of truncation error that in such implicit schemes is predicted to be quite large. Then, the analysis progresses considering a more realistic bundle slice, including the fluid and the fuel rod, with UO 2, cladding and gap regions, simplified only by neglecting the effects of spacer grids and <b>inlet</b> <b>throttling,</b> to be addressed in a later phase of the research. The coupling with a point kinetics model, obtained by using an external program, developed in java, is also parametrically assessed.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. This study {{examines}} the successful use of Homogeneous-Charge, Compression-Ignition (HCCI) combustion {{in a standard}} issue model-aero “diesel” engine. This two-stroke engine, unlike the more common glow-plug versions, operates without any form of combustion initiator. The fuel and air are premixed using a simple carburettor and ignited by piston compression only. The engine therefore operates in HCCI-mode {{even though it is}} referred to as a “model diesel engine”. Of particular interest {{is the fact that the}} engine is easily started from cold, warm and hot conditions. It runs stably from idle to over 11000 rpm and is shown to run at high load points across the speed range with extremely conservative pressure rise rates. Furthermore, this engine is shown not to exhibit any knocking (high pressure oscillations) within its normal range of operation. The speed-load operational envelope of the engine is mapped out using a range of propellers and a propeller speed-load calibration rig. Air/fuel ratio, inlet air and exhaust gas temperatures are examined within this operational envelope. Areas of unstable operation and extremities in stable operation are also mapped out and discussed. The engine’s use of <b>inlet</b> <b>throttling,</b> crankcase pumping and residual exhaust gas metering is modelled and discussed. In addition, the engine’s inherent ability to maintain constant combustion phasing over varying operating conditions is also investigated...|$|R

Some of the additional horsepower for 1994-95 engines was gained by using epoxy (not teflon as commonly believed) coated supercharger rotors to improve efficiency, and a larger supercharger <b>inlet</b> and <b>throttle</b> body. The 1994-1995 utilized a 2.85 in pulley versus the 2.55 in pulley used on the 91-93 supercharger.|$|R

Off-design control {{techniques such as}} <b>inlet</b> air <b>throttling,</b> varying the <b>inlet</b> guide vane and the mass fuel rate, compressor mass bleeding, and outlet mass recirculation, were examined with constant and varying boiler pressures at varying steam flow rates. The test steam cycle was comprised of a heat recovery boiler (HRB), steam turbine, condenser, and feed pump. The HRB was modelled computing the heat transfer surface and gas- and steam-side pressure drops so that the HRB performance could be accurately determined with varying gas turbine exhaust gas flow rates and temperatures. The efficiency of the steam turbine was computed in relation to variations in the steam flow rate and the temperature and pressure inlet conditions.

40|$|The turbulent-flow {{throttles}} {{are used}} in pneumatic systems and gas-supply ones to restrict or measure gas mass flow. It is customary to install the throttles in joints of pipelines (in teejoints and cross tees) or in joints of pipelines with pneumatic automation devices Presently, in designing the pneumatic systems and gas-supply ones a gas mass flow through a throttle is calculated by a known equation derived from the Saint-Venant-Vantсel formula for the adiabatic flow of ideal gas through a nozzle from an unrestrictedly high capacity tank. Neglect of gas velocity at the <b>throttle</b> <b>inlet</b> {{is one of the}} assumptions taken {{in the development of the}} above equation. As may be seen in practice, in actual systems the diameters of the throttle and the pipe wherein it is mounted can be commensurable. Neglect of the inlet velocity therewith can result in an error when determining the required throttle diameter in design calculation and a flow rate in checking calculation, as well as when measuring a flow rate in the course of the test. The theoretical study has revealed that the flow velocity at the <b>throttle</b> <b>inlet</b> is responsible for two parameter values: the outlet flow velocity and the critical pressure ratio, which in turn determine the gas mass flow value. To calculate the gas mass flow, the dependencies are given in the paper, which allow taking into account the flow rate at the <b>throttle</b> <b>inlet.</b> The analysis of obtained dependencies has revealed that the degree of influence of inlet flow rate upon the mass flow is defined by two parameters: pressure ratio at the throttle and open area ratio of the throttle and the pipe wherein it is mounted. An analytical investigation has been pursued to evaluate the extent to which the gas mass flow through the throttle is affected by the inlet flow rate. The findings of the investigation and the indications for using the present dependencies are given in this paper. By and large the investigation allowed the conclusion that the inlet flow rate must be taken into account when calculating the gas mass flow through the throttles of pneumatic systems and gas supply systems...|$|R

It has been ascertained that work-holding of different workpiece materials and shapes during machining operation {{is one of the}} problems encountered during CNC milling machining operations. This work proposes a novel clamping strategy for workpieces with the aid of SCFC. The purpose of the study is to adjust the forward movement of the clamp and reduce the damage caused by the clamp on the workpiece, this depends on the material of the work-piece.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the analysis by a CFD code of coupled neutronic–thermal hydraulic instabilities in a subchannel slice {{belonging to a}} square lattice assembly. The work represents a further phase {{in the assessment of}} the suitability of CFD codes for studies of flow stability of supercritical fluids; the research started in previous work with the analysis of bare 2 D circular pipes and already addressed 3 D subchannel slices with no allowance for heat conduction or neutronic effects. In the present phase, a more realistic system is considered, dealing with a slice of a fuel assembly subchannel containing the regions of the pellet, the gap and the cladding and including also the effect of <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>throttling.</b> The adopted neutronic model is a point kinetics one, including six delayed neutron groups with global Doppler and fluid density feedbacks. The response of the model to perturbations applied starting from a steady-state condition at the rated power is compared with that of a similar model developed for a 1 D system code. Upward, horizontal and downward flow orientations are addressed making use of a uniform power profile and changing relevant parameters as the gap equivalent conductance and the density reactivity coefficient. A bottom-peaked power profile is also considered in the case of vertical upward flow. Though the adopted model can still be considered simple in comparison with actual details of fuel assemblies, the obtained results demonstrate the potential of the adopted methodology for more accurate analyses to be made with larger computational resources...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the SAE World Aviation Congress, Phoenix, AZ, November 5 - 7, 2002. Recent {{market studies}} {{indicate}} {{a renewed interest}} for a quiet Supersonic Business Jet (SBJ). The success of such a program will be strongly dependent upon the achievement of stringent engine noise, emissions and fuel consumption goals. This paper demonstrates the use of advanced design methods to develop a parametric design space exploration environment which will be ultimately used for the identification of an engine concept capable of satisfying acoustic levels imposed by FAR part 36 (stage IV) and NOx and CO 2 standards {{as stated in the}} 1996 ICAO. The engine performance is modeled through the use of Response Surface and Design of Experiments Techniques, enabling the designer/decision-maker to change initial engine parameter values to detect the effects of the responses in a time efficient manner. Engine performance and engine weight results are obtained through physics-based engine analysis codes developed by NASA. An SBJ airframe baseline model is used in conjunction with the engine performance data and executed through a synthesis and sizing code to simulate a supersonic mission. This paper focuses on the tradeoffs associated with noise, emissions and specific fuel consumption of the supersonic engine by employing design parameters such as overall pressure ratio, fan pressure ratio, turbine <b>inlet</b> temperature and <b>throttle</b> ratio. Finally, an optimal engine combination is created to satisfy all the constraints imposed by the aforementioned regulations for a particular mission configuration.

The compressor {{is powered by a}} 1400 hp AC motor and a variable frequency drive. The high operational speed is achieved through a 30. 46 : 1 speed increasing gearbox. ^ The drive system has been designed, manufactured, and assembled into the facility, and includes a driveshaft which interfaces the gearbox to the compressor, a drive housing which encloses the driveshaft and holds two sets of oil jets used to lubricate and cool the compressor rear bearing and driveshaft splines. The drive housing also aligns the compressor to the gearbox through the use of two pilots. The lubrication and cooling system has also been designed and installed and includes a boost pump, a scavenge pump, an oil reservoir, two air-over-oil heat exchangers, and a series of regulating and relief valves to control the oil pressure throughout the system. The inlet and exhaust piping have also been designed, which includes flow conditioning at the inlet of the compressor as well as an <b>inlet</b> bellmouth. A <b>throttle</b> has also been designed to control the flow of air through the compressor as well as provide a backpressure to simulate the operating conditions in a gas turbine engine. ^ All of the instrumentation has also been designed, calibrated, and installed into the facility. Some of the measurements integrated into the facility include mass flow measurements of the inlet and bleed flows of the compressor using Venturi and orifice flow meters, respectively. Inlet and exit rakes provide total temperature and total pressure data. Oil pressure and temperature measurements are also acquired throughout the system, as well as vibration measurements through the gearbox, drive housing, and compressor to monitor the health of the facility.
