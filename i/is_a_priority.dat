5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are serially monogamous. They {{have only}} one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating {{appears to be an}} influence, as there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year's partner.|$|E
5|$|Like her {{predecessor}} Rudd, Gillard {{had said}} that health <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> in her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, {{that there would be}} an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years. She also said mental health would be a priority in her second term, with a $277million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups. As the election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.|$|E
5|$|Austria and Switzerland {{are both}} {{members of the}} Partnership for Peace, and border NATO member states. Malta {{is also a member}} of the Partnership for Peace and the European Union. However, each country has a long-standing policy of neutrality. Cyprus is the only Member state of the European Union that is not a member of the Partnership for Peace, with any treaty blocked by Turkey's {{concerns}} regarding the Cyprus dispute. According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj, integration with NATO <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Hoxhaj stated in 2014 that the country's goal is to be a NATO member by 2022. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia, do not recognize Kosovo's independence. United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E

5|$|Research <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> {{in terms}} of {{improving}} women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress {{in terms of}} large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E
5|$|The Conservation Priority List (CPL) is the Conservancy's list of breeds {{for which}} {{conservation}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority.</b> Published annually, {{the list is}} used {{as the foundation for}} all conservation work done by the organization. Each year, it gathers population data on all breeds of livestock, including registration data and, for poultry, census numbers gathered from members, hatcheries and breeders. This data is then used to divide breeds into five categories: critical, threatened, watch, recovering and study. Breeds are placed in the first three categories based on annual registrations with breed registries in the United States and estimated global populations. Recovering breeds are those that have exceeded the numbers needed for the watch category but that the organization still wishes to monitor. Breeds in the study category lack genetic or historical documentation but are still considered to be of genetic interest. Population numbers may be lacking on these breeds, or proof that they are a true breed, instead of a type or non-true-breeding cross.|$|E

25|$|If FID forces {{take part}} in combat, one of their first {{activities}} tends to be teaching HN personnel how to call for close air support and artillery fires. The actual fire may come from HN or FID resources, or a combination.

Free-fire zones, such as used in Vietnam, can produce new insurgents faster than killing old ones.|$|E
