5|$|Animals {{such as the}} <b>flounder</b> {{have the}} ability to adapt their {{camouflage}} patterns to suit the background, and they do so extremely effectively, selecting patterns that match the spatial scales of the current background.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around San Antonio Bay. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have been caught in the bay: palmetto bass, striped bass, hardhead catfish, black drum, red drum, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, lefteye <b>flounder,</b> pinfish, spotted seatrout, and the sheepshead.|$|E
5|$|Animals such as chameleon, frog, {{flatfish}} such as {{the peacock}} <b>flounder,</b> squid and octopus actively change their skin patterns and colours using special chromatophore cells to resemble their current background, or, as in most chameleons, for signalling. However, Smith's dwarf chameleon does use active colour change for camouflage.|$|E
5000|$|Like all <b>flounders,</b> peacock <b>flounders</b> are {{masters of}} camouflage. They use cryptic {{coloration}} {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colors and patterns. In a study, peacock <b>flounders</b> demonstrated the ability to change colors in just eight seconds. They were even able to match the pattern of a checkerboard they were placed on. The changing of the colors is an extremely complex and not well understood process. It involves the <b>flounder's</b> vision and hormones. The <b>flounders</b> match {{the colors of the}} surface by releasing different pigments {{to the surface of the}} skin cells while leaving some of the cells white by suppressing those pigments. If one of the <b>flounder's</b> eyes is damaged or covered by sand, the <b>flounders</b> have difficulties in matching their colors to their surroundings. Whenever hunting or hiding from predators, the <b>flounders</b> bury themselves into the sand leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} (or armless) <b>flounders</b> {{are a small}} family, Achiropsettidae, of <b>flounders</b> {{found in}} Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters. There are four genera, each with one species.|$|R
50|$|Large-tooth <b>flounders</b> or sand <b>flounders</b> are a family, Paralichthyidae, of <b>flounders.</b> The family {{contains}} 14 genera with a {{total of}} about 110 species. They lie on the sea bed on their right side; both eyes are always {{on the left side of}} the head, while the Pleuronectidae usually (but not always) have their eyes on the right side of the head.|$|R
5|$|A prequel {{television}} series that originally aired from 1992 to 1994, depicts Ariel's {{life as a}} mermaid under the sea with Sebastian, <b>Flounder,</b> and her father. Ariel appears in all 31 episodes of the series, which is set an unspecified time before the first film. The series follows Ariel's adventures with her friends and family and sometimes has Ariel foiling the attempts of enemies that are intent on harming her or the kingdom of Atlantica.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the <b>flounder,</b> and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Disney Comics {{released}} a four-issue The Little Mermaid Limited Series comic book series. In 1994 Marvel Comics released its own title, Disney's The Little Mermaid, which ran for twelve issues. All these comics are prequels to the film, and feature Ariel a mermaid {{living under the}} sea having adventures with <b>Flounder</b> and Sebastian, and thwarting villains that wish to take over or destroy Atlantica.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is attained}} after age two, where the mean {{female and male}} lengths are 29 cm and 24 cm respectively. On average, female <b>flounders</b> have a faster growth rate and are longer and heavier than male <b>flounders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{couple were}} married but tragedy was to strike <b>Flounders</b> yet again — Mary, Flounders' sole heir and his obvious pride and joy, died in 1844, before a home which <b>Flounders</b> {{was to have}} funded and given to Mary and Lowe at Culmington was even built. <b>Flounders</b> and Lowe now really fell out — Major Lowe wanted Mary buried {{in a place of}} his choosing, <b>Flounders</b> wanted his dear {{daughter}} buried in the parish churchyard at Yarm in his native North-East, in the plot set out for himself and his family. Lowe had Mary buried there — but right against the church wall—so her father could never be laid next to her.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flounders</b> (Platichthysflesus) {{have a body}} geometry, {{which is}} adapted to a life on the sea bottom. When {{swimming}} the dorso-ventrally flattened body makes the flatfish to undulate its body vertical to the substratum. In addition the <b>flounders</b> use their dorsal and anal fin for propulsion as well, which stands in contrast to round fish. Due {{to the lack of}} a hydrostatic organ, <b>flounders</b> are heavier than water and need to produce lift while swimming. For this study, it was expected that <b>flounders</b> show significant differences in swimming kinematics compared to round fish. Comparison of the body and fin movements of the <b>flounders</b> was desirable to show a relation of the two propulsion systems. Juvenile <b>flounders</b> were filmed in side view at 125 frames s- 1 while swimming freely towards a food source. For analysing the wave characteristics of the undulatory movements, ten points on the upper body side, fifteen on the fin tip and fifteen points on the fin base were followed in time. Cubic splines were fitted through these points, to yield accurate estimates of the wave characteristics. The obtained lines indicate the movements of the body and the fin in space and time. Kinematic data were obtained following the methods of Videler and Wardle (1978). Three film sequences showing upward swimming of three different juvenile <b>flounders</b> were analysed. The following results were found: - The last two third of the body of all <b>flounders</b> were active, having about 1 to 1. 2 waves at once. - The fins were undulating over the whole length, with 1. 5 to 1. 9 waves at one time. - For the body the amplitude maximum was located at the tail. - For the fin, the maximum amplitude was found half way to two third of the fin length. - Differences were seen within and between the <b>flounders</b> in the tail beat amplitudes. - An interpretation was given about a possible steering component of the tail beat direction. - Wave speeds v varied quite strongly within and between the <b>flounders.</b> It indicated that the <b>flounders</b> have possibilities to alter their swimming style and are able to change quickly between wave speeds during swimming. - Differences in swimming movements of flatfish compared to round fish were: a smaller wave length lambda b, stride length lambda s and swimming efficiency, which make <b>flounders</b> bad forward swimmers. - The waves on the fins are not an artefact of the moving body, but the <b>flounders</b> appear to have two propulsing systems, the body and the fins. - The fins are moving in phase with the body, enlarging the moving surface and the effect of the waving propulsion. - Small differences in the movements are explained as complexity of the moving systems and can serve as steering components and stabilising factors. ...|$|R

5|$|The Environmental Protection Agency has {{designated}} the Corpus Christi Bay system as an estuary of national significance. More than 234 {{species of fish}} {{are found in the}} bay, including the Gafftopsail catfish, Hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic cutlassfish, Black drum, Red drum, Southern <b>flounder,</b> Crevalle jack, Ladyfish, Inshore lizardfish, Atlantic midshipman, Silver perch, Pinfish, Smooth puffer, Scaled sardine, Bighead searobin, Sand seatrout, Spotted seatrout, Sheepshead, Gray snapper, Common snook, and the Tripletail.|$|E
5|$|These {{are often}} called flukes, as most have flat rhomboid shapes {{like that of}} a <b>flounder</b> (Old English flóc). There are about 11,000 species, more than all other {{platyhelminthes}} combined, and second only to roundworms among parasites on metazoans. Adults usually have two holdfasts, a ring around the mouth and a larger sucker midway along what would be the underside in a free-living flatworm.|$|E
50|$|At {{around this}} time <b>Flounders</b> {{daughter}} Mary was engaged to marry a Major Arthur Lowe in London. <b>Flounders</b> did not wholeheartedly approve of the Major as Mary — his closest relative and family member — was to be 'taken from him' by this marriage.|$|R
5000|$|Sea angling {{is popular}} in the coastal villages. At Borth-y-Gest, <b>flounders,</b> bass, mullet, whiting and {{mackerel}} can all be caught. Morfa Bychan produces bass, <b>flounders,</b> eels, whiting and the occasional turbot. [...] Bass, <b>flounders</b> and huge numbers of whiting are found at Black Rock Sands, along with thornback ray, mackerel and garfish. [...] Bass, flatfish, eels and some very large mullet can be caught in Porthmadog Harbour, right {{in the heart of}} the town, though care must be taken to avoid taking the poisonous lesser weever.|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the <b>flounder</b> can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E
5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend <b>Flounder,</b> Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Tides cause {{seawater}} {{to enter}} {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), <b>flounder</b> (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.|$|E

The French and Bavarian commanders eventually agreed on a plan and decided to attack Eugene's smaller force. On 9 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces began to cross to the north bank of the Danube.|$|E
5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous and curious about the world of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk {{are not allowed to}} make contact with the human world. She and <b>Flounder</b> go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel {{falls in love with a}} human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} <b>Flounder,</b> her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E
