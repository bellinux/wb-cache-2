5|$|By this time, the fortifications {{had fallen}} into {{disrepair}} because the Swedish command did not {{pay much attention to}} these territories, and <b>funds</b> <b>that</b> were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed under the supervision of Captain L.

5|$|In Fischer v. United States (2000), the Court {{held that}} the {{jurisdictional}} requirement of $10,000 in federal funds can be satisfied by any <b>funds</b> <b>that</b> flow through the organization, for example Medicaid reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the patients. The only requirement is that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation, and that their receipt be in furtherance of a federal policy.|$|E

In 1887, the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was established at Texas A.M.C., enabling the college to gain more funding. Many residents of the state saw little need for two colleges in Texas, and some wanted to close the agricultural and mechanical school.|$|E

These donor/provider restrictions are usually communicated in writing and may be found in the terms of an agreement, government grant, will or gift.|$|E
5|$|Funding for the $1.9 billion project {{comes from}} a mix of funds contributed by the California Department of Transportation, California High-Speed Rail Authority, California cap and trade revenue, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, {{the city and county}} of San Francisco, SamTrans, and Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. 32% of the funding, or $647 million, will come from Federal Transit Administration's Core Capacity grant, with the funding {{agreement}} approved on May 22, 2017 after a three-month delay. An additional $600 million comes from Proposition 1A <b>funds</b> <b>that</b> authorized the construction of high-speed rail, $113 million from cap and trade revenue, and the rest coming from local and regional sources.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Vassar College in {{the town}} of Poughkeepsie, New York, {{completed}} Davison House, the fourth dorm in the college's residential quadrangle (quad).

5|$|In {{the early}} Western Han, a wealthy salt or iron industrialist, whether a {{semi-autonomous}} king or wealthy merchant, could boast <b>funds</b> <b>that</b> rivaled the imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand. This kept many peasants {{away from their}} farms and denied the government {{a significant portion of}} its land tax revenue. To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the monopolies. By Eastern Han times, the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations, as well as private businessmen.|$|E

In 1796 and 1803, Louis also used the diaries of Louis XVI's final attendants in the same way. In January 1801, Tsar Paul told Louis XVIII that he could no longer live in Russia. The court at Jelgava was so low on <b>funds</b> <b>that</b> it had to auction some of its possessions to afford the journey out of Russia. Marie-Thérèse even sold a diamond necklace that the Emperor Paul had given her as a wedding gift.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{proposals}} for {{completion of the}} tunnel have come from New York City Councilman Lewis Fidler, who has proposed 0.33% tax for the tri-state region {{to pay for the}} construction.

State Senator Diane Savino was among the supporters of the tunnel; Savino stated that if built, the tunnel would cost $3 billion and would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment.|$|E

Kenyatta lived in Kilimani, although financed the construction of a second home at Dagoretti; he referred to this latter hut as the Kinyata Stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighbourhood.

5|$|Netball is an Olympic {{recognised}} sport, {{a status}} attained in 1995 after a twenty-year period of lobbying. It {{has never been}} played at the Summer Olympics, but with recognition a formal requirement for inclusion is met. The absence at the Olympic Games was seen by the netball community as a hindrance to the global growth of the game, depriving it of media attention and funding. Inclusion is hampered, because it is mainly played by women, and mostly in Commonwealth countries. When the sport gained recognition, it opened up sources of <b>funds</b> <b>that</b> the global netball community {{had not been able}} to access before, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), national Olympic committees and sports organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E
5|$|The President of India is {{the supreme}} {{commander}} of the nation's armed forces; with 1.325 million active troops, they compose the world's third-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard. The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP. For the fiscal year spanning 2012–2013, US$40.44 billion was budgeted. According to a 2008 SIPRI report, India's annual military expenditure in terms of purchasing power stood at US$72.7 billion. In 2011, the annual defence budget increased by 11.6%, although {{this does not include}} <b>funds</b> <b>that</b> reach the military through other branches of government. , India is the world's largest arms importer; between 2007 and 2011, it accounted for 10% of funds spent on international arms purchases. Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase {{in direct proportion}} to improving travel times. The study concluded that {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from <b>funds</b> <b>that</b> had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be the top priority to make the rail line more palatable to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E
