50|$|A <b>hypereutectic</b> piston is an {{internal}} combustion engine piston cast using a <b>hypereutectic</b> alloy-that is, a metallic alloy which has a composition beyond the eutectic point. <b>Hypereutectic</b> pistons are made of an aluminum alloy which has much more silicon present than is soluble in aluminum at the operating temperature. <b>Hypereutectic</b> aluminum has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion, which allows engine designers to specify much tighter tolerances.|$|E
50|$|Compositions of {{eutectic}} {{systems that}} are not at the eutectic composition can be classified as hypoeutectic or <b>hypereutectic.</b> Hypoeutectic compositions are those with a smaller percent composition of species β and a greater composition of species α than the eutectic composition (E) while <b>hypereutectic</b> solutions are characterized as those with a higher composition of species β and a lower composition of species α than the eutectic composition. As the temperature of a non-eutectic composition is lowered the liquid mixture will precipitate one component of the mixture before the other.

5000|$|The [...] "4032" [...] {{performance}} piston alloy has a {{silicon content}} of approximately 11%. This {{means that it}} expands less than a piston with no silicon, but since the silicon is fully alloyed on a molecular level (eutectic), the alloy is less brittle and more flexible than a stock <b>hypereutectic</b> [...] "smog" [...] (low compression) piston. These pistons can survive mild detonation with less damage than stock pistons. 4032 and <b>hypereutectic</b> alloys have a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing tighter piston to cylinder bore fit at assembly temperature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypereutectic</b> pistons are {{stronger}} than more common cast aluminum pistons and used in many high performance applications. They are {{not as strong as}} forged pistons, but are much lower cost due to being cast.|$|E
5000|$|Alusil as a <b>hypereutectic</b> aluminium-silicon alloy (EN AC-AlSi17Cu4Mg / EN AC-48100 or A390) {{contains}} approximately 78% aluminium and 17% silicon. [...] This alloy {{was created}} in 1927 by Schweizer & Fehrenbach of Baden-Baden Germany and further developed by Kolbenschmidt.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1990-1991 model years a {{high-output}} 4.3L V6 was an available {{option for}} the Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari vans. The LU2 used unique <b>hypereutectic,</b> strutless pistons and a more aggressive camshaft. Like the LB4, the LU2 used throttle-body fuel injection, but was rated at [...] and [...] of torque. This engine was replaced in 1992 with the L35.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} five-bolt pentagonal {{cylinder head}} pattern {{was replaced with}} a square four-bolt design (much like the 64-90 Oldsmobile V8 [...] ), and the pistons are of the flat-topped variety (in the LS1, LS2, LS3, LS6, LS7, LQ9 and L33), while all other variants, including the new LS9 and LQ4 truck engine received a dished version of the GM <b>hypereutectic</b> piston.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypereutectic</b> alloys, with a {{silicon content}} of 16 to 19%, such as Alusil, {{can be used}} in high-wear {{applications}} such as pistons, cylinder liners and internal combustion engine blocks. The metal is etched after casting, exposing hard, wear-resistant silicon precipitates. The rest of the surface becomes slightly porous and retains oil. Overall this makes for an excellent bearing surface, and at lower cost than traditional bronze bearing bushes.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the end of}} the run near in 1992, Ford {{switched}} to cast <b>hypereutectic</b> pistons for all 302 cuin L engines and also re-rated the GT to [...] and [...] of torque. This estimate was more accurate given the previous power ratings were made before the addition of the mass air flow system, minor revisions in the camshaft profile, and other various small changes made throughout the production run.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hypereutectic</b> alloy {{also has}} {{different}} melting points. However, between these points, {{it is the}} constituent with the higher melting point that will be solid. Similarly, a hypereutectoid alloy has two critical temperatures. When cooling a hypereutectoid alloy from the upper transformation temperature, it will usually be the excess solutes that crystallize-out first, forming the proeutectoid. This continues until the concentration in the remaining alloy becomes eutectoid, which then crystallizes into a separate microstructure.|$|E
50|$|In {{the forging}} process, the rough casting {{is placed in}} a die set while it is still hot and semi-solid. A {{hydraulic}} press is used to place the rough slug under tremendous pressure. This removes any possible porosity, and also pushes the alloy grains together tighter than {{can be achieved by}} simple casting alone. The end result is a much stronger material. <b>Hypereutectic</b> pistons can be forged, but typically are only cast, because the extra expense of forging is not justified when cast pistons are considered strong enough for stock applications.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cylinder}} block remained basically the same. It {{was still a}} V-shaped, 90-degree design made of cast iron. The crankshaft, located {{to the bottom of}} the block by five main bearing caps, was cast nodular iron, and the eight connecting rods were forged steel. The pistons were cast aluminum, with a <b>hypereutectic</b> design. Cylinders were numbered from the front of the engine to the rear; cylinders 1, 3, 5 and 7 were found on the left (driver side) bank, or [...] "bank 1", with the even numbers on the other bank.|$|E

The engine is oversquare by design, with a bore size of 87.5 mm and stroke of 82.5 mm. It {{has proved to be a}} strong, reliable and smooth powerplant with features such as 6-bolt main bearings and belt-driven quad-camshafts. The water pump is also driven by the cam belt.

5000|$|The LS7 is a [...] engine, {{based on}} the Gen IV architecture. The block is changed, with sleeved {{cylinders}} in an aluminum block and a larger 4.125in (104.775mm) bore and longer 4.00in (101.6mm) stroke than the LS2. The small-block's 4.4 in bore spacing is retained, requiring pressed-in cylinder liners. The crankshaft and main bearing caps are forged steel for durability, the connecting rods are forged titanium, and the pistons are <b>hypereutectic.</b> The two-valve arrangement is retained, though the titanium intake valves by Del West have grown to 2.20 in and sodium-filled exhaust valves are up to 1.61 in.|$|E

50|$|If {{detonation}} {{is allowed}} to persist under extreme conditions or over many engine cycles, engine parts can be damaged or destroyed. The simplest deleterious effects are typically particle wear caused by moderate knocking, which may further ensue through the engine's oil system and cause wear on other parts before being trapped by the oil filter. Severe knocking can lead to catastrophic failure {{in the form of}} physical holes punched through the piston or cylinder head (i.e., rupture of the combustion chamber), either of which depressurizes the affected cylinder and introduces large metal fragments, fuel, and combustion products into the oil system. <b>Hypereutectic</b> pistons are known to break easily from such shock waves.|$|E

However, instead of the EJ207, the USA receives the first EJ257, a 2.5-liter version of the EJ207.

5000|$|In 1991 GMC {{introduced}} the GMC Syclone limited edition truck that used a turbocharged 4.3L V6. This engine used a Mitsubishi TD06-17C turbocharger, Garrett Water/Air intercooler and electronic multi-point fuel injection. Although GM made these {{modifications to the}} engine, it was still referred to with the RPO LB4 code. The majority of the naturally aspirated LB4's long-block was shared with the turbo version. However, the vehicles that used the 4.3L turbo engine also included RPO code ZR9. Internal engine upgrades included nodular iron main bearing caps, graphite composite head gaskets with stainless steel flanges and <b>hypereutectic</b> pistons which lowered the engine compression to 8.35:1. [...] A unique intake manifold that used the 48 mm twin-bore throttle body from the 5.7L TPI Corvette engine was used on the engine's top end.|$|E
50|$|From 1991 to 1998 the {{connecting}} rods were forged steel with standard type crank pin bearings. SOHC engines, for 1991-1998, used a dished piston design whereas the twin cam engines used a flat top piston with 2 recesses for the intake valves. Twin cam pistons received several re-designs from 1991-2002 {{aimed at reducing}} oil consumption issues. These included reducing the clearance between {{the top of the}} piston and the first compression ring, redesigning the skirts on the pistons and the oiling ports {{on the bottom of the}} pistons. For the 1999 model year all pistons were totally redesigned. Both engines used the flat top pistons with 2 valve recesses and featured a new <b>hypereutectic</b> design with coated skirts. Also for 1999 all connecting rods switched to a powder forged design and cracked bearing caps. The piston pins floated in {{the connecting}} rod bushings. The pistons were cast aluminum alloy with the piston pins being retained with snap rings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{material}} used for automotive pistons is aluminum {{due to its}} light weight, low cost, and acceptable strength. Although other elements may be present in smaller amounts, the alloying element of concern in aluminum for pistons is silicon. The point at which silicon is fully and exactly soluble in aluminum at operating temperatures is around 12%. Either more or less silicon than this will result in two separate phases in the solidified crystal structure of the metal. This is very common. When significantly more silicon {{is added to the}} aluminum than 12%, the properties of the aluminum change {{in a way that is}} useful for the purposes of pistons for combustion engines. However, at a blend of 25% silicon there is a significant reduction of strength in the metal, so <b>hypereutectic</b> pistons commonly use a level of silicon between 16% and 19%. Special moulds, casting, and cooling techniques are required to obtain uniformly dispersed silicon particles throughout the piston material.|$|E
5000|$|Ford {{introduced}} the Lightning in 1992 {{to compete with}} primarily the Chevrolet 454 SS, {{in an effort to}} enhance the sporty, personal-use image of the Ford F-Series pickup. This initial Lightning featured performance handling developed by world-champion driver Jackie Stewart. The Lightning was powered by a special [...] version of the 351 in3 L V8 engine. The Lightning shared its basic platform structure with the regular F-150, but modifications were made to many vehicle systems. To enhance the Lightning chassis, the thicker frame rails from the 4-wheel drive F-250 used to increase rigidity. The stock Lightning was capable of achieving 0.88 g lateral acceleration, yet it retained almost all the hauling and trailering capabilities of the parent F-Series. A 351 in3 L Windsor V8 producing 240 hp (179 kW) and 340 ft·lbf (461 N·m) of torque replaced the standard F-150 engine. The engine was based on an existing block, but Ford engineers fitted it with high flow rate [...] "GT40" [...] heads and used <b>hypereutectic</b> pistons to increase response, output and durability. The engine was also fitted with stainless steel [...] "shorty" [...] headers.|$|E

[...] The choice to use an Overhead valve (OHV) arrangement (also known as a pushrod engine) is unique in the luxury performance sedan market where competitors typically use dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) engines. The engine is produced in GM's Silao, Mexico engine assembly plant. The LSA engine has a bore and stroke of 4.06×3.62 inches (103.25×92.0 mm). [...] The engine block is cast aluminum 319-T5 alloy with cast-iron cylinder liners. The crankshaft is forged steel using powdered-metal connecting rods. Pistons are high-silicon <b>Hypereutectic</b> Aluminum alloy replacing the forged aluminum used in the LS9 engine. The compression ratio is 9.1:1. The cylinder heads are {{based on the}} Corvette's LS3 head and are cast from type 356-T6 Aluminum alloy. The exhaust manifolds are cast iron. The supercharger is a twin four-lobe screw compressor-type unit displacing 1.9 L.

5000|$|Most {{automotive}} engines use aluminum pistons {{that move}} in an iron cylinder. The average temperature of a piston crown in a gasoline engine during normal operation is typically about , and the coolant {{that runs through}} the engine block is usually regulated at approximately [...] Aluminum expands more than iron at this temperature range, so for the piston to fit the cylinder properly when at a normal operating temperature, the piston must have a loose fit when cold. In the 1970s, increasing concern over exhaust pollution caused the U.S. government to form the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began writing and enforcing rules that required automobile manufacturers to introduce changes that made their engines run cleaner. By the late 1980s, automobile exhaust pollution had been noticeably improved, but more stringent regulations forced car manufacturers to adopt the use of electronically controlled fuel injection and <b>hypereutectic</b> pistons. Regarding pistons, it was discovered that when an engine was cold during start-up, a small amount of fuel became trapped between the piston rings. As the engine warmed up, the piston expanded and expelled this small amount of fuel which added to the amount of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust.|$|E
