While there he encountered the young Arthur C. Clarke, who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station as the basis for his novel <b>Glide</b> <b>Path,</b> which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez.

Suddenly, the plane encountered an increasing downdraft (in other word; microburst), as it continued the approach. The pitch angle increased as it encountered the descending air mass. Computed airspeed decreased significantly as the autopilot tried to maintain the glide slope beam.|$|E

50|$|Air {{navigation}} systems {{usually have}} a moving map display and are often connected to the autopilot for en-route navigation. Cockpit-mounted GNSS receivers and glass cockpits are appearing in general aviation aircraft of all sizes, using technologies such as WAAS or LAAS to increase accuracy. Many of these systems may be certified for instrument flight rules navigation, and some {{can also be used}} for final approach and landing operations. Glider pilots use GNSS Flight Recorders to log GNSS data verifying their arrival at turn points in gliding competitions. Flight computers installed in many gliders also use GNSS to compute wind speed aloft, and <b>glide</b> <b>paths</b> to waypoints such as alternate airports or mountain passes, to aid en route decision making for cross-country soaring.|$|R

25|$|Almost {{one year}} after the accident, on 15 July 2011, the Security Council of Aeronáutica Civil {{concluded}} that the cause of the accident was the execution of the final approach below the <b>glide</b> <b>path,</b> due to an error of judgment by the crew who believed they were much higher. This is typical of a “black hole” illusion, which is experienced during a night approach to a low contrast runway environment surrounded by bright lights, aggravated by heavy rain. Aeronaútica Civil recommended retraining of the crew. Although the accident was caused by human error, Aeronaútica representative Colonel Carlos Silva reminded {{that the purpose of the}} investigation was not to apportion blame but to prevent aircraft accidents that may occur in the future.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War from 1941 to 1946 {{he served}} in the Royal Air Force as a radar {{specialist}} and was involved in the early-warning radar defence system, which contributed to the RAF's success during the Battle of Britain. Clarke spent most of his wartime service working on ground-controlled approach (GCA) radar, as documented in the semi-autobiographical <b>Glide</b> <b>Path,</b> his only non-science-fiction novel. Although GCA did not see much practical use during the war, it proved vital to the Berlin Airlift of 1948–1949 after several years of development. Clarke initially served in the ranks, and was a corporal instructor on radar at No. 2 Radio School, RAF Yatesbury in Wiltshire. He was commissioned as a pilot officer (technical branch) on 27 May 1943. He was promoted flying officer on 27 November 1943. He was appointed chief training instructor at RAF Honiley in Warwickshire and was demobilised with the rank of flight lieutenant.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} {{the development of}} feedback control for autonomous underwater gliders. Feedback is introduced to make the glider motion robust to disturbances and uncertainty. Our focus is on buoyancy-propelled, fixed-wing gliders with attitude controlled by means of active internal mass redistribution. We derive a nonlinear dynamic model of a nominal glider complete with hydrodynamic forces and coupling between the vehicle and the movable internal mass. We use this model to study stability and controllability of <b>glide</b> <b>paths</b> and to derive feedback control laws. For our analysis, we restrict to motion in the vertical plane and consider linear control laws. For illustration, we apply our methodology to a model of our own laboratory-scale underwater glider.

50|$|Blue sharks, {{like most}} pelagic sharks, tend to fare poorly in captivity. Attempts at keeping them using {{circular}} tanks with long <b>glide</b> <b>paths,</b> and pools with 3 m central depth gently ascending to zero depth {{have met with}} mixed results at best; most specimens last fewer than 30 days. As with other pelagic sharks, {{they seem to have}} trouble avoiding walls or other obstacles. In 1969, at Sea World San Diego, several blue sharks were put in circular tanks (15 m diameter, 2.1 m deep) for three months. The blue sharks did fairly well until bull sharks were added to the tank; the bull sharks ate the blue sharks. The captivity record for blue sharks as of 2008 was held by the New Jersey Aquarium for a specimen that lasted roughly seven months before expiring of an apparent bacterial infection.|$|R
25|$|According to the report, an {{instrument}} {{in the cockpit}} displayed false information, causing the aircraft to deviate from the prescribed flight path specified by the instrument landing system, flying above its <b>glide</b> <b>path.</b> As the aircraft broke free of the cloud cover and switched from instrument controlled flight to visual control, the captain presumably estimated the altitude incorrectly due to darkness and poor visibility, causing the aircraft to come in too far, which made the final approach too late. The captain decided to abort because the little remaining runway {{would not have been}} sufficient to allow for braking the aircraft. At this point, he maneuvered the Convair into an extreme flight attitude, leading to a stall and the aircraft striking the ground with its left wing first. The aircraft burned completely except for the tail section and the right wing. When the rescue team arrived they could only sort through the wreckage.|$|E

In contrast to traditional wealth management practices that rely on explicit assessments of individual risk aversion, platform-based investment management services can provide concise metrics that define individual risk aversion, but are computationally-intensive. Using a complete dataset obtained from the interaction of investors with investment management platforms, we provide a detailed insight into risk aversion by age, gender and reaction to investment performance history. We use a MapReduce model to efficiently gauge risk aversion levels in real-time to optimize individual <b>glide</b> <b>paths</b> and investment styles.

The instructor pilot stated that the PAPI indicated a deviation below the <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> at approximately 500 feet above ground level, and he attempted to correct it at that time.

The NTSB found that the [...] "Mismanagement of Approach and Inadequate Monitoring of Airspeed led to the Crash of Asiana flight 214". The NTSB determined that the flight crew mismanaged the initial approach and that the airplane was well above the desired glidepath. In response, the captain selected an inappropriate autopilot mode, which, without the captain's awareness, resulted in the autothrottle no longer controlling airspeed. The aircraft then descended below the desired <b>glide</b> <b>path</b> with the crew unaware of the decreasing airspeed. The attempted go-around was conducted below 100feet, by which time it was too late. Over-reliance on automation and lack of systems understanding by the pilots were cited as major factors contributing to the accident.|$|E

We call our approach the Dynamic Forecasting (DF) approach because it assumes that the retiree's portfolio will repeat its past performances in the future. Two variations on the DF approach are the relaxed DF approach and the alternate DF approach. These provide two opposite withdrawal structures while guaranteeing a 0 % probability of failure.

Pre- and post-instrumentation images were taken using macroscopic magnifier, layered by PaintShop Pro 9 software, and canal transportation was measured using Solidwork CAD 2014 in apical, middle and coronal levels. Data were analyzed using a General Linear Model with a 0. 05 significance level. ResultsWhen the number of uses only was considered, there were {{no statistically significant differences}} in transportation (F= 0. 453; p= 0. 808). No statistically significant differences were found in transportation in the interdependence influence of the locations and the number of uses of the files (F= 0. 746; p= 0. 691). There were statistically significant differences in this measure between the locations when all groups about number of uses (F= 22. 358; p< 0. 0005) were considered. The largest measures were seen at five and seven millimeters from the apex and the shortest ones in the apical area.

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{design of}} an {{underwater}} glider {{is an act}} of balancing the requirement for a streamlined, hydrodynamically effective shape and the consideration of the practical aspects of the intended operational envelope of the vehicle, such as its ability to deploy a wide range of sensors across the water column. Key challenges in arriving at a successful glider design are discussed {{and put them in the}} context of existing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) of this type. The design cycle of a new vehicle shape is then described. The discussed AUV will operate both as an buoyancy-propelled glider and a flight-style, propellerdriven submersible, utilising its large size to deliver substantial scientific payloads to remote locations to perform environmental monitoring, seabed survey, and exploration for sub-sea oil, gas and material deposits. Emphasis is put on using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods capable of predicting laminar-turbulent transition of the flow in order to estimate the performance of candidate designs and thus inform and guide the evolution of the vehicle. A range of considered shapes are therefore described and their hydrodynamic characteristics predicted using CFD are summarised. A final shape for the new glider is then proposed. This is then subject to an in-depth flow-field analysis which points out how natural laminar flow may be used as a means of drag reduction without compromising the practical aspects of the design, such as its ability to carry sufficient payload. Finally, the obtained data are used to project the expected <b>glide</b> <b>paths,</b> as well as give preliminary estimates of its range.
