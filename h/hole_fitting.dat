50|$|The AR-18's {{action is}} powered by a short-stroke gas piston above the barrel. The gas piston is of 3-piece design to {{facilitate}} disassembly, with a hollow forward section with 4 radial gas vent <b>holes</b> <b>fitting</b> around a stainless steel gas block projecting rearwards from the foresight housing. The gas is vented from the barrel and travelled via a vent through the foresight housing into the hollow front section of the piston, which causes it to move rearwards a short distance. The rear end of the piston emerges through the barrel extension to contact the forward face of the bolt carrier, causing it in turn to move rearwards. The bolt itself is of similar configuration to the AR-15 with 7 radial locking lugs engaging corresponding recesses in the barrel extension, and the extractor in place of the 8th lug. The bolt is moved {{into and out of the}} locked position via a cam pin that engaged a helical slot in the bolt carrier, which rides on two metal guide rods (each with its own return spring) instead of contacting the receiver walls, providing additional clearance for foreign matter entering the receiver. Unlike the AR-15, the cocking handle fits directly into a recess in the bolt carrier and reciprocates with it during firing, allowing the firer to force the breech closed or open if necessary. The cocking handle slot has a spring-loaded cover that can be closed by the user to prevent debris entering the receiver, and it will open automatically as the bolt carrier moves rearwards after the first shot. The recoil springs are housed within the receiver, differing from the AR-15 which houses its more elaborate buffer mechanism in the buttstock. The AR-18's compact design enables the use of a side-folding stock with a hinging mechanism (which proved to be less than adequately rigid).|$|R

However, one undeniable success of holography has been the celebrated duality that apparently exists between anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes and conformal field theories (CFTs); that is, the AdS/CFT correspondence [7, 8, 9]. It has, in fact, been argued (and demonstrated in many instances) that the horizon thermodynamics of a given n+ 2 dimensional AdS black hole can be identified with a certain n+ 1 -dimensional CFT.

40|$|We {{present a}} new, {{approximate}} method for modelling the acceleration and collimation of relativistic jets {{in the presence}} of gravity. This method is self-similar throughout the computational domain where gravitational effects are negligible and, where significant, self-similar within a flux tube. These solutions are applicable to jets launched from a small region (e. g. near the inner edge of an accretion disc). As implied by earlier work, the flow can converge on to the rotation axis, potentially creating a collimation shock. In this first version of the method, we derive the gravitational contribution to the relativistic equations by analogy with non-relativistic flow. This approach captures the relativistic kinetic gravitational mass of the flowing plasma, but not that due to internal thermal and magnetic energies. A more sophisticated treatment, derived from the basic general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical equations, is currently being developed. Here we present an initial exploration of parameter space, describing the effects the model parameters have on flow solutions and the location of the collimation shock.

40|$|We use {{a simple}} {{framework}} {{to calculate the}} time evolution of {{the composition of the}} fallback material onto a supermassive black hole arising from the tidal disruption of main sequence stars. We study stars with masses between 0. 8 and 3. 0 M_, at evolutionary stages from zero-age main sequence to terminal-age main sequence, built using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code. We show that most stars develop enhancements in nitrogen (^ 14 N) and depletions in carbon (^ 12 C) and oxygen (^ 16 O) over their lifetimes, and that these features are more pronounced for higher mass stars. We find that, in an accretion-powered tidal disruption flare, these features become prominent only after the time of peak of the fallback rate and appear at earlier times for stars of increasing mass. We postulate that no severe compositional changes resulting from the fallback material should be expected near peak {{for a wide range of}} stellar masses and, as such, are unable to explain the extreme helium-to-hydrogen line ratios observed in some TDEs. On the other hand, the resulting compositional changes could help explain the presence of nitrogen-rich features, which are currently only detected after peak. When combined with the shape of the light curve, the time evolution of the composition of the fallback material provides a clear method to help constrain the nature of the disrupted star.

These newly generated face instances can then be added to the morphable face model to build a more descriptive one. To avoid our bootstrapping algorithm from needlessly adding redundant face data, we incorporate a redundancy estimation algorithm.

We utilize up-to-date data reduction procedures and implement the recently developed, self-consistent model for X-ray reflection and relativistic ray tracing, relxill. In the very high and intermediate state, the rate of accretion is high and thus the disk remains close to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We require a common spin parameter and inclination when fitting the two observations since these parameters should remain constant across all states. This allows for the most accurate determination of the spin parameter of this galactic black <b>hole</b> binary from <b>fitting</b> the Fe Kα emission line and provides a chance to test previous estimates.

This spin value is consistent with previous high estimates for this object. Further, if the inner disk is aligned with the binary inclination, this modest inclination returns a high black hole mass, but they need not be aligned.

After learning the initial task all animals followed the same experimental protocol, first they had to retrieve this L shaped container, presented at the same orientation, through a tight <b>fitting</b> <b>hole</b> in a clear Perspex partition (level 1).

All octopuses were successful in reaching criterion in all levels of the task. At the onset of each new level the performance of the animals dropped, shown as an increase in working times. However, they adapted quickly so that overall working times were not significantly different between levels. Our findings indicate that octopuses show behavioral flexibility by quickly adapting to a change in a task.

Although our spin estimate depends on a single high quality spectrum, which was obtained in 1975 by OSO- 8, we are confident of our result because of the consistent values of the inner-disk radius that we have obtained for hundreds of observations of other sources: H 1743 - 322, XTE J 1550 - 564, and notably LMC X- 3. We have determined the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be a*= 0. 12 +/- 0. 19, with a* - 0. 59 at the 3 sigma level of confidence. This result takes into account all sources of observational and model-parameter uncertainties. Despite the low spin, the intensity and properties of the radio counterpart, both in outburst and quiescence, attest {{to the presence of}} a strong jet. If jets are driven by black hole spin, then current models indicate that jet power should be a steeply increasing function of a*. Consequently, the low spin of A 0620 [...] 00 suggests that its jet may be disk-driven. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figures, ApJL in pres...|$|R
40|$|We obtain {{estimates}} of Sgr A* accretion flow and black <b>hole</b> parameters by <b>fitting</b> polarized sub-mm observations with spectra computed using three-dimensional (3 D) general relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) (GRMHD) simulations. Observations are compiled from averages over many epochs from reports in 29 papers for estimating the mean fluxes Fnu, linear polarization (LP) fractions, circular polarization (CP) fractions, and electric vector position angles (EVPAs). GRMHD simulations are computed with dimensionless spins a_*= 0, 0. 5, 0. 7, 0. 9, 0. 98 over a 20, 000 M time interval. We perform fully self-consistent GR polarized radiative transfer using our new code {{to explore the}} effects of spin a_*, inclination angle θ, position angle (PA), accretion rate Mdot, and electron temperature Te (Te is reported for radius 6 M). By fitting the mean sub-mm fluxes and LP/CP fractions, we obtain estimates for these model parameters and determine the physical effects that could produce polarization signatures. Our best bet model has a_*= 0. 5, θ= 75 deg, PA= 115 deg, Mdot= 4. 6 * 10 ^- 8 M_Sun/year, and Te= 3. 1 * 10 ^ 10 K at 6 M. The sub-mm CP is mainly produced by Faraday conversion as modified by Faraday rotation, and the emission region size at 230 GHz {{is consistent with the}} VLBI size of 37 microas. Across all spins, model parameters are in the ranges θ= 42 deg- 75 deg, Mdot=(1. 4 - 7. 0) * 10 ^- 8 M_Sun/year, and Te=(3 - 4) * 10 ^ 10 K. Polarization is found both to help differentiate models and to introduce new observational constraints on the effects of the magnetic field that might not be fit by accretion models so-far considered.
