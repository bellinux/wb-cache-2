50|$|Whilst the Reverend Calvin O. Butts {{method was}} {{effective}} Rodríguez-Gerada, with Artfux, sought more {{creative ways to}} undermine the billboard consumption messages: by turning them into political messages of their own with ‘clever/cute’ interventions. That way they could borrow {{the legitimacy of the}} advertising itself and still reach the same audience the adverts were originally targeting.For example, Rodríguez-Gerada would morph the faces of cigarette models so they looked rancid and diseased. He then replaced the standard Surgeon General’s warning with his own messages: ‘Struggle General’s warning: Black and Latinos are the prime scapegoats for illegal drugs, and the prime target for legal ones’. With a deft détournement (an <b>image</b> <b>message</b> or artefact lifted out of its context to create a new meaning) a jammed ad might now speak about the negative effects of those products. Press releases were then sent out with photos of the exploits. Every time a newspaper, magazine or newscast gave them the platform to address these social ills Artfux considered it a victory.|$|E

The system aims at offering good {{security of the}} secret binary <b>image</b> <b>message</b> and the real-time performance {{that is very important}} for the speech calling of the telephone service. Therefore, we adopt a simple and effective encryption method for the secret binary <b>image</b> <b>message</b> prior to the embedding process. The embedding position is also protected by using a secret key. By using these methods, the requirement of short-term protection in the bursting phone call communication for the secret binary <b>image</b> <b>message</b> and the real-time encryption are both fulfilled. Furthermore, an information hiding algorithm based on vector quantization is proposed and the advantage of it is discussed. We evaluate the system with the ITU-T G. 729 a standard speech codec in StegoPhone, which is our platform for research on covert communication technology via PSTN. The experimental results show that our method has negligible hearing effects on the conversation speech and meet the requirement of the real-time calling conversation communication via PSTN...|$|E

It is a technique that is used for detecting the presence of hidden information in some cover media. Normally steganalysis is a challenging task when {{the pattern of the}} hidden information is unknown to the steganalysts. To deal with this, bit plane analysis is proposed in this paper. Bit planes of cover and stego images are analyzed by computing the difference of corresponding 8 bit planes so that one can clearly see hidden information with varying densities. Black regions of the image represent the value that is similar for both the images and the white regions represent hidden secret message.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} multifarious methods available for image steganography. The steganography is an art and science of invisible communication. The image steganography is divided into four basic terminologies viz. cover <b>image,</b> <b>message,</b> stego image, embedding and extracting algorithm. In this paper comparison of steganography with other security techniques is done. Image steganography technique is widely used technique to secure information utilized for covert communication, featured tagging, copyright protection, military agencies and for many more applications related to secure communications. Image steganography {{is divided into two}} domains, spatial and transform. For Spatial domain techniques like Least significant bit replacement and PVD based methods, the embedding capacity is more but sustainability against attacks on stego image is very less, so this technology need more attention to overcome the disadvantage of existing algorithms. The current research is going on transform domain techniques which provide good robustness against attacks. Here, comparative analysis of various image steganography methods is done considering various performance evaluation parameters like invisibility, payload capacity, robustness against attacks etc...|$|E

This paper proposes a significant comparative study of the spatial LSB domain technique that focuses on sharper edges of the color as well as gray scale images {{for the purpose of}} data hiding and hides secret message first in sharper edge regions and then in smooth regions of the <b>image.</b> <b>Message</b> embedding depends on content of the image and message size. The experimental results illustrate that, for low embedding rate the method hides the message in sharp edges of cover image to get better stego image visualization quality. For high embedding rate, smooth regions and edges of the cover image are used for the purpose of data hiding. In this steganography method, color image and textured kind of image preserves better visual quality of stego image. The novelty of the comparative study is that, it helps to analyze the efficiency and performance of the method as it gives better results because it directly works on color images instead of converting to gray scale image...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{introduce}} a robot-assisted surgical system for spinal posterior fixation that can automatically recognize the drilling state and stop potential cortical penetration with force and image {{information and to}} further evaluate the accuracy and safety of the robot for sheep vertebra pedicle screw placement. METHODS: The Robotic Spinal Surgery System (RSSS) was composed of an optical tracking system, a navigation and planning system, and a surgical robot equipped with a 6 -DOF force/torque sensor. The robot used the <b>image</b> <b>message</b> and force signals to sense the different operation states and to prevent potential cortical penetration in the pedicle screw insertion operation. To evaluate the accuracy and safety of the RSSS, 32 screw insertions were conducted. Furthermore, six trajectories were deliberately planned incorrectly to explore whether the robot could recognize the different drilling states and immediately prevent cortical penetration. RESULTS: All 32 pedicle screws {{were placed in the}} pedicle without any broken pedicle walls. Compared with the preoperative planning, the average deviations of the entry points in the axial and sagittal views were 0. 50 ± 0. 33 and 0. 65 ± 0. 40 mm, and the average deviations of the angles in the axial and sagittal views were 1. 9 ± 0. 82 ° and 1. 48 ± 1. 2 °.

In preparation for this assessment, the international modeling community is developing four Representative Concentration Path (RCP) scenarios developed by four Integrated Assessment Modeling teams (IAMs). The RCP scenarios include land-use changes and {{will be used as}} input to CMs. However, the diversity of approaches and requirements among IAMs and CMs for tracking land-use change, along with the dependence of model projections on land-use history, presents a challenge for effectively passing data between these communities and for smoothly transitioning from the historical estimates to future projections. Our goal is to bridge the two communities by developing a harmonized set of land-use scenarios that smoothly connects historical reconstructions of land- use with future projections, in the format required by CMs. We compute consistent global gridded maps of land-use activities and recovering lands as well as the underlying land-use transitions including the effects of wood harvest and shifting cultivation. We build upon the method of Hurtt et al. 2006 and use gridded historical maps of crop and pasture data from HYDE 3. 0 1500 - 2000 (Klein Goldewijk, in prep), historical national wood harvest and shifting cultivation estimates from Hurtt et al. 2006, future agricultural and wood harvest data from IAMs (AIM, <b>IMAGE,</b> <b>MESSAGE,</b> and MiniCAM) 2000 - 2100, and future climate and CO 2 data from IAMs. The resulting half degree gridded maps of subgrid-scale land-use and underlying transitions smoothly progress from past to future in a format that can be used as input into CMs. This harmonized set of products will provide the first consistent set of land-use change and emission scenarios in a consistent format for a large community of CMs to enable studies of the effects of gridded land-use changes on the global carbon-climate system...|$|E

40|$|The {{large and}} rapid {{development}} {{in the field of}} communications today represents one of the biggest interests among researchers. In fact, it has become a great revolution in the wireless communication and mobile Internet as an accelerating need to transfer data, such as voice, <b>image,</b> <b>message,</b> and video, in a faster, less expensive, and less complex manner. Hence, Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and Multi Carrier-Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) systems are examples of multi-carrier wireless communication. In general, several benefits are gained when multi-carrier systems emerge as an attractive standard for various digital data over radio systems. However, OFDM and MC-CDMA still suffer from peak to average power ratio (PAPR), which is a major drawback in most multi-carrier communications systems. In addition, channel estimation plays a very important role in overcoming the effect of channel fading, which causes BER degradation and jamming pilot symbols. Thus, this thesis introduces two important modifications in OFDM transceiver. First, a novel rotating phase shift (RPS) based on signal scrambling to reduce PAPR in OFDM system had been proposed. The search algorithm was used to solve the convex problem in selecting PAPR-RPS best phase shift factor based on the cost of computational complexity. Second, the Channel Estimation (CE) expressions were derived as the objective function to study the effect of perfect BER in MC-CDMA/OFDM for a frequency selective Rayleigh fading environment. Besides, the CE scheme based on a Local Search Algorithm was suggested. The simulation results of RPS were compared with various PAPR reduction schemes, such as selective mapping (SLM) technique and Partial Transmission Sequence (PTS), and furthermore, different phase shifts with slight computational complexity had been analyzed. As a result from the simulations carried out, the RSP displayed significant approximate by 85 % and 72 % for PAPR reduction at around 1. 5 dB compared to PTS and SLM techniques respectively. Furthermore, the local search channel estimation using number particles for each single swarm that had been used to identify the best fitness solution was computed from the average BER value. Besides, the proposed channel estimator was tested under fast fading channel in a multi-carrier communication system with and without interpolation methods. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed channel estimation of the MIMO-OFDM system had significantly provide better BER performance compared to other techniques at different modulation types, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values, and channel length. On top of that, the results showed that BER exhibited the best ratio at around 83 % and 78 % compared to MMSE and LSE algorithms, respectively. Finally, the proposed multi-carrier system, the MC-CDMA, and the OFDM were implemented in FPGA after it had been written by using the VHDL Language implemented in Xilinx ISE 14. 1 and also employed the Virtex- 4 FPGA board, which had been identical or close to the output of Matlab software environments...|$|E
