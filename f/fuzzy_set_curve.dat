40|$|Anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> {{based on}} invex set and its related {{properties}} were researched, and anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> and some {{results in the}} related references were generalized. By applying thought of invex <b>set</b> to anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set,</b> a new generalized anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> called anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set was proposed. Let A∈F(Rn), andA is called Anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set, whereη:Rn×Rn→Rn, and A(y+αη(x,y)) ≤A(x) ∨A(y),x,y∈Rn,α∈［ 0, 1 ］. Then, the relation between anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> and anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set was discussed. If η(x,y) =x－y, then anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set was degenerated into anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set,</b> and obviously, anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> was made particular case of anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set.</b> Anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set was not anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> by building an example, and anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set was a true generalization of anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set.</b> Thirdly, based on the definition of anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set, the properties about the union and denseness of anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set and the condition for <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> to be anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set were studied. Lastly, similarly to ant-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set, the conditions for <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> to be strongly anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex set and strictly anti-convex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> were respectively studied...|$|R

Type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> and complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> are both three {{dimensional}} extensions of type- 1 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets.</b> Complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> come in two forms, the standard form, postulated in 2002 by Ramot et al., and the 2011 innovation of pure complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets,</b> proposed by Tamir et al [...] In this paper we compare and contrast both forms of complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> with type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets,</b> as regards their rationales, applications, definitions, and structures. In addition, pure complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> are compared with type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> {{in relation to their}} inferencing operations. Complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> and type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> differ in their roles and applications; complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> are pertinent to inferencing where there is seasonality, and type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> are applicable to reasoning under uncertainty. Their definitions differ also, though there is equivalence between those of a pure complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> and a type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set.</b> Structural similarity is evident between these three- dimensional <b>sets.</b> Complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> are represented by a 3 –D line, and type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> by a 3 –D surface, but a surface is simply a generalisation of a line. This similarity is particularly apparent between pure complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> and type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets,</b> which are both mappings from the domain onto the unit square. However type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> were found not to be isomorphic to pure complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets.</b> The mechanisms by which complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> model and quantify periodicity, and type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> model and quantify uncertainty are discussed. A type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> can be represented as the union of its type- 2 embedded set. An embedded type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> is a type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> in itself, whose geomet- rical representation is a 3 -D line. Thus, geometrically an embedded type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> can be seen as equivalent to a pure complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> and therefore a type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> can be represented as the union of a collection pure complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets,</b> which in turn can be regarded as embedded complex <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> of a type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set.</b> This relationship is exploited to provide a complex definition of a type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set...</b>|$|R
