50|$|Therefore, {{an ideal}} helmet liner is stiff enough to {{decelerate}} the <b>impacting</b> <b>head</b> {{to an abrupt}} stop in a smooth uniform manner just before it completely crushes the liner and no stiffer. The required stiffness depends on the impact speed of the head, which is unknown {{at the time of}} manufacture of the helmet. The result is that the manufacturer must choose a likely speed of impact and optimize the helmet for that impact speed. If the helmet is in a real impact that is slower than the one for which it was designed, it will still help but the head will be decelerated a little more violently than was actually necessary given the available space between the inside and outside of the helmet, although that deceleration will still be much less than what it {{would have been in the}} absence of the helmet. If the impact is faster than the one the helmet was designed for, the head will completely crush the liner and slow down but not stop in the process. When the crush space of the liner runs out, the head will stop suddenly which is not ideal. However, in the absence of the helmet, the head would have been brought to a sudden stop from a higher speed causing more injury. Still, a helmet with a stiffer foam that stopped the head before the liner crush space ran out would have done a better job. So helmets help most in impacts at the speeds they were designed for, and continue to help but not as much in impacts that are at different speeds. In practice, motorcycle helmet manufacturers choose the impact speed they will design for based on the speed used in standard helmet tests. Most standard helmet tests use speeds between 4 and 7 m/s.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the current}} study was to study the {{kinematics}} of adult pedestrians and assess head injury risks based on real-world accidents. Methods: A total of 43 passenger car versus pedestrian accidents, in which the pedestrian's <b>head</b> <b>impacted</b> the windscreen, were selected from accident databases for simulation study. According to real-world accident investigation, accident reconstructions were conducted using multibody system (MBS) pedestrian and car models under MADYMO environment (Strasbourg University) to calculate <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> conditions in terms of <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> velocity, <b>head</b> position, and head orientation. Pedestrian <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> conditions from MADYMO simulation results were then used to set the initial conditions in a simulation of a head striking a windscreen using finite element (FE) approach. Results: The results showed strong correlations between vehicle <b>impact</b> velocity and <b>head</b> contact time, throw distance, and <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> velocity using a quadratic regression model. In the selected samples, the results indicated that Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2 + and AIS 3 + severe head injuries with probability of 50 percent were caused by <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> velocity at about 33 and 49 km/h, respectively. Further, the predicted head linear acceleration (head injury criterion, HIC) value, resultant angular velocity, and resultant angular acceleration for 50 percent probability of AIS 2 + and AIS 3 + head injury risk were 116 g, 825, 40 rad/s, 11, 368 rad/s(2) and 162 g, 1442, 55 rad/s, 18, 775 rad/s(2), respectively, and the predicted value of 50 percent probability of skull fracture was 135 g.

40|$|Football safety has {{increased}} over time, {{in part due}} to improvements in equipment and body mechanics, but there are still inherent risks involved, including exposure to repetitive <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> (RHI). Significant <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> can result in a constellation of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and amnesia, which typically assist in the diagnosis of concussion. However, {{it has been shown that}} subconcussive impacts may result in microstructural changes and physiological alterations in the brain. This is particularly concerning because athletes may be undergoing changes in the brain in the absence of outwardly visible symptoms. Poorer neurologic outcomes later in life have been associated with cumulative exposure rather than number of diagnosed concussions. Accelerometers installed in helmets have shown that college football players may receive up to 1, 850 <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> throughout the course of one season. The concussion rate is obviously much lower, indicating there are a high number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> per diagnosed concussion. Axons are especially susceptible to damage from RHI because of their extension throughout the nervous system. The subtle changes thought to result from RHI are not easy to measure, but several modalities have been proposed. These include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), plasma tau protein, and King-Devick testing. The proposed study will look to quantify cumulative <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> exposure in college football players prior to the start of a season and see if this has any impact on the variables.

40|$|Anti-personnel Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) {{are used}} to impart {{sufficient}} effect onto a person in order to deter uncivil, suspect or hazardous behaviour with a low prob- ability of permanent or fatal injury. They appear to be suitable for many law enforcement missions and {{to a certain extent}} to the military forces. In fact, in many situations of conflict, where the army and civil police are involved, the use of such weapons can ensure a minimal risk of collateral damage. The most used NLW are Kinetic Energy Non-Lethal Weapons (KENLW) that involve the shooting of a de- formable or breakable projectile with masses between 5 g to 140 g at initial velocities between 70 m/s and 160 m/s. Practically, KENLW are not used without risk for the targeted persons. The head zone represents the most critical part of the human body regarding non-lethal projectile impacts. The inflicted injuries can be severe and sometimes lead to death. The experts in the field should identify the limits in which KENLW should be effective without causing permanent or fatal injuries. Therefore, assessment methods should be developed in order to predict the injury risk of non-lethal <b>head</b> <b>impacts.</b> The present thesis proposes the development of three different approaches allowing the assessment of the non-lethal <b>head</b> <b>impacts.</b> The first approach named FW (Force wall) method has been developed at DGA (Direction Générale de l’Armement) - France. For a benchmark projectile, this method links the maximum <b>impact</b> <b>head</b> force to the maximum impact force mea- sured on a supposedly infinitely rigid structure, equipped with a piezoelectric force sensor. Three lesional thresholds: unconsciousness, meningeal damage and bone damage with coma are used. The FW method proposes the extension of the bench- mark projectile results to other projectiles using the assumption: two different pro- jectiles producing the same force on a rigid structure, will have the same effects on the head. This method is applied in the present thesis for different projectiles using a specific experimental setup. Different improvements have been achieved regarding the frequency analysis of the rigid structure and the quantification of uncertainties of the FW method. These improvements represent some original contributions of the present thesis. The second approach concerns the use of a mechanical surrogate in order to predict the maximum <b>impact</b> <b>head</b> force. The mechanical surrogate involved in the present study is BLSH (Ballistics Load Sensing Headform). Different tests have been performed using no less than eight commercial projectiles. The third approach uses numerical simulations with a validated FEHM (Fi- nite Element Head Model). SUFEHM (Strasbourg University Finite Element Head Model) is considered in the present thesis. The model offers the possibility to pre- dict head injuries using other parameters than the maximum <b>impact</b> <b>head</b> force: the strain energy and the Von Mises stress. A specific method is proposed in order to develop the FE (Finite Element) models of non-lethal projectiles. Six FE models of projectiles are used for the numerical simulations. Results show a good agreement between the three methods for the benchmark projectile. The extension of the FW method for other projectiles can be performed with some limitations mentioned in the present document. Moreover, there is a good agreement between BLSH and SUFEHM for all studied projectiles. Different correlations between the maximum <b>impact</b> <b>head</b> force and other criteria are also proposed in order to include them in the non-lethal <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> injury prediction. Ultimately, the present work proposes assessment methods for non-lethal projec- tile <b>head</b> <b>impacts.</b> The different details of these methods are given in the present document...|$|R

Talavage et al. have shown that several subjects in their cohort of high school football players exhibit substantial changes in their neural health due to subconcussive blows without developing any outward symptoms. They probed neural health through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Breedlove et al. subsequently demonstrated that changes in fMRI correlate with the number and location of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> experienced throughout the football season. ^ This work builds upon the analysis of Breedlove et al. Regression models based on an updated and expanded data set are presented. This analysis confirms that the number and location of subconcussive <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> are factors in eliciting deleterious changes in neural health as measured by fMRI. Further analysis indicates that the peak linear acceleration of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> is also a factor in eliciting changes in fMRI. Collectively, these results indicate that the subconcussive injury mechanism is analogous to mechanical fatigue or soft tissue overuse injury. Furthermore, comparison of player <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> based on position (i. e., linemen versus skill positions) indicates that player position may be a risk factor for subconcussive injury due to the large number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> characteristic of linemen. ^ These analyses help elucidate the connection between <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> biomechanics and subconcussive pathophysiology.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} assess the effect of bull bars on the head {{kinematics}} and <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> severity of an adult pedestrian in a collision. Multibody models were created to represent a range of sport-utility vehicles and common bull bar geometries and materials. The contact-impact behaviours of the pedestrian-vehicle interactions were determined {{from a series of}} impact tests with the vehicles and the bull bars being modelled. A generalised Hunt-Crossley damping model was fitted to the test data. The interaction models were implemented in MADYMO models of a vehicle pedestrian collision using the geometry of the vehicles and bull bars and a fiftieth percentile male human model. Head kinematics were extracted and the <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> severity estimated. The speed of the <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> with the bonnet was increased by between 7 and 55 percent in simulations where a bull bar was fitted to the vehicle. The increase in <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> velocity was not related to the bull bar material type. The 55 percent increase in <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> speed produced a 249 percent increase in HIC value, using a head-bonnet interaction model based on Australasian NCAP <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> test results. The location of the <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> was affected by the bull bar but the effect was not consistent. The simulation results show that the addition of a bull bar to the front of a vehicle increases the speed of the <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> with the bonnet. This speed increase appears to be less a product of the material the bull bar is made from, but more a product of the geometry of the bull bar. This suggests that bull bar geometries could be altered to improve pedestrian collision kinematics possibly even lessening the severity of the <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> with the bonnet. Combined with a soft material, such as polymer, this may lead to a safer bull bar designs for pedestrians. RWG Anderson, S Doecke, AL van den Berg, DJ Searson, G Pont...|$|R
