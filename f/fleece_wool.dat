50|$|The {{majority}} of the woollen fabrics of Kashmir, and particularly the best quality shawls, were and are still made of Pashm or Pashmina, which is the wool of Capra hircus, a species of the wild Asian mountain goat. Hence the shawls {{came to be called}} Pashmina. The fine fleece used for the shawls is that which grows under the rough, woolly, outer coat of the animal; that from the under-belly, which is shed on the approach of hot weather. Materials of an inferior grade were of the wool of the wild Himalayan mountain sheep or the Himalayan ibex. However, the best <b>fleece</b> <b>wool</b> is soft, silky and warm is of the wild goats, and painstakingly gathered from shrubs and rough rocks against which the animals rub off their fleece on the approach of summer. This was undoubtedly the soft <b>fleece</b> <b>wool</b> from which were made the famous and much coveted 'ring shawls' in Mughal times. Unfortunately very inferior and second rate wool taken from domesticated sheep and goats provide most of the wool used today on the looms of Kashmir.|$|E

50|$|Sheep {{shearing}} is {{the process}} by which the woolen fleece of a sheep is cut off. After shearing, the wool is separated into four main categories: fleece (which makes up the vast bulk), broken, bellies, and locks. The quality of fleeces is determined by a technique known as wool classing, whereby a qualified person called a wool classer groups wools of similar gradings together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep owner. In Australia before being auctioned, all Merino <b>fleece</b> <b>wool</b> is objectively measured for micron, yield (including the amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength, and sometimes color and comfort factor.|$|E
50|$|Wool colour: Indicates whether wool {{is able to}} be dyed {{in light}} shades. Colour may be graded {{depending}} upon the natural colour, impurities and various stains present. Severely stained wool decreases prices dramatically. However, {{it is difficult to}} assess colour accurately without proper measurement, since some stains will wash out in the processing, whereas others are quite persistent.The fleece is skirted to remove excess frib, seed and burr etc. to leave the fleece as reasonably even as possible in good respects. The parts of wool taken from a sheep are graded separately. The fleece forming the bulk of the yield is placed with other <b>fleece</b> <b>wool</b> as the main line, other pieces such as the neck, belly and skirtings (inferior wool from edges) are sold for such purposes where the shorter wools are required (for example: fillings, carpets, insulation). Whilst in some places crimp may determine which grade the fleece will be placed into, this subjective assessment is not always reliable and processors prefer that wools are measured objectively by qualified laboratories. Some of the superfine wool growers do in shed wool testing, but this can only be used as a guide. This enables wool classers to place wool into lines of a consistent quality. A shedhand, known as a wool presser, places the wool into approved wool packs in a wool press to produce a bale of wool that must meet regulations concerning its fastenings, length, weight and branding {{if it is to be}} sold at auction in Australasia. All Merino <b>fleece</b> <b>wool</b> sold at auction in Australia is objectively measured for fibre diameter, yield (including the amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength and sometimes colour.|$|E

50|$|For small flocks, a grazier {{might do}} the work single-handedly. For large flocks and stud sheep, graziers will hire shearers, or use a {{contractor}} who provides professional shearing teams to do the required work. The grazier would decide {{on the extent of}} crutching: the rear of the sheep is almost always shorn, whereas wool around the face, ears, underside and pizzle may also be removed depending on the circumstances such as the weather, length of fleece, and amount of seed or other impurities present in the fleece and the underlying reason for crutching (preventative of fly-strike, or to reduce the likelihood of stain in the <b>fleece</b> <b>wool).</b> Super fine wool Merino flocks are often given a light crutch, known as a New England crutch that removes less of the valuable fleece.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the entire}} fleece {{has been removed}} from the sheep, the fleece is thrown, clean side down, on to a wool table by a shed hand (commonly known in New Zealand and Australian sheds as a roustabout or roustie). The wool table top {{consists}} of slats spaced approximately 12 cm apart. This enables short pieces of wool, the locks and other debris, to gather beneath the table separately from the fleece. The fleece is then skirted by one or more wool rollers to remove the sweat fribs and other less desirable parts of the fleece. The removed pieces largely consist of shorter, seeded, burry or dusty wool etc. which is still useful in the industry. As such they are placed in separate containers and sold along with <b>fleece</b> <b>wool.</b> Other items removed from the fleece on the table, such as faeces, skin fragments or twigs and leaves, are discarded a short distance from the wool table so as not to contaminate the wool and fleece.|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{variation}} in the total population of fungi within sheep fleece in vivo with time, and also of the types of moulds and yeasts present within this environment. Fungi were isolated by dilution plating and by the brush technique at the two temperatures of 25 C and 37 C. Considerably larger numbers of fungi were isolated at the lower temperature. There was no apparent correlation between fungal numbers within <b>fleece</b> <b>wools</b> and the environmental rainfall, either at the time of sampling or on a monthly average basis. The total population of moulds able to grow at 25 C did, however, vary with the average monthly environmental temperature. No such correlation existed for moulds growing at 37 C nor yeasts at either temperature. Fungal numbers were unaffected by pretreatment of the sheep with commonly used insecticides variously applied, and seemed more related to general environmental conditions than to mode of pretreatment. Possible factors contributing to variations in the total fungal populations of <b>fleece</b> <b>wools</b> are discussed. The types of fungi isolated from wools could be grouped into very frequently isolated species, e. g. Alternaria alternata, Phoma spp., Torulopsis candida, frequent species, e. g. Mucor racemosus, Aspergillus fumigatus, occasional species, e. g. Cladosporium herbarum, Epicoccum purpurascens, Fusarium oxysporum and very occasional species, e. g. Aspergillus niger, Geotrichum candidum, Peyronellaea glomerata. A study of the spatial distribution of the fungi within the fleece was made by an impression technique involving both microscopic and cultural examinations. Most fungi were present in the median parts of the staple and numbers decreased towards the tips and basal parts of the fleece. Again, the most frequent types included Alternaria alternata, Fusarium culmorum and Phoma spp. Of the 68 isolated species, 19 were tested for their ability to degrade autoclaved and propylene oxide sterilised wool in vitro. While Aspergillus niger and Penicillium canescens were consistently unable to degrade either of the wools, most of the tested species degraded both autoclaved and propylene oxide sterilised wool. The degradation of wool by these fungi resulted in the release into the culture medium of cortical cells from the wool fibres. It is postulated that degradation occurred {{as a result of the}} breaking down of cementing materials holding the cortical cells together and did not involve true keratin digestion. Wool degraded by fungi was densely stained by lactophenol cotton blue. It is suggested that this activity could be useful in estimating the ability of fungi to degrade wool, even though undegraded wool was lightly and irregularly stained. As several fungi were shown to be capable of breaking down wool in vitro, further tests were made to determine which of these species are potentially able to grow within fleece in vivo. Of those able to grow at skin temperature and which were unaffected by the fatty materials present in wool, Sordaria fimicola. and Aureobasidium pullulans were the two species most likely to grow in the natural fleece environment. The significance of the work reported here is discussed. Many of the fungi commonly isolated from <b>fleece</b> <b>wools</b> have been reported to cause opportunistic fungal infections in man and animals and are also capable of spoiling refrigerated meats. Thus knowledge of the presence of these fungi in wools is necessary to help avoid problems in public health...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} of {{bacteriostatic}} agents used in sheep dips, the results of earlier relevant work were first reviewed. The literature relating to the microbiology of <b>fleece</b> <b>wool,</b> the chemicals {{that have been used}} in the control of arthropod ectoparasites of sheep, and the micro-organisms of the fleece that cause problems with plunge sheep dipping, and the in vitro methods of testing the sensitivity of bacteria to chemicals was studied. The seven bacteriostatic compounds selected for study were: lauryldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, a mixture of alkyl-, tolyl-, and methyl- trimethylammonium chlorides, 2 -hydroxypropylmethanethiosulphonate, 4 -chloro- 2 -cyclopentylphenol, 2, 2 '-dihydroxy- 3, 5, 6, 3 ', 5 ', 6 '-hexachlorodiphenylmethane, 3, 4, 4 '-trichlorocarbanilide, and an arsenical preparation containing sodium arsenite. They were evaluated against the following indicator organisms; Escherichia coli (Migula) Castellani and Chalmers 1919, a sulphur reducing strain of E. coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Schroeter) Migula 1919, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (Migula) Buchanan 1918, and Dermatophilus congolensis van Saceghem 1915, emend. 1916, 1934. The laboratory methods used to assess the activity of the compounds were; a broth dilution turbidimetric and agar subculture technique, an agar diffusion technique, a manometric technique, and a gradient plate procedure. A field trial was undertaken to relate the laboratory results to the practical sheep dipping situation. The quaternary ammonium compounds tested showed the greatest antibacterial activity, and their use as dip bacteriostats can be recommended. All the other compounds, except 3, 4, 4 '-trichlorocarbanilide, have possible applications for the control of specific microbiological problems of sheep dipping or in <b>fleece</b> <b>wool.</b> Some observations are made concerning the phenomenon of hormesis as shown in agar diffusion plates. Comparisons have been drawn between the methods used in this study and assessment of their value has been made.

The mini-commercial-consignments were sent to CSIRO, Textiles and Fibre Technology, Geelong and processed through to top using recommended CSIRO settings for 21. 5 micron wool. Utilising data from the FD profile, a fibre breakage model was developed which predicted the fibre length distribution of the top.

40|$|Abstract. A {{benchtop}} scouring {{procedure was}} used to evaluate the ability of conventional detergent scouring systems to adequately clean fleece samples from a selection of Western Australian Merino wools. Sixteen fleeces were selected from the Western Australian Department of Agriculture resource flocks, covering a wide range in yield (49. 2 to 77. 5 %), wax (7. 3 to 26. 9 %), suint (4. 9 to 11. 6 %), and dust (1. 4 to 16. 3 %) contents. Using a simple detergent-based system, 50 % of the fleeces were classified as effectively scoured, based on residual wax content. When scouring liquor was not refreshed between subsamples drawn from the same <b>fleece,</b> <b>wool</b> wax, staple length and dust content in the greasy fleece accounted for 93 % of the variation in the rate of residual wax increase observed in sequential 10 g samples of wool. Residual ash content also increased but the greasy fleece parameters measured were not statistically significant predictors of residual ash changes. The rate of scoured wool colour change, when sequential samples of greasy wool from the same fleece were scoured without liquor change, could be predicted from greasy fleece yields. The scouring efficiency of the more difficult to scour wools was improved by the addition of sodium carbonate to the main scouring bowls...|$|E
40|$|The conidia {{and resting}} hyphae of the {{northern}} anthracnose pathogen of Trifolium species, Kabatiella caulivora, were effectively carried by, and maintained long-term viability on, a range of materials, including metals, fabrics, woods and plastics. Conidia and hyphae became thick-walled and melanized with time. There were significant (P < 0. 001) differences in conidia/resting hyphae survival between carrier materials and between temperature regimes. At 23 °C/ 8 °C day/night, conidia and resting hyphae remained viable on steel, corrugated iron, galvanized steel, all tested fabrics, wood and random mixed materials for up to 8 months. At 36 °C/ 14 °C day/night, conidia and resting hyphae remained viable for up to 8 months, but only on cotton, denim, fleece, silk, leather, paper, plastic and all wood materials. At 45 °C/ 15 °C day/night, conidia and resting hyphae remained viable up to 8 months only on <b>fleece</b> <b>wool,</b> Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah wood) and paper. There were significant differences between carrier materials in their abilities to retain conidia and resting hyphae after washing (P < 0. 001). Metabolic activity was confirmed for conidia and resting hyphae recovered after 8 months and K. caulivora colonies successfully re-established on potato dextrose agar. Findings confirmed the critical importance of materials as long-term carriers of viable K. caulivora conidia and resting hyphae, highlighting the potential for spread of a highly virulent K. caulivora race within and outside Australia via farming equipment, clothing and other associated materials. Results also have wider biosecurity implications for the transportation of fungal-infested carrier materials previously considered as low risk...|$|E
