5|$|By fourteen, Sunday was {{shifting}} for himself. In Nevada, Iowa, {{he worked}} for Colonel John Scott, a former lieutenant governor, tending Shetland ponies and doing other farm chores. The Scotts provided Sunday a good home {{and the opportunity to}} attend Nevada High School. Although Sunday never received a high school diploma, by 1880 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> educated than many of his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} his two-year-old {{season with a}} record of five wins and a second place from six starts. At the end of the season, some even believed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> than his sire Ormonde, the 'horse of the century'. One writer rated him ten pounds superior to the next best two-year-old La Fleche, with her being one pound superior to Flyaway. Some were more cautious, however, suggesting that Orme had not beaten any top horses.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Arthur Miller Boyd (11 November 1923 − 14 February 2008) was an English {{professional}} footballer who played 333 matches in the Football League in the 1940s and 1950s. After {{serving in the}} Royal Navy during the Second World War, Boyd signed for Second Division club Plymouth Argyle, where he spent two seasons playing as an inside forward. When he began playing as a wing half, a position to which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> suited, he attracted attention, and soon secured a transfer to the First Division with Birmingham City for what was for Plymouth a record fee.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Grosmont's early years, {{but that he was}} born at Grosmont Castle in Grosmont, Monmouthshire, Wales, and that he was born c. 1310, not {{around the turn of the}} century as {{previously}} held. According to his own memoirs, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> at martial arts than at academic subjects, and did not learn to read until later in life. In 1330 he was knighted, and represented his father in parliament. The next year he is recorded as participating in a royal tournament at Cheapside.|$|E
5|$|He was an {{enthusiastic}} athlete, playing soccer, rugby and baseball as a child. His passion was for basketball {{and though he}} stood only five feet tall and was a poor player at the time, Fox sought to make his school team in grade eight. Bob McGill, Terry's physical education teacher and basketball coach at Mary Hill Junior High School, felt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> suited to be a distance runner and encouraged him {{to take up the}} sport. Fox had no desire for cross-country running, but took it up because he respected and wanted to please his coach. He was determined to continue playing basketball, even if he was the last substitute on the team. Fox played only one minute in his grade-eight season but dedicated his summers to improving his play. He became a regular player in grade nine and earned a starting position in grade ten. In grade 12, he won his high school's athlete of the year award jointly with his best friend Doug Alward.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son, {{also called}} Henry, {{was born at}} the castle of Grosmont in Monmouthshire between 1299 and 1314. According to the younger Henry's memoirs, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> at martial arts than {{academic}} subjects and did not learn to read until later in life. Henry was coeval with Edward III and was pivotal to his reign, becoming his best friend and most trusted commander. Henry was knighted in 1330, represented his father in parliament and fought in Edward's Scottish campaign. After {{the outbreak of the}} Hundred Years' War, Henry took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340. Later, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for Edward’s considerable debts. He remained hostage for a year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, he {{traveled}} to Liechtenstein with the Spain under-17 side for the 2010 UEFA European Football Championship in which Spain ended as runners-up to England. Jesé scored one goal at the tournament, netting the opener in Spain's 3–1 semi-final win over Turkey. Two years later, Jesé netted five goals during Spain's victorious 2012 European Under-19 Championship campaign in Estonia, including a hat trick against Portugal and the winning goal against Greece in the final. Jesé also received the Golden Boot award for ending as the competition's top goalscorer. The following year, Jesé scored a further five goals and assisted another for the Spanish under-20 team at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey. Spain were ultimately eliminated at hands of Uruguay in the quarter-finals but the nation's early exit from the competition did not prevent Jesé from earning the Bronze Boot award for ending as the tournament's third top goalscorer. His form at the tournament drew praise from Spanish journalist Guillem Balagué who claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> than Real Madrid's new world-record signing Gareth Bale was at the same age.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 Royal Rumble, Helms {{participated in}} an Open Invitational match for the Cruiserweight Championship and won, {{even though he was}} a Raw superstar and the {{championship}} was defended solely on SmackDown!. As a result, he returned to the SmackDown! brand in February 2006 to start a feud with Nunzio, Kid Kash and the other cruiserweights. During this time, Helms defeated Nunzio in a one-on-one match. The next week, he was supposed to defend against Kid Kash, but Kash was away on a family emergency, so Scotty 2 Hotty took his place. Helms defeated him and declared that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> than all the other cruiserweights. As a result, all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked Helms. It was later announced by SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long that at the No Way Out pay-per-view event, Helms would face all the cruiserweights in a match for the title. Helms was able to retain the championship. Later, Long mandated that Helms had to defend his title against a cruiserweight each week on SmackDown! to prove that he truly was better than all the cruiserweights. Helm's first defense under this new rule was against Psicosis of The Mexicools; Helms retained by cheating.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaur mania was {{exemplified}} by the fierce rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, both of whom raced {{to be the first}} to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the Bone Wars. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an Elasmosaurus skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> funded through a relationship with the US Geological Survey. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used dynamite to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, while Marsh's is on display at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.|$|E

5|$|Within weeks Jan {{was sent}} from the {{familiar}} surroundings of Klipfontein to a boarding house at Riebeek West, {{to take his}} brother's place {{at the school of}} Mr TC Stoffberg. As had been the case with his brother, his parents had already mapped out his future; like his brother Jan was destined for a future in the Dutch Reformed Church, to be ordained as a predikant at the conclusion of his studies. This vocation, though imposed upon him by his parents, was by no means regarded as an imposition by Jan, growing up as he had in an environment where adherence to the Church and piety of deeds counted for a good deal. This upbringing had turned twelve-year-old Jan into a deeply religious, serious-minded boy. Now, attending school for the first time, he faced a number of obstacles. Foremost amongst these was his rudimentary grasp of English, {{at a time when it}} was the main medium of instruction and crucial for any Afrikaner who wished to play a role in wider Cape society. Thanks to his mother's efforts. in this as well as in other subjects, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> prepared than most children in similar circumstances, but nevertheless he was to start his schooling alongside children many years younger than himself with many years of study separating him from his contemporaries.|$|E

As Coe was a well-known personality in Olympic sport, it was felt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> suited to the diplomatic finesse needed to secure the IOC's backing. Coe's presentation at the critical IOC meeting in July 2005 was viewed by commentators as being particularly effective, against tough competition from Paris and Madrid, and the London bid won the IOC's blessing on 6 July.|$|E
