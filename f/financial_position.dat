It relies fundamentally {{on the concept of}} risk measures, which are functionals defined on sets of <b>financial</b> <b>positions</b> and satisfying some basic properties. The convex risk measures are exactly those which guarantee that diversification does not increase risk. From the standpoint of individual investors risk measures may be interpreted as loss functions expressing the preferences on the respective sets of <b>financial</b> <b>positions.</b> Starting from this point of view, Föllmer and Schied succeeded in finding a kind of robust Savage representation for convex risk measures by probability contents [3]. They also gave a sufficient condition to achieve a representation by probability measures. One aim of the paper is to show the reverse direction of their result. Another subject of the paper is to weaken the criterion within the setting when the sets of scenarios are endowed with a metrizable topology, restoring an earlier attempt by Föllmer and Schied.

The studios were in a difficult <b>financial</b> <b>position</b> even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point.

40|$|Abstract. New policies, such {{as urban}} water trading, have been {{proposed}} to manage water allocation among households in the current water crisis. Intelligent Software Development’s (ISD) agent-based water network simulation, SIMULAIT WATER, was used to analyse urban water trading and water saving incentives. Agents represent households of various demographic types and their demand for water, modelling low, medium and high water users, or those in low, medium and high <b>financial</b> <b>positions,</b> respectively. Currently {{it is believed that}} charging a greater second tier price will provide an incentive for low water users to trade. Contrary to this notion, we found that further incentives were required to encourage low water users to trade. This could be achieved by reselling allocated water at a higher price than it is purchased. Such a scheme is also fairer because those in low <b>financial</b> <b>positions</b> will pay less as an incentive to save water, and those in high <b>financial</b> <b>positions</b> will have to pay more for traded water, also providing them an incentive to save water. Surprisingly we found that increasing the allocation of tradeable water could decrease overall water consumption. Finally we found that implementing a buyer administration fee rather than a seller fee when trading reduces water consumption of higher water users, and does not impact on households in low <b>financial</b> <b>positions</b> that use less water. The utility of SIMULAIT WATER has proven effective in analysing various pricing and trading structures that are financially beneficial and ultimately save water. The complex interdependencies of the many factors that influence water consumption and price makes SIMULAIT WATER critical in aiding with the analysis of this complex system. 1...|$|R

5|$|Watford's weak <b>financial</b> <b>position</b> {{was exposed}} in 2002–03, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} ITV Digital. The club was facing administration, but an agreement by players and staff to a 12% wage deferral helped the club's cash flow, and a run to the FA Cup semi-final generated vital revenue.

After consolidating in 2003–04, the following season started well, with the club in the upper half of the Championship at the end of September. Poor form, however, saw the club drop towards the relegation zone. Despite reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, Watford's league form did not improve, and Lewington was sacked in March 2005. His successor, Aidy Boothroyd, led the club to Championship survival.|$|E

5|$|Alfred Wallace {{was born}} in the Welsh village of Llanbadoc, near Usk, Monmouthshire. He was the seventh of nine {{children}} of Thomas Vere Wallace and Mary Anne Greenell. Mary Anne was English; Thomas Wallace was probably of Scottish ancestry. His family, like many Wallaces, claimed a connection to William Wallace, a leader of Scottish forces during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th century. Thomas Wallace graduated in law, but never practised law. He owned some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's <b>financial</b> <b>position.</b> His mother was from a middle-class English family from Hertford, north of London. When Wallace was five years old, his family moved to Hertford.
