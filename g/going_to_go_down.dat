25|$|The Colts {{came into}} Week 15 of the NFL season still undefeated, and this week's game {{featured}} the Colts playing the San Diego Chargers at home. San Diego started {{the game with}} 4 scores in the first 3 quarters of the game, before the Colts could even score. By the time the Colts finally put some points on the scoreboard, they were down 16–0 to the Chargers. Marty Schottenheimer and the Chargers {{were in the middle}} of a playoff hunt, and they were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> easy. But after San Diego jumped out to a 16-point lead, the Colts came back in the third quarter with three scores of their own, to put them up by one point at the beginning of the fourth quarter, 17–16. However, they were not able to score the rest of the game, and the Chargers scored twice in the fourth quarter, once on a field goal and another on an 83-yard touchdown run by RB Michael Turner. The loss to the Chargers was the first loss of the season for the Colts, but the last team to go 13–0, the 1998 Denver Broncos, lost their 14th and 15th games, before winning their last game of the season, and they went on to win Super Bowl XXXIII. The Colts had history in their favor, but Peyton Manning did not want to lose any more games during the 2005 season.|$|E

500|$|The band's lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump {{stated that}} the band had not planned to cover the song. [...] "Basically, I just started playing the riff in sound-check one day, and then we all started playing it, and then we started playing it live, and then we figured we'd record {{it and put it}} out with our live DVD." [...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on", he said. Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo. [...] "We were trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> as a legend", Wentz later noted.|$|E

500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the forfeit, Rainmen guard Joey Haywood recounted that the team had been {{approached}} by an unknown man at their hotel following the brawl. Haywood said, [...] "He was pacing around the lobby on his phone eyeing us. He {{then went to the}} ATM but didn't actually do anything. He went and sat in a parked car out front. We thought something was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday morning, and I get a message from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, telling me that my bags have been packed and all of my stuff has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E

60|$|One warm July {{evening the}} three of them were sitting under the Tree Lovers, feeling a little lonely. Nobody else had come near the valley that evening. Jem Blythe was away in Charlottetown, writing on his {{entrance}} examinations. Jerry and Walter Blythe were off for a sail on the harbour with old Captain Crawford. Nan and Di and Rilla and Shirley had gone down the harbour road to visit Kenneth and Persis Ford, who had come with their parents for a flying visit to the little old House of Dreams. Nan had asked Faith to go with them, but Faith had declined. She would never have admitted it, but she felt a little secret jealousy of Persis Ford, concerning whose wonderful beauty and city glamour she had heard a great deal. No, she wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> there and play second fiddle to anybody.

500|$|Folk metal {{has been}} {{associated}} with paganism ever since its inception, when Martin Walkyier left his former band Sabbat to form Skyclad, in part because the band [...] "wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> far enough <b>down</b> the pagan, British way that we wanted to do it." [...] Consequently, the lyrics of Skyclad have been known to deal with pagan matters. The band Cruachan was also founded by a self-described pagan, Keith Fay. For Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow, the label [...] "pagan metal" [...] is preferred [...] "because that describes the ideological points in the music, but doesn’t say anything about the music itself." [...] Other bands that also prefer to use the term [...] "pagan metal" [...] as a self-description include Cruachan, Eluveitie, Obtest and Skyforger. In contrast to bands with pagan themes, some folk metal bands such as Orphaned Land have themes of Abrahamic religion.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{of those}} same targets of {{criticism}} would later become fierce advocates of neoconservative policies. During 1992, referring to the first Iraq War, then United States Secretary of Defense and future Vice President Richard Cheney said: I would guess if we had gone in there, I would still have forces in Baghdad today. We'd be running the country. We {{would not have been}} able to get everybody out and bring everybody home....And the question in my mind is how many additional American casualties is Saddam Hussein worth? And the answer is not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the president made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> get bogged <b>down</b> in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.|$|R

50|$|In 1992, the US Defense Secretary {{during the}} war, Dick Cheney, {{made the same}} point:I would guess if we had gone in there, we would still have forces in Baghdad today. We'd be running the country. We {{would not have been}} able to get {{everybody}} out and bring everybody home.And the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of casualties. I don't think you could have done all of that without significant additional US casualties, and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war.And the question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties is Saddam (Hussein) worth? And the answer is, not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the President made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> get bogged <b>down</b> in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.Instead of a greater involvement of its own military, the US hoped that Saddam would be overthrown in an internal coup d'état.

It made me think, [...] "what are they so afraid of?" [...] It made me think about what scares them. Is it really four musicians from Los Angeles who've got a point of view? Is it really just this music and these rhythms and these words? Is that what they're scared of? I thought I'd think about it and you know what? My conclusion is this: nah, they ain't scared of us, they're scared of you! They're scared that you might come election time and throw Bush and Cheney and all them fascists out of power! That's what they're scared of!And let me say this: the Democrats are scared of you too! Because they know that you see through their bullshit too. Because when Bush was wiretapping, spying on citizens, torturing innocent people - {{they were supposed to be}} the people to defend us from them, and they didn't do shit! So the Democrats are scared of you too. Why? Because they know they're coming to power and they're taking it all for granted, but they're scared because they know that if they don't start fucking pulling troops from Iraq that you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and burn <b>down</b> every office of every Senator that doesn't do the job.Well I will say this, that the world is watching us now. The whole world is watching us. The brothers and sisters in South America who are dealing with this imperialist violence have got their eyes on us.
