5|$|A {{reported}} {{block on}} player transfers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>club,</b> {{set in place}} by the Hull City board on 28 July 2010 until transfers out would substantially reduce the £39million-per-year wage bill, at first cast doubt on the new manager's efforts to build a squad capable of a quick return to the Premier League; nevertheless, Pearson brought several transfers and loan signings <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>club</b> in his bid to strengthen the squad for the season's campaign. The team set a new club record on 12 March 2011 with 14 away matches unbeaten, breaking a previous record held for over 50 years. This 17-match streak was finally broken by Bristol City {{on the last day of}} the 2010–11 season, Hull losing the match 3–0.|$|E

He did not think the statue – or membership <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>club</b> – should have been given to a woman.|$|E
5|$|Since {{exiting the}} Premier League, Eddie Davies, the then {{owner of the}} club revoked his {{investment}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>club.</b> This led to published debts of almost £200m and bought the club very close to being wound up over unpaid tax bills owed to HMRC. As a gesture of his goodwill and as incentive to sell the club, Davies promised to wipe over £125m of debt owed to him when the club was sold, which wiped {{a significant proportion of}} debt the club owed.|$|E

5|$|After {{over a year}} of live shows, rehearsals and a {{recording}} of a demo (known as the Live Demonstration tape), the band's big break came in May 1993 when they were spotted by Creation Records co-owner Alan McGee. Oasis were invited to play a gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut club in Glasgow, Scotland, by a band called Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along {{with a group of}} friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club as they were not on that night's set list, which reportedly caused the band to bully their way in (although the band and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they managed to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>club).</b> They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see 18 Wheeler, one of his own bands. McGee was so impressed he offered them {{a recording}} contract; they however did not sign until several months later. Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis ended up signing a worldwide contract with Sony, which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is {{organised}} as {{a registered}} association. This means that Real Madrid {{is owned by}} its supporters who elect the club president. The club president cannot invest his own money <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>club</b> and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through merchandise sales, television rights and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, {{it is not possible}} to purchase shares in the club, but only membership. The members of Real Madrid, called socios, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. As of 2010, the club has 60,000 socios. At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.|$|E

The appointment of Kenny Jackett as manager on 6 November 2007, proving crucial. Over {{the course of the next}} two seasons Jackett led Millwall to two top six finishes in League One, in fifth and third place respectively. He won the League One Manager of the Month award three times while in charge of the club. Several of his key signings helped propel Millwall toward the play-offs, and eventual promotion. After a play-off final defeat in the 2008–09 season against Scunthorpe United and losing out on automatic promotion on the last day of the 2009–10 season to Leeds United by one point, Millwall made it back to Wembley, finally breaking the play-off hoodoo run of five successive failures in 1991, 1994, 2000, 2002 and 2009, with a 1–0 win in the 2010 League One play-off final against Swindon Town, securing a return to the Football League Championship after a four-year absence.|$|E
