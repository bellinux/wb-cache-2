50|$|An {{external}} gear is {{one with the}} teeth formed on the outer surface of a cylinder or cone. Conversely, an <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> is one with the teeth formed on the inner surface of a cylinder or cone. For bevel gears, an <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> is one with the pitch angle exceeding 90 degrees. Internal gears do not cause output shaft direction reversal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} focused on {{analysis}} of tooth-root strength of <b>internal</b> <b>gears.</b> Methods of calculation of the tooth-root stress of <b>internal</b> <b>gears</b> according to the ISO 6336 - 3 : 1996 and DIN 3990 - 3 : 1987 standards are briefly described. Reasons for potential errors in the strength calculations of <b>internal</b> <b>gears</b> performed {{in accordance with the}} ISO 6336 - 3 : 1996 and DIN 3990 - 3 : 1987 standards are discussed. Determination of the precise values of the parameters of the critical section and introducing them to use with the ISO 6336 - 3 : 1996 standard, proposed in the paper and called the modified ISO 6336 - 3 : 1996 method, is presented. Finite element analysis of various accurate models of <b>internal</b> <b>gears</b> is performed and location of critical section as well as its parameters are determined for all considered models of gears. On the grounds of results of precise finite element computations made for a large number of models of gears the influences of several main parameters of the machined gear and applied tool on the tooth-root strength of <b>internal</b> <b>gears</b> are investigated. General conclusions concerning the tooth-root strength of <b>internal</b> <b>gears</b> are formulated. They concentrate on the influences of several main parameters of the machined gear and tool on the tooth-root stresses of gear. They are useful for correct determination of the parameters of the critical section of the <b>internal</b> spur <b>gear</b> and for proper selection of the main parameters of the machined gear and applied tool...|$|R

40|$|For {{over forty}} years <b>internal</b> <b>gears</b> were {{surrounded}} by obscurity occasioned by the discovery of tip interference where calculation suggested {{that it would not}} occur (I) +. The present author developed a new theory for tip interference which gave better insight in the manufacturing process. <b>Internal</b> <b>gears</b> not satisfying rule (12) will be injured by the cutter at a centre distance still too low for involute geherating. This injuring phenomenon in an early stage of cutting is. called overcut. The overcut has to be neutralized by an increase of, the tooth spaces to such an amount that the final generating centre distance is larger than existing theories suggested. When rule (12) is satisfied, then there is no overcut and no tip interference...|$|R
