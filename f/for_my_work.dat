The notion of "believing" comes out as the focal point when analyzing and defining these concepts.

2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>work,</b> but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the onset}} of the First World War in September 1914, Kirchner volunteered for {{military}} service. In July 1915 he was sent to Halle an der Saale to train as a driver in the reserve unit of the 75th Mansfeld Field Artillery Regiment. Kirchner's riding instructor, Professor Hans Fehr, arranged for Kirchner to be discharged after a mental breakdown. [...] Kirchner then returned to Berlin and continued to work, producing many paintings including Self-Portrait as a Soldier (1915); in December 1915 he was admitted to Dr. Kohnstamm’s sanatorium in Königstein in Taunus, where he was diagnosed with a strong dependency on Veronal, and alcoholism. In a letter to Dr. Karl Hagemann, a friend and patron, Kirchner writes: [...] "After lengthy struggles I now find myself here for a time to put my mind into some kind of order. It is a terribly difficult thing, of course, to be among strangers so much of the day. But perhaps I’ll be able to see and create something new. For the time being, I would like more peace and absolute seclusion. Of course, I long more and more <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>work</b> and my studio. Theories may be all very well for keeping a spiritual balance, but they are grey and shadowy compared with work and life". Throughout 1916, Kirchner periodically returned to Berlin for a few weeks at a time to continue his work at his studio; he also produced a series of oil paintings, and many drawings, during his stays in Königstein. After an exhibition of his work in at the gallery of Ludwig Schames, in Frankfurt am Main, in October 1916, Kirchner sold many works and began to do well financially. In December, he suffered from a nervous breakdown and was admitted to Dr. Edel’s sanatorium in Berlin Charlottenburg.|$|E
