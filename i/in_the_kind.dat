Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure they were right? He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E

Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and {{had told him to}} have his men ready for work south of the river within a month. When told that Clark had no connection with the BSAC, Mubruma said that he would not give Clark the workers, but would readily take part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of scheme he had suggested if the Company wished. He made no comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Ralph's Spot {{was founded}} as a {{division}} of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. Bakshi was uninterested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of animation the studio was turning out, and wanted to produce something personal. He soon developed Heavy Traffic, a tale of inner-city street life. Krantz told Bakshi that Hollywood studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Krantz arranged a meeting with Crumb, during which Bakshi presented the drawings he had created while learning the artist's distinctive style {{to prove that he}} could adapt Crumb's artwork to animation. Impressed by Bakshi's tenacity, Crumb lent him one of his sketchbooks for reference.|$|E

5|$|To some extent, the {{difficulties}} both Gebhard and Ernst faced {{in winning the}} war were the same the Spanish had in subduing the Dutch Revolt. The protraction of the Spanish and Dutch war—80 years of bitter fighting interrupted by periodic truces while both sides gathered resources—lay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of war it was: Enemies lived in fortified towns defended by Italian-style bastions, which meant the towns {{had to be taken}} and then fortified and maintained. For both Gebhard and Ernst, as for the Spanish commanders in the nearby Lowlands, winning the war meant not only mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless cycle of enemy artillery fortresses, but also maintaining the army one had and defending all one's own possessions as they were acquired. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt in that respect, was also a war of sieges, not of assembled armies facing one another on the field of battle, nor of maneuver, feint, and parry that characterized wars two centuries earlier and later. These wars required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating. The Spanish faced another problem, distance, which gave them a distinct interest in intervening in the Cologne affair: the Electorate lay on the Rhine River, and the Spanish road.|$|E

25|$|Although the 8th Dalai Lama lived {{almost as}} long as the Seventh he was overshadowed by many {{contemporary}} lamas in terms of both religious and political accomplishment. According to Mullin, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama has pointed to certain indications that Jamphel Gyatso might not have been the incarnation of the Seventh Dalai Lama but of Jamyang Chojey, a disciple of Tsongkhapa and founder of Drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara. In any case, he mainly lived a quiet and unassuming life as a devoted and studious monk, uninvolved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of dramas that had surrounded his predecessors.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s saw {{something}} of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, {{as well as the}} hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis' critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly modal jazz and post-bop); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.|$|E

25|$|The Luftwaffe {{itself was}} {{essential}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of operations the German Army {{and its allies}} were going to fight. In the Inter-War period, the Luftwaffe developed its communications, aircraft, training programs, and to an extent its logistics to support mobile operations. Its primary mission was not direct close air support, but operational-level interdiction. This entailed attacking enemy logistics, communications, and air bases. Air raids on Soviet war-making potential were forbidden by Hitler. It made little sense to destroy industry that would soon be in Axis hands; the OKW {{did not believe the}} Soviets could transport the industry to the Ural Mountains. Counter-air operations were considered most important. In order for the German Army and Luftwaffe bombers to operate effectively in their roles, the first task of the Axis was to eliminate the Soviet air force and deny the enemy the means to interfere with their operations. Once these operations had been carried out, close air support could be rendered to the army. This had always been a core tenet of Luftwaffe doctrine. Once the A-A line had been reached, the Luftwaffe was to destroy the surviving factories in the Urals.|$|E

Leng also notes the [...] "clear climactic overtones" [...] evident in the choruses, where Harrison urges his lover to [...] "Let your hair hang all around me... / Let your love flow and astound me." [...] Musically, the composition features contrasting moods between the ethereal, ballad-like verses and the more strident choruses.|$|E

Chapters throughout this book have described details about the nature of many of the preceding changes. New fields of mathematical inquiry are emerging as important; and, new levels and types of abilities are replacing old notions of basic skills. Examples of the former include discrete mathematics and the mathematics of complex systems; and, examples of the latter often emphasize capabilities associated with description and explanation—even more than traditional abilities associated with computation and deduction...|$|R

Bakshi directed 1972's Fritz the Cat, an adaptation of Robert Crumb's comic strip of the same name. The financial success of Fritz the Cat allowed Bakshi to produce the film he had always intended to produce, and to focus on human characters rather than anthropomorphic animals.

[...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters was critical of Wyatt's vocal performance; he wrote that [...] "we really {{get a sense of}} how Wyatt's voice hinders the group".

500|$|... "The Wave" [...] is a piano-based electropop {{piece with}} a [...] "marching band vibe". Chris Schulz of The New Zealand Herald {{described}} it as an [...] "electro-anthem" [...] with a [...] "skittery dubstep throb". Instrumentation is provided by an autoharp, drums, handclaps, military drums, percussion and a piano. In an interview for Complex, Wyatt said that the song is built in [...] "tsunami form", stating that [...] "the real pay-off" [...] does not come until the final refrain. According to critic Josh Modell of Spin, the song [...] "dips its toes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of Brit-rock purveyed by Elbow but mixes in some organic, tribal fun à la Yeasayer". Wyatt sings with falsetto vocals, which Chris Martins of The A.V. Club thought recalled a [...] "sad-faced" [...] Peter Gabriel. In the chorus, Wyatt sings, [...] "My love won't be saved / We'll all be staring at the wave". Winnberg told Billboard that [...] "The Wave" [...] "kind of sums up a lot what Miike Snow is about".|$|E
500|$|The label {{had also}} been known for {{carrying}} out the management concept of [...] "condominium". Originally conceived and penned by Cowell, it gave artists authority and responsibility over their recorded material independently, {{as well as the}} ability to assign the master tapes over to the label for distribution. Strata-East artists had more control over their recordings than major labels at the time had offered. Music journalist Kevin Moist later wrote of the label's [...] "condominium" [...] concept, [...] "The idea was to try and develop an independent cultural space outside of the mainstream that could function self-sufficiently and be genuinely participatory for its members. The goal was to live in an engaged way where art, society, spirituality, and politics could all come together holistically in an integrated existence. That (sub)cultural renewal is embodied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of music midwifed by Strata-East." [...] The label's philosophy for artist management and recording ethic worked to the advantage of artists such as Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson. Scott-Heron and Jackson were able to release more aesthetically personalized recordings for Strata-East than most mainstream labels would allow.|$|E
500|$|Conceptual {{designs were}} created by Range Murata, who was given {{complete}} freedom to create the setting. He began drawing detailed sketches of machines and everyday objects from a daily newspaper. His research was given no constraints {{with the exception of}} production deadlines. Gonzo initially intended for Last Exile to be shown in a space setting, but producers did not want the characters to wear sterile space suits. Instead, the final product was described by Jonathan Mays as an [...] "ugly" [...] world of [...] "rusting bolts, lots of blues and grays." [...] Murata believed the design took [...] "the course the story had laid out". His character conceptualization included a great amount of time spent on costume design. Wanting to portray each character's personality more fully, he [...] "tried to draw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of material that would have been used in creating their clothes and try to represent the stitches connecting the fabric." [...] In contrast to crewmembers of the battleship Silvana who wear modern and utilitarian uniforms, other characters wear traditionally aristocratic attire. High amount of attention was given to character animation. Animators especially experienced difficulties with Alex Row's hair and flowing cape.|$|E
