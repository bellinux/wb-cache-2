5|$|On 11 March 1958, base {{personnel}} {{were the first}} members of the Air Force to land a B-52 in a wheels-up configuration at Westover AFB near Springfield, Massachusetts.

5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of <b>its</b> <b>wheels</b> and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E

5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over <b>its</b> <b>wheels.</b> This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} calculator in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced <b>its</b> <b>wheels</b> to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E
5|$|During {{their field}} trip, the bus from Springfield Elementary {{arrives at the}} Fort Springfield civil war site and skids into a cannon, {{knocking}} one of <b>its</b> <b>wheels</b> off. The cannon then points at the tower leg of a lookout, giving the impression that it will fire at the lookout and destroy it, which is {{a reference to the}} opening sequence of the television sitcom F Troop. The lookout was also modeled after the lookout in the show. The scene in which Ãœter is left behind {{at the end of the}} field trip is based on a scene from the 1965 film Von Ryan's Express.|$|E

25|$|Of the cars, {{the most}} popular was the carrus, a {{standard}} chariot form descending to the Romans from a greater antiquity. The top was open, the front closed. One survives in the Vatican. It carried a driver and a passenger. A carrus with two horses was a biga; three horses, a triga; and four horses a quadriga. The tyres were of iron. When not in use, <b>its</b> <b>wheels</b> were removed for easier storage.|$|E
25|$|A duplex {{locomotive}} is a {{steam locomotive}} that divides {{the driving force}} on <b>its</b> <b>wheels</b> by using two pairs of cylinders rigidly mounted to a single locomotive frame; {{it is not an}} articulated locomotive.

Johnson.|$|E

An onboard information control system (OICS) enables automatic control over the transmission, engine and other important parts of the BTR-90, and it is the first armoured personnel carrier to have such a system. A centralized tire pressure control system is also available, and allows the vehicle to move even if four of <b>its</b> <b>wheels</b> are destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Aldrich {{continued}} {{to serve in}} the Marine Corps Reserve postwar. He had almost 2,400 hours of flying time by early 1947.

On 3 May, Aldrich was given leave to visit his family in Chicago, but encountered engine trouble while en route to Naval Air Station Glenview. He attempted to land at Ashburn Airport, which was closed due to mud. His Corsair flipped over when <b>its</b> <b>wheels</b> touched the ground and Aldrich was killed. He was buried at the Oak Woods Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|As the Batman {{films were}} {{handed over to}} {{director}} Joel Schumacher from Tim Burton, the design for the Batmobile updated.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{applying}} of the controller in {{the suspension system}} of car. In {{order to deal with}} disturbances and uncertainties, the sliding mode control method {{has been used as a}} resistant method as well as a controlling method applied on system. This controller with a Quarter model of car uses the mathematical linear combination of an ideal model Sky-hook and an ideal model Ground-hook as a reference model that this reference model causes to simultaneously have both factors of the comfort of car passengers and more proper conductibility. Stimulation of the suspension system of car causes the effect of applied controller on the dynamics of carâ€™s cabin and dynamics of <b>its</b> <b>wheel.</b> In this paper, both stable and transient states have been used as the stimulation entering to the system and the effects of both states on dynamics of carâ€™s cabin and <b>its</b> <b>wheel</b> have been investigated. The obtained results show that there are states in which there is the equilibrium between the appropriate response of carâ€™s cabin and <b>its</b> <b>wheel.</b> This balance causes the shift in emphasis of reference model on the controllers of sky-hook and Ground-hook through changing the advantage of dual controller...|$|R
