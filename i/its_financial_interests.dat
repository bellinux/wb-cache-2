50|$|Until 1899 Bradley's chief work in {{the firm}} of Storey, Thorndike and Palmer had been to check the {{legality}} of bonds and then to handle the legal business of the Boston Fruit Company, the company of Andrew W. Preston, a Boston banana importer. In that year, however, he created the United Fruit Company by a merger of Preston's firm and the banana import business of Minor Cooper Keith. Bradley became a director and a permanent member of the executive committee, while his law partners were listed as executives. Their first move was to buy outright or buy an interest in 14 competitors. They now had a monopoly on the Costa Rican banana import business and controlled 80% of the entire business in the United States. These moves under Bradley's tutelage brought instant wealth to everyone concerned. The profits in 1899 were 1.6 million, and were up to 6.2 million by 1907. For all business purposes, Bradley was United Fruit. When the first anti-trust suit was brought against United Fruit in 1909, charging that it had created a monopoly and was using <b>its</b> <b>financial</b> <b>interests</b> in the competition (in this case the Bluefields Steamship Company) to suppress their business, Palmer, as secretary, was named along with Preston and Keith, {{the president and vice}} president.|$|E

As part of the deal, Square 37 Partners agreed to split revenues with Crown Hotels, giving the management firm 70 percent of the profits.

40|$|This thesis explores Taiwanese {{privatisation}} in {{the context}} of global neo-liberalisation. It is a study {{of the relationship between the}} state, capital and trade unions in relation to privatisation and the policy-making process in Taiwan and the Taiwan Railway in particular. It pays attention to exploring the three dimensions: first, how the state plays its role in the privatisation process second, what private capital does in order to extend <b>its</b> <b>financial</b> <b>interests</b> and third, whether trade unions have capacity to shape privatisation policies. The thesis draws upon extensive fieldwork that took place in Taiwan and the Taiwanese railway industry in particular between May 2005 and November 2007. It documents how Taiwanese public sector unions, dependent on the party-state system, sought to transform themselves into independent unions during the period of privatisation. Using qualitative and participant observation methods, including semi- structured interviews, fieldnote taking, and documentary analysis, this thesis provides, for the first time first-hand, rich, deep, holistic and contextual data on issues that had previously been hidden from public debate. These are discussed and analysed with particular reference to British and former Soviet Union's experience {{in the context}} of privatisation. Although the research was explicitly located {{in the context of}} Taiwan and the Taiwan Railway, it is hoped that it has more general significance. Taiwan's experience, until now neglected in debates on privatisation, could extend contemporary debates on the topic especially in relation to the various roles of the state, capital and trade unions. In particular, it raises for discussion the finding that under certain circumstances, instead of being marginalised by privatisation, certain trade unions could gain strong bargaining capacity, weakening the role of the state and private capital, and significantly shaping the policy process.

40|$|The {{increased}} demand and supply of logistics services {{bring together the}} logistics service providers (LSPs) and the companies that outsource logistics activities. LSPs stand in between those companies and their customers, thus playing an essential role for supply chain integration. If the two parties have different viewpoints of the processes in the supply chain, the fulfillment of the goal to satisfy the end customers may be hindered. The {{purpose of this article}} is two-fold: First, to investigate the characteristics of logistics outsourcing in Bulgaria from the perspectives of the logistics service providers and their customers, and more specifically, to compare their viewpoints concerning the motives for outsourcing, the methods and contents of communication and some relationship management aspects; Second, to assess the relations of the communication and relationship management aspects to customer satisfaction. This article is based on empirical data provided by 138 manufacturing and trading companies and 136 LSPs and collected through two structured questionnaires designed to address the researched issues. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the independent samples t-test. The research found that the service related reasons for logistics outsourcing are prevailing and that LSPs overestimate, compared to manufacturing and trading companies, motives related to service, organizational capabilities and relationships, while more manufacturing and trading companies concern as important the availability of logistics assets and the provision of value-added services. The research also found that both the LSPs and their customers consider that the extent of sharing of knowledge and information essential for material flow integration is very low and that the usage of team meetings and joint teams is quite rare. Also, customers do not view their relationships with the LSPs as so collaborative as viewed by the LSPs. Furthermore, the research proved the existence of positive relationships between customer satisfaction and communication through team meetings and joint teams, knowledge sharing concerning material flow management and relationship management issues such as trust, mutual problem solving, understanding the logistics strategy of the other party and respecting <b>its</b> <b>financial</b> <b>interests.</b> The research findings may help fill in some of the gaps between LSPs and their customers. They point the need for LSPs to include in their service offerings more value-added services and to invest in assets that provide reliable and flexible services for their customers. The research also highlights the importance of knowledge sharing and trust building and reveals great potential for effective trust-based alliances between LSPs and their customers that could help them extract more competitive benefits from their relationships...|$|E
40|$|Corporations are {{increasingly}} becoming political actors, which reflects in {{the utilization of}} CSR. A tendency is that {{the line between the}} private and public sector erodes, and MNCs increasingly take part in political assignments. The often close mutual influence between the state and powerful corporations, and corporate influence in state regulations, strengthens the political role of business. In this thesis, I investigate Telenor’s utilization of political CSR in Myanmar. I also investigate the role that the Norwegian state has in Telenor’s utilization of political CSR, and its interests and roles in Telenor’s Myanmar operations. The state-owned multinational Norwegian telecommunication firm Telenor was in 2012 awarded a license to operate in Myanmar’s newly opened economy. Myanmar is a highly important but challenging market, with recent democratic and economic reforms, low state capacity, political risks, corruption and poverty. I conduct a qualitative case study, largely based on secondary, and a content analysis. Telenor’s utilization of CSR in Myanmar involves several political elements, such as alleged attempts to contribute to economic growth and sustainable development, development projects and involvement with UN initiatives, governmental information and Myanmar’s regulatory framework to address low state capacity challenges. Although Telenor in many ways contribute to economic growth and development, Telenor does not publish how much tax it pays to Myanmar’s state, which is its largest potential to contribute to growth and progress. A further concern is that Telenor may, through its small-scale development projects and utilization of the UN’s name create and overestimated image of itself as a development actor. Telenor’s attempts to create its own regulations to address Myanmar’s lacking system to determine when Myanmar’s political authorities can ask for sensitive customer data can also be seen as challenging. While Telenor provides itself responsibilities beyond its mandate, it appears as Telenor {{has no choice but to}} interfere with political CSR elements in Myanmar, due to the country’s complex and challenging context and low state capacity. The Norwegian state has a strong financial interest in Telenor Myanmar, and expects Telenor to execute a strong CSR performance. However, the state does not interfere with Telenor’s CSR, thus having a limited role. The Norwegian state is also an established development and peace building actor in Telenor, suggesting overlapping roles and interests. Telenor and the Norwegian state have together executed influence on Myanmar’s regulations, specifically the telecommunications law. This may have contributed to enhancing Telenor’s position in Myanmar, and some argue that the Norwegian state utilizes development assistance in Myanmar to pursue <b>its</b> <b>financial</b> <b>interests</b> in Telenor. Overlapping posts between Telenor Myanmar and the Norwegian state’s representation in Myanmar also suggests that the roles and interests of the Norwegian state in Telenor’s Myanmar operations are unclear. The Norwegian state’s strong financial interest in Telenor, little involvement with Telenor’s CSR practises, overlapping roles and interests in Telenor and in Myanmar, the close ties between Telenor and the Norwegian state, and Telenor’s and the Norwegian state’s combined efforts to influence Myanmar’s regulations can contradict the Norwegian state’s policies for SEOs, thus undermining its democratic accountability. Moreover, this may undermine Myanmar’s procedural justice, facilitate unfair competition, lack transparency, and can harm reputation, and raises important questions whether the Norwegian state and Telenor are democratic accountable for citizens in Myanmar. However, whether many of these issues are legitimate depends on one’s ethical position. This illustrates the many complexities and grey areas within business ethics, CSR and the increasingly political role of corporations...|$|E
5000|$|Critics often claim {{abuse of}} {{administrative}} power over domain names. Particularly noteworthy was the VeriSign Site Finder system which redirected all unregistered [...]com and [...]net domains to a VeriSign webpage.

SiteFinder, at first, assumed every Internet query was for a website, and it monetized queries for incorrect domain names, taking the user to VeriSign's search site. Unfortunately, other applications, such as many implementations of email, treat a lack of response to a domain name query as an indication that the domain does not exist, and that the message can be treated as undeliverable. The original VeriSign implementation broke this assumption for mail, because it would always resolve an erroneous domain name to that of SiteFinder.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether ownership of MR imaging equipment by ordering physicians influences the frequency of negative cervical spine MR imaging findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 500 consecutive cervical spine MRIs ordered by 2 separate referring-physician groups serving the same geographic community. The first group owned the scanners used and received technical fees for their use, while the second group did not. Final reports were reviewed, and for each group, the percentage of negative study findings and the frequency of abnormalities were calculated. The number of concomitant shoulder MRIs was recorded. RESULTS: Five hundred MRIs meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed (250 with <b>financial</b> <b>interest,</b> 250 with no <b>financial</b> <b>interest).</b> Three hundred fifty-two had negative findings (190 with <b>financial</b> <b>interest,</b> 162 with no financial interest); there were 17. 3 % more scans with negative findings in the <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> group (P. 006).
