2500|$|For {{historical}} reasons, some organizations use {{the term}} systems programmer to describe a job function which would be more accurately termed systems administrator. [...] This is particularly true in organizations whose computer resources have historically been dominated by mainframes, although the term is even used to describe <b>job</b> <b>functions</b> which do not involve mainframes. This usage arose because administration of IBM mainframes often involved the writing of custom assembler code (IBM's Basic Assembly Language [...] (BAL)), which integrated with the operating system such as OS/MVS, DOS/VSE or VM/CMS. [...] Indeed, some IBM software products had substantial code contributions from customer programming staff. This type of programming is progressively less common, but the term systems programmer is still the de facto job title for staff directly administering IBM mainframes.|$|E

30|$|The Laozi’s idea is {{whatever}} we do must have a purpose in our job, purpose allows us to fulfil ourselves effectively and efficiently. Laozi uses the metaphor of people who occupy different jobs to illustrate impact of purpose on performance. A good passenger’s purpose is to leave no tracks and footprint wherever he travels; a good speaker’s purpose is to make no slips whenever he speaks; a good accountant’s purpose is to make no miscalculation even when he does not use calculator; a good locker’s purpose is to keep doors unlocked {{even if he does}} not use bolts; and a good knotter’s purpose is to keep knots untied even when he does not use ropes. Laozi’s idea in this passage is more concerned with job purpose instead of <b>job</b> <b>function.</b> In our modern business philosophy, job purpose is different from <b>job</b> <b>function.</b> <b>Job</b> <b>function</b> is the set of tasks a person performs in their role, whereas job purpose is the intended outcome of the job in terms of its impact on organization, community, customers, society or environment (Izzo & Vanderwielen, 2018). Those who have high purpose in their jobs and lives work effectively and efficiently are less prone to waste of resources. As a result, whatever they do {{have a positive impact on}} environment and society. The purpose-driven or effective leaders must understand the distinction between <b>job</b> <b>function</b> and <b>job</b> purpose, and instill a sense of purpose in their job and act on it.|$|R
