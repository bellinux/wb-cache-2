5|$|Nolan's {{films are}} rooted in <b>epistemological</b> and metaphysical themes, {{exploring}} human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His body of work is permeated by materialistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, practical special effects, innovative soundscapes, large-format film photography, and analogous relationships between visual language and narrative elements. In addition to his filmmaking, he is a vocal advocate for film preservation and the continued availability of film stock.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{objects are}} conceptually {{imported}} {{into the situation}} as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of <b>epistemological</b> footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its quasi-disinterest in pillage and treasure hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues {{with the intent of}} taking a piece separated {{from the rest of the}} statue without regard. It is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments undoubtedly represented an <b>epistemological</b> progress.|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel <b>epistemological</b> argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} {{about the use of}} the postmodern {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means to respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an <b>epistemological</b> grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are <b>epistemological</b> concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
5|$|The {{variety of}} {{positivism}} that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism. This approach eschews <b>epistemological</b> and metaphysical concerns (such as {{the nature of}} social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, replicability, reliability and validity. This positivism {{is more or less}} synonymous with quantitative research, and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.|$|E
25|$|Cartesian dualism and Popper's three {{worlds are}} {{two forms of}} what is called <b>epistemological</b> pluralism, that is the notion that {{different}} <b>epistemological</b> methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of <b>epistemological</b> pluralist dualism include psychophysical parallelism and epiphenomenalism. <b>Epistemological</b> pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is not reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 20th century, <b>epistemological</b> {{justifications}} {{based on}} induction, logic, pragmatism, and especially probability theory {{have become more}} popular among philosophers.|$|E
25|$|Aquinas' <b>epistemological</b> theory {{would later}} be {{classified}} as empiricism, for holding that sensations are a necessary step in acquiring knowledge, and that deductions cannot be made from pure reason.|$|E
25|$|However, such an <b>epistemological</b> or {{explanatory}} problem {{might indicate}} an underlying metaphysical issue—the non-physicality of qualia, {{even if not}} proven by conceivability arguments is far from ruled out.|$|E
25|$|One subject within {{philosophy}} of biology {{deals with the}} relationship between reductionism and holism, contending views with <b>epistemological</b> and methodological significance, but also with ethical and metaphysical connotations.|$|E
25|$|Although {{definitions}} {{and use of}} the terms have varied in the history of philosophy, they have consistently labeled two separate <b>epistemological</b> notions. See also the related distinctions: deductive/inductive, analytic/synthetic, necessary/contingent.|$|E
25|$|Philosophical Explanations is a 1981 metaphysical, <b>epistemological,</b> {{and ethical}} {{treatise}} by philosopher Robert Nozick. The work has received praise, and the sections in which Nozick discusses knowledge and scepticism have received much critical attention.|$|E
25|$|Despite the criticism, the {{influence}} of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American pragmatism, and modern Thomism. The influence has been particularly important concerning the <b>epistemological</b> importance of a sensus communis for any possibility of rational discussion between people.|$|E
25|$|An <b>epistemological</b> {{difference}} between most microeconomic modeling and these works {{is that the}} latter offer an opportunity to test implications of their theory in a quantitative manner. This opens up the possibility of comparison between experiments and world markets.|$|E
25|$|B-theorists {{maintain}} {{that the fact that}} we know much less about the future simply reflects an <b>epistemological</b> difference between the future and the past: the future is no less real than the past; we just know less about it.|$|E
25|$|Chaitanya Mahaprabhu {{has left}} one written record in Sanskrit called Siksastakam. Chaitanya's <b>epistemological,</b> {{theological}} and ontological teachings are summarised as ten roots or maxims (dasa mula). The statements of amnaya (scripture) are the chief proof. By these statements the following ten topics are taught.|$|E
25|$|This <b>epistemological</b> {{proposition}} of Charvakas was influential {{among various}} schools of in Indian philosophies, by demonstrating {{a new way}} of thinking and re-evaluation of past doctrines. Hindu, Buddhist and Jain scholars extensively deployed Charvaka insights on inference in rational re-examination of their own theories.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Bourdieu {{used the}} methodological and theoretical concepts of habitus and field {{in order to}} make an <b>epistemological</b> break with the prominent objective-subjective antinomy of the social sciences. He wanted to effectively unite social phenomenology and structuralism. Habitus and field are proposed to do so.|$|E
25|$|Against Albert Einstein {{and others}} who {{advocated}} determinism, indeterminism—championed by Eddington—says that a physical object has an ontologically undetermined component that is not due to the <b>epistemological</b> limitations of physicists' understanding. The uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, then, would not necessarily be due to hidden variables but to an indeterminism in nature itself.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the {{relationship}} between aprioricity, necessity, and analyticity {{is not easy to}} discern. However, most philosophers at least seem to agree that while the various distinctions may overlap, the notions are clearly not identical: the a priori/a posteriori distinction is <b>epistemological,</b> the analytic/synthetic distinction is linguistic, and the necessary/contingent distinction is metaphysical.|$|E
25|$|From a postcolonial and <b>epistemological</b> {{perspective}} obligating identity politics, Shenhav {{believes the}} Israeli society must become multi-ethnic and therefore multi-culturalist. Among his publications {{on the subject}} is the anthology Coloniality and the Postcolonial Condition which included translations of founding texts by writers such as Frantz Fanon, Homi K. Bhabha and Edward Said.|$|E
25|$|While Rorty shares Dewey’s {{commitment}} to debunk <b>epistemological</b> foundationalism, he (Rorty) {{believes that the}} notion of language is better suited to achieve this goal, than the notion of immediate, non-discursive experience preferred by Dewey. Rorty further says that Dewey’s theory itself collapses into a version of foundationalism, where immediate, non-discursive experience serves as evidence for particular knowledge claims.|$|E
25|$|Aquinas, {{father of}} Thomism, was immensely {{influential}} in Catholic Europe, placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation, {{and was one}} of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and <b>epistemological</b> writing. His work was a significant departure from the Neoplatonic and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early Scholasticism.|$|E
25|$|Relational constructivism can be {{perceived}} as a relational consequence of the radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the <b>epistemological</b> threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. self referentially operating cognition). Therefore, humans are not able to come to objective conclusions about the world.|$|E
25|$|The ancient scriptures of Hinduism are in Sanskrit. These {{texts are}} {{classified}} into two: Shruti and Smriti. Hindu scriptures were composed, memorized and transmitted verbally, across generations, for many centuries {{before they were}} written down. Over many centuries, sages refined the teachings and expanded the Shruti and Smriti, as well as developed Shastras with <b>epistemological</b> and metaphysical theories of six classical schools of Hinduism.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{demonstration}} of Pythagoras' theorem, the dialogue takes an <b>epistemological</b> turn when the interlocutors begin to discuss the fundamental nature of knowledge. The general question asked is how one can claim to know something when one does not even know what knowledge is. Via the Socratic method, it is shown {{that the answer to}} the question posed is innateness – one possesses a priori knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The <b>epistemological</b> {{foundations}} of Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge – perception and inference, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six (described elsewhere in this article). However, some Buddhists in history, {{have argued that}} Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's Śabda pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures {{as a form of}} inference method.|$|E
25|$|Developmental {{theories}} are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of <b>epistemological</b> beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) {{have been described}} in terms of gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Dr. David Gottlieb {{notes that}} many Kabbalists hold that the {{concepts}} of, e.g., a Heavenly Court or the Sitra Ahra are only given to humanity by God {{as a working}} model to understand His ways within our own <b>epistemological</b> limits. They reject {{the notion that a}} satan or angels actually exist. Others hold that non-divine spiritual entities were indeed created by God as a means for exacting his will.|$|E
25|$|By this account, {{there are}} no metaphysical or <b>epistemological</b> {{problems}} special to mathematics. The only worries left are the general worries about non-mathematical physics, and about fiction in general. Field's approach has been very influential, but is widely rejected. This is {{in part because of}} the requirement of strong fragments of second-order logic to carry out his reduction, and because the statement of conservativity seems to require quantification over abstract models or deductions.|$|E
25|$|Other {{proponents of}} {{behavioral}} economics note that neoclassical models {{often fail to}} predict outcomes in real world contexts. Behavioral insights can influence neoclassical models. Behavioral economists note that these revised models not only reach the same correct predictions as the traditional models, but also correctly predict some outcomes where the traditional models failed. The <b>epistemological,</b> ontological, and methodological components of behavioral economics are increasingly debated, in particular by historians of economics and economic methodologists.|$|E
