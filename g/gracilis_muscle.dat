2500|$|Two such ligaments are the {{superior}} pubic ligament [...] and the inferior pubic ligament, which {{provide the most}} stability; the anterior and posterior ligaments are weaker.

The superior pubic ligament connects together the two pubic bones superiorly, extending laterally as far as the pubic tubercles. The inferior ligament in the pubic arch is also known as the arcuate pubic ligament or subpubic ligament; it is a thick, triangular arch of ligamentous fibers, connecting together the two pubic bones below, and forming the upper boundary of the pubic arch. Above, it is blended with the interpubic fibrocartilaginous lamina; laterally, it is attached to the inferior rami of the pubic bones; below, it is free, and is separated from the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm by an opening through which the deep dorsal vein of the penis passes into the pelvis.|$|E

50|$|Based on the {{preference}} of the surgeon, the <b>gracilis</b> <b>muscle,</b> latissimus dorsi muscle, or pectoralis minor muscle {{are used as}} free neurovascular grafts. The <b>gracilis</b> <b>muscle</b> is mostly used free neurovascular muscle, {{because it has a}} reliable anatomy and is relatively simple to harvest. In addition, it can be trimmed for the correct size and volume with preservation of superior contraction qualities compared to bipennate muscles, because the gracilis is a parallel-fibered or strap muscle. Another advantage is the possibility for simultaneous dissection by a second team while the first team is preparing the face for the free muscle transplant.Another option for a free muscle transfer is the latissimus dorsi muscle. A disadvantage is that it can only be harvested with the patient in lateral decubitus or prone position. Therefore, the patient has to be turned during the operation. Advantages of the latissimus dorsi muscle are its reliable anatomy and relatively simple dissection. Analogue to the <b>gracilis</b> <b>muscle,</b> this muscle can be trimmed to the correct size and volume. The latissimus dorsi muscle is also a parallel-fibered muscle.

40|$|Background.

Hamstring harvesting procedures were performed by a senior orthopaedic surgeon on seven lower limbs from fresh-frozen specimens. Femoro-tibial kinematics and tendons excursion were simultaneously recorded at each steps of the surgery. Findings. No significant difference was demonstrated for excursions and moment arms after tenotomies and gracilis tendon harvesting (p > 0. 05).

50|$|In the 1950s {{described}} an operation using the <b>gracilis</b> <b>muscle</b> {{from the inner}} thigh and wrapping it around the anus {{to function as a}} new anal sphincter (neosphincter). Non dynamic graciloplasty was not particularly successful because the gracilis is mostly composed of type II, fast-twitch, fatiguable muscle fibres, whereas the sphincter ideally {{needs to be able to}} automatically contract for long periods. A neurostimulation device with an impulse generator can be implanted to adapt the muscle to prolonged contraction (dynamic graciloplasty). Over time, the muscle becomes mostly composed of type I, slow twitch, fatigue resistant fibres. The patient uses an external magnetic programming device to deactivate the electrical stimulation, relaxing the muscular contraction and enabling defecation at a voluntary time. Dynamic graciloplasty may be indicated for patients with a completely destroyed anal sphincter or a torn sphincter with a large gap between both ends that is not amenable to repair. The procedure involves detachment of the gracilis from the leg, preserving both its blood supply and innervation. The muscle is then moved to wrap around the anal canal completely, and also attached to the periosteum of the inferior ramus of the pubic bone. Various arrangements are described, depending upon the length of the gracilis. The implanted stimulator electrode is placed intramuscularly (within the muscle), very close to the gracilis nerve, and the impulse generator is placed subcutaneously (under the skin). The success rate of the operation is between 40-60%, and varies with surgeon experience. The complication rate is high, (infections 28%, device problems 15%, andleg pain 13%) but these are usually treatable without influence on the final result. A second operation may be required for some complications. When dynamic graciloplasty is successful in curing FI, up to 50% of patients may develop signs and symptoms of obstructed defecation.|$|E

METHODS:The outcomes of patients with brachial plexus injury who received <b>gracilis</b> functioning free <b>muscle</b> transplantation with either conventional end-to-end anastomosis or flow-through anastomosis from 2005 to 2013 were retrospectively compared. In the flow-through group, the pedicle comprised a segment of the profunda femoris and the nutrient artery of the gracilis. The recipient artery was interposed by the T-shaped pedicle. RESULTS:A total of 46 patients received flow-through anastomosis, and 25 patients received conventional end-to-end anastomosis. The surgical time was similar between the groups. The diameter of the arterial anastomosis in the flow-through group was significantly larger than that in the end-to-end group (3. 87 mm vs. 2. 06 mm, respectively, p< 0. 001), and there were significantly fewer cases of vascular compromise in the flow-through group (2 [4. 35 %] vs. 6 [24 %], respectively, p= 0. 019).
