5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to <b>find</b> <b>in</b> Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was an easy target for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{some circles}} within the US State Department viewed Arafat as an able diplomat and {{negotiator}} {{who could get}} support from many Arab governments at once.

5|$|A notable <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the Fosse Way burials was a Chi-Rho amulet, at {{the time}} thought {{to be from the}} 5th century, and {{considered}} to be among the earliest definite evidence of Christianity in England. A copy of the amulet was presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, by the churches of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Although the amulet is in the Museum of Somerset, analysis by Liverpool University in 2008 using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy demonstrated that it was a hoax, as its silver content dated to the 19th century or later.|$|E
5|$|Academic jobs {{in history}} were {{not easy to}} <b>find</b> <b>in</b> 1941, so Elliott joined the Civil Service, working in the Prices and Statistics Section of the Iron and Steel Control {{directorate}} in the Ministry of Supply.

There she became involved with the Official History of the Second World War, as assistant to Keith Hancock who was overall editor of the United Kingdom Civil Series of books within the Official History. As an official historian of the History of the Second World War: United Kingdom Civil Series, Gowing had access to unpublished official papers and files.

5|$|As {{in the oil}} sector, India's {{state-owned}} companies {{account for}} the bulk of natural gas production. ONGC and Oil India Ltd.

5|$|British mycologist Donald Dring, in his 1980 {{monograph}} on {{the family}} Clathraceae, wrote that C.ruber was not regarded highly in southern European folklore. He mentions a case of poisoning following its ingestion, reported by Barla in 1858, and notes that Ciro Pollini reported finding it growing on a human skull in a tomb in a deserted church. According to John Ramsbottom, Gascons consider the mushroom a cause of cancer; they will usually bury specimens they <b>find.</b> <b>In</b> other parts of France it has been reputed to produce skin rashes or cause convulsions.|$|E
5|$|Common titanium-containing {{minerals}} are anatase, brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, rutile, and titanite (sphene). Akaogiite is {{an extremely}} rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to <b>find</b> <b>in</b> high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ukraine. About 186,000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.|$|E

5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things to <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the woods {{and what can be}} made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E

5|$|Gatlif {{wanted to}} {{represent}} the entire Romani community through the characterization of Félix Lavil dit Taloche's naiveté and purity.

5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could <b>find</b> <b>in</b> real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
