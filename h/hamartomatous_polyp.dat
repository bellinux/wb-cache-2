40|$|Abstract Introduction A <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> without {{associated}} mucocutaneous pigmentation or {{a family}} history of Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome is diagnosed as a solitary Peutz-Jeghers type <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp.</b> As compared with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps are diagnosed with a lower risk of cancer and are regarded as a different disorder. Case presentation In case one, we describe an 84 -year-old Japanese man with a 14 mm duodenal polyp. Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed and histological examination showed findings suggestive of a <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> with a focus of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. In case two, we describe a 76 -year-old Japanese man who had been treated for prostate, rectal and lung cancer. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a duodenal polyp measuring 15 mm in diameter. Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed, and histological examination showed findings suggestive of a <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp.</b> Liver and thyroid cancers were found after the endoscopic treatment. Conclusion Although duodenal solitary hamartomatous polyps are associated with a lower risk of cancer, four patients, including our cases, have been diagnosed with cancerous polyps. Patients with duodenal solitary hamartomatous polyps should be treated by endoscopic or surgical resection and need whole-body screening. </p...|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with the}} Peutz-Jeghers {{syndrome}} carry a slight, though definite, {{increased risk of}} gastrointestinal carcinoma. The malignant potentiality of Peutz-Jeghers <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps,</b> generally considered benign, is supported by this report. Two cases of metastasising gastrointestinal carcinoma associated with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are described in a 56 year old female and her 29 year old son. Both mother and son died from duodenal and gastric carcinomas respectively, which developed in <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> with extensive metastases. Both cases also showed dysplastic areas within <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> These features indicate that <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> may, in some cases, be the precursors of digestive tract carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|Most <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> in {{the stomach}} occur in {{patients}} with adenomatous polyposis coli and dysplasia. The authors report {{a case of a}} 57 -year-old man without prior history of polyposis coli who presented with adenocarcinomas derived from <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> {{in the stomach}}. The patient underwent a radical subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth I anastomosis. Pathology revealed adenocarcinomas with moderate differentiation without evidence of lymph node metastasis in 60 nodes. We report a case of gastric cancers arising from de novo gastric <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Gastric polyps are {{frequently}} encountered on endoscopic examinations. While {{many of these}} represent true epithelial lesions, some of the polyps may result from underlying stromal or lymphoid proliferations or even heterotopic tissue. Histologic examination is essential for accurate typing of the polyps to predict malignant potential and underlying possible genetic abnormalities. The focus of this review is on gastric <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps,</b> which are relatively rare and diagnostically challenging. Though most of the gastric <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> are benign, certain types are associated with increased malignant potential. These include certain polyps associated with specific genetic familial polyposis syndromes and gastric inverted <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> Identification of these polyps can result in the prevention or early diagnosis of gastric carcinoma and also help {{in the identification of}} family members with polyposis syndromes. The aim of this review is to categorize gastric <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> and aid in the identification of high-risk categories...|$|R
40|$|A solitary Peutz-Jeghers-type <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> in the {{duodenum}} is rare, and few {{reports have}} described its characteristic endoscopic features. We describe three cases of solitary Peutz-Jeghers-type <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> and their endoscopic findings in detail. The polyp {{in all of}} our three cases showed an irregularly lobular or nodular surface, whereas adenomas often show a regularly nodular or granular surface. The color of the polyp was whitish {{in all of our}} cases. In the present cases, close observation by endoscopy revealed that the solitary Peutz-Jeghers-type hamartomatous polyps looked whitish {{because of the presence of}} diffusely scattered white spots on the surface of the polyps. Duodenal polyps that exhibit the aforementioned endoscopic characteristics may be diagnosed as Peutz-Jeghers-type hamartomatous polyps and treated by polypectomy because of the malignant potential...|$|E
40|$|Volvulus and {{intussusception}} {{are rare}} conditions in children. We describe an unusual case of intussusception {{due to a}} solitary Peutz-Jeghers type <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> complicated by volvulus, which occurred in an 11 -year-old girl. A laparotomy allows to successfully treat the pathology. The postoperative course was favourable. We discuss the clinical findings and {{the values of the}} preoperative instrumental diagnosis. The literature is reviewed. Identifying a midgut volvulus, as complication of a small bowel intussusception, during the diagnostic phase could help in choosing the most appropriate surgical approach...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCongenital perianal masses, {{distinct}} from sacrococcygeal teratomas, are a rare entity and are minimally reported in literature. A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who {{presented to the}} Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) with a benign pedunculated perianal mass between April 2014 and June 2015. Three patients fulfilling these criteria underwent elective resection either under general or local anesthesia. The first patient's mass was diagnosed as a benign acrochordon, or skin tag. The midline location of this mass prompted a spinal MRI revealing a low-lying conus and fibrolipoma of the filum terminale. The patient underwent prophylactic laminectomy and transection of the filum terminale and he currently remains asymptomatic. The second patient {{was found to have}} a <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> and later developed scrotal and perirectal vascular malformations and was treated successfully with topical timolol. Our third patient presented with a hamartomatous lesion and underwent a colonoscopy and stool studies, both of which were negative. We present these cases to bring awareness to this clinically important entity and to the associated anomalies and work-up that should be considered...|$|E

40|$|Peutz-Jeghers {{syndrome}} {{was diagnosed}} in a 51 -year-old woman presenting with iron deficiency anaemia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed several <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> in the stomach, duodenum and colon, which were removed. At a combined surgical-endoscopic procedure, 42 <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> {{were removed from}} the small intestine by snare polypectomy. This enteroscopic procedure reduces symptoms, may protect against future intestinal obstructive episodes and their associated surgery, and may reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal malignancy...|$|R
40|$|McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS) {{is a rare}} {{sporadic}} syndrome {{caused by}} post-zygotic mutations in the GNAS oncogene, leading to constitutional mosaicism for these alterations. Somatic activating GNAS mutations also commonly occur in several gastrointestinal and pancreatic neoplasms, but the spectrum of abnormalities in these organs in patients with MAS {{has yet to be}} systematically described. We report comprehensive characterization of the upper gastrointestinal tract in seven patients with MAS and identify several different types of polyps, including gastric heterotopia/metaplasia (7 / 7), gastric hyperplastic polyps (5 / 7), fundic gland polyps (2 / 7), and a <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> (1 / 7). In addition, one patient had an unusual adenomatous lesion at the gastroesophageal junction with high-grade dysplasia. In the pancreas, all patients had endoscopic ultrasound findings suggestive of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), but only two patients met the criteria for surgical intervention. Both of these patients had IPMNs at resection, one with low-grade dysplasia and one with high-grade dysplasia. GNAS mutations were identified in the majority of lesions analyzed, including both IPMNs and the adenomatous lesion from the gastroesophageal junction. These studies suggest that there is a broad spectrum of abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas in patients with MAS and that patients with MAS should be evaluated for gastrointestinal pathology, some of which may warrant clinical intervention due to advanced dysplasia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONHeterotaxy designates rare {{congenital}} disorders {{of organ}} positioning in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, {{which can be}} associated with numerous anomalies, complicating the surgical management because of the loss of conventional anatomic landmarks. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 72 -year-old man was found to have asymptomatic cholestasis. Further workup included computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography that revealed anomalies of lateralization of digestive organs associated with intestinal malrotation and polysplenia, and a stone-like element in the main bile duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography failed to extract the lesion. Laparotomy found no stone, but a polypoid tumor with ampullary implantation. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was judged unreasonable due to the presence of macroscopic cirrhosis and a complete ampullectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp.</b> DISCUSSIONThe unusual angle of the duodenoscope in a left-sided duodenum {{may have contributed to the}} improper pre-operative diagnosis. Endosonography could have recognized the tissular origin of the lesion and prompted a more detailed preoperative planning. It was fortunate that the patient ended up receiving the appropriate treatment despite the absence of an adequate pre-operative diagnosis, as the option of performing an extended resection was ruled out due to the presence of cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONAlthough heterotaxy leads to increased technical difficulties in performing usual endoscopic and surgical procedures, it can be safely managed by experienced surgeons as illustrated by the present case. Imaging modalities have limited sensitivity in the diagnosis of small ampullary tumors. As false-negatives are likely to occur, this possibility should guide the choice of the best operation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe Peutz-Jeghers {{syndrome}} (PJS) {{is a rare}} hereditary, autosomal-dominant disorder. It {{is characterized}} by a gastrointestinal polyposis and mucocutaneous melanic spots. It has also been reported as a precondition for malignancies with a life-time-hazard for cancer up to 93 %, caused by a germline mutation in the STK 11 gene. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 21 -year-old man presented with nausea and abdominal pain. He had a known history of PJS since the age of 13 when he was treated for intussusception due to a <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp.</b> Preoperative diagnostics revealed a second intussusception and an extensive intestinal polyposis. Intraoperative findings confirmed the suspected diagnoses and desvagination was performed. Nearly 50 polyps were removed from the small intestinum over several longitudinal sections. As the appendix appeared thickened an appendectomy was performed simultaneously. Histology showed hamartomatous polyps and the incidental finding of a pT 1 carcinoid of the appendix. The patient recovered well and needed no further treatment for his carcinoid tumor. DISCUSSIONThe mechanism of carcinogenesis in PJS still remains debatable, although the genetic disorder underlying the syndrome is known. A predisposition for carcinoid tumors also stays questionable. To our knowledge there is no description of an association between carcinoid tumors of the appendix and PJS to date. CONCLUSIONLife-expectancy in patients with PJS is reduced. Causes are the development of malignancies and complications from the polyps such as intussusception. Since there is no treatment possible main focus must be aimed at early recognition of malignancies and the prevention of complications...|$|E
40|$|A 42 -year-old female {{diagnosed}} with tuberous sclerosis {{was found to}} have multiple polyps in the fundus of stomach.

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{the presence of}} smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the lamina propria of both tubular and villous adenomatous polyps. In the current study, we investigated the presence and distribution of SMCs with immunohistochemical techniques using anti-alpha smooth muscle actin and anti- desmin antibodies {{on a series of}} <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> In five Peutz-Jeghers polyps, large tree-like branches of SMCs were observed, while in 13 juvenile polyps, rare elongated SMCs were found in the lamina propria, partially surrounding cystically dilated glands. Apart from the quantitative differences, the SMC distribution was similar in the two types of <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> and not dissimilar from the pattern described in neoplastic polyps. These findings make the category 'juvenile polyp' less clear and its differentiation from other histologic types of polyp less sharp. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} SMCs cannot form the basis of the differential diagnosis between adenomatous and <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps...</b>|$|R
50|$|Affected {{individuals}} may present with rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhea or anemia. On colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy polyps that vary in shape or size are present. The polyps can be sessile or pedunculated <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Peutz-Jeghers {{syndrome}} (PJS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} syndrome {{with an increased}} risk of polyposis complications and intestinal and extraintestinal tumours. METHODS: During the last 15 years, we reviewed a series of 11 children with PJS, with special attention to evolution and follow-up. Diagnosis was based on at least 1 <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyp</b> associated with 2 of the 3 following criteria: family record of PJS, polyposis localised on small bowel, and mucocutaneous pigmentation. Diagnosis of PJS also could be raised by a single genetic analysis of STK 11 gene. RESULTS: Median age at beginning of symptoms was 6 years old. Seven of the 11 children had genetic tests, which were positive for STK 11 gene mutation. Among the 10 children presenting with gastrointestinal complications, 8 were operated on, 6 had at least 1 small bowel resection, and 4 had repeat surgery for recurrent intussusceptions. In case of complications leading to a surgical procedure, we performed intraoperative enteroscopy to remove all large polyps. To prevent any polyposis complications, we suggest a complete check-up of polyposis topography with some of the new endoscopic tools, either double-balloon endoscopy or videocapsule endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Children with PJS have a high risk of numerous laparotomies due to polyps 2 ̆ 7 complications. Therefore, a screening of intestinal polyposis by videocapsule endoscopy is recommended, as well as a screening of the most frequent sites of cancers for the patient 2 ̆ 7 s whole life. During any abdominal procedure, they should have an intraoperative endoscopy, this management allowing an increased time interval between 2 laparotomies...|$|E
50|$|Other {{conditions}} {{consisting of}} multiple <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> of {{the digestive tract}} include Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis, and Cowden disease. Related polyposis conditions are familial adenomatous polyposis, attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and MUTYH.|$|R
40|$|The <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> in Peutz-Jeghers {{syndrome}} {{may have}} malignant potential.

40|$|Germline {{mutations}} in LKB 1 cause the rare cancer prone disorder Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). Gastrointestinal <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> constitute the major phenotypic trait in PJS. <b>Hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> arising in PJS patients are {{generally considered to}} lack premalignant potential although rare neoplastic changes in these polyps and an increased gastrointestinal cancer risk in PJS are well documented. These conflicting observations are resolved in the current hypothesis by providing a unifying explanation for these contrasting features of PJS polyposis. We postulate that a genetic predisposition to epithelial prolapse underlies {{the formation of the}} polyps associated with PJS. Conventional sporadic adenomas arising in PJS patients will similarly show mucosal prolapse and carry the associated histological feature...|$|R
30|$|Peutz-Jeghers {{syndrome}} is an inherited autosomal dominant disease characterised by two classic findings: mucocutaneous pigmentations and <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> of the GI tract. This {{syndrome is}} usually diagnosed {{early in life}} because mucocutaneous pigmentation in the perioral region commonly appears in infancy or childhood [20].|$|R
50|$|The risks {{associated}} with this syndrome include a strong tendency of developing cancer {{in a number of}} parts of the body. While the <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> themselves only have a small malignant potential (<3% - OHCM), patients with the syndrome have an increased risk of developing carcinomas of the pancreas, liver, lungs, breast, ovaries, uterus, testicles and other organs.|$|R
40|$|This study reviews {{different}} aspects of hereditary colorectal cancer associated with three polyposis syndromes: familial adenomatous polyposis, juvenile polyposis coli and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. All these syndromes share some similarities: low incidence, autosomal dominant inheritance, genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer and/or other extracolonic cancers. Classical familial adenomatous polyposis is clinically defined {{by the presence of}} hundreds of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum, whereas less than 100 polyps are found in attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis. Without prophylactic colectomy, colorectal cancer develops inevitably by the age of 40. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal anal-pouch anastomosis is the operation of choice in familial adenomatous polyposis. In juvenile polyposis coli, 50 - 200 <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> are found in the colon, rectum, stomach and small bowel. Life-time cumulative risk for colorectal cancer is estimated to be 50 %. Prophylactic colectomy is required only in cases in which endoscopic surveillance is not able to control polyp development. Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome is a variant form of juvenile polyposis coli, consisting of multiple mixed adenomatous, hyperplastic and <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps.</b> Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is characterized by multiple <b>hamartomatous</b> <b>polyps</b> located in the small bowel, colon and stomach. Small bowel follow through and colonoscopy is advised for surveillance. Surgery is warranted only in cases of polyps larger than 1 cm. The causative genes of these syndromes have been cloned. Molecular genetic testing of affected and at-risk individuals is proposed in order to advise surveillance and management...|$|R
