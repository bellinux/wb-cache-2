40|$|Traditionally, {{prestressed}} concrete <b>girder</b> <b>bridges</b> {{are limited to}} 150 ft span lengths in Texas due to restrictions on handling and transportation. An effective way of increasing span lengths of precast, {{prestressed concrete}} <b>girder</b> <b>bridges</b> is demonstrated using splicing technique. In spliced <b>girder</b> <b>bridges,</b> precast <b>girder</b> segments are transported in shorter segments for handling and transportation and then spliced together to form long-span continuous bridges. Different methods are explored for construction of spliced <b>girder</b> <b>bridges.</b> Two application examples are developed to demonstrate the design of continuous prestressed concrete spliced <b>girder</b> <b>bridges</b> for both shored and partially shored methods of construction. A three-span bridge having a span configuration of 190 - 240 - 190 ft is considered for both examples. Advantages and dis-advantages of each method of construction are discussed. Construction issues {{that should be considered}} in the design are highlighted. The results {{of this study indicate that}} span lengths up to 240 ft are achievable using standard Tx 70 girders with the help of splicing techniques. A parametric study is performed to further explore the design space of spliced <b>girder</b> <b>bridges.</b> The results of the parametric study, along with critical design issues that were identified, are highlighted and related recommendations are provided. The results of this study will be of significant interest to bridge engineers and researchers for guidance in implementing spliced <b>girder</b> <b>bridges</b> in Texas and other states...|$|R

5|$|The 130th Engineer Brigade {{focused on}} {{bridging}} projects as was its specialty, but it ultimately found itself undertaking numerous different projects {{throughout the country}} for much of 2003 and into 2004. Not all of its units were confined entirely to construction, though. The 502nd Engineer Company also conducted river patrol operations in Baghdad and Tikrit. This new mission for the company was essential for force protection, troop transportation, search and cordon operations, and to protect against sabotage on fixed bridges. In September 2003, with the inactivation of the 38th Engineer Company (Medium <b>Girder</b> <b>Bridge),</b> the 502nd Engineer Company became a multi-role bridge company with both float and fixed bridging capabilities and the only active bridge company in USAREUR.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 the Bull Head Turnpike Company built {{a private}} toll road {{known today as}} the Sag Harbor Turnpike, which {{operated}} successfully until a competing railroad line opened in the 1880s. In 1906 the town of Southampton {{took control of the}} now dilapidated road and removed the toll gates. NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an arched bridge that serves as a village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals to replace it with a <b>girder</b> <b>bridge.</b> Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original and is in the same location.|$|E

A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the current}} bridge, four other bridges have spanned the Indian River Inlet, opened in 1934, 1940, 1952, and 1965, the latter widened by an {{additional}} span added in 1976. All were known informally as the Indian River Inlet Bridge, and all but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge. The 1965 bridge, a steel <b>girder</b> <b>bridge,</b> was subject to scouring from the inlet, leading {{to the need to}} replace it. Initial plans for a tied-arch bridge over the inlet in 2004 were over budget, and 2006 plans for a 1,400-foot (427-meter) cable-stayed bridge were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems. Construction of the current, 2,600-foot (792-meter) bridge began in 2008 as part of a design-build project, with Skanska awarded the contract to build the bridge. The current Indian River Inlet Bridge opened partially in January 2012 and completely in May 2012 at a cost of $150 million.|$|E
5|$|Sprotbrough Bridge is {{actually}} two bridges that carry Mill Lane, the southern one crossing the weir stream {{and the northern}} one crossing the lock cut. Replacing a ferry crossing of the river, the first bridge and associated toll house were built in 1849 for Sir Joseph William Copley of Sprotbrough Hall. The designers of the southern bridge were Benjamin Brundell and William Arnold, and the present structure has three segmental arches on each side, which originally formed the approaches to a central arch. The arch was replaced by an above-deck truss in 1897. The ironwork was manufactured by Newton Chambers & Co. Ltd., who were based at Thorncliffe Ironworks in Sheffield, as recorded by plates attached to the bridge. The northern bridge was a single-arched masonry structure, which {{has been replaced by}} a plate <b>girder</b> <b>bridge</b> resting on the original piers. The toll house, consisting of a single storey with a half basement, made of dressed sandstone with an asphalt roof, still survives on the northern bank of the lock cut. Tolls collected here for passage over Sprotbrough Bridge were said to have been given by the Copley family to the Doncaster Dispensary.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small Box <b>Girder</b> <b>bridge</b> was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E

5|$|The next {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} {{at the site}} was an 860-foot (262-meter) steel <b>girder</b> <b>bridge,</b> the third to be named for Cullen. Its first span opened in 1965, and it was widened by the addition in 1976 of a second span slightly {{to the west of}} the first one, the newer span carrying southbound traffic while the older span became one-way northbound. When the first span opened in 1965, the inlet was 23 feet (7 meters) deep, but inlet currents led to scouring of the piers of the bridge, first noticed in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, scouring was severe enough to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divers to swim beneath one of the span's concrete footings. The Corps installed protective riprap around the bridge piers in 1989, but this was only a temporary solution; realizing that the bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm, Delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement. Scouring had increased the inlet's depth to over 100 feet (30 meters) by 1999, leading the Corps of Engineers and Delaware officials to question the stability of the pilings and their protective riprap. By 2005, various reports gave the bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013. By 2007, the bridge carried 14,000 cars on an average day and an average of 28,000 cars per day during the summer months, and the disruption to traffic if the bridge had to be closed before a replacement could open was of increasing concern.|$|E
