I don't know how it happened. I <b>just</b> started <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> and having conversations. I still talk to all those people, a lot of them when I go back there. It's cool because it gave me the feeling of a hometown rooting for you. Because I grew up in New York, and it's not really that hometown rooting for you kind of thing, it's more like everybody's just trying to do their own thing." ...|$|R
