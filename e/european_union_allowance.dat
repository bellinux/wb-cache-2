Based on the available literature and on experience in the UK and Germany with promotion instruments for low-carbon technologies, the results of our analysis suggest that two alternative schemes, a CCS bonus incentive or a carbon dioxide (CO 2) price guarantee, perform best in comparison with the other assessed instruments.

40|$|This paper {{fills the}} gap in the {{literature}} that the functions of the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Allowance</b> (EUA) futures have only been studied in the pilot phase of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and no market evolvement has been explored. The cost-of-carry pricing efficiency of the EUA futures and information spillover between the EUA spot market and futures market are examined in Phase I (2005 - 2007) and Phase II (2008 - 2012), respectively. First, it was found that only the December 2007 futures price was in long-run equilibrium with the spot price, but the relationship was not given by a cost-of-carry model. Second, the information spillover pattern also changed from Phase I to Phase II. The leading role of futures contract in price discovery can only be seen in Phase I, but not in Phase II. We conclude that, in the second phase of EU ETS, the market fundamentals are imposing stronger impacts on EUA price formation while the impact from speculation has weakened significantly.

40|$|J. de Sépibus* The {{so-called}} ‘Linking’-Directive {{adopted in}} 2004 does not impose any {{limit on the}} import of JI/CDM credits under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), but requires from the Member States to set, {{in accordance with their}} ‘supplementarity ’ obligations under the Marrakesh Accords, the maximal amount of Kyoto ‘units ’ each covered installation is entitled to use for compliance under the scheme.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a global issue {{concerning}} scientists and governments alike. Dealing with this issue {{is at the top}} of the international agenda. The primary cause of the human-induced greenhouse effect is found to be the carbon dioxide (CO 2), deriving mainly from burning fossil fuels, industrial activity and deforestation. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU has committed to reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions through a flexible mechanism, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Here, emission allowances in the form of a new tradable asset, the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Allowance</b> (EUA), can be traded in organised financial markets. Reducing effectively carbon emissions depends upon the success of such a carbon market, which requires sufficient prediction of the price behaviour. The tradable carbon credits appear to be influenced by fuel prices in the energy sector and by certain economic indicators. This thesis presents statistical models for efficient price forecasting based on the relationships between the emission spot and futures prices with energy and several industrial and economic indicators to empirically study the emission price behaviour. Due to the different Kyoto-established trading commitment phases of emission spot prices and their volatility behaviour, we propose appropriate AR–GARCH models for stochastic futures price modelling. We find that various energy and industrial variables affect the formation of the emission futures prices and should be incorporated in price forecasting models. ...|$|E

Comparing Phase 1 (2005 - 2007) and Phase 2 (2008 - 2012), we find that the products traded in Phase 2 show weaker rejection against the random walk hypothesis than the products traded in Phase 1. We further divide the two phases into four sub periods, 2005 / 06 / 24 for spots and 2005 / 04 / 25 for futures to 2006 / 04 / 26, 2006 / 04 / 27 to 2007 / 12 / 31 as Phase 1, 2008 / 02 / 26 for spots and 2008 / 01 / 03 for futures to 2008 / 12 / 15 and 2008 / 12 / 16 to 2010 / 01 / 28 as Phase 2. It is revealed that even the products traded in the later stage in Phase 1 after the price adjustment on 26 th April 2006 showed much weaker rejection than the primary stage of the market.

40|$|As an {{instrument}} to combat climate change many governments are mobilising the efficiencies created by the free market mechanism to penalize polluters for their emissions {{through the creation of}} emissions trading schemes (ETSs). Due to their relatively immature, unique and complex nature, one of the main arguments against the introduction of an ETS is the potential for manipulation of carbon markets. This paper examines <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Allowance</b> (EUA) historical price data and current literature to present a theoretical framework of potential drivers that may have, and may continue to be, facilitating manipulation {{of the largest and most}} comprehensive ETS to date, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). This theoretical framework is applied to the different forms of manipulation in the EU ETS as identified in the literature to illustrate why manipulation may have occurred in the EU ETS. The informational efficiency of EU ETS carbon markets is also subjected to statistical testing using both parametric and non-parametric tests. Testing results indicate that, in line with current literature and market events, the EU ETS carbon markets were informationally inefficient during the first phase but are developing, with indications of strengthening informational efficiency in the second phase. As carbon market manipulation hampers the development of an efficient carbon price signal, which is integral to ETS success, this paper provides some important implications for ETS regulation and design as well as for the overall effectiveness of emissions trading schemes...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of fossil}} fuels has caused an {{increase}} in GHG concentration in the atmosphere, which has a direct effect on global warming. Among the possible technologies to mitigate GHG emissions, {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) can be applied to existing plants and now it is being accepted officially in order to gain emission reduction certificates. This paper presents a feasible solution for CO 2 capture and storage network in Italy from sources that are included in the National Allocation Plan and that are forced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in {{the second phase of the}} implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The technical aspects of carbon sequestration are derived from industrial applications, while transportation and storage depend on local and geological characteristics. Since Italy has complex geological characteristics, the selection of the most convenient sites should include hydrocarbon reservoirs that are currently used or are depleted. To select these sites, all oil wells that are located in the Italian territory and are managed by UNMIG (National Mining Office for Hydrocarbons and Geothermy) were considered, and a short list was selected among those that have safety and lasting characteristics to ensure a long time permanence. The position of the selected storage sites is drawn on a GIS map containing all the plants included in the National Allocation Plan to be able to identify the optimal networks for carbon dioxide transportation. The case study is located in an area that includes Milan, Pavia and Lodi districts. Knowing the amount of CO 2 produced by plants in the selected zone, it is possible to determine the tons of CO 2 to capture and the size of transportation and storage systems. Pipelines are, in this case, the most appropriate transport technologies. From emission and sequestration points to storage sites it is necessary to build 122 km pipelines for 8 MtCO 2 capacity. Using this CCS grid it is possible to avoid CO 2 emission with economic feasibility close to the cost of carbon trading values.
