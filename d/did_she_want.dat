Nakazawa also came up with each album's concept and title. However, in 2010, Kawada began to cooperate more with other producers and also began working more in Tokyo. When producing Square the Circle, Nakazawa asked Kawada what sort of album and what sort of songs <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want.</b> Kawada said that she wanted an album whose songs would be reminiscent of her visual image and stage persona, as opposed to her private self.|$|E
2500|$|Florence Conybeare was {{actively}} involved in fundraising in Dartford during the First World War. [...] "As the grim reality developed in France, an appeal went out from Florence Conybeare, to 'all Florence's'. Her plan was {{to raise money to}} purchase and equip an ambulance which would be sent to the Western Front which would be used to move wounded British soldiers—referred to as [...] "the devoted sons of our Empire" [...] on —from the battlegrounds back to the field hospitals. Not only <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> this done, she wanted volunteers called [...] "Florences" [...] to [...] "man" [...] the ambulance in France! She managed to raise the money, but she never got her wish to man the ambulance with Florence's.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to do that? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to {{sell her}} pearl-backed brush and mirror, her silver candlestick, her pendant, her lovely little necklace, and go dressed in drab like the Wherrys: the unlovely uncombed Wherrys, who were the [...] "poor" [...] to her? She did not.|$|E

6000|$|If Mr. Longdon breathed rather hard {{it seemed}} to show at least that he followed. [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> of a good conscience?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Was Emma's mind {{disengaged}} {{enough for}} curiosity, or <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> {{to quit the}} subject! She said--'You have had a trial of this kind yourself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Who was she? What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want?</b> Whence did she come? What was {{the horror}} she {{revealed}} to {{the night in the}} bower of Christabel? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What was {{all that}} noise just now?" [...] he growled peevishly, without looking up. [...] "Confound you and your mother! What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want?</b> What did you come out for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How much <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> you to have?" [...] I asked, laughing. [...] "She {{ought to}} fix the sum, so that I may stay till it's made up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, she {{was always}} so," [...] said Minver. [...] "When a thing was to be <b>done,</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> it <b>done</b> like lightning, {{no matter what the}} thing was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I don't {{think he}} <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to dance with}} him again bad enough, I know. Everybody does with Dick, because he's so {{handsome}} and such a clever courter." ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{intensely}} fascinated. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> him to {{make love}} to her? A look at her face was enough to rebuke him for the thought. The shadows from the flickering fire played over her.|$|E
6000|$|But <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to find Mr. Otter? She had {{inherited}} {{much of the}} old cutter's independence. How much better {{it would be if}} she could find work and support herself without calling on him for aid! ...|$|E
6000|$|On Saturday morning Soames {{had found}} her at her writing-table with a note written to Swithin, putting him off. Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to put him off? he asked. She might put her own people off when she liked, {{he would not have}} her putting off his people! ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{carriage}} slowly {{passed the}} window, and Havill recognized the Power liveries. 'Hullo--she's coming here!' he said under his breath, as the carriage {{stopped by the}} kerb. 'What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want,</b> I wonder? Dare, <b>does</b> <b>she</b> know you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one you know. But {{she used}} to go about with her brows knit trying not to <b>do</b> {{whatever}} <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to do--if ever <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> to do anything--" ...|$|R

60|$|Why had {{she left}} Sabbath-school? Why? Oh, yes. What did he (McSnagley) {{want to tell}} her she was wicked for? What did he tell her that God hated her for? If God hated her, what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to go to Sabbath school for? She didn't want to be beholden to anybody who hated her.|$|E
6000|$|Geoffrey {{observed}} {{her from}} the dining-room, on {{her way down the}} stairs. He waited to see what she did, before he showed himself, and spoke to her. Instead of going on into the kitchen, she stopped short, and entered the parlor. Another suspicious circumstance! What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> in the parlor, without a candle, at that time of night? ...|$|E
6000|$|What did she want--what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want?</b> Her mother {{once said}} to her, with that {{characteristic}} touch of irony: 'Well, dear, if it is your fate to consider the lilies, that toil not, neither do they spin, that is one destiny among many others, and perhaps not so unpleasant as most. Why do you take it amiss, my child?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Merril! What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> here?" [...] said old Leeson, {{who usually}} spoke {{somewhat}} loudly, {{in what he}} evidently fancied was an aside, {{and it seemed to}} Jimmy that his sister's eyes asked the same question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Herr Paul {{raising his}} brows till his glasses fell from his nose: [...] "And what says Gretchen? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> {{to be handed}} up to posterities a little peacock {{along with the other}} little birds?" ...|$|R

What will her choice be?(It'll be a surprise) ...|$|R
60|$|Freddie, too, was in trouble. But <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> {{to comfort}} Freddie? No. On the contrary, {{she was already}} regretting her promise, so lightly given before luncheon, to go and sit with him that afternoon. A well-marked feeling of {{annoyance}} {{that he should have}} been so silly as to tumble downstairs and sprain his ankle was her chief sentiment respecting Freddie.|$|E
6000|$|... "She hasn't bitten you, has she? Oh, {{they do it}} sometimes! What lies has {{she been}} telling you of me? Oh, they lie in the most abominable manner! What?

6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} loving her dearly. They were intimate, and Mrs. Finn {{used to be}} with her very much {{when she was in the}} country. She was at Matching just now, when my poor mother died. Why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to see you?" ...|$|R
60|$|That {{was just}} what <b>she</b> didn't <b>want!</b> The light from the window was that horrid vulgar red glow which she hated. It might be very romantic and suit lovers like Jack, but as SHE had some work to <b>do,</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> the blue shade of the lamp to correct that dreadful glare.|$|R
6000|$|Henrietta {{opened her}} eyes, and gazed upon her {{without saying a}} word for some moments; then, as her senses awakened, she half sprung up. [...] "How is mamma? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> me? Why?" [...] Her aunt made an effort to speak, but it seemed beyond her power.|$|R
6000|$|He made {{no answer}} to this, and the words had no sting for him.

6000|$|If {{you can be}} patient! Why, a {{patience}} of ten years would be as nothing to her. Could she but live {{with the knowledge that}} she was first in his estimation, dearest in his heart; could it be also granted to her to feel that she was regarded as his equal, she could be patient for ever. What more <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> than to know and feel this? Patient, indeed! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Happy? What right had she {{to expect}} to be happy? Are we {{to believe that we}} should be happy here? Are we not told that we are to look for {{happiness}} there, and to hope for none below?" [...] As he said this he stretched his left hand to the ceiling. [...] "But why shouldn't she have been happy? What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want?</b> Did she ever say anything against me, Mr. Finn?" ...|$|E

6000|$|MARY. Who is <b>she?</b> What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> with him? And he ... {{where is}} he? Do {{you know that}} my father is dead, and the Deacon not here? Where has he gone? He may be dead, too. Father, brother ... O God, {{it is more than}} I can bear! ...|$|R
60|$|A {{quick change}} came over her. She mistrusted herself, she mistrusted the outer world. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> to go on, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> {{to go out}} into it, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to go no further.|$|R
