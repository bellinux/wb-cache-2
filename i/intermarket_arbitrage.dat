40|$|In 1990, the NYSE amended its Rule 80 A to {{restrict}} stock index arbitrage on days of large price movements. We design empirical tests {{to evaluate the}} impact of Rule 80 A on trading costs and <b>intermarket</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> We find that Rule 80 A significantly curtails [...] or “collars” [...] index arbitrage activity. Despite the significant curtailment of index arbitrage activity, the cash and futures markets remain linked. Pricing discrepancies between the markets are simply eliminated less quickly. Our {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that information is conveyed from one market to the other by means other than formal arbitrage. We also find that trading costs in the stock market, as measured by the average bid-ask spread for S&P 500 stocks, do not change following the triggering of Rule 80 A, in spite of the binding constraint on index arbitrage volume. Overall, Rule 80 A appears to have had little impact on trading costs and <b>intermarket</b> <b>arbitrage</b> despite significant curtailment of index arbitrage volume.

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry's {{core business}} is the innovation, development {{and marketing of}} new drugs. Pharmacogenetic (PG) testing and technology {{has the potential to}} increase a drug's value in many ways. A critical issue for the industry is whether products in development should be teamed with genetic tests that could segment the total population into responders and non-responders. In this paper we use a cost-effectiveness framework to model the strategic decision-making considerations by pharmaceutical manufacturers as they relate to drug development and the new technology of PG (the science of using genetic markers to predict drug response). In a simple, static, one-period model we consider three drug development strategies: a drug is exclusively developed and marketed to patients with a particular genetic marker; no distinguishing among patients based on the expression of a genetic marker is made (traditional approach); and a strategy whereby a drug is marketed to patients both with and without the genetic marker but there is price discrimination between the two subpopulations. We developed three main principles: revenues under a strategy targeting only the responder subpopulation will never generate more revenue than that which could have been obtained under a traditional approach; total revenues under a targeted PG strategy will be less than that under a traditional approach but higher than a naive view would believe them to be; and a traditional approach will earn the same total revenues as a price discrimination strategy, assuming no <b>intermarket</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> While these principles relate to the singular (and quite narrow) consideration of drug revenues, they may nevertheless partially explain why PG is not being used as widely as was predicted several years ago when the technology first became available, especially in terms of pharmaceutical manufacturer-developed tests.
