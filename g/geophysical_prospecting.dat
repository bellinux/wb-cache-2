The survey {{was carried out in}} the context of a big scale project, where the old monuments protective roof cover is being replaced by a new environmental and friendly construction which will be supported by 95 pillars embedded in the volcanic basemen rock. The target of the <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospect</b> was the man-made or natural cavities unveiled during the excavations of the foundation shafts, the presence of which might affect the construction response during an earthquake. The cross-shaft seismic tomography technique was adopted for this purpose. A number of synthetic examples and a calibration experiment at a shaft with a known natural cavity clearly indicated that the tomographic inversion is capable of providing highly resolved 2 -D models. High S/N ratios ensured field seismic records of high quality. A set of stability tests was run to check the consistency of the method. Travel time residuals verified the validity of the final velocity depth sections while model complexity trends showed a consistency between models after a certain number of iterations. The reconstructed velocity fields were quite consistent with the expected velocities. Impressive low-velocity structures attributed to natural or man-made cavities were reported to the constructin...|$|R

In {{environmental}} protection and in petroleum prospecting, apart from the commonly applied geophysical methods, geochemical methods are becoming more common. They include gas methods (the most popular consists in the “free gas method”) as well as bacteriological, bitumen luminesce, hydrogeochemical, geobotanical methods and redox methods {{which are based on}} pH and Eh analyses. Geochemical research supported by geophysical research constitutes a very accurate tool in locating deep hydrocarbon deposits and in research conducted in relation to natural gas storage facilities. The geochemical research takes into account qualitative and quantitative measurement of parameters characterising the soil environment which includes the acidity and alkalinity of soil pH. The application of the method based on soil pH analysis in terms of exploring deep hydrocarbon pools became an area of interest for the Gas Chromatography Methods and Surface Geochemical AGH. Until now, the method based on soil pH analysis was not used in Poland in terms of exploring deep hydrocarbon pools. Such research was conducted only in the US (Reid 1992, Klusman 1993, Tedesco 1995) but this was done in varying environments and thus the results varied. Soil pH measurement may be performed in compliance with the Polish Standard (PN-ISO 10390 : 1997) by creating a soil solution however according to the manufacturer, the measurement tool in possession of the Laboratory is suited for taking measurement of solid substances such as cream or soil. Due to the fact that preparation of a soil solution is relatively time-consuming, the author of the work makes an effort of analysing the differences between the standard measurements taken on the solution and in situ measurements taken on the soil using the same device, the latter being a lot faster. Measurements were taken using 56 samples drawn in the area of one of the natural gas deposits in the Carpathian Foredeep Basin. Research has shown that the average values from taking in situ measurements and the collection of soil solution measurements are very similar and amount to 4. 65 and 4. 93 respectively. The graphical representation of the statistical parameters of both collections (box plot) shows that their distribution is similar. For both collections, the modal class on the performed histograms is between 4. 5 and 5. 0. Taking into account the variability of the soil centre and the impact of surface and weather conditions on the soil, the collections of values were normalized and filtered. Then, such data was subjected to directional correlation. It showed 85 % of corresponding directions of changes. Furthermore, the correlations of measured values performed using the Cartesian coordinate system where the R 2 coordinate equals to 0. 64, show a relatively high correspondence. The conducted analyses and comparative correlations have shown that in order to characterise the researched area, an in situ test of samples using a mobile analyser may be sufficient to identify the variability of soil acidity in the researched area, thus allowing to save the valuable time and labour consumption to a large extent.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The various {{elements}} of physical geography are commonly entertained as factors retarding the mineral industries of Alaska. It {{has been shown}} by numerous writers that the mineral industries of Alaska are, indeed, in a difficult situation. Only the petroleum industry and sand and gravel for construction are of much significance to the Alaskan economy. Alaska's location {{makes it difficult to}} use domestic markets and turns the attention of all the resource-based primary industry toward the Orient. Though close to Europe, Alaskan trade across the Arctic Ocean yet awaits future transportation developments. The strategic position of Alaska has very significantly affected Alaska's primary industries by imposing stifling inflation on the state through emergency military activity little concerned with economics. Statehood and increased concern with the economy of Alaska by the Federal government promises to improve Alaska's locational problems. Alaska's size to some extent limits accessibility to the interior, but it also provides Alaska with a high mineral resource potential of great diversity and a very diverse landscape. The diversity of the land is a retardant to the extent that complexity of environment is a characteristic of Alaskan operations requiring a wide range of field experience and field equipment. Experience in all Alaskan terrain is quite rare. The topography of Alaska limits the development of new transportational routes to the interior from the south coast. It does not appreciably affect operational costs on existing roads and rails. Low terrain subject to frost action is a greater operational problem. As an underdeveloped land, Alaska is not unusually disadvantaged by topography; it does, in fact, have some advantages. A great hydroelectric potential exists in Alaska, but there is little chance that it will be of any great value to the mineral industries at this stage. Alaska has many diverse climates. South coastal Alaska has a climate similar enough to southern climates to be considered insignificant as a retardant to the mineral industries. In providing frozen coasts to western and northern Alaska, climate seriously retards development in these areas. Permafrost is a climatic resultant offering some considerable but yet largely undetermined effect on the mineral industries. The colder parts of Alaska have their biggest effect on the mineral industries in being different and, consequently, foreign and discouraging to southern people. The inherent disadvantage of cold is still largely obscured by blundering and inefficiency. Alaska has a considerable and diverse mineral resource that can, at this time, only be inferred. The unknown of Alaskan geology is its most striking feature. Exploration in all aspects is seriously discouraged by the economy and the obscuration of bed rock. <b>Geophysical</b> and geochemical <b>prospecting</b> has met with little success. It is felt that the lack of knowledge of and experience with the land is the biggest retardant to Alaska's mineral industries. The land is not inherently hostile, but rather it is different from that familiar to most of the people on it. A two-pronged attack on ignorance of the land is suggested, one to disseminate present knowledge and the other to seek out the unknown. When Alaska acquires a people familiar with and fully oriented toward the land, the effect of the geographic factors presently retarding the mineral industries will be greatly reduced...|$|R

50|$|Ulpiana was a Roman town, {{established}} in the 1st century AD, receiving municipium status in 169 AD. It was located near a rich mining area and also had a geo-strategic position situated close to the ancient crossroads that linked east with west, were dominant factors for the foundation, development and existence through centuries. During the Roman era, Ulpiana {{was one of the}} most active and frequented centers connecting Constantinople with Rome, and close to the town the crossroad connecting the Adriatic with the Aegean coasts, even indirectly with the Black Sea. Furthermore, the existence of the ancient communication route Via Lissus-Naissus is known, land communication networks that met close to Ulpiana. The earliest forms of the occupation and human activity and civilization, witness the existence since the prehistoric period, but worth mentioning is the period known by the jargon of the archaeologists as the Bronze and Iron Ages. Nevertheless, the first forms of an urban centre recorded in Ulpiana, date to the beginning of the Roman rule, which occurred at the first century AD. With the Romans settled, Ulpiana developed from a small ancient Dardanian concentrated Opidum; to a widespread territory with all attributes of a typical Roman town organization. In regard to this matter, it is believed that Ulpiana was established as a Roman municipium in 169 AD, called Municipium Ulpianum. Nonetheless, Ulpiana achieved its peak of development during the 3rd and 4th century; a period when it became a very important political, economical, cultural center of a wider area of the territory of Dardania, but also became the crucial center for the expansion of the ancient civilization in this region. The Roman town of Ulpiana during this period was ascribed as the Municipum Ulpiana Splendidissima - the Splendid City of Ulpiana, characterized with road networks, orthogonal construction system, water supply, drainage, houses, buildings and various other public, sacral, profane and utilitarian buildings. In addition, the Municipium of Ulpiana was a very important trading centre of either metallurgical, artisans or agricultural goods and merchandise for at least first five centuries of the first millennium and especially during the rule of the Byzantine emperor Justinian the Great in the 6th century AD; time when Ulpiana was rebuilt and renamed to Justiniana Secunda. Since the second part of the 20th century and onward, the ancient town of Ulpiana has been in a continuity study through the loupe and pickaxe of either local or foreign archaeologists that contributed until present day with the discovery of a few cult and sacral monuments, basilica, necropolis, as well as parts of the ramparts with watchtowers, castrum - Roman military garrison and hundreds of movable artifacts, different in form, material and usage, but as well as human remains, architectural structures and elements, all testimony of the cultural material very important for the scientific field of archaeology. The gathered data was partially studied and is under the process of systematic evaluation from various specialists of different scientific disciplines that all together contribute for the further update of the archaeological data. Since our century is the one of technological and scientific innovations, the archaeological site of Ulpiana went through elaborate research studies with highly sophisticated investigative devices, which totally are non intrusive methods of survey examination. Thanking the cooperation, between the German Archaeological Institute, and the Archaeological Institute of Kosovo, have jointly participated in <b>geophysical</b> <b>prospecting</b> with the advance survey/recording methods, for example; Fluxgate Magnetometer, Gradiometer, georadar connected with GIS, surveying around 50 hectares of land with archaeological potential within the Ulpiana area. Besides the scientific character, the underneath earth recording will aid in the future pacifications and development plans for this archaeological site. But even more, the site will benefit also for the management plan for compilation of the development plans for the promotion of the cultural heritage known in the developed countries as archaeotourism, which as a precondition requires the setting of the tourist infrastructure at the archaeological parks. On the other hand, these advanced methods and techniques will help on the determination of the extent, character and nature of Ulpiana, when having in mind that this is a multilayer site.|$|E
