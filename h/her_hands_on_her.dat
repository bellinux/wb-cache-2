25|$|Later, Lawrence Alamain {{comes to}} town. Jennifer {{believes}} that Lawrence thinks she is Katerina, the heiress to the Von Leuschner fortune, {{due to a}} confusion going back to when the real heiress (Carly Manning) and Jennifer were teenagers and they had switched dates. After a hurried wedding, Lawrence rapes Jennifer, admitting that he knew her real identity all along. Jack arrives to rescue Jennifer. Jack and Jennifer became engaged, but he calls off the wedding because he feels alienated from her. Jennifer is still unable to handle intimacy and is too ashamed to tell Jack that Lawrence raped her. Jack then marries Eve to help her get <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> $10 million inheritance. After Jennifer finally tells Jack the truth, she presses rape charges against Lawrence. Kimberly and Jack are able to record him confessing to the rape, and Lawrence is then sent to jail. Eve reluctantly grants Jack a divorce, and Jack and Jennifer are married. Soon after, a swindler named Hawk soon cheats {{them out of their}} money. He is caught, but the couple remains penniless. Jennifer then learns she is pregnant, but Jack's joy is not great. He thinks he is suffering a relapse of Hodgkin's disease. Though he is not ill, Jennifer goes to New York to do a TV show with Calliope. Jennifer gives birth later that year to a daughter, Abigail Johanna.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, a {{director}} {{cut of the}} video leaked onto the Internet. It shows heavier scenes, like wounded and maimed soldiers, war scenes, images of poverty and death. In 2010, Slant Magazine placed this alternate video on the nineteenth place of decade's fifty best music videos list, stating: [...] "It isn't like either the video's message about viewing war {{as a form of}} popular entertainment or its striking, loaded images leave much room for misinterpretation. Prescient? Yes. Relevant? Surely. Subtle? Not so much." [...] This version of the video ends with the tossed grenade landing on the catwalk and Madonna putting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> ears.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} of the unwelcome band playing outside Marlinspike Hall, called the [...] "Marlinspike Prize Band" [...] (Harmonie de Moulinsart {{in the original}} French version), {{was based on a}} similar experience of Hergé's who was also obliged to serve a band with drinks. To add insult to injury, they gave a toast to [...] "Spirou", the cartoon character created by Robert Velter. Another influence for the band was a cutting of [...] "L'Orpheon France" [...] band. Whenever Castafiore fears her jewels her stolen, her expressions, which involve placing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, were influenced by a photograph of her model in real life, Maria Callas, taken by Cecil Beaton in 1957. In page 43 of the book, Tintin is shown reading Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island (1883), which was also one of Hergé's favourite books. The depiction of the Romani wagons and clothing was closely modelled on photographs of Romani communities that Hergé had consulted, and he depicted members of the group engaged in basket weaving and fortune telling after reading that the Romani engaged in such activities in the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Unger curated a {{show called}} “In a Dark Vein,” at the Sculpture Center in New York. It {{featured}} work by women who used the human figure to shape feelings of fear, loss, and pain and was inspired by Unger's own struggle with cancer. [...] In this show, she {{tried to focus on}} a more naked and physical reality and the search for experience that is shared and elemental. [...] Unger included her bonded iron sculpture, Guardian, which both expresses and mediates suffering. [...] It shows a nude woman, cut off at the waist, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hips. [...] The sculpture's mouth is like a pit facing the sky and her arms are like wings. [...] The earthly figure suggests a fertility goddess insisting on her ability to reproduce and crying to get out of her skin. “In a Dark Vein” was filled with representations of the female body shaped by a woman’s hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped her}} apron, {{replaced}} the cigarette, and, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> plump knees, eyes him steadily.|$|E
60|$|There she paused, {{and crossed}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lap, {{and waited for}} {{what was to come}} next.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{rose from}} her seat to leave also, but Mysa put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|R
60|$|After which valediction {{she slowly}} climbed the stairs, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knee at each step, with the effort.|$|R

60|$|LADY. Oh, horribly afraid, agonizingly afraid. (She presses <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> heart.) It hurts only {{to imagine}} it.|$|E
60|$|A slim {{woman of}} fifty, with hollow {{eyes and a}} patient smile, came in, wiping <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> apron.|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped on}} the seat, and wrung <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lap. Her downcast eyes still obstinately avoided meeting mine.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, don't,' entreated Picotee, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> entertainer's arm. 'It seems wrong; it is {{no concern}} of ours.' ...|$|R
60|$|The girl {{shook her}} head and clapped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mouth more vigorously than before, but the boy went on.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} face her; I had known so many {{who did not}} recover. She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mother's shoulder.|$|R

60|$|Miss Pinnegar wept {{herself into}} silence. She looked huddled and forlorn. Alvina went to <b>her</b> and laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|There was an {{impressive}} silence. Hetty shuddered, {{and the fear}} in her eyes was unmistakable when she laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> husband's arm.|$|R

60|$|Penelope was yawning with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mouth; she stopped, and, {{with a laugh}} of amused expectance, {{sank into}} a chair, her {{shoulders}} shrugged forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "My poor boy," [...] said May, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> brother's arm, [...] "it's not a {{very great}} {{beginning}} of life to become a telegraph-messenger." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DUDGEON (deadly pale, with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{heart as}} if she had {{received}} a deathblow). My curse on you! My dying curse! (She goes out.) ...|$|R
