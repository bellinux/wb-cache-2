The manual's author gets the possibility to transfer the sequence of paper folds the manual consists of to the Origamist application, which is able to export several types of output - the most favourite (among origami folders) PDF manuals, but also image manuals (as PNG or SVG), and even as an animation of the folding process.

40|$|AbstractThere is a {{need for}} rules {{allowing}} three-dimensional structure information to be derived from protein sequences. In this work, consideration of an elementary protein <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> allows protein sub-sequences which optimize folding to be derived for any given protein sequence. Classical mechanics applied to this system and the energy conservation law during the elementary <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> yields an equation whose solutions are taken over the field of rational numbers. This formalism is applied to beta-sheets containing two edge strands and at least two central strands. The number of protein sub-sequences optimized for folding per amino acid in beta-strands is shown in particular to predict edge strands from protein sequences. Topological information on beta-strands and loops connecting them is derived for protein sequences with a prediction accuracy of 75 %. The statistical significance of the finding is given. Applications in protein structure prediction are envisioned such as for the quality assessment of protein structure models...|$|R

By comparison, about half of the single domain proteins in the Protein Data Bank have their N- and C-terminal elements in contact, more than expected on a random probability basis but not nearly enough to account for the bias in protein folding. Possible reasons for this bias relate to the mechanisms for initial protein folding, native state stability, and final turnover...|$|R

The most important of these to note are N-linked glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. N-linked glycosylation occurs as soon as the protein sequence passes into the ER through the translocon, where it is glycosylated with a sugar molecule that forms the key ligand for the lectin molecules calreticulin (CRT; soluble in ER lumen) and calnexin (CNX; membrane bound)1. Favoured by the highly oxidizing environment of the ER, protein disulfide isomerases facilitate formation of disulfide bonds, which confer structural stability to the protein in order for it to withstand adverse conditions such as extremes of pH and degradative enzymes.|$|R

This is enabled by the cross-crease vertex, a special configuration consisting of two pairs of collinear crease lines, which is proven here by means of a kinematic analysis to contain two independent 1 -DOF rigid-foldable states.

We find that each probe yields different kinetics and compare these observations with a Markov State Model constructed from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and find a complex network of states that yield different kinetics for different observables.

After flattening PAB simulation, the 2 D surfaces are meshed with respect to the predefined folding lines. The subsequent <b>folding</b> <b>steps</b> of flat 2 D airbag are carried out according to the folding requirements.
