25|$|A law {{to improve}} the system of {{sickness}} benefits provided that those insured would receive compensation when obliged {{to stay at home}} to care for a sick child and thereby incurring a loss of income. An insured person could request unpaid leave of absence on such occasions. The same law established the right to a <b>home</b> <b>help,</b> to be paid for by the health service, where the parents are in hospital or undergoing treatment, provided that the household included a child under 8 or a handicapped child required special care. The SPD-FDP coalitionâ€™s time in office also saw a considerable expansion in the number of childcare places for three- to six-year-old children, with the number of facilities rising from 17,493 in 1970 to 23,938 in 1980, and the number of places from 1,160,700 to 1,392,500 during that same period. Subsidies for day care rose between 1970 and 1980, but fell between 1980 and 1983.|$|E
40|$|This study {{uses the}} theory of logics to answer the question: What are the effects of cash-for-care on the professionalism of formal care workers in home care? Interviews with <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> on the {{influence}} of cash-for-care on three salient dimensions of professionalism (autonomy, discretionary space and professional norms) show that there is little tangible effect, but there are differences in the way <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> think. The reason why cash-for-care has so little effect on the professionalism of <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> must be sought in bureaucratic logic: it prevents the market logic of cash-for-care to have any effect on professionalism...|$|R

[...] However, it was roundly rejected by Gordon Brown, then the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that it was [...] "An idea that they say is sweeping the world, well sweeping Estonia, well a wing of the neo-conservatives in Estonia", and criticised it thus: [...] "The millionaire to pay exactly the same tax rate as the young nurse, the <b>home</b> <b>help,</b> the worker on the minimum wage".|$|E
