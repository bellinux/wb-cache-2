5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase <b>in</b> <b>data</b> capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's optic fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8. This increase <b>in</b> <b>data</b> capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable. Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.|$|E

5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility <b>in</b> <b>data</b> storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{identifying the}} types of Indonesian culture-specific terms (CST’s) in Korrie Layun Rampan’s Upacara and revealing foreignization and domestication strategies applied in translating the Indonesian CST’s of Korrie Layun Rampan’s Upacara in George A Fowler’s Ceremony. Since the research emphasized on describing the translation phenomena of foreignization and domestication in Korrie Layun Rampan’s Upacara, a descriptive qualitative approach was employed in this research. Moreover, quantitative data were added to support the analysis. The data of this research were the Indonesian CST’s in the forms of words and phrases and their English translation. Then, the sources of this data were the original version of the novel, Upacara by Korrie Layun Rampan, and its translation, Ceremony by George A Fowler. This study reveals two findings. In terms of CST’s, there are five categories that are employed in the novel. They are ecology <b>in</b> 109 <b>data,</b> material culture <b>in</b> 115 <b>data,</b> social culture <b>in</b> 22 <b>data,</b> organizations <b>in</b> 64 <b>data,</b> and gestures <b>in</b> 6 <b>data.</b> Among them, CST’s in terms of material culture has the highest number. It occurs because {{the theme of the}} novel tells about the social condition of Dayak tribe. In terms of translation strategies, there are four foreignizing translation strategies that are employed in this research. They are preservation <b>in</b> 64 <b>data,</b> addition <b>in</b> 68 <b>data,</b> naturalization <b>in</b> 10 <b>data,</b> and literal translation <b>in</b> 11 <b>data.</b> As for domesticating translation strategies, there are four strategies used by the translator, they are cultural equivalence <b>in</b> 52 <b>data,</b> omission <b>in</b> 11 <b>data,</b> globalization <b>in</b> 13 <b>data,</b> and equivalent translation <b>in</b> 86 <b>data.</b> There is not any data translated by employing translation by more specific terms and creation. It can be concluded that from 315 <b>data</b> <b>in</b> the novel, there are 153 data or (48. 58...|$|R

5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias <b>in</b> <b>data</b> collection.|$|E
