The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement <b>for</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E

5|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its original construction both for its environmental impact and {{violations of the}} Raker Act {{by the city of}} San Francisco. Although the Raker Act explicitly stated that power and water from the Hetch Hetchy Project could be used only for public purposes, San Francisco has sold Hetch Hetchy power to Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) since 1925. Dam removal advocates have stated that San Francisco's utilization of Yosemite National Park <b>for</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> power is unfair because of the damage to tourism and the local environment caused by the dam and reservoir. By draining the reservoir, removing the dam and restoring the valley to its original state, visitors to the park would once again be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Hetch Hetchy – once compared to that of Yosemite Valley. There are other rivers and reservoirs available for San Francisco to replace the water supply, such as the city's currently unused share of water in Lake Don Pedro, the biggest reservoir on the Tuolumne River.|$|E
5|$|Residents in some {{portions}} of the country became angry {{due to lack of}} assistance. In the town of Lazaro Cardenas in Tabasco, residents opened ditches to alleviate flooding on their streets, which flooding thousands of vehicles along a section of highway near the state's capital, Villahermosa. In the capital city, which remained submerged by floodwaters for a week, residents protested the sandbagging efforts after waters were redirected to some neighborhoods. Due to the protests, police officers beat and arrested 100people. The Federal Consumer Protection Agency issued warnings to businesses accused of price gouging <b>for</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> other basic products.

5|$|The Army {{presence}} at Oak Ridge increased in August 1943 when Nichols replaced Marshall {{as head of}} the Manhattan Engineer District. One of his first tasks was to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge, although the name of the district did not change. In September 1943 the administration of community facilities was outsourced to Turner Construction Company through a subsidiary, the Roane-Anderson Company. The company was paid a fee of $25,000 per month on a cost-plus contract, about 1 percent of the $2.8 million monthly cost of running the town facilities. Roane-Anderson did not take over everything at once, and a phased takeover started with Laundry No. 1 on 17 October 1943; transportation and garbage collection soon followed. It assumed responsibility <b>for</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> sewage in November, and electricity in January 1944. The number of Roane-Anderson workers peaked at around 10,500 in February 1945, including concessionaires and subcontractors. Thereafter, numbers declined to 2,905 direct employees and 3,663 concessionaires and subcontractors when the Manhattan Project ended on 31 December 1946.|$|E
5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking <b>for</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.|$|E
5|$|The plan went awry {{when the}} 2nd Platoon got lost and missed a {{rendezvous}} with the 1st and 3rd Platoon, which {{were waiting for}} them near Mravince. The 2nd Platoon was therefore disbanded {{while the rest of}} the detachment continued via Mosor to Dicmo where they were to meet up with their guides. They arrived on the night of 12 August, and upon realizing their guides were not there, decided to continue alone towards Kamešnica, but got lost and ran out of supplies during the night. At dawn on 13 August the detachment camped near the village of Krušvar. In the evening they once again continued towards Kamešnica, and at dawn on 14 August, they camped near the village of Košute, near Trilj. Borovčić-Kurir tasked two fighters to go into the village and ask the locals <b>for</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> directions. After talking to some locals, the fighters were fired upon by a member of the Ustaše Militia of the village. They returned fire then continued back to their camp and notified the others about the incident.|$|E

5|$|Black drongos {{become active}} very early {{at dawn and}} roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They {{sometimes}} fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields that are being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common mynas, cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas. It is said that they imitate {{the call of the}} Shikra so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using false alarm calls, has been noted in the fork-tailed drongo. There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, or maybe even bats. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as Erythrina and Bombax may be visited <b>for</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed late in the evening or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.|$|E

25|$|According to FAO, {{water fees}} {{are too low}} to meet {{maintenance}} and operation requirements for hydraulic infrastructure. For instance, cost recovery <b>for</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> sanitation is minimal. Average tariffs are moderate at US$0.21 per cubic meter <b>for</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> US$0.07 per cubic meter for sewerage. In addition, collection rates for {{water supply and sanitation}} are extremely low at only 28%. As a result of moderate tariffs and very low collection rates, according to a WHO estimate in 1998, households paid on average only US$0.50 per month <b>for</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> US$0.09 per month for sewerage. Not surprisingly, the regional water and sewer companies and INAPA (the national water and sewerage authority) rely largely on transfers from the central budget to fund their operations.
