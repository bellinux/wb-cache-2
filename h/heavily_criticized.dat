5|$|Christie's {{sacrifice}} {{in the film}} is a <b>heavily</b> <b>criticized</b> plot element, with critics from online publications such as Cracked.com and Bloody Disgusting calling it avoidable and unnecessary. In Keyframes: Popular Cinema and Cultural Studies, Matthew Tinkcom and Amy Villarejo write that Christie reinforces an Alien-franchise trope (shared by Parker in Alien and Dillon in Alien 3) where black characters save and sacrifice themselves for Caucasian characters. The theme of hybridization is exemplified by Christie and Vriess, according to Rizzo in Deleuze and Film: A Feminist Introduction; while the two characters are harnessed together, they alternate movement, support and combat.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were <b>heavily</b> <b>criticized.</b> Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E
5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews.

IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, <b>heavily</b> <b>criticized</b> the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E
5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets.

An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was <b>heavily</b> <b>criticized</b> for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to many of}} his contemporaries, Clavijero promoted {{a view of the}} Indigenous as peaceful and good, while <b>heavily</b> <b>criticizing</b> the actions of the Spanish conquistadors.

5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been <b>heavily</b> <b>criticized</b> for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, a {{group of}} {{statehood}} supporters broke into the El Diario's building, vandalizing most of the equipment. Following this incident, {{the family moved to}} Caguas where he reopened La Democracia. After receiving further threats from the statehood movements, Muñoz Rivera decided to move to New York City, not before leaving the paper's editing in charge of one of his followers. There he founded the bilingual newspaper Puerto Rico Herald, in which he <b>heavily</b> <b>criticized</b> the United States' stance on Puerto Rico. During the following years, the family constantly traveled between both locations. Muñoz Rivera, together with Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Antonio R.
