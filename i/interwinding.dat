This work is to address the issue of systematic TL modeling and verification methods. Specifically, (1) A systematic design modeling flow with a set of well-defined transaction protocols and TL model verification method are proposed; (2) We show comprehensive details on architecture (bus, memory, basic blocks) exploration results obtained by using our TL modeling and verification methodology for movie capture application, which <b>interwinds</b> Camera I/F, two DMAs, LCD buffer, SDRAM, and MPEEG HW accelerator.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the dynamic formation of coronal magnetic loops in three dimensions {{as a result of}} horizontal vortex-like convection on the photosphere. Localized plasma motions twist bipolar magnetic field lines which are tied to the dense photosphere by high electrical conductivity. The twists propagate into the corona along the field and create a narrow quasi-toroidal region where the field lines <b>interwind.</b> At the same time, this tubeline region rises in altitude, expands in cross section, and distorts into a slight S shape before settling into an equilibrium state. The MHD stability of such line-tied magnetic loop structures is directly exhibited by this dynamic simulation...|$|R
5000|$|Tectonically, the Mazovian Lowland is a stable, {{safe area}} of the {{so-called}} Mazovian Hutch, that is area composed of <b>interwinding</b> layers of Cenozoic aqueous rocks and sands. The surface of the area was shaped {{by the presence of}} Scandinavian ice sheet during the Ice Age. As the area was the southernmost border of the ice sheet's presence, the northern and southern parts of the plain differ significantly: the former is a vast open space while the latter is more rough terrain. The southern part is also covered by many gorges created during the Baltic Glacier. The central part of the Mazovian Lowland, the so-called Warsaw Cauldron, as well as the valleys of Radomka and Pilica rivers are covered by a number of parabolic dunes.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{that the}} switch has opened at Topen, the {{magnetizing}} current {{in the primary}} is Ipeak,m = Vp×Tclosed/Lp, and the energy Up is stored in this [...] "magnetizing" [...] field as created by Ipeak,m (energy Um = 1/2×Lp×Ipeak,m2). But {{now there is no}} primary voltage (Vb) to sustain further increases in the magnetic field, or even a steady-state field, the switch being opened and thereby removing the primary voltage. The magnetic field (flux) begins to collapse, and the collapse forces energy back into the circuit by inducing current and voltage into the primary turns, the secondary turns, or both. Induction into the primary will be via the primary turns through which all the flux passes (represented by primary inductance Lp); the collapsing flux creates primary voltage that forces current to continue to flow either out of the primary toward the (now-open) switch or into a primary load such as an LED or a Zener diode, etc. Induction into the secondary will be via the secondary turns through which the mutual (linked) flux passes; this induction causes voltage to appear at the secondary, and if this voltage is not blocked (e.g. by a diode or by the very high impedance of a FET gate), secondary current will flow into the secondary circuit (but in the opposite direction). In any case, if there are no components to absorb the current, the voltage at the switch rises very fast. Without a primary load {{or in the case of}} very limited secondary current the voltage will be limited only by the distributed capacitances of the windings (the so-called <b>interwinding</b> capacitance), and it can destroy the switch. When only <b>interwinding</b> capacitance and a tiny secondary load is present to absorb the energy, very high-frequency oscillations occur, and these [...] "parasitic oscillations" [...] represent a possible source of electromagnetic interference.|$|E

50|$|Buttress {{roots are}} large roots {{on all sides}} of a shallowly rooted tree. Typically, they are found in nutrient-poor {{rainforest}} soils and do not penetrate to deeper layers. They prevent the tree from falling over (hence the name buttress) while also gathering more nutrients. Buttresses are tension elements, being larger on the side away from the stress of asymmetrical canopies. The roots may <b>interwind</b> with buttress roots from other trees and create an intricate mesh, which may help support trees surrounding it. They can grow up to 30 ft tall and spread for 30 metres above the soil then for another 30 metres below. When the roots spread horizontally, they are able to cover a wider area for collecting nutrients. They stay near the upper soil layer because all the main nutrients are found there.|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial {{networks}} {{exhibit a}} variety of complex behaviors, including coordinated cell-wide oscillations of energy {{states as well as}} a phase transition (depolarization) in response to oxidative stress. Since functional and structural properties are often <b>interwinded,</b> here we characterize the structure of mitochondrial networks in mouse embryonic fibroblasts using network tools and percolation theory. Subsequently we perturbed the system either by promoting the fusion of mitochondrial segments or by inducing mitochondrial fission. Quantitative analysis of mitochondrial clusters revealed that the structural parameters of healthy mitochondria lay in between the extremes of highly fragmented and completely fusioned networks. We confirmed our results by contrasting our emprirical findings with the predictions of a recently described computational model of mitochondrial network emergence based on fission-fusion kinetics. Altogether these results not only offer an objective methodology to parametrize the complexity of this organelle but add weight to the idea that mitochondrial networks behave as critical systems and undergo structural phase transitions...|$|R
50|$|After Abir Chatterjee {{decided to}} opt {{for the role of}} Byomkesh Bakshi, Sandip Ray decided to cancel the reboot series because the {{director}} and many others were of the view that the same person doing both Feluda and Byomkesh Bakshi won’t be accepted by the audience. Ray again proposed the role again to Sabyasachi Chakraborty, who earlier proposed Ray to take Abir Chatterjee for the role. Though, initially reluctant, Chakraborty decided to accept the role since he can't reject Ray's proposal. Chakraborty has reportedly decided to look young to fit himself in the role. Along with Chakraborty, Saheb Bhattacharya also made a comeback with the role of Topshe. Ray also stated that his upcoming Feluda film would not star the character of Jatayu, since he couldn't find any suitable replacement for Bibhu Bhattacharya and it was a godsend that both the stories he decided to <b>interwind</b> to put into celluloid did not have the mention of the character.Apart from veterans Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Dhritiman Chatterjee, Paran Bandopadhyay, Bratya Basu, Rajesh Sharma (actor) and many more, Gaurav Chakraborty was announced to be the part of the cast.|$|R
40|$|A body of {{evidence}} supports the idea that newly replicated Escherichia coli chromosomes segregate progressively as replication progresses, with spatial separation of sister genetic loci occurring ∼ 15 min after their replication. We show that {{the time of this}} cohesion can be modulated by topoisomerase IV (TopoIV) activity. Impairment of TopoIV prevents segregation of newly replicated sister loci and bulk chromosome segregation, whereas modest increases in TopoIV decrease the cohesion time substantially. Therefore, we propose that precatenanes, which form as replication progresses by <b>interwinding</b> of newly replicated sister chromosomes, are responsible for E. coli sister chromosome cohesion...|$|E
40|$|Interactive haptics-assisted docking {{provides}} a virtual {{environment for the}} study of molecular complex formation. It enables the user to interact with the virtual molecules, experience the interaction forces via their sense of touch, and gain insights about the docking process itself. Here we use a recently developed haptics software tool, Haptimol_RD, for the rigid docking of protein subunits to form complexes. Dimers, both homo and hetero, are loaded into the software with their subunits separated in space for the purpose of assessing whether they can be brought back into the correct docking pose via rigid-body movements. Four dimers were classified into two types: two with an <b>interwinding</b> subunit interface and two with a non-interwinding subunit interface. It was found that the two with an <b>interwinding</b> interface could not be docked whereas the two with the non-interwinding interface could be. For the two that could be docked a “sucking” effect could be felt on the haptic device when the correct binding pose was approached which is associated with a minimum in the interaction energy. It is clear that for those that could not be docked, the conformation of {{one or both of the}} subunits must change upon docking. This leads to the steric-based concept of a locked or non-locked interface. Non-locked interfaces have shapes that allow the subunits to come together or come apart without the necessity of intra-subunit conformational change, whereas locked interfaces require a conformational change within one or both subunits for them to be able to come apart...|$|E

40|$|Four {{kinds of}} {{modified}} montmorillonites were prepared by introducing different content of hexadecyltriphenyl phosphonium cations into sodium montmorillonite (Na/MMT) through an ion-exchange method, and characterized using thermogravimetry (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). Also the Zeta potentials and antibacterial activity of the modified montmorillonites were investigated. The onset temperatures of the decomposition for quaternary phosphonium cations in modified montmorillonites are all higher than 230 ¡䪠which have good thermal stability. For the montmorillonites, the interlayer spacings enlarge, the Zeta potentials increase and the antibacterial activity improves {{with the increase of}} the content of quaternary phosphonium cations. Na/MMT displays flake shape with the particles adhered and <b>interwinded</b> each other, while the modified montmorillonites are in irregular shape. QPC/MMTª² 3 containing 23. 55 wt% quaternary phosphonium cations, possesses the minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) against E. coli and S. aureus of 1. 2 g/L and 0. 1 g/L, respectively. After contacting the bacteria for 24 h, 1. 0 g/L of QPC/MMT- 3 is able to kill more than 99. 9 % E. coli, and nearly all the E. coli. Moreover, QPC/MMT- 3 has good water resistance. </FONT...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of adenosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, Escherichia coli recA protein extensively unwinds duplex DNA in a reaction that is strongly stimulated by either homologous or heterologous single-stranded DNA [Cunningham, R. P., Shibata, T., DasGupta, C. & Radding, C. M. (1979) Nature (London) 281, 191 - 195]. In {{the presence}} of ATP and homologous circular single-stranded DNA, recA protein also unwinds circular duplex DNA that is nicked at a heterologous site. When DNA ligase seals this nick, the product is a highly negatively superhelical molecule that can be relaxed by E. coli topoisomerase I. This unwinding requires {{a high degree of}} homology since phi X 174 single-stranded DNA does not serve as a cofactor in the unwinding of G 4 DNA, even though these molecules are 70 % homologous. Like synapsis itself, and unlike strand exchange which follows synapsis, unwinding is sensitive to inhibition by ADP. Because recA protein unwinds duplex DNA when neither the single-stranded DNA nor the duplex DNA has a free end in the region of homology, unwinding can be initiated or mediated by a synaptic structure that differs from that of a simple D loop. The paired circular single strand in the synaptic structure behaves like one strand of an under-wound helix because E. coli topoisomerase I can <b>interwind</b> it with its complement...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a 95 ks Chandra {{observation}} of the TeV emitting High Mass X-ray Binary LSI + 61 303, using the ACIS-S camera in Continuos Clocking mode {{to search for a}} possible X-ray pulsar in this system. The observation was performed while the compact object was passing from phase 0. 94 to 0. 98 in its orbit around the Be companion star (hence close to the apastron passage). We did not find any periodic or quasi-periodic signal (at this orbital phase) in a frequency range of 0. 005 - 175 Hz. We derived an average pulsed fraction 3 sigma upper limit for the presence of a periodic signal of ~ 10 % (although this limit is strongly dependent on the frequency and the energy band), the deepest limit ever reached for this object. Furthermore, the source appears highly variable in flux and spectrum even in this very small orbital phase range, in particular we detect two flares, lasting thousands of seconds, with a very hard X-ray spectrum with respect to the average source spectral distribution. The X-ray pulsed fraction limits we derived are lower than the pulsed fraction of any isolated rotational-powered pulsar, in particular having a TeV counterpart. In this scenario most of the X-ray emission of LSI + 61 303 should necessarily come from the <b>interwind</b> or inner-pulsar wind zone shock rather than from the magnetosphere of the putative pulsar. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for the previously suggested extended X-ray emission (abridged). Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, MNRAS in pres...|$|R
40|$|Although linking {{number is}} an {{effective}} topological invariant for describing supercoiled DNA, it is inadequate for the additional <b>interwinding</b> in catenated or knotted DNA. We explain how the two-bridge theory of Schubert provides a powerful yet simple method for analyzing these forms by associating them with two integral invariants, alpha and beta, that measure their geometric complexity. These integers can either be determined graphically or computed {{with the aid of}} standard tables, and they allow tabulation of all possible stereoisomers of a given knot or catenane. A complete classification can then be made via a simple theorem. Stereoisomers of representative knots and catenanes are tabulated for easy reference. There are four stereoisomers of regularly interlocked catenanes that we designate right-handed parallel, right-handed antiparallel, left-handed parallel, and left-handed antiparallel according to the helical intertwining of the rings. The biological processes that form catenanes [...] replication, recombination, and topoisomerase action [...] predict distinctly different isomers...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} conformations {{of a model}} for a short segment of closed DNA. The {{molecule}} is represented as a cylindrically symmetric elastic rod with a constraint corresponding to a specification of the linking number. We obtain analytic expressions leading to the spatial configuration of a family of solutions representing distortions that interpolate between the circular form of DNA and a figure-eight form that represents the onset of <b>interwinding.</b> We are also able to generate knotted loops. We suggest ways to use our approach to produce other configurations relevant to studies of DNA structure. The stability of the distorted configurations is assessed, along with the effects of fluctuations on the free energy of the various configurations. Comment: 39 pages in REVTEX with 14 eps figures.

40|$|Extensive {{computer}} based engineering design effort resulted in optimization of a superconducting magnet design {{with an average}} bulk current density of approximately 12 KA/cm(2). Twisted, stranded 0. 0045 inch diameter NbTi superconductor in a copper matrix was selected. Winding the coil from this bundle facilitated uniform winding of the small diameter wire. Test coils were wound using a first lot of the wire. The actual packing density was measured from these. <b>Interwinding</b> voltage break down tests on the test coils indicated the need for adjustment of the wire insulation on the lot of wire subsequently ordered for construction of the delivered superconducting magnet. Using the actual packing densities from the test coils, a final magnet design, with the required enhancement and field profile, was generated. All mechanical and thermal design parameters were then also fixed. The superconducting magnet was then fabricated and tested. The first test was made with the magnet immersed in liquid helium at 4. 2 K. The second test was conducted at 2 K in vacuum. In the latter test, the magnet was conduction cooled from the mounting flange end...|$|E
40|$|A new {{modelling}} {{method for}} magnetic circuits {{is presented in}} this thesis. This method {{can be used to}} model magnetic circuits with any number of windings. The models incorporate adequate information about the correct distribution of leakage energy, the presence of gaps throughout the core, the arrangement of the windings, and the type of core used. These new electric circuit models (physical models) are "physically natural"; i. e., the elements in the models have a one-to-one relationship with corresponding physical quantities in the original magnetic structure. Several commonly used arrangements such as toroids with uniformly distributed turns, and bobbin core structures with multiple windings were modelled with the new technique. The measured electric circuit model values always compared favorably with the predicted physical values derived with the new method. By breaking the windings of the magnetic circuit into their separate layers, a more elaborate and accurate set of models (layer-to-layer models) can be obtained. These models incorporate additional information about the correct distribution of the windings and <b>interwinding</b> self-capacitances. Because of the complicated nature of these elaborate models, they are more suitable for computer analysis of magnetic circuits. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a physical model for three phase power transformers {{with the goal}} of advancing techniques for the physical interpretation of Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) data. The model is structured such that it facilitates end to end FRA tests. A parameter estimation algorithm is then simultaneously applied to the three end to end test permutations. The proposed model utilises parameters such as the core yoke and limb lengths, the core's cross sectional area, and the number of turns on each winding to determine the inductive relationships between each of the transformer's windings. Parameters such as the conductor cross sectional area and number of disc layers are used to account for skin and proximity effects within the windings. Furthermore, the various tank, core and <b>interwinding</b> capacitive couplings are also incorporated into the model. To demonstrate the veracity of the model, FRA tests were conducted on a Dyn 1 1. 3 MVA 11 kV/ 430 V distribution transformer. Using the FRA data, the key parameter estimates for the proposed model were obtained and compared against their physically measured counterparts. The relative accuracy of the results demonstrates the applicability of the proposed transformer modelling approach...|$|E
40|$|To {{initiate}} homologous recombination, sequence {{similarity between}} two DNA molecules must be searched for and homology recognized. How {{the search for}} and recognition of homology occurs remains unproven. We have examined the influences of DNA topology and the polarity of RecA–single-stranded (ss) DNA filaments on the formation of synaptic complexes promoted by RecA. Using two complementary methods and various ssDNA and duplex DNA molecules as substrates, we demonstrate that topological constraints on a small circular RecA–ssDNA filament prevent it from <b>interwinding</b> with its duplex DNA target at the homologous region. We were unable to detect homologous pairing between a circular RecA–ssDNA filament and its relaxed or supercoiled circular duplex DNA targets. However, the formation of synaptic complexes between an invading linear RecA–ssDNA filament and covalently closed circular duplex DNAs is promoted by supercoiling of the duplex DNA. The results imply that a triplex structure formed by non-Watson–Crick hydrogen bonding {{is unlikely to be}} an intermediate in homology searching promoted by RecA. Rather, a model in which RecA-mediated homology searching requires unwinding of the duplex DNA coupled with local strand exchange is the likely mechanism. Furthermore, we show that polarity of the invading RecA–ssDNA does not affect its ability to pair and interwind with its circular target duplex DNA...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{serves to}} {{describe}} {{the findings of the}} investigation into the possible existence and occurrence of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in the Eskom MTS. The project commenced in January 1999 and is a joint collaboration between Eskom, the University of Cape Town and EPRI. Eskom has been aware since about 1990, that occasional severe geomagnetic storms in the Southern Cape might disrupt the MTS in that area. At that time no correlation was observed between disruptions at selected sites of the Eskom MTS and geomagnetic activity. (The sites selected were based on the knowledge at that time.) However, there is now evidence that the sites most susceptible are not at the conventionally accepted locations, and that damage and disruption may have occurred where it was not expected. For this project a thorough literature search was done to understand the source and effects of GICs. An investigation was conducted into the past events on the Eskom MTS, which was compared with geomagnetic activity to check for correlation. Finally, the modelling process of a network that would indicate its susceptibility to GICs was studied. Typical disruptions that would indicate the existence of GICs include Buchholz trips, <b>interwinding</b> faults, permanent failure due to internal faults, etc. From this investigation there is circumstantial evidence that equipment damage may have occurred due to geomagnetic activity during the previous solar cycle peak...|$|E
40|$|Transcriptional {{regulation}} in differentiating microorganisms is highly dynamic involving multiple and <b>interwinding</b> circuits consisted of many regulatory genes. Elucidation of these networks {{may provide the}} key to harness the full capacity of many organisms that produce natural products. A powerful tool evolved {{in the past decade}} is global transcriptional study of mutants in which one or more key regulatory genes of interest have been deleted. To study regulatory mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor, we developed a framework of systematic analysis of gene expression dynamics. Instead of pair-wise comparison of samples in different combinations, genomic DNA was used as a common reference for all samples in microarray assays, thus, enabling direct comparison of gene transcription dynamics across different isogenic mutants. As growth and various differentiation events may unfold at different rates in different mutants, the global transcription profiles of each mutant were first aligned computationally to those of the wild type, with respect to the corresponding growth and differentiation stages, prior to identification of kinetically differentially expressed genes. The genome scale transcriptome data from wild type and a Δ absA 1 mutant of Streptomyces coelicolor were analyzed within this framework, and the regulatory elements affected by the gene knockout were identified. This methodology should find general applications in the analysis of other mutants in our repertoire and in other biological systems...|$|E
40|$|We report our {{observations}} of a swirling flare-related EUV jet on 2011 October 15. We utilised the EUV observations from SDO/AIA. We extracted a wide slit along the jet axis and 12 thin slits across its axis {{to investigate the}} longitudinal motion and transverse rotation. We also used data from STEREO/EUVI to investigate the 3 D structure of the jet. Gound-based Hα images provide {{a good opportunity to}} explore the relationship between the cool surge and hot jet. LOS magnetograms from SDO/HMI enable us to study the magnetic evolution of the flare/jet event. The onset of jet eruption coincided with the start time of C 1. 6 flare impulsive phase. The initial velocity and acceleration of the longitudinal motion were 254 ± 10 km s^- 1 and - 97 ± 5 m s^- 2, respectively. The jet presented helical structure and transverse swirling motion at the beginning of its eruption. The counter-clockwise rotation slowed down from an average velocity of ∼ 122 km s^- 1 to ∼ 80 km s^- 1. The <b>interwinding</b> thick threads of the jet untwisted into multiple thin threads during the rotation that lasted for 1 cycle with a period of ∼ 7 min and an amplitude that increases from ∼ 3. 2 Mm at the bottom to ∼ 11 Mm at the upper part. Afterwards, the curtain-like leading edge of the jet continued rising without rotation, leaving a dimming region behind before falling back to the solar surface. The appearance/disappearance of dimming corresponded to the longitudinal ascending/descending motions of jet. Cospatial Hα surge and EUV dimming imply that the dimming resulted from the absorption of hot EUV emission by cool surge. The flare/jet event was caused by continuous magnetic cancellation before the start of flare. The jet was associated with the open magnetic fields at the edge of AR 11314.

40|$|There {{is raising}} {{interest}} {{in the scientific community}} about the impact of body mass on different rheumatologic diseases. A growing body of evidence suggests that the effect of obesity on joint structure goes beyond the simply overload but is based on a complex <b>interwinding</b> of cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and intracellular regulators that at different stages can modify the course of a rheumatologic disease and the clinical response to biotherapies. In these settings, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been the more extensively studied. Intriguing is the finding that the interaction between obesity and diseases seems different for PsA or RA. Concerning PsA, epidemiologic studies have provided robust data about the association between obesity and prevalence of psoriasis or PsA. Yet obesity is associated with an increase in degree of disability and poor clinical outcome on treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) drugs. Nevertheless, there are clues suggesting that weight reduction above 5 % from baseline increases the probability of achieving a good clinical response in PsA patients on anti-TNF drugs. On the contrary, the epidemiological association between obesity and RA seems to be restricted to some categories of patients with peculiar demographic and autoimmune status. Furthermore, obesity definitely impairs the clinical response of RA patients to anti-TNF treatment, and this might be an effect limited to TNF-blocking agents, as preliminary studies are not confirming these findings for abatacept or tocilizumab. However, the most puzzling aspect of the impact of obesity on RA is that obese patients tend to have a more clinical active disease, an impaired response to biotherapies, and a less radiographically evident joint damage over time. The latter is a very stimulating issue and the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms should be an auspicious challenge for the researchers, which will provide further insights on the overall management of RA...|$|E
