25|$|But {{after seven}} months I {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was {{going to take a lot}} more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} how {{behind the times}} Pawnee is, Tom said residents are now only starting to become interested in the rock band Nirvana. Tom said, [...] "I don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> tell them what's {{going to happen to}} Kurt Cobain in 1994", a reference to the suicide of the band's lead singer. Before Tom eats a hot pepper at the dinner party, he sings, [...] "This is how you eat it" [...] to the tune of the 1995 Montell Jordan song [...] "This Is How We Do It". Leslie said she was saving an old newspaper because it had the [...] "first rumblings of Iran-Contra", a reference to the scandal in which U.S. figures facilitated the sale of arms to Iran. Tom visits Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, to learn more about India when quizzed by Justin.|$|E
2500|$|Jo first {{appears in}} the 1971 serial Terror of the Autons, having been {{assigned}} to the Doctor (Jon Pertwee) {{as a replacement for}} Liz Shaw (Caroline John). Apparently, she gained the assignment to UNIT because her uncle, a high ranking civil servant, had [...] "pulled some strings". Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) assigns her to the Doctor, who is initially dismayed when he finds out that she is not a scientist, but accepts her because he does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> tell her otherwise. An enthusiastic, bubbly and sometimes scatter-brained blonde, Jo soon endears herself to the other members of UNIT, especially Captain Mike Yates (Richard Franklin) and Sergeant Benton (John Levene). The Third Doctor is also particularly attached to her, and she is devoted to him, refusing to leave his side even where mortal danger is involved.|$|E

2500|$|Vamp Willow {{appears in}} the third season episodes [...] "The Wish" [...] and [...] "Doppelgangland". She is [...] and aggressive, the {{opposite}} of Willow's usual nature; her bad behavior so exaggerated {{that it does not}} instill fear into the viewer like other female vampires in the series, but indicates more about Willow's personality. Shocked upon seeing her alter ego in [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow states [...] "That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil and [...] And I think I'm kinda gay!" [...] Angel is stopped by Buffy in telling the Scoobies that the vampire self carries many of the same attributes as the human self, at which Willow says that is nothing like her. Many Buffy fans saw this as a funny Easter egg when Willow revealed herself to actually be a lesbian in later seasons. As surprised as Willow is with Vamp Willow, she feels bound to her, and does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> allow Buffy to kill her. Both Willows make the observation that [...] "this world's no fun", before they send Vamp Willow back into the alternate dimension from which she came, whereupon she is staked and dies immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Although I am {{ordinary}} and foolish, but I {{have had the}} opportunity to, by my ancestors' largess, receive the opportunity to be an imperial messenger when leaving the capital and a guard leader in the capital. If the administration falls and I am unable to help it, even the most understanding wise man will rebuke me. Therefore, I have organized a righteous army and sought peace with the barbarians to the north [...] to try to calm the earth and to protect Sui. However, for the people under the heavens, there must be someone to rule over them, and other than you, who can be that person? I am too old – over 50 – and that is not my intent, but I am happy to support you, my younger brother.

5000|$|When later {{asked by}} the CUP {{secretary}} general Mithat Şukru Bleda how he, as a doctor, <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> kill so many people he replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've done {{everything}} in the world for her," [...] he cried, [...] "and she <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> treat me like this. How cruel, how monstrously cruel!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> think so," [...] {{returned}} Biddy, [...] "say so. Say so {{over and}} over again, if you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> think so." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{drive me}} mad. It's so serious, it's so tremendously serious, and you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> make little jokes about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a happiness--for {{surely a}} father would not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> sell his own child to {{ambition}} and mercenary hopes! And thy mother?" ...|$|E
60|$|She said it so sweetly, {{with her}} pretty Scotch accent, that I couldn't imagine how Dick <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> refuse her. But he did, all the same.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say nay, Mabel; they wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> hurt you. No, {{not even}} a fiery Mingo devil would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> hurt a hair of your head. Bad as I suspect the vampires to be, I do not suspect them of {{anything}} so wicked as that. They might have wished you, nay, forced you to become the wife {{of one of their}} chiefs, and that would be torment enough to a Christian young woman; but beyond that I do not think even the Mingos themselves would have gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|RANKIN. If a man <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> pull <b>the</b> trigger, {{it matters}} little what color his hand is, Mr. Drinkwotter. Have ye {{anything}} else {{to say to me}} this afternoon? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} the Hurons will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> do what you say, Deerslayer?" [...] she asked. [...] "I have found them kind and harmless." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Was {{not that}} little fellow cute? I have had several fawns, but <b>have</b> never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> keep them," [...] said Betty. Then, as Alfred made no motion to speak, she continued: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing is settled. I <b>have</b> not <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> {{think of}} it. It {{will not be}} {{for a month or}} two yet. I suppose I shall stay out my regular Indian time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I {{the first}} man who has {{neglected}} his duties for your sake?" [...] he asked. [...] "I wonder whether the masters at school <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> report you when you neglected your lessons?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} {{with my father}} once more," [...] Jacob said, in a tone so piteous that I did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> make any protest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm awfully sorry," [...] {{cried the}} boy, in answer. [...] "I wonder you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> laugh at all. But how am I {{to get you}} out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{always seemed}} {{very fond of}} them. Even if {{he was tired of}} me, I wonder that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> leave them. It's all so incredible. Even now I can hardly believe it's true." ...|$|R

60|$|I never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> throw {{cold water}} on Euphemia's noble emotions, and so I did not tell her that the notice merely {{requested}} travellers to remove from their trunks the anciennes etiquettes, or old railway labels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dost thou hear me, son?" [...] {{continued}} the prisoner, uncovering his head: [...] "dost thou {{really think they}} will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> chase the spider from my cell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. At first I thought I {{would do}} so, {{but he looked}} so down-and-out that I didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> say {{anything}} and perhaps make him feel worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{retuning}} to {{his place}} of business Teddy did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>to</b> wait upon the customers, and after telling Tim what had been said to him, he added: ...|$|E
