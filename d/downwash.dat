5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor <b>downwash</b> from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk wing is strut-braced, {{constructed}} from aluminum tubing {{and covered with}} either pre-sewn Dacron envelopes or doped aircraft fabric. The wing also features flaps. The fuselage is of similar construction and uses a curved boom tube for its main structural member. The curved tube allows the tail to be located higher, out of the wing's <b>downwash,</b> especially when the flaps are extended. Landing gear for all models is optionally tricycle or conventional.|$|E
25|$|The first Type 192 {{prototype}} XG447 flew on 5 July 1958 with tandem wooden rotor blades, {{a completely}} manual control {{system and a}} castored, fixed quadricycle undercarriage. From the fifth prototype, the rotors fitted were all-metal, four-bladed units. Production model controls and instruments allowed night operations. The prototype machines had an upwards-hinged main passenger and cockpit door, which was prone to being slammed shut by the <b>downwash</b> from the rotors. This {{was replaced by a}} sliding door on the later aircraft.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{influence of}} <b>downwashing</b> on atmospherically deposited elements is of rare focus {{compared with other}} geochemical processes related to peat. <b>Downwashing</b> may cause a rapid downward movement of atmospherically supplied elements before they bond to the peat organic substrate and thus reduce the reliability of age-depth models that rely on atmospherically supplied radioisotopes (e. g. 210 Pb, 241 Am, 137 Cs). However, the existence of <b>downwashing</b> has not been directly tested, and to which depth the deposited element can be washed down is not fully understood. To {{address the question of}} <b>downwashing,</b> an experiment was set up to mimic wet deposition by applying a CuBr 2 solution during a three-week period in peat cores collected from Rödmossamyran. Through this, the experimental results clearly supported the existence of downward mobility. Added Cu 2 + could be measured to a depth of 10 cm, similar to previous studies based on Be and Pb. As a similar metal to Cu, the age-depth model based on 210 Pb dating could underestimate the ages to some extent without consideration of <b>downwashing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lift {{interference}} effects are discussed based on Bland's (1968) integral equation. A mathematical existence theory is utilized for which convergence of the numerical method {{has been proved}} for general (square-integrable) <b>downwashes.</b> Airloads are computed using orthogonal airfoil polynomial pairs {{in conjunction with a}} collocation method which is numerically equivalent to Galerkin's method and complex least squares. Convergence exhibits exponentially decreasing error with the number n of collocation points for smooth <b>downwashes,</b> whereas errors are proportional to 1 /n for discontinuous <b>downwashes.</b> The latter can be reduced to 1 /n to the m+ 1 power with mth-order Richardson extrapolation (by using m = 2, hundredfold error reductions were obtained with only a 13 % increase of computer time). Numerical results are presented showing acoustic resonance, as well as the effect of Mach number, ventilation, height-to-chord ratio, and mode shape on wind-tunnel interference. Excellent agreement with experiment is obtained in steady flow, and good agreement is obtained for unsteady flow...|$|R

25|$|In 2002, the EC135 Active Control Technology demonstrator/Flying Helicopter Simulator (ACT/FHS), a {{research}} aircraft designed to test fibre optic-based flight control systems, undertook its first flight. In 2014, Airbus Helicopters began flying the Bluecopter Demonstrator aircraft, built to explore more efficient design elements, including economy-optimised single-engine operations, Blue Edge swept rotor blades to reduce noise and increase efficiency, a relocated horizontal stabilizer outside the main rotor's <b>downwash,</b> an active rudder, and new water-based external paint; these changes {{were aimed at}} cutting fuel consumption by 40%.

25|$|When on {{approach}} to land, the pilot would push the stick forward to gain speed for the flare and landing. As speed built up, the rear wing, operating at a greater {{angle of attack}} would gain lift and pitch the aircraft's nose further downward. The pilot's normal reaction would be to pull back on the stick. This action would increase the angle of attack on the front wing by lowering {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. Because the trailing edge of the front wing was close to {{the leading edge of the}} rear wing, the front wing's <b>downwash</b> would accelerate the air over the rear wing and cause it to gain lift more quickly than the front wing, resulting in an ever-increasing nose pitch-down and flight directly into the ground.|$|E
500|$|The V-22 has {{a maximum}} rotor <b>downwash</b> speed above 80 knots, {{more than the}} 64 knots lower limit of a hurricane. The rotorwash usually {{prevents}} usage of the starboard door in hover, instead the rear ramp is used for rappelling and hoisting. Boeing has stated the V-22 design loses 10 percent of its vertical lift over a tiltwing design when operating in helicopter mode because of airflow resistance due to the wings, but that the tiltrotor design has better short takeoff and landing performance. V-22s must maintain at least [...] of vertical separation between each other to avoid each other's rotor wake, which can cause turbulence and potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control.|$|E
40|$|A model, {{based on}} the physico-chemical {{properties}} of gypsum, is postulated in order to interpret the regular distribution of plant communities associated with the topography and the main environmental stresses to which each vegetation type is subjected in a landscape unit. The leaf chemical composition of 28 representative plant species supports the main predictions of the model: species from low areas present large concentrations of Na, N and ash but low contents of Ca. It is demonstrated that the strong nutrient and salt <b>downwashing</b> in the hilly terrain is an important cause of the vegetation segregation observed on a large spatial scale. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Rhizofiltration may be {{applicable}} {{to the treatment of}} surface water and groundwater, industrial and residential effluents, <b>downwashes</b> from power lines, storm waters, acid mine drainage, agricultural runoffs, diluted sludges, and radionuclide-contaminated solutions.Plants suitable for rhizofiltration applications can efficiently remove toxic metals from a solution using rapid-growth root systems. Various terrestrial plant species have been found to effectively remove toxic metals such as Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr6+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ from aqueous solutions. It was also found that low level radioactive contaminants can successfully be removed from liquid streams. A system to achieve this can consist of a “feeder layer” of soil suspended above a contaminated stream through which plants grow, extending the bulk of their roots into the water. The feeder layer allows the plants to receive fertilizer without contaminating the stream, while simultaneously removing heavy metals from the water. Trees have also been applied to remediation. Trees are the lowest cost plant type. They can grow on land of marginal quality and have long life-spans. This results in little or no maintenance costs. The most commonly used are willows and poplars, which can grow 6 - 8’ per year and have a high flood tolerance. For deep contamination, hybrid poplars with roots extending 30 feet deep have been used. Their roots penetrate microscopic scale pores in the soil matrix and can cycle 100 L of water per day per tree. These trees act almost like a pump and treat remediation system.|$|R
40|$|We have {{generalized}} observation data on Fisht Glacier – {{the most}} western glacier in the Caucasus located at elevation 2450 – 2750 m asl. Considering location of Fisht Glacier we might сonsider {{it one of}} the most sensitive to climate change glaciers in the Caucasus. We used the following materials: sketch map (1909), aerial photos (1954), topographic map (1957), detailed map (1 : 5000, 1982), LIDAR survey data (2010) and finally UAV data (2015). We have noted considerable shrinkage of glacier area from 0. 9 ± 0. 1 to 0. 5 ± 0. 01 km 2 in 1909 – 2015, retreat of glacier termini was assessed as 200 ± 20 m (eastern snout) and 350 ± 20 m (western snout). We consider that during 1982 – 2010 the glacier was close to equilibrium, but during 2010 – 2015 the glacier surface elevation lowering up to 15 – 20 m was accompanied by an abrupt decrease of glacier area at about 15 %. Rapid glacier <b>downwashing</b> in 2010 – 2015 could be explained by a significant decrease of October-May (accumulation season) precipitation and snow thickness accompanied by an increase of June-September (ablation season) air temperature in comparison to 1982 – 2010. During 2010 – 2015 mean ablation was about 800 mm w. e. more than during 1982 – 2010. Basing on geodetical data on glacier change in 1982 – 2010 and ablation values assessed using DDF (4600 mm w. e.) we have roughly estimated mean accumulation at Fisht Glacier as 4500 mm w. e. In 2010 – 2015 mean accumulation was at least 600 mm w. e. lower than in 1982 – 2010. As a result in 2010 – 2015 Fisht Glacier lost at least 1500 mm w. e. more than in 1982 – 2010. Basing on obtained results we could adjust regional pattern of the glacier response to climate change in the Caucasus. Rarely applied in Russia both LIDAR and UAV techniques are recognized as precise tools for mapping glacier surface in high mountains.  </p...|$|R
500|$|Another {{class of}} {{inherent}} errors {{is that of}} position error. [...] A position error is produced by the aircraft's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft. [...] This error {{is caused by the}} air flowing past the static port at a speed different from the aircraft's true airspeed. [...] Position errors may provide positive or negative errors, depending on one of several factors. [...] These factors include airspeed, angle of attack, aircraft weight, acceleration, aircraft configuration, {{and in the case of}} helicopters, rotor <b>downwash.</b> [...] There are two categories of position errors, which are [...] "fixed errors" [...] and [...] "variable errors". [...] Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft. [...] Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air, or particular situations which may overstress the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|On 13 January 2007, a 200-strong British force, led by Royal Marines, {{launched}} an operation to attack Jugroom Fort, a major Taliban base in southern Helmand Province.

A rescue mission was launched using four volunteers, Royal Marines and a Royal Engineer, strapped to the stub-wings of two Apaches. The helicopters could not travel above 50mph {{to ensure the safety of}} the extra passengers from rotor <b>downwash.</b> The Apaches landed under fire inside the compound, after which the rescuers dismounted and recovered the body of LCpl Ford. Ford's body was flown out in the same manner that the soldiers arrived. Other Apaches hovered above, providing suppressive fire throughout.

2500|$|To {{prove the}} concept Miles {{designed}} and built a 5/8th scale version, the M.39B, which flew on 22 July 1943, showing no [...] "undesirable handling" [...] characteristics. It coincided with interest by the authorities in unorthodox designs for large aircraft. The rear wing was higher than the forward one to avoid <b>downwash</b> and give ground clearance for the propellers. The M39 design had inboard flaps and outboard ailerons on the rear wing and the front wing had an auxiliary aerofoil/flap/elevator device, which could vary the wing area without changing lift coefficient.|$|E

2500|$|When {{flying in}} {{airplane}} mode, {{the majority of}} lift is produced by the AW609's wings, which are slightly forward-swept. Both the wing and the main fuselage are made largely of composite materials. The [...] wings feature flaperon control surfaces which are normally automatically controlled; in vertical flight, the flaperons drop to a 66-degree downwards angle to reduce the wing area being encountered by <b>downwash</b> from the proprotors. A high-mounted rudderless vertical stabiliser is attached {{the rear of the}} fuselage to stabilise flight while in aircraft mode. In the event of a single engine failure, either engine can provide power to both proprotors via a drive shaft; the AW609 is also capable of autorotation. The AW609 has been designed to develop Full Transport Category/Class 1 performance to operate safely even when flown under single engine conditions. It is equipped with a de-icing system, and is to be certified for flying into known icing conditions. Building on experiences with the V-22, the AW609 is outfitted with a sink rate warning system.|$|E
2500|$|Petter {{initiated}} a design proposal with F. W."Freddie" [...] Page leading {{the design and}} Ray Creasey responsible for the aerodynamics. By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40° swept wing [...] This proposal was submitted in the November [...] and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric. On 29 March 1949 [...] MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949. To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60° with the ailerons moved to the wingtips. In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large <b>downwash</b> on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing. Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.|$|E
50|$|Induced drag - Induced drag is {{a result}} of an imperfect, or non-infinite, lifting surface (in this case the keel, rudder and any other appendages.) When lift is {{generated}} in three dimensions, a closed circulation loop is formed which creates <b>downwash.</b> This <b>downwash</b> alters the free stream velocity, by rotating it downward, towards the <b>downwash.</b> This new angle results in a small increase in resistance as it has a component {{in the direction of the}} free stream.|$|E
