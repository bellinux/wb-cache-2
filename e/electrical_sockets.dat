25|$|Air France has {{introduced}} a brand new economy long haul product which features a new slimline seat providing up to an inch more legroom, wider table, universal <b>electrical</b> <b>sockets,</b> retractable armrests, winged leather headrests, more storage space, high definition 10-inch screens featuring the latest in flight entertainment with a USB port, a headphones holder, and newly designed pillows featuring different patterns of the Air France logo. The seats would be installed along with the new La Première, Business, and Premium Economy seats from June 2014 till summer 2016 on the Boeing 777 aircraft, {{the core of the}} fleet. All other aircraft will be retrofitted except the Airbus A340-300 and Boeing 747-400 as they would be leaving the fleet soon.|$|E
25|$|Bed bugs {{can exist}} singly, but tend to congregate once established. Though {{strictly}} parasitic, they spend {{only a tiny}} fraction of their lifecycles physically attached to hosts. Once a bed bug finishes feeding, it relocates to a place close to a known host, commonly in or near beds or couches in clusters of adults, juveniles, and eggs—which entomologists call harborage areas or simply harborages to which the insect returns after future feedings by following chemical trails. These places can vary greatly in format, including luggage, inside of vehicles, within furniture, amongst bedside clutter—even inside <b>electrical</b> <b>sockets</b> and nearby laptop computers. Bed bugs may also nest near animals that have nested within a dwelling, such as bats, birds, or rodents. They are also capable of surviving on domestic cats and dogs, though humans are the preferred host of C. lectularius.|$|E

25|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>sockets</b> {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>sockets</b> {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide three electrical {{connections to the}} supply conductors. These are termed neutral, line and earth. [...] Both neutral and line carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually at or very near to earth potential, being earthed either at the substation or at the service entrance (neutral-to-earth bonding is not permitted in the distribution board/consumer unit). Line (commonly, but technically incorrectly, called live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral. The [...] protective earth connection allows the exposed metal parts of the appliance {{to be connected to}} earth, providing protection to the user should those exposed parts inadvertently come into contact with any live parts within the appliance. [...] Historically, two-pin sockets without earth were used in Britain, but their use is now restricted to sockets specifically designated for shavers and toothbrushes.|$|E
2500|$|Plastic Slinkys {{are also}} available. They {{can be made}} in {{different}} colors. Many of them are made with the colors of the rainbow in rainbow order. They were marketed in the 1970s as a safer alternative to metal slinkys as they did not present a hazard when inserted into <b>electrical</b> <b>sockets.</b> The plastic spring toy, known as the Plastic Slinky was invented by Donald James Reum Sr. of Master Mark Plastics in Albany, Minnesota. Reum {{came up with the idea}} as he was playing with different techniques to produce a spiral hose for watering plants. [...] However, as it came off the assembly line, according to his children, it looked more like a [...] "Slinky." [...] He worked at it until it came out perfectly and then went to Betty James with his prototype. Reum manufactured the Plastic Slinky for Betty James for several years. [...] Eventually Betty James [...] decided to manufacture the product exclusively through James manufacturing, effectively ending the production of the toy by the small Minnesota company. Reum’s patent number, 4120929 was filed on Dec 28, 1976 and issued by the US Patent Office on Oct 17, 1978.|$|E

50|$|A {{power strip}} (also {{known as an}} {{extension}} block, power board, power bar, plug board, trailing gang, trailing socket, plug bar, trailer lead, multi-socket, multiple socket, multiple outlet, polysocket and by many other variations) is a block of <b>electrical</b> <b>sockets</b> that attaches {{to the end of}} a flexible cable (typically with a mains plug on the other end), allowing multiple electrical devices to be powered from a single electrical socket. Power strips are often used when many electrical devices are in proximity, such as for audio, video, computer systems, appliances, power tools, and lighting. Power strips often include a circuit breaker to interrupt the electric current in case of an overload or a short circuit. Some power strips provide protection against electrical power surges. Typical housing styles may include strip, rack-mount, under-monitor and direct plug-in.|$|E
