5|$|In {{its first}} year of service, an IK-3 was lost {{when one of the}} {{squadron}} commanders, Kapetan Anton Ercigoj, was making a mock attack on a Potez 25 over the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. After passing below the Potez, he went into a climb with the intention of performing a loop. His rate of climb was too steep and the aircraft fell into a spin at low altitude and <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in early April 1941, the 51st Fighter Group was placed under the 6th Fighter Regiment, which was responsible for the defence of Belgrade. The 51st Fighter Group was further reinforced the day before the invasion began, with the 102nd Fighter Squadron equipped with Bf 109Es. When the invasion began on 6 April, the two IK-3 squadrons had only three serviceable aircraft each.|$|E
5|$|No. 77 Squadron {{returned}} to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageIII supersonic fighters, undertaking its initial flights on 7July. The Mirages {{were charged with}} interception, high- and low-angle bombing, close air support, and photo reconnaissance; their armament included 30mm cannon, Sidewinder missiles and conventional bombs. No.77 Squadron's prime role was ground attack, although none of the RAAF's Mirages ever saw combat. No.481 Squadron was responsible for day-to-day servicing, {{as well as most}} heavy maintenance. No.77 Squadron suffered its first fatal Mirage accident on 3April 1973, when an aircraft crashed during a training flight at low altitude. Another pilot was killed when his Mirage <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> during formation flying at night on 24June 1976.|$|E
5|$|OTUs, {{employing}} as {{they did}} warplanes that were more advanced and more powerful than trainers, and teaching combat techniques that often carried high risk, generally suffered higher accident rates than other flying training schools. On 3March 1943, a Wirraway of No.4 OTU crashed near Williamtown, killing both crewmen. Two others died when their Vengeance crashed and burned near Goulburn during a cross-country exercise on 4August. On 16August, a Vengeance flew into trees after apparently pulling out late from a dive, resulting in two fatalities. A Vengeance blew up in flight during dive-bombing practice at Williamtown on 14September, killing both crewmen. On 5October, a Vengeance on a dive-bombing exercise crashed into the sea near Newcastle; both crewmen were reported as missing, believed killed. No.4 OTU suffered two more fatalities when a Vengeance struck a hill near Braidwood during a cross-country flight on 26November 1943. Another Vengeance <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and exploded in Nelson Bay on 7April 1944 after failing to recover from a dive, killing the two-man crew.|$|E
50|$|Chambers {{pulls back}} on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire. Chambers {{immediately}} <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> fire extinguishing button, and the flames are momentarily extinguished. Because the aircraft is at such a low altitude, the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire suppression bottle. But by this time, the aircraft stall alarm is activated and <b>the</b> aircraft's tail <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> All <b>the</b> passengers wake up, and realizing what is happening, most panic. Chambers is able to pull up, but the plane's right wing <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> again. <b>The</b> plane lifts into the air for a moment, then <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Because of <b>the</b> hard impact, the plane becomes grounded in the ocean and begins to sink.|$|R

25|$|On 24 September 2017, an Italian Air Force {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the sea during an airshow in Terracina, Lazio, Italy. The pilot Capt. Gabriele Orlandi did not eject and died in the accident. The Italian Air Force said the jet completed a loop but then failed to get enough lift as it approached sea level and <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{just a few hundred}} meters offshore. The body of the pilot was recovered soon after. An investigation was opened into the cause.|$|E
25|$|It {{was further}} theorized that the abrupt change in {{transverse}} rotational axis during the ship's descent {{down the long}} launch ramp caused the bow to press against the chute itself as the stern <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> This may have caused a crack somewhere in the keel, contributing to admission of water to the hull. Regardless of the exact cause, it was eventually determined that full responsibility {{for the loss of}} the steamship was due to the shipyard's technical mistakes during launch and not in the design or construction of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{with the}} tail first. The impact caused the fuselage {{to break into}} three main parts. The largest was the 26-meter (85ft) forward section of the aircraft, from the nose to {{the trailing edge of}} the wings. It remained afloat after the accident for about twenty hours. The midsection was 13meters (42ft) long, from the trailing edge of the wing to the rear pressure bulkhead. The aft section consisted of the tail cone, including all of the horizontal stabilizers and the vertical stabilizers. The engines and landing gear separated from the aircraft at the time of impact.|$|E

50|$|An elastic {{ball that}} bounces on <b>water,</b> <b>the</b> Waboba <b>water</b> balls flatten like a pancake when they <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface, {{increasing}} its lift and propelling it upward. When it <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> at a shallow angle, it too creates a bowl-shaped depression. But {{because it is}} soft, the ball flattens into a disc-shape when it <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> surface and this allows it to aquaplane efficiently across the surface. And {{the angle of the}} bowl-shaped depression causes it to launch into the air where the ball regains its shape, making it look as if it has bounced. The process is remarkably similar to the way stones skip across water, even though they are denser than the liquid. A shallow impact with <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface creates a bowl-shaped depression that launches the stone into the air as it leaves.|$|R

25|$|Bell's {{experiments}} with tetrahedral kites had explored {{the advantages of}} utilizing great banks of cells to create a lifting body leading to the Cygnet I. On 6 December 1907, Thomas Selfridge piloted the kite as it was towed into the air behind a motorboat, eventually reaching a height of 168ft (51 m). This was the first recorded heavier-than-air flight in Canada. While demonstrably able to fly as a person-carrying kite, it seemed unpromising as a direction for research into powered flight. It was difficult to control, and was in fact destroyed when it <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{at the end of}} the flight.|$|E
25|$|Common murres {{breed in}} colonies at high densities. Nesting pairs {{may be in}} bodily contact with their neighbours. They make no nest; their single egg is {{incubated}} on a bare rock ledge on a cliff face. Eggs hatch after ~30 days incubation. The chick is born downy and can regulate its body temperature after 10 days. Some 20 days after hatching the chick leaves its nesting ledge {{and heads for the}} sea, unable to fly, but gliding for some distance with fluttering wings, accompanied by its male parent. Chicks are capable of diving as soon as they <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The female stays at the nest site for some 14 days after the chick has left.|$|E
25|$|As the {{aircraft}} approached the MAC VOR from the north, the pilot turned right, {{heading out to}} sea, 1.0 to 1.5nm before reaching the MAC VOR. This {{made it difficult to}} establish {{the aircraft}} on the proper outbound course, though this was eventually done. The aircraft began its descent on this outbound leg, but it failed to level off at the minimum altitude of 1,540 feet. At 2416:22, the last radar contact was recorded with the aircraft 200 feet below that altitude, still outbound, and still descending at 1,050 feet per minute. At 2418 (approximately 100 seconds after the last radar return) the pilot made his last call to the controller (who did not have radar), saying he had completed his base turn back to the airport. Investigators believe the aircraft <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> very soon after that transmission.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} was eventually to bow out on 23 February 1989 {{in one of}} the programme's most famous episodes which attracted more than 20 million viewers. After escaping from custody, Den returned to the famous canal (in Alperton) for one last rendezvous with Michelle. The episode ended with Den being shot {{by a member of the}} firm (who was carrying a gun concealed in a bunch of daffodils) and then falling into the canal. The scene where Den actually <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> had to be taped at the BBC's Ealing Film Studios using a water tank, because the waters of the Grand Union Canal were deemed unsafe. When the episode was finished, however, Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC1, requested that the final shot be removed to allow for the possibility of Den returning at a later date. In protest, Tony Holland and Julia Smith had their names taken off the episode's credits. Den's exit ended up being the creators' final contribution to the show.|$|E
25|$|In October 1968, {{a routine}} night launch of an E-2A from VAW-123 {{led the way}} for all {{launches}} aboard Forrestal. The crew members were LCDR Paul Martin Wright (Operations Officer), LCDR James Leo Delaney (Maintenance Officer), LTJG Howard Booth Rutledge (Personnel Officer), LTJG Frank J. Frederick (Asst. Maintenance Officer), and AT1 David E. Carpenter (Avionics Dept). The flight was routine and all aircraft recovered as usual until the VAW-123 E-2A, which was the last plane to recover. The aircraft boltered and went off the angled deck and into the water, nose first. When it <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> the aircraft flipped over onto its back, breaking its radar dome off and sank within minutes. The dome floated and was recovered. Immediately, helicopters moved into the area for search and rescue operations. AT1 David E. Carpenter and LTJG Frank J. Frederick were rescued without serious injury. Lost at sea were LCDR Wright, LCDR Delaney, and LTJG Rutledge.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was en-route to Campbeltown Airport in Argyll, Scotland, {{to pick up}} a ten year-old boy with acute abdominal pain, suspected to be appendicitis. After a flight that included many navigational irregularities, the pilot was flying the normal approach, which took the aircraft out to sea before turning back toward the airport. The pilot informed controllers that he had completed the turn, {{and that was the last}} transmission received from the aircraft. Investigators conclude the aircraft <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> a few seconds after that transmission. Both occupants of the aircraft, the pilot and a paramedic seated at his station behind the pilot, were killed. The ensuing investigation concluded that the pilot allowed the aircraft to fly too low, and it descended unchecked into the sea. The pilot was also fatigued, overworked, lacked recent flying practise, and he might have suffered from an undetermined influence, such as disorientation, distraction, or subtle incapacitation, as evidenced by several navigational errors, miscommunications, and mismanagement of his instruments. Although the weather might have precluded a safe landing in Campbeltown, the weather was not a cause of the accident. The patient was eventually driven overland to a Glasgow hospital, where he was treated for a ruptured appendix.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the cruiser's signal, Detmers ordered that Kormorans disguise be dropped, for the Dutch flag {{to be replaced by}} the Kriegsmarine ensign, and for the guns and torpedoes to open fire. Accounts disagree on which ship fired first, but agree that both opened fire almost simultaneously. The first shots from Sydney, a full, eight-shell salvo from the main guns, were reported in most accounts to have passed over Kormoran, although some of the Germans said that shells punched through the funnel and the wireless office at bridge level without exploding, and <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{on the far side of}} the raider. One analysis claims that this was either a warning shot just over the superstructure, or an attempt to destroy the raider's bridge as a prelude to capture. With Kormorans opening salvo (which consisted of two shells instead of four because the raider's two centreline guns were slower to decamouflage), the gunnery officer attempted to bracket the cruiser's bridge but failed to hit it, with the shells striking other parts of the ship or missing completely. Two torpedoes from Kormorans starboard above-water tubes were launched simultaneously with the raider's attack, and the close proximity of the target allowed the use of the anti-aircraft and close defence guns to rake Sydneys flank, thus preventing the use of the cruiser's secondary weapons.|$|E
25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} overturned while loading or lowering, spilling passengers {{into the}} sea; others were overturned by the ship's motion when they <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> It has been claimed that some boats, {{because of the}} negligence of some officers, crashed down onto the deck, crushing other passengers, and sliding down towards the bridge. This has been disputed by passenger and crew testimony. Some crewmen would lose their grip on ropes used to lower the lifeboats while trying to lower the boats into the ocean, and this caused the passengers to spill into the sea. Others tipped on launch as some panicking people jumped into the boat. Lusitania had 48 lifeboats, more than enough for all the crew and passengers, but only six were successfully lowered, all from the starboard side. Lifeboat 1 overturned as it was being lowered, spilling its original occupants into the sea, but it managed to right itself shortly afterwards and was later filled with people from in the water. Lifeboats 9 and 11 managed to reach the water safely with a few people, but both later picked up many swimmers. Lifeboats 13 and 15 also safely reached the water, each overloaded with around 70 people. Finally, Lifeboat 21 reached the water safely and cleared the ship moments before her final plunge. A few of her collapsible lifeboats washed off her decks as she sank and provided floatation for some survivors.|$|E
