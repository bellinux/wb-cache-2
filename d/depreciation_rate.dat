2500|$|The British {{researchers}} Richard Harris & Stephen Drinkwater also {{highlighted the}} problem that the PIM {{does not account for}} premature scrapping. The reason is that a constant <b>depreciation</b> <b>rate</b> (based on average asset lives) is applied for the stock; a discrepancy therefore arises between depreciated value and scrap value (often statisticians also fail to track what happens to fixed assets that are got rid of, and therefore the assets can be counted twice in the same year). The mathematical problem is that, given a constant <b>depreciation</b> <b>rate,</b> the effect of overstated stock values in the data will increase cumulatively across a series of years, unless a special adjustment is made. Thus, Harris & Drinkwater's 2000 study of fixed capital in British manufacturing 1970–1993 (23 years) found that, if the effect of capital scrapping which occurs due to plant closures is ignored from the 1969 benchmark onward, then this will lead to a 1993 capital stock estimate for plant and machinery which is 44% larger than it is when an appropriate adjustment is made for premature asset disposals. Another depreciation measurement problem is the accelerating replacement of fixed assets, particularly of computer systems, affecting estimated asset lives and therefore average depreciation rates. These two factors alone could, according to a 1997 OECD paper, make a difference of 10% to the estimate of the annual capital stock for some UK industries. Dutch and French statisticians suggested that if capital scrapping is ignored, capital stock results obtained with the PIM could be up to 20% larger than they probably are. New Zealand statisticians acknowledge explicitly that [...] "PIMs may typically overstate the gross capital stock because of a failure to account for changing cyclical or accelerating rates of retirements". Although he is not a Marxist, Thomas Piketty usefully discusses many problems with the PIM. Unlike orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist academics, Piketty and Zucman did not use the PIM method to get a measure of the capital stock, but instead used book values and corporate equity at market value.|$|E

Firm-level data collected in 1992 and 1995 are utilized here to assess whether the “engines of transition” - non-state-owned firms, and firms with export experience shouldered {{a disproportionate share of}} the burden in the form of below-average <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> and thus an above-average tax burden. The results indicate that ownership and export experience are important explanatory variables in explaining within-industry variation in <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> in 1992. While non-state-owned firms did exhibit below-average <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> in 1992 and thus incurred a higher tax burden, exporters as a category of firms exhibited above-average <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, the results are mixed with regard to whether the “engines of transition” shouldered a disproportionate burden.

40|$|Research and {{development}} (R&D) <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> {{are critical to}} calculating the rates of return to R&D investments and capital service costs, {{both of which are}} important for capitalizing R&D investments in the national income and product accounts. Although important, measuring R&D <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> is extremely difficult because both the price and output of R&D capital are generally unobservable. To resolve these difficulties, economists have adopted various approaches to estimate industry-specific R&D <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates,</b> but the differences in their results cannot easily be reconciled. In addition, many of their calculations rely on unverifiable assumptions. Unlike tangible capital which depreciates due to physical decay or wear and tear, business R&D capital depreciates because its contribution to a firm’s profit declines over time. Based on this understanding, I developed a forward-looking profit model with a gestation lag to derive both constant and time-varying industry-specific R&D <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> for ten R&D intensive industries that are identified in BEA’s R&D Satellite Account. I used two data sources, a Compustat SIC-based database and a BEA-NSF NAICS-based database, to perform model calculations. The data cover the period from 1989 to 2008. The results align with the major conclusions from recent studies that R&D <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> are higher than the traditionally assumed 15 percent and vary across industries.

If estimates of capital productivity and firm-level efficiency in Soviet industry are correct, enterprise managers in Russia's emerging market economy will lobby for high <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> in order to write off as quickly as possible the obsolete capital stock which they inherited. Policy makers, seeking to maintain or expand tax revenues to finance the transition, may resist pressure to allow market forces to value capital and continue to set <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> similar to those in the former Soviet economy. This paper utilizes firm-level data in 1992 and 1995 to investigate the extent to which <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> vary across industries and regions {{by the size of the}} firm's capital stock, the intensity of capital use, the size of the firm's workforce, the firm's ownership structure, and whether or not the firm exports any portion of its output.

40|$|For {{many kinds}} of capital, <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> change {{systematically}} with {{the age of the}} capital. Consider an example that captures essential aspects of human capital, both regarding its accumulation and its depreciation: a worker obtains knowledge in period 0, then uses this knowledge in production in periods 1 and 2, and thereafter retires. Here, depreciation accelerates: it occurs at a 100 % rate after period 2, and at a lower (perhaps zero) rate before that. The present paper analyzes the implications of non-constant <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> for the optimal timing of taxes on capital income. The main finding is that under natural assumptions, the path of tax rates over time must be oscillatory. Oscillatory tax rates are optimal when <b>depreciation</b> <b>rates</b> accelerate with the age of the capital (as in the above example), and provided that the government can commit to the path of future tax rates but cannot apply different tax rates in a given year to different vintages of capital. ...|$|R

However, eventually the <b>depreciation</b> <b>rate</b> will limit the expansion of capital: savings will be used up replacing depreciated capital, and no savings will remain to pay for an additional expansion in capital.
