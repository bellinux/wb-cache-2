40|$|The {{modelling}} procedure {{described in}} this publication {{which is based on}} a partitioning of the total structure, allows a synthesis of the overall transfer function from simple, physics-motivated equations representing the behaviour of the substructures. Casting this into a Matlab description admits relatively easy combination with a GUI in order to obtain a modelling environment convenient for parameter studies during the development process. In parallel, some package solution for single-chip and array microphones are developed. During the model development {{it is not possible to}} consider all kinds of applications taking into account, so that some effects occur first at the finished product. Especially in a car application (<b>handsfree</b> <b>set)</b> for mobile phones occurred parasitic EMC effects. Based on this example, the EMC problems are described and solutions for circuit- as well as for package-level are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{listening}} to music on cycling behaviour were evaluated. Twenty-five participants completed a track on a bicycle while listening to music with two standard earbuds, with one earbud, and with two in-earbuds. Conditions with high tempo music and loud volume were {{also included in the}} experiment, as were two mobile phone conditions, one in which participants operated the phone hand held and one handsfree condition. Cycle speed was not affected by listening to music, but was reduced in the telephone conditions. In general the response to auditory signals worsened when participants listened to music, in particular when listening with in-earbuds loud auditory stop signals were missed in 68 % of the cases. However, when listening with only one standard earbud performance was not affected. In the conditions when participants listened to high volume and to high tempo music, the auditory stop signal was also heard in significantly fewer cases. Completing a task on the mobile phone, using both handheld and <b>handsfree</b> <b>sets,</b> resulted in increased response time to an auditory stop signal and also reduced overall auditory perception. Furthermore, handsfree operation only had minor advantages opposed to hand held operation, with only response time to an auditory stop signal resulting in faster performance. This is likely {{to be related to the}} fact that both hands could be used for braking. It is concluded that listening to music worsens auditory perception, in particular if in-earbuds are used. Furthermore, both handheld and handsfree operation of mobile phones has a negative effect on perception, potentially forming a threat to cyclist traffic safety. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{effects of}} telephoning while driving were studied in three {{different}} traffic conditions, i. e. in light traffic on a quiet motorway, in heavy traffic on a four-lane ring-road, and in city traffic. Twelve subjects, unfamiliar with mobile telephones, drove an instrumented vehicle for one hour each day during three weeks and while {{in each of the}} three traffic conditions, had to operate the mobile telephone for a short while. To ensure a fixed “heavy traffic load” in the second condition, the subjects were instructed to follow another instrumented vehicle (at a safe distance). The results showed a significant effect of telephoning while driving as opposed to normal driving (i. e., not involving telephone conversation), on the effort subjectively measured by an effort scale and objectively measured by heartrate indices and on some of the measured parameters of driving performance. One half of the subjects had to operate the telephone manually, the other half performed the telephone task with a <b>handsfree</b> mobile telephone <b>set.</b> The subjects who operated the handsfree telephone showed better control over the test vehicle than the subjects who operated the handheld telephone, as measured by the steering wheel movements. Also, a clear improvement over time in the course of the 15 test days was found for some of the measurements. As a consequence of the results, some advice concerning mobile telephoning can be given to authorities, manufacturers, and users...|$|R
