50|$|Lafarge {{was founded}} in 1833 by Joseph-Auguste Pavin de Lafarge in Le Teil (Ardèche), to exploit the {{limestone}} quarry in Mont Saint-Victor between Le Teil and Viviers. The limestone is white and argillaceous, and yielded an <b>eminently</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime.</b>|$|E
40|$|Restoration of {{historic}} buildings is often executed using lime mortars. A restoration mortar is considered {{compatible with the}} original building materials when it answers to certain criteria, such as the facilitation of moisture transport. This can be determined by studying porosity, permeability, and the pore size distribution of both materials. Since NHL mortars are used in restoration of the exterior, where water and moisture are ever-present, a good characterization {{in terms of their}} pore-related properties is necessary. This study therefore researched characteristics of pure NHL mortars, without metakaolin or pozzolan additives. In this study, 16 different mortar recipes were made with NHL 5, the most hydraulic NHL type. The mortars had variations in spread, sand type and grain size. The sand types varied from coarse-grained to very fine, {{in order to be able}} to study the influence of the largest and smallest grains. The spread was adapted from 120 to 180 mm by changing the water:binder ratio. This allows understanding the influence of binding water on these pore-related properties. The measured pore-related properties were linked to compressive strength measurements, so as to characterize these <b>eminently</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> also on a mechanical level. Nearly 180 samples were tested after 90 days of curing. All mortars show a bimodal pore size distribution. Depending on the sand type and the mortar spread, the mechanical strength varied from 1 to 10 MPa and pore sizes varied from the larger to smaller pore region. This demonstrates the large influence aggregates and water have on the properties of the hardened mortar. In general, the influence of the variation in water:binder ratio was less apparent, although an excess of binding water was translated into a change towards smaller pores, higher porosity and lower compressive strength. This study demonstrates that NHL 5 lime can be a good binder for restoration mortars, in which the properties of the mortar can be adapted through variation of aggregate grain size and spread. This allows researching a possible estimation of properties before making the mortars...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{strength}} grades for natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime,</b> {{laid down in}} the European Norm EN459; NHL2, NHL3.5 and NHL5. The numbers stand for the minimum compressive strength at 28 days in newtons per square millimeter (N/mm2). For example, the NHL 3.5 strength ranges from 3.5 N/mm2 (510 psi) to 10 N/mm2 (1,450 psi). These {{are similar to the}} old classification of feebly hydraulic, moderately <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>eminently</b> <b>hydraulic,</b> and although different, some people continue to refer to them interchangeably. The terminology for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> mortars was improved by the skilled French civil engineer Louis Vicat in the 1830s from the older system of water limes and feebly, moderately and eminently. Vicat published his work following research of the use of lime mortars whilst building bridges and roads in his work. The French company Vicat still currently produce natural cements and lime mortars. Names of lime mortars were so varied and conflicting across the European continent that the reclassification has greatly improved the understanding and use of lime mortars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two basic}} types of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> are natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) and {{artificial}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (AHL): [...] Natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) {{is produced by}} heating (calcining) limestone that naturally contains clay and other impurities: no materials may be added to create the hydraulicity. In the United States NHL may be called hydrated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (HHL) per ASTM C-141 Standard Specification for Hydrated <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lime</b> for Structural Purposes. Artificial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (AHL) or artificial <b>lime</b> (AL) becomes <b>hydraulic</b> when hydraulic and/or pozzolan materials are added either before or after burning in a lime kiln. Artificial limes are more specifically identified as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (HL), as defined European Norm 459 (EN-459), [...] "Consists of lime and other materials such as Portland cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone filler and other suitable materials."; formulated lime (FL) (EN-459) consists of [...] "...mainly of hydrated lime and or NHL with added hydraulic and/or pozzolanic material. It is identical to HL but its composition must be declared on the CE marking."; pozzolanic <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (PHL) (ASTM C-1707)is [...] "very similar to HL or FL. Consists mainly of hydrated lime {{with one or more}} pozzolans with possible inclusion of inert filler. When Portland cement, even traces, is present (can be up to 20% of binder weight), it has to be labeled as 'PHLc'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hydraulic lime is {{also called}} water lime. Hydraulic lime {{contains}} lime with silica and/or alumina and sets with {{exposure to water}} and can set under water. Natural hydraulic lime (NHL) is made from a limestone which naturally contains some clay. Artificial hydraulic lime is made by adding forms of silica and/or alumina such as clay to the limestone during firing, or by adding a pozzolana to pure lime. Hydraulic limes are classified by their strength: feebly, moderately and <b>eminently</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime.</b> Feebly hydraulic lime contains 5-10% clay, slakes in minutes, and sets in about three weeks. It is used for less expensive work and in mild climates. Moderately hydraulic lime contains 11-20% clay, slakes in one to two hours, and sets in approximately one week. It is used for better quality work and exterior walls in freezing climates. <b>Eminently</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> contains 21-30% clay, slakes very slowly, and sets in approximately a day. It is used in harsh environments such as damp locations and near saltwater. Hydraulic lime is off-white in color. [...] "The degree of hydraulicity of mortars will affect many characteristics. By selecting an appropriate ratio of clay to limestone mortars that carbonate or set hydraulically to a varying extents can be designed for particular application requirements such as setting time, strength, colour, durability, frost resistance, workability, speed of set {{in the presence of}} water, vapour permeability etc." ...|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic lime (HL) is {{a general}} term for {{varieties}} of lime (calcium oxide), or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), used to make lime mortar which set through hydration: thus they are called hydraulic. The other common types of lime mortar set through carbonation (re-absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air) and are sometimes called air lime. Hydraulic lime provides a faster initial set and higher compressive strength than air lime and <b>eminently</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> will set in more extreme conditions including under water. Calcium reacts in the lime kiln with the clay minerals to produce silicates that enable some of the lime to set through hydration; any unreacted calcium is slaked to calcium hydroxide which sets through carbonation: These are sometimes called semi-hydraulic lime and include feebly and moderately hydraulic lime, NHL 2 and NHL 3.5. The terms hydraulic lime and hydrated lime are quite similar and may be confused but {{are not necessarily the}} same material: hydrated lime is any lime which has been slaked whether it sets through hydration, carbonation, or both.|$|E

The investigation conducted showed that a plaster composed of <b>eminently</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> impregnated with water-repellent solutions (a perfluoropolyether or an oligomen’c alkylalkoxysiloxane) or admixed with an acrylic latex is significantly more durable than plain plaster. In particular, the different modes of salt crystallization are discussed in relation to the microstructural properties conferred by the poly- mers, and to the thermohygrometric conditions of the system...|$|E

30|$|In 2010, new European {{building}} lime standard EN 459 - 1, modified from previous version, was published [12]. Comparing to old version, natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL), formulated <b>lime</b> (FL) and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (HL) {{under the category}} of <b>limes</b> with <b>hydraulic</b> properties has been clearly specified. Natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime,</b> its use can be dated back to Romans [13], is a <b>lime</b> with <b>hydraulic</b> properties produced by burning of more or less argillaceous or siliceous limestones with reduction to powder by slaking with or without grinding. No other additions are allowed except grinding agents up to 0.1 wt%. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> is, however, a binder consisting of lime and other materials such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone filler and other suitable materials, but does not need to have a declaration of constituents. Formulated lime (FL), which is a new term, is a <b>lime</b> with <b>hydraulic</b> properties mainly consisting of air lime (CL) and/or natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) with added hydraulic and/or pozzolanic material. To protect the user especially in restoration and conservation, formulated limes contain a constituent’s declaration.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> is {{a useful}} {{building}} material for the following reasons: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{curing time}} of lime plaster can be {{shortened}} by using (natural) <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> or adding pozzolan additives, transforming it into artificially <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime.</b> In ancient times, Roman lime plaster incorporated pozzolanic volcanic ash; in modern times, fly ash is preferred. Non-hydraulic lime plaster {{can also be}} made to set faster by adding gypsum.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> sets by {{hydration}} {{so it can}} set under water. Non-hydraulic lime sets by carbonatation and so needs {{exposure to}} {{carbon dioxide in the}} air and cannot set under water or inside a thick wall. For natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) mortars, the lime is obtained from limestone naturally containing a sufficient percentage of silica and/or alumina. Artificial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> is produced by introducing specific types and quantities of additives to the source of lime during the burning process, or adding a pozzolan to non-hydraulic lime. Non-hydraulic lime is produced from a high purity source of calcium carbonate such as chalk, limestone or oyster shells.|$|R
50|$|Moderately <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL 3.5) can be {{used for}} {{external}} work in most areas.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative phase {{analyses}} of three commercial samples of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> have been per-formed using the Rietveld method. Although the Rietveld method has been already applied to cement analysis, we report here the first application to different classes of hydraulic binders, such as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> (HL) and natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> (NHL). Unlike HL, that are simple diluted cement, NHL are specific product {{of great interest}} for its application in building restoration and conservation. Samples were also characterized by laser granulometry and chemical analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis/Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG/DSC) and calcimetric {{analyses were conducted to}} compare the results of such well-established techniques with those obtained with the Rietveld method. Taking advantage of the Rietveld method with the addition of an internal standard, the phase fraction of all the crystalline phases as well as the amorphous component, have been accurately determined. This technique offers a valid support for the characterization of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> {{in the light of the}} EN classification of such industrial products...|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the same}} {{long history in}} the use of lime, China is far behind of Europe in the {{research}} of lime in modern times. Due to the wet slaking and lake of grinding technique, the ancient Chinese did not realize the <b>hydraulic</b> properties of <b>limes,</b> which can only be observed through dry slaking with or without grinding. Until 2008 natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> was introduced from Europe into China and has been researched comprehensively, but exclusively for conservation of cultural heritage. Adhesives, grouting slurries, restoration mortar for natural stones and kilned bricks (from traditional green bricks to firebricks) based on modified natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> (may be defined as formulated lime, FL, according to EN 459 - 1 / 2010) have been developed. With help of modern construction chemistry achievements, natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> can be modified to meet almost all kinds of requirements for conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. The new challenges will be grout to seal cracks from adobe and earthen masonry.|$|R

30|$|Hydration of {{hydraulic}} components {{from both}} the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> and cement binders results {{in the production of}} C-S-H. Hydration of cement clinker components, such as alite (C 3 S), occurs significantly more rapidly than hydraulic components associated with lime (i.e. β-belite) [36]. The hydration of alite is therefore responsible for early strength gain in Portland cement materials. Carbonation of calcium hydroxide in the mixed material, combined with the continuation of β-belite hydration, will account for the longer term strength development in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> [36, 47].|$|R
50|$|Semi-hydraulic lime, {{also called}} {{partially}} <b>hydraulic</b> and grey <b>lime,</b> sets initially {{with water and}} then continues to set with air. This lime is similar to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> but has less soluble silica (usually minimum 6%) and aluminates, and will set under water but will never harden.|$|R
40|$|Liguria {{has always}} been a region with a rich {{production}} of binders, especially lime and, in part, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime.</b> The excellent quality of magnesian lime and the high cost of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> did not favor the spread in the region of hydraulic binders.
