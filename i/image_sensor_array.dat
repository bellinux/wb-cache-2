40|$|The subwavelength mode {{volumes of}} {{plasmonic}} filters are well matched {{to the small}} size of state-of-the-art active pixels (~ 1 µm) in CMOS <b>image</b> <b>sensor</b> <b>arrays</b> used in portable electronic devices. Typical plasmonic filters exhibit broad (> 100 nm) transmission bandwidths. Dramatically reducing the peak width of filter transmission spectra would allow for the realization of CMOS hyperspectral imaging arrays, which demand the FWHM of transmission peaks to be less than 30 nm. We find that the design of 5 layer metal-insulator-metal-insulator-metal structures gives rise to multi-mode interference phenomena that suppresses spurious transmission features gives rise to a single narrow transmission band with FWHM as small as 17 nm. The transmission peaks of these multilayer slot-mode plasmonic filters (MSPFs) can be systematically varied throughout the visible and near infrared spectrum, so the same basic structure can serve as a filter over a large range of wavelengths...|$|R
