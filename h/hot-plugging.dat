Autoconfig does support <b>hot-plugging</b> but only for one device (the last one). Most manufacturers which required <b>hot-plugging</b> instead did not use Autoconfig for whatever was being added and removed (e.g. a PCMCIA card) but instead assigned whatever resource was necessary permanently to the port or controller and handled the addition or removal much like inserting a floppy disk.|$|E

40|$|Video {{streaming}} <b>hot-plug</b> {{is defined}} as keeping video streaming to be continuous when a host is switched from wired/wireless to wireless/wired networks, or from one wireless network to another wireless network. In this paper, video streaming <b>hot-plug</b> mechanisms using Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), which is a new transport layer protocol supporting multihoming, are investigated. Using SCTP, a host can establish multiple paths, e. g. one through the wired network and another one through the wireless network, to communicate with its peer. Two SCTP extensions, the SCTP ADDIP extension and (Partially Reliable) PR-SCTP are adopted to implement the corresponding system called MOVIDEO. The SCTP ADDIP extension enables the host to dynamically configure IP addresses and the primary path used for the association, whereas PR-SCTP provides a partially reliable transmission option for the host to transmit data. Performance evaluation of the MOVIDEO system is provided in this paper. In addition to MOVIDEO, three other configurations of SCTP, including the triggering patterns of changing primary path and the transmission patterns of streaming video data, are implemented for performance comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that, using the proposed SCTP-based video streaming <b>hot-plug</b> mechanism, the connection of the video streaming service would not be broken and the playout of the video can be kept smooth {{during the process of}} video streaming <b>hot-plug...</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{original}} Eurocard solutions such as VME, which use connectors with a 0.1 inch (2.54 mm) pin spacing, CompactPCI cards use metric connectors with a 2-millimeter pin spacing, designed to the IEC 1076 standard. 3U boards have a 110-pin connector (J1), which carries the 32-bit PCI bus signals, and an optional 110-pin connector (J2), which carries either user-defined I/O or the upper 32 bits of an optional 64-bit PCI bus. 6U cards have an identical J1, a J2 {{that is always}} used for 64-bit PCI, as well as J3, J4, and J5 connectors {{for a variety of}} uses either as user-defined I/O or specified signaling such as Telephony and/or Ethernet signaling. <b>Hot-plugging</b> is a supported feature of CompactPCI.

40|$|Abstract—IaaS clouds promise instantaneously {{available}} re-sources to elastic applications. In practice, however, {{virtual machine}} (VM) startup times {{are in the}} order of several minutes, or at best, several tens of seconds, negatively impacting the elasticity of applications like Web servers that need to scale out to handle dynamically increasing load. VM startup time is strongly influenced by booting the VM’s operating system. In this work, we propose using so-called prebaked µVMs to speed up VM startup. µVMs are snapshots of minimal VMs that can be quickly resumed and then configured to application needs by <b>hot-plugging</b> resources.

40|$|Moving device {{virtualization}} {{from the}} {{virtual machine monitor}} (VMM) to the devices improves virtual-machine performance significantly, but it requires support from the devices. PCI and PCI Express (PCIe) devices can provide VMs with direct and secure I/O {{through the use of}} multiple functions per card, but at significant cost and inflexibility. One solution to help reduce the costs is the PCIe SR-IOV standard, which introduces lightweight, virtual PCIe functions. We are currently developing a highly configurable and programmable PCIe networking device which can change its behavior at runtime and which can provide a number of different types of device functions to the host system (e. g., standard NIC, specialized packet capturing devices, or crypto offload engines). We have found the PCIe SR-IOV standard to be too inflexible to support these types of devices, primarily due to its mechanism for configuring virtual functions. In this paper we propose an alternative approach which does not require additional silicon and provides significantly higher flexibility than SR-IOV. We achieve this by delegating enumeration and configuration of “software configurable virtual functions ” to the main device driver for the device. Our solution is compatible with the higher layers of the PCI device stack of modern operating systems and hypervisors so that we can leverage all the existing mechanisms for <b>hot-plugging,</b> discovering devices, loading device drivers, and assigning PCI devices to virtual machines (including providing DMA isolation with IO-MMUs).

40|$|GaN-based {{light-emitting}} diodes have recently demonstrated {{to be almost}} ideal devices for the realization of next generation light sources, thanks to their high performance and long expected lifetime. For a massive market penetration of these devices, their reliability must be significantly improved: if on one hand the physical mechanisms responsible for gradual degradation have been extensively described, {{on the other hand}} the origin of catastrophic failures still has to be investigated in detail. One of the most critical situations occurs when an LED module is directly connected to an energized power supply: this event (usually referred to as "hot-plugging") can generate current spikes up to several tens of amperes, that can potentially destroy or damage the LEDs. The aim of this work is (i) to analyze, for the first time, the nature of the current spikes generated during <b>hot-plugging,</b> (ii) to understand the failure mechanisms of LEDs submitted to high current spikes, and (iii) to present a simplified model to explain the hot plugging phenomenon.

40|$|Robotics {{has been}} {{considered}} as a viable automation solution for the aerospace industry to address manufacturing cost. Many of the existing robot systems augmented with guidance from a large volume metrology system have proved to meet the high dimensional accuracy requirements in aero-structure assembly. However, they have been mainly deployed as costly and dedicated systems, which might not be ideal for aerospace manufacturing having low production rate and long cycle time. The work described in this thesis is to provide technical solutions to improve the flexibility and cost-efficiency of such metrology-integrated robot systems. To address the flexibility, a software framework that supports reconfigurable system integration is developed. The framework provides a design methodology to compose distributed software components which can be integrated dynamically at runtime. This provides {{the potential for the}} automation devices (robots, metrology, actuators etc.) controlled by these software components to be assembled on demand for various assembly applications. To reduce the cost of deployment, this thesis proposes a two-stage error compensation scheme for industrial robots that requires only intermittent metrology input, thus allowing for one expensive metrology system to be used by a number of robots. Robot calibration is employed in the first stage to reduce the majority of robot inaccuracy then the metrology will correct the residual errors. In this work, a new calibration model for serial robots having a parallelogram linkage is developed that takes into account both geometric errors and joint deflections induced by link masses and weight of the end-effectors. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the two pieces of work presented above. The proposed framework is adopted to create a distributed control system that implements calibration and error compensation for a large industrial robot having a parallelogram linkage. The control system is formed by <b>hot-plugging</b> the control applications of the robot and metrology used together. Experimental results show that the developed error model was able to improve the 3  positional accuracy of the loaded robot from several millimetres to less than one millimetre and reduce half of the time previously required to correct the errors by using only the metrology. The experiments also demonstrate the capability of sharing one metrology system to more than one robot...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{high-power}} white LEDs {{in general}} lighting applications is becoming, day-by-day, increasingly important. The reliability of these devices, {{compared to that}} of conventional light sources, represents one of the keys for their development and their market penetration. It is then of fundamental importance to deeply understand the various degradation mechanisms that affect the operation of LEDs, in terms of lifetime, chromaticity characteristics and efficiency. This thesis reports the results of a research activity focused on several issues related to the reliability of LED-based lighting systems. After an initial overview on the most important theoretical concepts necessary for the understanding of the physical results, three main sections can be identified in this thesis, concerning the presentation of research activity: •	The first section reports an extensive study {{on one of the most}} critical Electrical Over Stress (EOS) phenomena, called “Hot-plugging”, which occurs when an LED module is directly connected to an energized power supply and can generate current spikes up to several tens of amperes that can potentially destroy or damage the LEDs. The aim of this section is to analyze, for the first time, the nature of the current spikes generated during <b>hot-plugging</b> and to present a simplified model to explain the hot plugging phenomenon. The study is based on transient electrical measurements, carried out on several LED modules (fabricated by different manufacturers), connected to three different power supplies. Results reveal that the amplitude and the time constants of the current spikes are directly determined by the number of LEDs connected in series and by the output capacitance of the current driver. •	Afterwards, the second section presents an extensive study on the effects of Electrostatic Discharges (ESD) on state-of-the-art GaN based LEDs, based on optical and electrical measurements carried out during the ESD events. ESD events were simulated through a Transmission Line Pulser (TLP), which generates voltage pulses with a duration of 100 ns and increasing amplitude: during each pulse, spatially resolved electroluminescence measurements were carried out through a high speed EMCCD camera. These measurements allowed to identify the chip region where the discharge is localized and the change in the damaged area induced by consecutive ESD events. In addition, the current and voltage waveforms at the LED terminal were monitored during the tests; this analysis provided important information about modifications the impedance of the devices. 	The analysis was carried out on different types of commercially available low-power GaN-based LEDs with several differences in the manufacturing technology. Thanks to these tests, we have identified two different failure behaviors during a destructive ESD event, clearly related to the different defects in the semiconductor lattice and to structure of the chip. •	The last section investigates the thermal stability of remote phosphor plates to be used in solid-state lighting systems, for the conversion of the blue light emitted by GaN-based LEDs into white light. A preliminary thermal characterization revealed that in normal conditions of blue light irradiance the phosphor plates could reach temperature levels higher than 60 °C, which can affect both performance and reliability. The results of accelerated thermal stress tests indicate that high temperature levels can trigger a relevant degradation mechanism (estimated activation energy is 1. 2 eV), that drastically reduces the phosphor conversion efficiency and modifies the photometric and colorimetric characteristics of the emitted white light. ...|$|E
