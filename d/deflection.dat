5|$|Closely {{related to}} light <b>deflection</b> is the {{gravitational}} time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} move through a gravitational field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the <b>deflection</b> of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E
5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their <b>deflection</b> {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant <b>deflection.</b> To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy <b>deflection.</b> Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} <b>deflections</b> for a transport type solid wing {{model were}} measured for several single point load conditions. These <b>deflections</b> {{were compared with}} those obtained by structural modeling of the wing by using plate and solid elements of Structural Performance Analysis and Redesign (SPAR) program. The solid element representation of the wing showed better agreement with the experimental <b>deflections</b> than the plate representation.

5|$|Adams {{continued}} {{to start in}} the 2009 season, and he recorded 33 tackles, a sack, and a pass <b>deflection</b> while playing in all 18 regular season games. The Roughriders {{made it to the}} 97th Grey Cup, where Adams forced a fumble that was recovered by teammate Keith Shologan. Facing the Montreal Alouettes, the Roughriders lost 28–27, preventing Adams from winning his second championship.|$|E
5|$|As {{integration}} of the delta function results in the Heaviside step function, {{it follows that the}} static <b>deflection</b> of a slender beam subject to multiple point loads is described by a set of piecewise polynomials.|$|E
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle <b>deflection</b> shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of <b>deflection</b> shooting.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} estimating long-term <b>deflections</b> of reinforced concrete beams by considering creep and shrinkage effects separately. Based on equilibrium and compatibility conditions a method is developed for investigating the properties of a cracked transformed section under sustained load. The concept of effective moment of inertia is extended to predict initial-plus-creep <b>deflections.</b> Long-term <b>deflections</b> computed by the proposed method are compared with the experimental results available in the literature and with the values obtained by the ACI Code method. This comparison shows that for beams having span/thickness ratio greater than 25, the ACI Code method underestimates long-term <b>deflections</b> while the proposed method gives a better estimate with computed to measured <b>deflections</b> ratio equal to 1. 0...|$|R
40|$|Thoracic {{responses}} {{between the}} Hybrid III {{model and the}} THUMS human body model were compared in three frontal impact severities for two belt (3 -point and criss-cross), two belt load limiter (constant and degressive) and two airbag types (symmetric and non-symmetric). The thoracic responses were evaluated by measurements of chest <b>deflections</b> (mid-sternum and multi-point measured), chest excursions and, for the human body model, supplemented by maximum rib strains. For the 3 -point belt, an overall correlation was found between Hybrid III and THUMS chest <b>deflections</b> and excursions {{as well as between}} THUMS multi-point chest <b>deflections</b> and rib strains. For the criss-cross belt, Hybrid III chest <b>deflections</b> increased and THUMS rib strains decreased. For the non-symmetric airbag, Hybrid III and THUMS chest <b>deflections</b> decreased...|$|R
5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the <b>deflection</b> of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of <b>deflection.</b> Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|The Munro Schiehallion's {{isolated}} {{position and}} regular shape led Nevil Maskelyne {{to use the}} <b>deflection</b> caused by {{the mass of the}} mountain to estimate the mass of the Earth in a ground-breaking experiment carried out in 1774. Following Maskelyne's survey, Schiehallion became the first mountain to be mapped using contour lines.|$|E
5|$|The control {{surfaces}} operated {{in much the}} same way as other aircraft, with the exception of the innovative automatic pull-out system. Releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery and climb, upon the <b>deflection</b> of the dive brakes. The pilot could override the system by exerting significant force on the control column and taking manual control.|$|E
30|$|In turn, the self-ligating systems show {{low force}} release rate at higher <b>deflections,</b> {{but they also}} release forces in small <b>deflections,</b> in {{agreement}} with the concept of light and continuous forces.|$|R

40|$|The {{simplified}} {{methods of}} CEB and of ACI for prediction of <b>deflections</b> of reinforced concrete beams are analyzed in this work. Obtained results with those methods are {{compared with those}} obtained through a nonlinear analysis. Additional <b>deflections</b> due to creep and shrinkage are considered in the study. The obtained {{results indicate that the}} two simplified methods are appropriate for calculation of instantaneous <b>deflections</b> of reinforced concrete beams. The method of CEB also supplies good results when creep and shrinkage of concrete are considered. However, the method of ACI is not satisfactory for evaluation of long-term <b>deflections</b> of reinforced concrete beams...|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with two British Barr and Stroud {{coincidence}} rangefinders that used two images {{that had to}} be superimposed to derive the range. The gunnery officer then calculated the proper elevation and <b>deflection</b> required to hit the target and transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each turret.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{prominent}} {{features on the}} ECG: the P wave (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward <b>deflection</b> on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge ("depolarising") {{in the direction of}} that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative ("repolarising") {{in the direction of the}} lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative <b>deflection,</b> and a lead on the right would show a positive <b>deflection.</b> The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.|$|E
5|$|This led Rutherford {{to propose}} a {{planetary}} model in which a cloud of electrons surrounded a small, compact nucleus of positive charge. Only such a concentration of charge could produce the electric field strong enough to cause the heavy <b>deflection.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} of RF acceleration in the SLC Linac to produce high energy beams are {{complicated by the}} presence of small transverse RF beam <b>deflections</b> which arise from several sources. These RF <b>deflections</b> place stringent tolerances on the phase and amplitude stability of the klystrons. They also force the use of special magnetic bumps to correct the trajectories of oppositely charged beams that will pass down the linac. If left unabated, RF <b>deflections</b> can limit the performance of the SLC. There are several methods to reduce the <b>deflections.</b> Many measurements of RF <b>deflections</b> {{have been made in the}} low energy part of the linac where the beams are most sensitive.

The two victories brought him the First Class Iron Cross, awarded 19 December 1916. His first victory of 1917, over Captain Daly, inadvertently taught Voss the knack of <b>deflection</b> shooting. Voss later visited Daly in hospital twice.|$|E
5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting <b>deflection</b> could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by.

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, light does not travel along {{straight}} lines when it propagates in a gravitational field. Instead, it is deflected {{in the presence}} of massive bodies. In particular, starlight is deflected as it passes near the Sun, leading to apparent shifts of up 1.75 arc seconds in the stars' positions in the sky (an arc second is equal to 1/3600 of a degree). In the framework of Newtonian gravity, a heuristic argument can be made that leads to light <b>deflection</b> by half that amount. The different predictions can be tested by observing stars that are close to the Sun during a solar eclipse. In this way, a British expedition to West Africa in 1919, directed by Arthur Eddington, confirmed that Einstein's prediction was correct, and the Newtonian predictions wrong, via observation of the May 1919 eclipse. Eddington's results were not very accurate; subsequent observations of the <b>deflection</b> of the light of distant quasars by the Sun, which utilize highly accurate techniques of radio astronomy, have confirmed Eddington's results with significantly better precision (the first such measurements date from 1967, the most recent comprehensive analysis from 2004).|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{actuation}} is a regularity in MEMS devices, {{however much}} of the progress has been in demonstrating planar motion. This paper derives a mechanical way to achieve out-ofplane <b>deflections</b> using simple mechanical beams and basic thermal expansion techniques. Tip <b>deflections</b> were optimized over a range of voltages and varying actuator base geometry. By uniformly directing four torque-bars, possible <b>deflections</b> of 9 μm were calculated without shear failure for a maximum voltage of 15 volts. At constant voltage, <b>deflections</b> decreased to half of maximum for a base thickness of 10 μm. The force transmitted at the deflecting lever arms tip was calculated in the milli-Newton range. 1...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Design {{criteria}} are needed specifically for portable bridges {{to insure that}} they are safe and cost effective. This paper discusses different portable bridge categories and their general design criteria. Specific emphasis is given to quantifying the effects of dynamic live loads on portable bridge design. Results from static and dynamic load tests of two portable timber bridges showed that dynamic loads can be significantly greater than static loads. Under smooth bridge entrance conditions, the mean dynamic bridge <b>deflections</b> were 1. 13 times greater than static bridge <b>deflections.</b> Under rough bridge entrance conditions, mean dynamic bridge <b>deflections</b> were 1. 44 times greater than static bridge <b>deflections...</b>|$|R

5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor <b>deflection</b> test.

5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given <b>deflection</b> of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model {{is proportional to the}} square of the mass and inversely proportional to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
