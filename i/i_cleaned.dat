2500|$|On December 1, 1910, Wedge {{was arrested}} and incarcerated in the city jail on charges of battery for {{attempting}} to strike a night watchman named Gus Miller and begging after being found on Fifth Street near Market Street at 4.30am. Wedge denied the allegations and explained his alcoholic odor as due to his incarceration with drunks and [...] "wine bums", and that he possessed port wine {{given to him by}} the Hahnemann Hospital to prevent pneumonia. Wedge was given the sobriquet [...] "The Fighting Parson of the Barbary Coast". In 1917 Wedge explained its origin: [...] "I was preaching on a beer keg in a saloon on the Barbary coast in San Francisco when a couple of toughs went for me. I guess maybe <b>I</b> <b>cleaned</b> out the place then. A reporter on the San Francisco newspaper gave me the name. He said I was a fellow who, if he could not preach good into men, would knock h—l out of them. Those fellows got me, though, and put me in the hospital for a while". After being hospitalized after a vicious assault by several denizens of the Barbary Coast at the corner of Pacific and Montgomery avenues, by the end of 1910 Wedge decided to return to Omaha to recuperate and to attempt to reconcile with Prudence Tracy.|$|E

60|$|The {{second day}} I {{was a very}} sick man. I, who had not eaten for so long, began to swell to a monstrous fatness--my legs, my arms, my whole body.

Yet did I labour sore in order to fulfil God's will that I should live.

6000|$|So, one Saturday, time ticking hard on midnight Ere an hour subserved, I set me upon it. Long with coiled-up sleeves <b>I</b> <b>cleaned</b> and yet cleaned, Till a first fresh spot, a high light, looked forth, Then another, like fair flesh, and another; Then a curve, a nostril, {{and next}} a finger, Tapering, shapely, {{significantly}} pointing slantwise.

60|$|I {{would have}} given kingdoms in those days to have been {{seventeen}} and James Ray. When {{he was in the}} fort I dogged his footsteps, and listened with a painful yearning to the stories of his escapes from the roving bands. And as many a character is watered in its growth by hero-worship, so my own grew firmer in the contemplation of Ray's resourcefulness. My strange life had far removed me from lads of my own age, and he took a fancy to me, perhaps because of the very persistence of my devotion to him. <b>I</b> <b>cleaned</b> his gun, filled his powder flask, and ran to do his every bidding.|$|E
60|$|In {{consequence}} of a note that was brought to Bartlemy Fair {{in the autumn of}} next year by a servant, most wonderful got up in milk-white cords and tops, <b>I</b> <b>cleaned</b> myself and went to Pall Mall, one evening appinted. The gentlemen was at their wine arter dinner, and Mr. Chops's eyes was more fixed in that Ed of his than I thought good for him. There was three of 'em (in company, I mean), and I knowed the third well. When last met, he had on a white Roman shirt, and a bishop's mitre covered with leopard- skin, and played the clarionet all wrong, in a band at a Wild Beast Show.|$|E
