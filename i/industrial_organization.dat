5|$|The late 1930s saw the {{emergence}} of a new era of tolerance in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Organization</b> affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.|$|E

40|$|Complexity in <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> {{became more}} {{difficult}} and complex to be solved and it needs more attention from academicians and technicians. For these reasons, complexity in <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> represents a new challenge in the next decades. Until now, analysis of <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> complexity is still remaining a research topic of immense international interest and they require reduction in their complexity. In this paper, analysis of complexity in <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> is shown based on the perspective of systems engineering analyst. In this perspective, analysis of complexity was divided into different levels and these levels were defined as complexity levels. A framework of analyzing these levels was proposed and suggested based on the complexity in <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations.</b> This analysis was divided into four main issues: industrial system vision, industrial system structure, industrial system operating, and industrial system evaluating. This analysis shows that the complexity of <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> is still an ill-structured and a multi-dimensional problem...|$|R
25|$|Industrial {{unionism}} thence proceeded {{primarily by}} combining craft unions into industrial formations, {{rather than through}} the birth of new <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations.</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> prior to 1922 included the National Transport Workers' Federation, the National Union of Railwaymen, and the Miners' Federation.|$|R
25|$|Committee for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Organization</b> (CIO) formed {{within the}} AFL on November 8, 1935. The AFL had long {{resisted}} industrial unionism, but {{the changing nature}} of work and the American economy were draining the AFL of members and inhibiting organizing.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, the American labor {{movement}} split over {{the question of}} craft versus industrial unionism. The Committee for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Organization</b> (CIO) formed on November 9, 1935, and UTW president Thomas McMahon {{was one of the}} Committee's charter members.|$|E
25|$|The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), was a {{federation}} of unions that organized workers in industrial unions in the United States and Canada from 1935 to 1955. Created by John L. Lewis in 1935, {{it was originally}} called the Committee for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Organization</b> but changed its name in 1938 when it {{broke away from the}} American Federation of Labor.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{centered}} on the management of change in <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. To achieve {{the purpose of the}} study, two null hypotheses were stated, a sectional survey was conducted using data which were from the Nigerian Engineering works, Port Harcourt, with the aid of questionnaire and personal discussions. The response of the questionnaire services serve as the basic element of the study. The instrument for collecting the primary data consisted of 120 copies of questionnaire administered personally to the respondents, which constituted the sample size. The hypotheses were tested with the use of Chi-square (X 2) formula. The findings of the research revealed that change management is a great phenomenon that enhances the performance of the <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> and that if more attentions are given, <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> definitely will have a good standard. We therefore recommend that the management should encourage change in the <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> and that <b>industrial</b> <b>organizations</b> are better of with innovative process on products and procedures of production...|$|R

25|$|The CIO {{supported}} Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal Coalition, and {{was open}} to African Americans. Both the CIO and its rival the AFL grew rapidly during the Great Depression. The rivalry for dominance was bitter and sometimes violent. The CIO (Congress for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Organization)</b> was founded on November 9, 1936, by eight international unions belonging to the American Federation of Labor.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} change in neoclassical economics occurred around 1933. Joan Robinson and Edward H. Chamberlin, with the near simultaneous publication {{of their respective}} books, The Economics of Imperfect Competition (1933) and The Theory of Monopolistic Competition (1933), introduced models of imperfect competition. Theories of market forms and <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> grew out of this work. They also emphasized certain tools, such as the marginal revenue curve.|$|E
25|$|PROUT's {{economic}} model advocates a three-tiered approach to <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> where key industries or public utilities are nonâ€“profit, a decentralized industry run by sociolinguistic unions provide people's bare minimum necessities, {{and most of}} the economic transactions are through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. It distinguishes itself from communism by proposing an incentive based economy where surplus in the society is distributed to people who serve the society.|$|E

25|$|In {{perfectly}} competitive markets {{studied in}} the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. <b>Industrial</b> <b>organization</b> generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price.

Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition, various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly.|$|E

25|$|Although Tobin {{supported}} {{the principle of}} craft unionism, he was tolerant of unions which advocated industrial unionism under certain limitations. In many ways, the Teamsters were already an industrial union, with wide diversity in membership, and Tobin advocated a moderate line toward industrial unionism in part to defend his own union. When the AFL Executive Council proposed in July 1935 suspending the unions which had formed the Committee for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Organization,</b> Tobin argued that the Executive Council lacked the authority to do so. But once the Executive Council's decision was made, Tobin enforced it and ordered Teamster local unions to cut off relations with CIO unions.|$|E
25|$|As {{one of the}} few {{industrial}} unions {{within the}} AFL, the ILGWU was eager to advance the cause of organizing employees in the steel, automobile and other mass production industries that employed millions of workers, many of them immigrants or children of immigrants, at low wages. The ILGWU was one of the original members of the Committee for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Organization,</b> the group that John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers formed within the AFL in 1935 to organize industrial workers, and provided key financial support and assistance; Rose Pesotta {{played a key role in}} early organizing drives in the rubber and steel industries.|$|E

25|$|Eugene Debs {{formed the}} American Railway Union (ARU) as an <b>industrial</b> <b>organization</b> in {{response}} to craft limitations. Railroad engineers and firemen had called a strike, but other employees, particularly conductors who were organized into a different craft, did not join that strike. The conductors piloted scab engineers on the train routes, helping their employers to break the strike. In June 1894, the newly formed, industrially organized ARU voted to join in solidarity with an ongoing strike against the Pullman company. The sympathy strike demonstrated the enormous power of united action, yet resulted in a decisive government response to end the strike and destroy the union.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} CIO in the mid-1930s {{represented}} a threat to Hague's policy of guaranteeing labor peace to the sweatshop type industries that might otherwise have fled Jersey City's high property taxes. When Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas came to {{speak on behalf of}} the CIO during a May Day rally in Journal Square, Hague's police swept Thomas and his wife into a car, took them to the Pavonia ferry and sent them back to New York. Hague spent much of the decade inveighing against Communists and labor unions, and his attempts to suppress the CIO's activities in Jersey City led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Hague v. Committee for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Organization</b> 307 U.S. 496 (1939), that is a cornerstone of law concerning public expression of political views on public property.|$|E
