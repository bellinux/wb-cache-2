Introducing a haptic device into CMM <b>inspection</b> <b>path</b> planning leads {{to the development of}} the proposed novel CMM off-line <b>inspection</b> <b>path</b> planning environment called haptic virtual CMM (HVCMM). HVCMM is an accurate e model ofa real CMM, which simulates a CMM's operation and its measurement process in a virtual environment with haptic perception. Due to the force feed back in the operation, the <b>inspection</b> <b>path</b> planning process is more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly. The <b>inspection</b> <b>path</b> generation procedure is carried out in several steps: first, the measuring points are selected by operators using "point-and-click" method; second, the measuring points are offset according to the surface geometry and the offset points are linked with line segments; third, the linked path is traced by the virtual CMM probe to perform collision detection; fourth, when a collision occurred, an auxiliary point method and a teach pendant method are developed to generate a collision-free path with the aid of haptic constraint plane. The aim of these algorithms is to minimize the computation of collision detection.

40|$|International audienceThis study proposes an {{instantaneous}} {{damage identification}} and localization technique through sparse laser ultrasonic scanning. First, an <b>inspection</b> <b>path</b> is selected from an intended inspection region {{of a target}} structure.

Second, ultrasonic waves generated at point B are measured at point A reciprocally. Once two reciprocal ultrasonic signals are obtained, a damage index (DI) representing the violation of the linear reciprocity on the path is computed by comparing the reciprocal signals. DI will increase when the path passes through damage as this generates nonlinearity to the path. Third, the aforementioned steps are repeated for all predetermined inspection paths within the inspection region by scanning both pulse laser and LDV. Finally, the paths associated with high DI values are identified as damage regions.

40|$|An {{important}} open {{problem in}} robotic planning is the autonomous generation of 3 D inspection paths – that is, planning the best path {{to move a}} robot along in order to inspect a target structure. We recently suggested a new method for planning paths allowing the inspection of complex 3 D structures, given a triangular mesh model of the structure. The method differs from previous approaches in its emphasis on generating and considering also plans that result in imperfect coverage of the inspection target. In many practical tasks, one would accept imperfections in coverage if {{this results in a}} substantially more energy efficient <b>inspection</b> <b>path.</b> The key idea is using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to optimize the energy usage and coverage of inspection plans simultaneously – and the result is a set of plans exploring the different ways to balance the two objectives. We here test our method on a set of inspection targets with large variation in size and complexity, and compare its performance with two state-of-the-art methods for complete coverage path planning. The results strengthen our confidence in the ability of our method to generate good inspection plans for different types of targets. The method's advantage is most clearly seen for real-world inspection targets, since traditional complete coverage methods have no good way of generating plans for structures with hidden parts. Multiobjective evolution, by optimizing energy usage and coverage together ensures a good balance between the two – both when 100 % coverage is feasible, and when large parts of the object are hidden...|$|E

As researchers and developers turn their attention to understanding the ecosystem and its different apps, instrumentation of mobile apps is a much needed emerging capability. In this pa-per, we explore a selective instrumentation capability that allows users to express instrumentation specifications at a high level of abstraction; these specifications are then used to automatically in-sert instrumentation into binaries. The challenge in our work is to develop expressive abstractions for instrumentation that can also be implemented efficiently.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a steady-state particle tracking code for use in conjunction with the object-oriented groundwater flow model, ZOOMQ 3 D (Jackson and Spink, 2004). Like the flow model, the particle tracking software, ZOOPT, is written using an object-oriented approach to promote its extensibility and flexibility. ZOOPT enables the definition of steady-state and time-variant path lines in three dimensions. Particles can be tracked in both the forward and reverse directions in steady-state flow fields enabling the rapid definition of borehole catchments, recharge and discharge areas and the visualisation of groundwater flow fields, for example. The program also enables the visualisation of steady-state particle tracks that are based on the node-by-node flows at a specific instant of a time-variant simulation. For example, this capability allows the examination of the changing shape of an approximate borehole catchment over an annual recharge or abstraction cycle. Particles can currently only be tracked in the forward direction in dynamic, or timevariant, flow fields. Path lines are defined using the semi-analytical method (Pollock, 1988), however, around particular model features the Runge-Kutta technique is implemented in order to solve some specific problems associated with particle tracking. The problem of particle termination at ‘weak’ sink nodes is solved by the application of the special velocity interpolation scheme presented by Zheng (1994). This approach enables the definition of borehole catchments around wells that induce weak sinks which is not possible with many other widely used particle tracking codes. ZOOMQ 3 D incorporates the representation of the vertical variation of hydraulic conductivity with depth (VKD) within finite difference nodes. This has been implemented in the flow model to enable the more accurate description of the variation of hydraulic conductivity in limestone, and particularly Chalk aquifers. ZOOPT is fully compatible with VKD models. ZOOMQ 3 D also enables the local refinement of the finite difference grid, for example, around pumping wells. Again, ZOOPT is fully compatible with this model feature and can be used to track particles through such refined meshes. ZOOPT has been rigorously tested through its comparison with an analytical solution and another particle tracking code and through the <b>inspection</b> of <b>path</b> lines generated using numerous test models (Jackson, 2002 b) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} to increase inspection speeds for non-destructive testing (NDT) of composite aerospace parts {{is common to}} many manufacturers. The prevalence of complex curved surfaces in the industry provides significant motivation {{for the use of}} 6 axis robots for deployment of NDT probes in these inspections. A new system for robot deployed ultrasonic inspection of composite aerospace components is presented. The key novelty of the approach is through the accommodation of flexible robotic trajectory planning, coordinated with the NDT data acquisition. Using a flexible approach in MATLAB, the authors have developed a high level custom toolbox that utilizes external control of an industrial 6 axis manipulator to achieve complex path planning and provide synchronization of the employed ultrasonic phase array inspection system. The developed software maintains a high level approach to the robot programming, in order to ease the programming complexity for an NDT inspection operator. Crucially the approach provides a pathway for a conditional programming approach and the capability for multiple robot control (a significant limitation in many current off-line programming applications). Ultrasonic and experimental data has been collected for the validation of the <b>inspection</b> technique.

40|$|As modern {{industry}} is automated {{the need for}} robots performing complex tasks increases. To achieve fully automated production both making the product and inspecting it for quality assurance needs to be automated. Robotic manufacturing processes {{have been around for}} a long time and has greatly increased the efficiency of modern industry. In this thesis existing framework for automatic 3 D inspection is examined, and an attempt at making a working 3 D inspection implementation is made. The work is centered around offline inspection planning, using a model reference to generate a path for fully inspecting a 3 D object with a sensor attached to a robot arm. Continuing previous work, the inspection planning algorithm proposed by A. Bircher et. al. 2015 is adapted further in an attempt to make it optimal for planning inspection of small to medium sized objects with an industrial robot arm. The modification of the structural inspection planning algorithm is evaluated compared against the algorithm without modification by comparing resulting path length and algorithm convergence. The augmentations appear to increase the performance of the inspection planning algorithm when planning in 5 dimensions. To simulate inspection with a UR 5 robot, a camera mount for the Intel RealSense SR 300 sensor is 3 D printed and attached to the wrist link. Sensor position relative to the wrist joint is measured and used to make a custom URDF and SRDF for the UR 5 such that collision between the sensor and other joints can be prevented and sensor position can be controlled accurately. The resulting inspection paths are simulated in Gazebo with two different approaches to motion planning. To further test in detail how effective individual improvements to the algorithm have been with regards to <b>inspection</b> <b>path</b> quality the algorithm is separated into different iterative versions, where the path generated by each version with otherwise identical parameters are simulated, and the resulting motion of the robot is compared with the intended path. The augmentations of the inspection planner improve robot behavior. However, logging sensor state reveals the sensor has incorrect orientation when reaching the waypoints. The Cartesian motion planner fails to produce a full trajectory for most paths. The inverse kinematics based point to point planner leads to undesirable behavior such as arcing motions between waypoints and goal overshoot. To test basic functionality for point cloud acquisition some of the generated paths are run on the real robot, while both the robot state and 3 D sensor output is being logged. The SR 300 performed poorly, possibly due to poor lighting conditions. It is concluded that the inspection planner should be rewritten to incorporate trajectory planning in joint space. The inspection planner appears to perform well but needs additional measures for adapting the path for inspection with manipulators...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} {{level in}} Swedish pig production is high, but {{their ability to}} compete in comparison with other countries is weak, because the Swedish production costs are high. Particularly poor is the competitiveness of Swedish piglet production, whereas growing-finishing pig production generally manages better. Those production costs which are especially high in Sweden are for buildings and labour. In this report, the results of work studies carried out in piglet producing herds with farrowing pens constructed after 2000, are reported. The herds were chosen in consultation with Swedish Meats/Scan AB. The aim of the studies was {{to focus on the}} farrowing pen, and how its’ design affected the time necessary for manure removal and management of the piglets. The work studies were thus divided into two separate work operations: work operation 1) the removal of manure and checking/monitoring the piglets, and work operation 2) managing/handling the piglets. In each herd, the work operations have been carried out continually within a number of farrowing pens per farrowing unit. The time for the different activities (transport outside the pen, transport inside the pen, work with gates, work with boards, work with doors/hatches, dunging out and the monitoring and management of the piglets) has been noted using a hand-held computer (PSION). All the practical work with manure removal and animal management has been done by the same individual in all the herds (Person 1). Similarly, all the notations with the computer have been carried out by the same observer in all the herds (Person 2). A total of 16 herds have been visited 1 - 2 times each. At the visit, besides the work studies, the owner/stock person has been interviewed with respect to herd management, farrowing pen design and cleaning, routines and management of the piglets, etc. In addition, the farrowing pens in every herd have been measured and photo-documented in detail. The farrowing pens in the 16 herds have been divided into two different types: pens without a protective bar system (Pen A) and pens with a protective bar system which can be used to limit the sow’s movements, if necessary (Pen B). In Figures 1 - 7, the plans and photographs of all the Pen A farrowing pens are shown, whereas similar documentation for Pen B is given in Figures 8 - 16. All the pens without a protective bar system (Pen A) were also used for rearing the pigs during the first weeks after weaning (the so-called not-moved system), while the piglets in the farrowing pens with a protective bar system (Pen B) were moved at weaning (the so-called moved system). The pens in the moved system were somewhat smaller, had a higher proportion of slatted floors, and had the dung removed more often using vacuum manure removal than did the pens in the not moved system (Table 1). The hygiene scores for the solid floors were, however, on average, the same for both pen systems (0. 44 and 0. 43, respectively) (Table 1) : Besides having two pen types A or B, the pens were also classified according to the proportion of slatted flooring (45 % of the total pen area having slatted floors). They were also classified according to the orientation of the pen to the inspection alley (front, back or side oriented). The results of the time studies of work operation 1 (manure removal and piglet monitoring) are shown in in diagram form per herd Figure 17 [...] It {{can be seen from the}} Figure that there is a large variation between the herds and that the time spent for dunging out sometimes was nearly half of the entire work operation. On average, it was observed that the work operation for dunging out in total required 0. 84 min per pen and occasion, while just scraping out the dung required on average circa 0. 44 min per pen. The remainder of the time was spent opening gates, hatches, transport between pens, etc. In general, there was a significant correlation between the hygiene score for the solid areas of the pen and the time spent on manure removal and the entire work operation, respectively (Table 2). Irrespective of pen type, it was also clear that having a good pen hygiene reduced the work related to manure removal. The total time for work operation 1 was also significantly affected by the proportion of slatted floors in the pen, being faster if the proportion was greater. Since Pen A on average had somewhat less slatted areas, a rather longer time for this work operation was noted for this pen type in comparison with that for Pen B. In the statistical analyses, where consideration was also given to the proportion of slatted floors in the model, it was found, however, that this difference was not significant. Within pen type A, the variation in time spent in work operation 1 was also especially great between the different herds (Figure 17), and it should be noted that the shortest time for the activity “manure removal” was noted for a type A farrowing pen. A statistically significant difference between Pens A and B, to the detriment of Pen A, was, however, noted for the activity “management of gates”. This was mainly due to the necessity of entering the pen for manure removal, because Pen A had about 35 % greater solid floor area than pen B. In Pen B, at least in some pen design variations, it was possible to reach the whole solid area from the <b>inspection</b> <b>path</b> outside the pen. This greatly reduced the time spent handling gates. For the forward oriented pen, a significantly shorter time for monitoring the piglets as well as a tendency for spending a shorter amount of time for gate management was noted (Table 4). The shorter time for gate management was due to the routine for dunging out the forward oriented pens completely from outside the pens (Figure 18), which was used in many herds. With respect to work operation 2 (piglet management) a tendency towards a negative relationship between the time required for this work operation and work operation 1 could be shown. That is, in the pens where the manure removal was quickly and efficiently performed, it took, instead, somewhat longer time to manage/handle the piglets (Table 5). On average, the work operation “handling piglets” took 2. 47 min per pen (when standardised to 11 pigs per pen). That is, nearly 3 times as long as time required for manure removal. Collecting and management the piglet in this way, however, was carried out significantly less often than the manure operation; often only on 1 - 2 occasions per litter in connection with castration, iron treatment and teeth filing. The entire work operation 2, management of animals, was carried out significantly faster in Pen A (without a protective bar system). This could possibly be explained by the tendency to use more time for managing gates, because sometimes the protective bar system had to be opened or moved in order to get the piglets (Table 6), as noted for the pens with the protective bar system. The proportion of slatted floors in the pens had no significant influence on how quickly the management of the piglets was carried out (Table 6). Nor did the factor “orientation of pen in relation to the inspection alley” appear to have any significant influence on the time required to manage the pigs (work operation 2) (Table 7). On the other hand, there was a tendency that the piglet management was carried out somewhat faster in the side oriented pens (Table 7). How then can we summarise what we have learned in the present study about the optimal design of a farrowing pen? As in many other situations it can be concluded that there are many conflicts between the different aims which one wants to achieve! It is clear that an increase in the proportion of slatted flooring in the pen will reduce the time for removing the dung. However, a increase in slatted floor area, leads to a corresponding reduction in the amount of bedding material used. On the other hand, no significant difference in the time required for manure removal between the pens where the sow was always free to move around (not moved system, Pen A), and where the pens had a protective bar system to be used at farrowing (moved system, Type B) can be determined. The piglets are, however, managed significantly faster in Pen A due to a better gate system for locking the piglets in their creep area. The orientation of the pen also appears to have some influence on the dung removal activity (work operation 1). In the side oriented pens, this activity appears to be somewhat more difficult in comparison with the front or the back oriented pens. The significantly higher hygiene score in the side oriented pens may explain this observation. The interpretation is unclear, but it may be that it is more difficult to have optimal ventilation in the side oriented pens. The length of the alleys in a farrowing unit with side oriented pens is also longer, since it is necessary to go past the long side of the pen and not the short side when transporting past the pens, as for the other orientations. In some of the newer front oriented pens, shorter times for the removal of dung (work operation 1) have been observed. This depends on, among other things, being able to scrape the solid area from outside the pen, which greatly reduced the time required for managing the gates. It should, however, be noted that even if the pen normally can be scraped from outside, sometimes it is necessary to enter the pen to do it more carefully, or in order to manage the piglets. Where there was no flexibility in the form of having gates in the dung alley was considered to be irritating, “cheap” and clearly a working environment shortcoming by many of the stockpersons in the study. The greater proportion of slatted floors in the farrowing pen permitted according to the Animal Welfare Regulations of 2006 (DFS 2006 : 4), clearly appeared to reduce the amount of work in connection with manure removal in these piglet herds. A good pen hygiene also reduced the time for dung removal work. A general effort to maintain good hygiene in the pen, irrespective of pen type, could therefore be another important measure of importance for dung removal work. In some of the visited herds they had distinct management instructions for how to keep a good pen hygiene. Such instructions could be, for example, to always clean up wet solid areas in the pen and and to help this areas to dry by putting on materials such as wood shavings or Stalosan. It should also be considered that the manure removal itself only constitutes about half of the time required for the entire work operation. Therefore, reducing the time for handling gates and hatches in the dung alley, etc. would be other important measures for reducing the work effort in connection with pen cleaning. This did not mean, however, that the pens should be designed without gates! A lack of gates when the stockperson really needs to come into the pen to treat ill animals, etc., is experienced by the stockperson as being a great disadvantage. The consequences could therefore be instead that the stockperson avoided entering the pen when necessary to maintain a good animal care. This could, besides being poor husbandry, lead to undesirable negative effects on production. The study presented here indicates a number of details in the farrowing pen which are of importance for manure removal work and for work with the management of the piglets. In the discussion, several factors have been taken up which must be considered when deciding which farrowing pen-/not moved pen should be chosen (see Discussion). The final choice is made by the piglet producer. Our hope is, however, that the presented study can help the individual piglet producer to make this decision...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the robot path planning {{problem in our}} effort to develop a fully automated dimensional measurement system using an eye-in-hand robotic manipulator. First, the CAD-based vision sensor planning system developed in our lab is briefly introduced; it uses both the CAD model and the camera model to plan camera viewpoints. The planning system employs a decomposition-based approach to generate camera viewpoints that satisfy given task constraints. Second, to improve {{the efficiency of the}} eye-in-hand robot <b>inspection</b> system, robot <b>path</b> planning is studied, which is the focus of this paper. This problem is rendered as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). A new hierarchical approach is developed to solve the TSP into its suboptimality. Instead of solving a large size TSP, this approach utilizes the clustering nature of the viewpoints and converts the TSP into a clustered Traveling Salesman Problem (CTSP). A new algorithm, which favors the intergroup paths, is proposed to solve the CTSP quickly. Performance of the new algorithm is analyzed. It is shown that instead of a fixed performance ratio as reported in some existing work, a constant bound can be achieved which is related to the diameter of the clusters. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the robot motion planning system. The proposed path planning approach can obtain sub-optimal solutions quickly for many large scale TSPs, which are common problems in many robotic applications. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.

40|$|Reconstructing the {{macroscopic}} human cortical connectome by Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is {{a challenging}} research topic that has recently gained {{a lot of}} attention. In the present work, we investigate the effects of intra-voxel fiber direction modeling and tractography algorithm on derived structural network indices (e. g. density, small-worldness and global efficiency). The investigation is centered on three semi-independent distinctions within the large set of available diffusion models and tractography methods: i) single fiber direction versus multiple directions in the intra-voxel diffusion model, ii) deterministic versus probabilistic tractography and iii) local versus global measure-of-fit of the reconstructed fiber trajectories. The effect of algorithm and parameter choice has two components. First, there is the large effect of tractography algorithm and parameters on global network density, which is known to strongly affect graph indices. Second, and more importantly, there are remaining effects on graph indices which range {{in the tens of}} percent even when global density is controlled for. This is crucial for the sensitivity of any human structural network study and for the validity of study comparisons. We then investigate the effect in choices in tractography algorithm on sensitivity and specificity of the resulting connections with a connectome dissection quality control (QC) approach. In this approach, evaluation of Tract Specific Density Coefficients (TSDCs) measures sensitivity while careful <b>inspection</b> of tractography <b>path</b> results assesses specificity. We use this to discuss interactions in the combined effects of these methods and implications for future studies...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{is to improve the}} testing of {{programs}} that contain loops and complex methods. We achieve this goal with verification-based testing, which is a technique that can generate test cases not only from source code but also from loop invariants and method specifications provided by the user. These test cases ensure the execution of interesting program paths that are likely to be missed by existing testing techniques that are based on symbolic program execution. These techniques would require an exhaustive inspection of all execution paths, which is hard to achieve in presence of complex methods and impossible if loops are involved. Verification-based testing takes a different approach. and in order to execute C() it has to be executed exactly 20 times. In similar programs these numbers could be much larger or be the result of complex expressions requiring an exhaustive <b>inspection</b> of all <b>paths</b> in order to find the case where the branch conditions are satisfied. The situation is similar in listing 2 where an exhaustive inspection of D() may be required in order to find a path such that after the execution of D() the branch condition i. = 20 holds. Since exhaustive symbolic execution is not possible existing testing techniques are likely to miss these cases because they have a bound on the amount of inspected execution paths. For loops and recursive methods the typical approach is to symbolically execute the first k loop iterations or recursion steps, called k-bounded unwinding, where k is a limiting constant. 1...|$|R
