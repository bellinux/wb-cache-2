50|$|In addition, {{evidence}} has been found of irrigation draining ditches, dating back to 9,000 years ago. A number of plants, including taro were grown, at {{what would have been}} the edge of its cultivable limit in the highlands. These ditches can be divided into three types: major disposal channels, large <b>field</b> <b>ditches,</b> and small <b>field</b> <b>ditches.</b> The major disposal channels were built to divert water from the fan flowing south and direct them toward the northeast areas. The large and small <b>field</b> <b>ditches</b> are more uniform, surrounding the perimeter of the planting areas. They connect with the major disposal channels. During this time, the people of Kuk Swamp transformed their landscape into an anthropogenic grassland suitable for agriculture.|$|E

To achieve these objectives, two commercial cane fields having the same furrow lengths (2100 m) and slopes were chosen. The study shows that in the open <b>field</b> head <b>ditch</b> irrigation, the irrigation water added was 69. 1 mm in the top, 75. 7 mm {{in the middle and}} 66. 1 mm in the end of the furrow.

40|$|Species of the Culex vishnui subgroup, Cx. fuscocephala and Cx. gelidus, {{which are}} known Japanese {{encephalitis}} (JE) vectors, are distributed in rice agroecosystems in Asian countries. Hence, although ecological studies of rice agroecosystems in northern Vietnam are necessary, very few integrated studies of breeding habitats of mosquitoes, including JE vectors, have been conducted. We {{carried out a}} field study and investigated the mosquito fauna in six rice production areas in northern Vietnam during the rainy and dry seasons of 2009. Mosquitoes and potential mosquito predators were collected from aquatic habitats by using larval dippers. We collected 1780 Culex individuals (including 254 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus; 113 Cx. vishnui, 58 Cx. vishnui complex, consisting of Cx. vishnui and Cx. pseudovishnui; 12 Cx. gelidus; 1 Cx. bitaeniorhynchus; and 1 Cx. fuscocephala), 148 Anopheles individuals (including 5 An. vagus), 1 Mansonia annulifera, and 1 Mimomyia chamberlaini {{during the rainy season}}. During the dry season, we collected 176 Culex individuals (including 33 Cx. vishnui, 24 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, 8 Cx. vishnui complex, and 1 Cx. gelidus) and 186 Anopheles individuals (including 9 An. tessellatus, 2 An. kochi, and 2 An. barbumbrosus). We found mosquitoes in all aquatic habitats, namely, rice <b>fields,</b> <b>ditches,</b> ponds, wetlands, irrigation canals, and rice nurseries, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui complex were found in all the above six areas. Heteroptera such as Micronecta, Veliidae, and Pleidae were abundant and widely distributed in both the seasons. The abundance of mosquito larvae was higher in the rice <b>fields,</b> <b>ditches,</b> and ponds during the rainy season than during the dry season. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui complex, Cx. fuscocephala, and Cx. gelidus were abundant in rice agroecosystems (rice <b>fields,</b> <b>ditches,</b> ponds, and wetlands) in northern Vietnam, and their abundance was high during the rainy season.

It considers four processes: transport, transformation, sorption and volatilization. Analytical andnumerical solutions corresponded well.

However, sorption to macrophytes leads to a slower transport and thus to longer residence times for the pesticide in the water layer. Sedimentation and resuspension of suspended solids were not considered, so that the model can only be applied for periods shorter than one month...|$|E
