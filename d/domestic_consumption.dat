Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowering corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on <b>domestic</b> <b>consumption,</b> rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for <b>domestic</b> <b>consumption.</b> He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E

At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular remained important for <b>domestic</b> <b>consumption.</b> The annual raids, which had almost lapsed in the turmoil following the Abbasid Revolution, were undertaken with renewed vigour from ca. 780 on, and were the only expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person.|$|E
5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no <b>domestic</b> <b>consumption.</b> This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

The flooding destroyed 6,000 houses and damaged 20,000 others, displacing over 730,000 and forcing over 100,000 to evacuate. In addition, the flooding destroyed 27 schools and damaged 286 others, 175 severely. Flooding caused major damage to crops, while landslides destroyed crop land across the country. The most severely affected crops for <b>domestic</b> <b>consumption</b> were tomatoes, bananas, corn, other vegetables, and beans, with damaged totaling to $48 million (1998 USD). Export crops such as bananas or coffee were greatly damaged as well, with damage amounting to $325 million (1998 USD). Damage to plantations and soil totaled to $121 million (1998 USD). The flooding also caused severe damage to the transportation infrastructure, including the loss of 37 bridges. Across the country, flooding damaged or destroyed 840 miles (1350km) of roads, of which nearly 400 miles (640km) were sections of major highways. In all, Hurricane Mitch caused $748 million (1998 USD) and 268 deaths in Guatemala. In addition, Mitch caused 11 indirect deaths when a plane crashed during the storm.|$|E

40|$|Comprehensively {{understanding}} {{water consumption}} behavior {{is necessary to}} design efficient and effective water use strategies. Despite global efforts to identify the factors that affect <b>domestic</b> water <b>consumption,</b> those related to domestic water use in rural regions have not been sufficiently studied, particularly in villages that have gained access to improved water supply. To address this gap, we investigated 247 households in eight villages in the Wei River Basin where three types of improved water supply systems are implemented. Results show that <b>domestic</b> water <b>consumption</b> in liters per capita per day was significantly correlated with water supply pattern and vegetable garden area, and significantly negatively correlated with family size and age of household head. Traditional hygiene habits, use of water appliances, and preference for vegetable gardening remain dominant behaviors in the villages with access to improved water supply.

Third, three member countries, Bahrain, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates, are found to be oil conserving as their per capita GDP grow and expand; whereas, the other three countries, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, tend to drive up their <b>domestic</b> oil <b>consumptions</b> as their per capita GDP expand and grow. Fourth, the three oil-conserving countries also have higher income elasticity than the three non-oil conserving countries. Finally, the domestic oil markets are found to be immune to disturbances and shocks to the international oil prices. Therefore, in the face of rising oil prices, per capita oil consumptions are rapidly raising in the GCC countries, while they have taken downward trends in some developed countries such as the United States and Japan...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{analyzes}} the socioeconomic energy metabolism of Austria {{in the period}} 1830 - 1995. During this period Austria underwent a transition from being a largely agricultural society to being an industrial society. We describe the changes associated with this transition {{in terms of the}} "physical economy, " or more precisely, in terms of changes in the throughput of energy, assessed in physical units (Joule per year). In accordance with currently used methods of material flow accounting (MFA), we define the indicators "direct input " and "domestic consumption " with respect to socioeconomic energy flows. Using these indicators, we analyze the transition from 1830, at which time biomass provided more than 99 % of Austria’s <b>domestic</b> energy <b>consumption,</b> to 1995, when biomass accounted for 30 % and fossil energy for 60 % of <b>domestic</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> Total <b>domestic</b> energy <b>consumption</b> in Austria increased by a factor of 6 in this period.
