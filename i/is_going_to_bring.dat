500|$|In December 2010, Lloyd {{signed with}} {{expansion}} team Atlanta Beat for the 2011 season. Of her signing, Beat head coach James Galanis said, [...] "She {{is a fantastic}} midfielder and someone who is fully focused on the game. I have known her from her college days, and I {{have had the opportunity}} to train her and improve her game individually. She has made a lot of sacrifices off the field to reach her dreams, and she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a lot of professionalism to the team." [...] Lloyd scored two goals in her ten appearances for the Beat. She scored the team's lone goal in a 4–1 defeat by the Boston Breakers on April 9. Her second goal on the season was an equalizer during the 70th minute of a 2–2 draw against the Western New York Flash. The Beat finished their first season in last place with a 1–4–13 record.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were mostly positive, noting its [...] "hilarious beginning and the nice ending." [...] Dan Iverson of IGN praised the episode, stating that the episode [...] "looks to show that this fifth season <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the series back to the irreverent basics that made it so appealing." [...] Iverson went on to comment {{that some of the}} jokes were [...] "extremely funny" [...] and that [...] "the episode had it all, from the Electric Company bit to making fun of people who drive Hummers and watch movies like Madagascar." [...] In the conclusion of his review, Iverson gave the episode an eight out of ten. Brett Love of TV Squad also gave the episode a positive review, calling the installment much better than the previous two episode's from the season, [...] "Stewie Loves Lois" [...] and [...] "Mother Tucker", but criticized the storyline's similarity to the South Park episode [...] "Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes". Love commented negatively on the portrayal of Peter working at the superstore, however, stating, [...] "it's a fine line when they go retarded with Peter. Sometimes it plays really funny, and sometimes it just gets annoying." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{preliminary}} {{round of the}} 200-meter butterfly, Tarwater turned in the fastest time, acknowledging that nerves {{played a role in}} his fast swim. In the semi-finals, he achieved a new personal best of 1:54.72 and finished with the second-fastest time, just seven-tenths of a second slower than Phelps. [...] "It felt great, but there's still no celebrating for me," [...] he said about the swim. In the finals, Tarwater was exactly tied with Phelps and on world-record pace through the first 50 meters. He stayed near Phelps for 150 meters before fading on the last 50. In the last 25 meters, he was passed by Gil Stovall, who beat his personal best by a second and a half, to finish third. Tarwater also swam a new personal best – 1:54.46 – but it was not good enough to make the Olympic team, missing out by six-tenths of a second. After the race, he briefly considered retiring before deciding to finish the meet. [...] "I don't know what the future <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring,</b> but I didn't want to go out knowing I didn't get back up," [...] he said. He finished eighth in the 100-meter butterfly; earlier, he failed to make the finals in the freestyle events.|$|E

2500|$|Whatever {{the reality}} behind the legends, {{even after his}} defeat Villa {{remained}} a powerful character still lurking in the Mexican mind; in 1950 Octavio Paz wrote, in his morose but thoughtful book on the Mexican soul, The Labyrinth of Solitude, [...] "The brutality and uncouthness {{of many of the}} revolutionary leaders has not prevented them from becoming popular myths. Villa still gallops through the north, in songs and ballads; Zapata dies at every popular fair. ... It is the Revolution, the magical word, the word that is going to change everything, that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> us immense delight and a quick death." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2014, the San Antonio Express-News, {{reported}} that Saldívar was [...] "mounting a new legal {{effort to get}} an early release from prison, following numerous appeals in her case." [...] The news of Saldívar's potential early release by a fake news agency which {{reported that}} Saldívar would be released as early as January 1, 2015 sparked a social media frenzy among fans. Valdez told the San Antonio Express-News that Saldívar is currently representing herself and that a court date {{has not yet been}} set. Saldívar claims that witnesses were not called on and files have gone missing {{since the end of the}} trial. Quintanilla, Jr. said that he [...] "doesn't care" [...] if Saldívar gets an early release, since [...] "nothing <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> [...] daughter back." [...] He does say that Saldívar would be safer in prison rather than being freed.|$|E

2500|$|Ellen E Jones from The Independent though Dyer in EastEnders seemed [...] "inevitable" [...] {{and called}} him [...] "the cockney messiah [...] come to save EastEnders". She said that Dyer walks the [...] "thin line between {{national}} treasure and national laughing stock", so EastEnders—"which works best when it's an overblown cockney pantomime"—would be Dyer's [...] "natural home". Kevin O'Sullivan from the Daily Mirror {{said that it would}} take more than hiring Dyer to [...] "stop the rot", as fans were getting [...] "fed up" [...] of watching the show. Katy Brent from the Daily Mirror said: [...] "I'm kind of intrigued to see what Danny Dyer <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> to the table, or bar in his case, but I think it's going to take me a little while to be convinced by him. No offence Dan, I'm sure you'll be great, but I'm a little sceptical when 'names' are brought in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Congress, Barr {{became famous}} for his [...] "dour" [...] image and told constituents, [...] "You don't send me to Washington to smile." [...] He also said in a radio {{interview}} [...] "If it's not in the Constitution, I won't smile". He later explained [...] "I don't consider politicians who smile to be worth {{a heck of a}} lot... all things considered, it doesn't make a dime's worth of difference if the politicians in Washington smile or not, what matters is how much of your hard-earned dollars they take to spend in pure pork". Barr said in 2010 [...] "I can see a situation where the federal government <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, and while I would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact {{is that this is a}} corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the 'red state' column. The only solution to this kind of behavior is dour and austere social conservatism, like my own". Adding to his image, Barr has frequently protested about [...] "cult hairstyles", saying [...] "I cannot abide by people who adopt a cult hairstyle, or persistently dress inappropriately for meetings with me".|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, {{but at the end of}} the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E
