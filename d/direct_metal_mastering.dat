2500|$|Through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, various {{methods to}} improve the dynamic range of mass-produced records {{involved}} highly advanced disc cutting equipment. These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the CBS DisComputer and Teldec <b>Direct</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Mastering,</b> were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. RCA Victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called [...] "diaphragming" [...] the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk. Lower recorded volume used closer spacing; higher recorded volume used wider spacing, especially with lower frequencies. Also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end {{farther away from the}} disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.|$|E

50|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>metal</b> <b>mastering</b> {{technology}} {{addresses the}} lacquer mastering technology's issue of pre-echoes during record play, {{caused by the}} cutting stylus unintentionally transferring some of the subsequent groove wall's impulse signal into the previous groove wall. In particular, a quiet passage followed by a loud sound often clearly revealed a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time (the duration of one revolution at 33 rpm). This problem could also appear as post-echo, 1.8 seconds after a peak in volume.|$|E
50|$|In {{preparation}} for a record pressing, acetates are used for quality control prior {{to the production of}} the stampers, from which retail copies of the record will be pressed. The purpose of the test acetate(s) in the mastering process is to allow the artist, producer, engineer, and other interested parties to check the quality of the tape-to-disc recording process and make any necessary changes to ensure that the audio fidelity of the master disc will be {{as close as possible to}} that of the original master tape. The actual stampers can be made either from normal acetates, or from a DMM disc (see <b>Direct</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Mastering).</b>|$|E

5000|$|DMM LP {{pressings}} {{are sometimes}} described {{by some as}} having a harshness or forwardness in the high frequencies. The fact the groove is cut to copper, a hard metal, and not to soft lacquer, nitrocelullose, supposedly endows DMM vinyl LP with a very different tonality to traditionally manufactured vinyl LP pressings. <b>Direct</b> <b>metal</b> <b>mastering</b> requires a radically different cutting angle than traditional (lacquer) cutting, almost 0 degrees. However the playback cartridges will always have the standard playback angle of 15-22.5°. Thus, the DMM process includes electronic audio processing [...] so the records can be played with a standard cartridge despite having been cut at a substantially different angle. This electronic processing might account for the supposedly different high frequency [...] "signature sound" [...] of DMM records.|$|E
50|$|Sides are recut {{for various}} reasons. Record stampers {{can only be}} used to make so many copies before they become worn, and a new cut is required. (As of the early 1980s, this was no longer true. Changes to master disc {{manufacturing}} methods, including the DMM or <b>Direct</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>Mastering</b> system, made it possible to make many copies of a master cut non-destructively, so a recut was no longer necessary when the plate used for pressing became worn.) Stampers can also become damaged from handling. Recuts can also be made when {{there is a problem with}} the previous cut, for example, a technical fault or improper banding (the visual separation between songs). When a new cut is made, several copies called test pressings are made for technicians (and, for a new record, the producer and the recording artist) to review the cut, and determine if it should be accepted or rejected. If it is rejected, another cut must be made.|$|E
