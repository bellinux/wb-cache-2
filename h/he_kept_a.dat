5|$|Myers had {{mechanical}} {{understanding and}} improved many devices. One was a patented invention of a kerosene lamp damper that reduced considerably the flame's smoke. Another innovation, {{of which he}} was proud, was an automatic self-recording mercury barometer that memorialized its measurements on a paper strip; with this meteorological instrument <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> continuous barometric record that covered a span of 30 years.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution, Boone resettled in Limestone (renamed Maysville, Kentucky in 1786), then {{a booming}} Ohio River port. In 1787, {{he was elected}} to the Virginia state {{assembly}} as a representative from Bourbon County. In Maysville, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> tavern and worked as a surveyor, horse trader, and land speculator. He was initially prosperous, owning seven slaves by 1787, a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time. Boone became a celebrity while living in Maysville. In 1784, on his 50th birthday, historian John Filson published The Discovery, Settlement And present State of Kentucke, a book which included a chronicle of Boone's adventures.|$|E
5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
50|$|Ogiemwonyi {{championed the}} {{takeover}} of NPDC and <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> up-to-date reserves position of the company.|$|R
60|$|The mate obeyed, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> anxious {{eye on the}} whale, {{which had}} gone off at a tangent and was smoking away to the eastward.|$|R
50|$|Uncle Ezekiel was a {{shop owner}} and had quite liberal beliefs, being <b>a</b> 'little Englander'. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> {{assortment}} of caged birds inside his shop as decoration.|$|R
5|$|Efforts {{to regain}} a public {{position}} in the Orange Free State failed, and in 1888 Spruyt once more returned to the South African Republic. He was allowed to work as law agent in the lower courts, and – being well-known and popular – set up a successful law practice. Until {{the end of his}} life <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> healthy interest in the affairs of the state, especially in land cases.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{got another}} brace in a 4–0 victory against Osasuna in the Copa del Rey. He also {{scored in the}} semi-final of the {{competition}} against Valencia to help Barcelona to the final with a 3–1 win on aggregate. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> regular run in the Barcelona side {{for the rest of}} the season, including appearances in both semi-final legs of the 3–2 aggregate defeat to Chelsea in the Champions League, and a substitute appearance in the 3–0 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final.|$|E
5|$|Long's time as {{governor}} {{was described by}} historian P.A.M. Tayler as relatively uneventful. He proposed a number of modest reforms, including a measured expansion of women's voting rights (then restricted to voting for school committees), and allowing women to sit on state boards. Most of these reforms were not implemented during his tenure, although some were later enacted into law by his successors. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> busy schedule, attending all manner of civic events across the state.|$|E
60|$|Borden set his teeth. The task {{which had}} seemed to him so easy was {{presenting}} now a very different appearance. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> iron restraint upon himself.|$|R
50|$|Wellington based, he {{was tried}} and convicted {{multiple}} times for anti-war activism {{during the second}} world war, spending a year in prison during which <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> illicit diary.|$|R
50|$|Hayter was {{charming and}} able, but few found real warmth in him. While still at school {{he had lost}} belief in Christianity, but <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> affection for the Church of England.|$|R
5|$|Reagan {{never left}} the United States during the war, but <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> film reel that he {{obtained}} {{while he was in}} the service. The reel depicted the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp; he believed that doubts would someday arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred. It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz, though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.|$|E
5|$|Southall {{was bought}} by Everton manager Howard Kendall for £150,000 {{in the summer of}} 1981. To win a first team place he had to compete with Jim McDonagh (a Gordon Lee signing who would soon leave the club), Jim Arnold (also a new signing), and Martin Hodge (who was injured {{throughout}} his time at Everton). He made his debut in a 2–1 win over Ipswich Town in October, after Arnold picked up an injury. He returned to the first team in December, and <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet against Aston Villa and remained an ever-present {{throughout the rest of the}} 1981–82 season.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
50|$|John Tennent of Listonshiels (died c. 1549) was {{a servant}} and {{companion}} of James V of Scotland. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> {{account of the}} king's daily expenses which is an important source document for the Scottish royal court.|$|R
60|$|He {{had felt}} his pulse quicken a trifle at the {{business}} manager's brusqueness, and upon him <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> alert eye, for {{it was in that}} gentleman's trousers pocket that he divined the Transcontinental's ready cash was reposing.|$|R
25|$|Khatami's other brother, Ali Khatami, a {{businessman}} with a master's degree in Industrial Engineering from Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, {{served as the}} President's Chief of Staff during President Khatami's second term in office, where <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> unusually low profile.|$|R
5|$|Amos {{made his}} first start of the 2011–12 season in a third round League Cup tie at Elland Road against Leeds United. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet as United cruised through to the next round winning 3–0. He played again in the {{following}} round away at Aldershot Town, a game which United also won 3–0 and advanced to the quarter finals. He was in goal again for United's League Cup game in a defeat against Championship club Crystal Palace on 30 November. It also seemed that he had moved above last season's second choice Tomasz Kuszczak in the pecking order, but was now third choice behind Anders Lindegaard and David de Gea. He {{made his first}} Premier League start in a 2–0 home win against Stoke City on 31 January 2012, keeping a clean sheet on his debut.|$|E
5|$|Arnold was the {{preferred}} choice in goal {{at the start}} of the 1983–84 season, before Southall was recalled on 1 October against Notts County. Everton had a poor start to the league campaign, but excelled in cup competitions, reaching the final of both the League Cup and the FA Cup. Southall's first appearance at Wembley was in the League Cup final against Liverpool, and <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet in a goalless draw. The replay was held at Maine Road, and Liverpool won the tie 1–0 with a Graeme Souness goal. He was rarely called into action in the 1984 FA Cup Final, and kept a clean sheet as Everton claimed the trophy with a 2–0 victory over Watford.|$|E
5|$|Buffon {{made his}} first {{appearance}} for Italy under new manager Antonio Conte on 9 September 2014, captaining his team in their opening European Championship qualifying match against Norway in Oslo. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> clean sheet as Italy won the match 2–0. On 12 June 2015, Buffon became {{the first player to}} appear in 50 UEFA competitive international matches in Italy's 1–1 away draw against Croatia in a European qualifying match. Buffon saved an early Mario Mandžukić penalty, but was taken off at half time and replaced by Salvatore Sirigu due to an injury. He made his 150th appearance for Italy on 6 September 2015, keeping a clean sheet in a home 1–0 win over Bulgaria, his 62nd clean sheet at the international level. Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan.|$|E
50|$|By Jan 2008, {{speculation}} about Longano and Davis leaving Brash began to spread. In May 2008, Longano left Brash to pursue another entrepreneurial endeavor. While <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> {{interest in the}} company as an investor, he no longer led the company.|$|R
50|$|During 1791-3 Tobin was in HMS Providence, captain William Bligh, on its {{voyage to}} Tahiti and the West Indies. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> {{illustrated}} journal, covering in particular Tahiti and Tasmania. It {{is now in}} the State Library of New South Wales.|$|R
50|$|Khatami's other brother, Ali Khatami, a {{businessman}} with a master's degree in Industrial Engineering from Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, {{served as the}} President's Chief of Staff during President Khatami's second term in office, where <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> unusually low profile.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{interest}} in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree in that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the Spanish Enlightenment, Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a freemason. He gave up his religious studies to study law and get married, but never actually became a priest, {{so there was no}} defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of vocation.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after he}} became a bishop Burnell kept a mistress, Juliana. Rumours {{circulated}} that she bore him four sons, {{and that he had}} a number of daughters, all of which Burnell denied. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> magnificent household, sufficient for him to be able to host a parliament at his home in Acton Burnell in autumn 1283. He married off a number of young female relatives, rumoured to be his daughters, to noblemen. Amabilla Burnell married a member of a royal justice's family, and a Joan Burnell {{was the subject of a}} guarantee to the bishop that the son of William of Greystoke would marry her. A William Burnell was dean of Wells Cathedral, and was named as one of the bishop's executors. Robert Burnell's eventual heir was his nephew, Philip.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich was a {{prolific}} artist who {{produced more than}} 500 attributed works. In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as The Stages of Life, were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted {{during one of the}} revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, in part because he often did not directly name or date his canvases. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Wright {{became one}} of the best known breeders and {{trainers}} of coursing greyhounds in the United Kingdom. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> extensive breeding and training establishment at Waverton, and his pedigree puppies annually offered high prices and won many noted events.|$|R
5000|$|Mellado {{resided in}} a small home in la colonia Anzures. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> {{exercise}} regiment and reportedly swam every morning at 6 a.m. until about 2004. [...] He lived {{in a nursing home}} during the final months of his life.|$|R
60|$|Whenever he {{went about}} away from home, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> {{eye out for}} dogs in the farmyards he passed. He did it without really {{thinking}} anything about it. He had given up hope of finding Bowser, yet he was always looking for him.|$|R
5|$|John Parkinson (15671650; buried 6 August 1650) was {{the last}} of the great English {{herbalists}} {{and one of the first}} of the great English botanists. He was apothecary to James I and a founding member of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries in December 1617, and was later Royal Botanist to Charles I. He is known for two monumental works, Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris (Park-in-Sun's Terrestrial Paradise, 1629), which generally describes the proper cultivation of plants; and Theatrum Botanicum (The Botanical Theatre or Theatre of Plants, 1640), the most complete and beautifully presented English treatise on plants of its time. One of the most eminent gardeners of his day, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> botanical garden at Long Acre in Covent Garden, today close to Trafalgar Square, and maintained close relations with other important English and Continental botanists, herbalists and plantsmen.|$|E
5|$|The Ententist bid {{resulted}} in major initial defeats, and a Romanian theater of war was opened. The country suffered heavily, and Bucharest {{was taken by}} the Central Powers. Reputedly, the occupation forces picked up Bogdan-Pitești from his cell at Văcărești, where he was still serving time. Like Arghezi, Macedonski, Galaction and Mateiu Caragiale, he remained in German-occupied territory. Despite his apparent triumph over the Ententist lobby, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> low profile: according to popular but unverifiable rumors, he was even arrested once the occupation authorities angrily discovered his uselessness for the cause. He was however a free man as of April 12, 1917, the date of his marriage to Domnica Colanoski. One account has it that Bogdan-Pitești proceeded to denounce his Ileana colleague, Petrescu Găină, who had published a set of anti-German cartoons. As a result, the Romanian draftsman spent the war years in German captivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{business}} {{base for}} the horse racing operation is Hackensack, New Jersey, but Zayat's horses live in different locations across the US. His horse breeding stock live mostly in Kentucky, young horses are started in Florida. The racing stock have been in training with multiple trainers including Bob Baffert, Mark Casse, D. Wayne Lukas, Todd Pletcher, Dale Romans and others. Zayat Stables keeps about 30 broodmares and their foals in Kentucky along with roughly 20 yearlings. In 2015 the operation stood 13 breeding stallions at stud. Zayat typically retains a 25% interest in the stallions he sends to stud, though {{in the case of}} Pioneerof the Nile, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>a</b> 75% interest.|$|E
50|$|Honjō {{later became}} Chief aide-de-camp to Emperor Hirohito until 1936, when his {{suspected}} {{involvement in the}} February 26 Incident led to his retirement. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> extensive diary during his time as aide-de-camp, which was published by the University of Tokyo Press in 1983.|$|R

50|$|In {{spite of}} his intransigent {{attitude}} toward the Italian Communist Party, Pertini was suspicious of many policies enforced by the PSI. He criticized all forms of colonialism, as well as corruption in the Italian state and within the socialist party, where <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> independent political position.|$|R
