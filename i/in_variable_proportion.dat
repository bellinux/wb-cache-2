The mineralogy of the precipitates changed significantly {{as a consequence of}} the variations in the chemical parameters of the circulating solutions (mainly pH, Eh, and sulphate concentrations) which were mainly controlled by mixing with unpolluted waters of Rosia River. Ochreous precipitates are characterized by high concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTEs; in particular Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb) and consist of a mixture, <b>in</b> <b>variable</b> <b>proportion,</b> of jarosite and schwertmannite, which represent the stable secondary minerals along the investigated transect of Rosia River.

Furthermore, laboratory kinetic batch experiments on natural heterogeneous samples of ochreous precipitates were carried out to investigate the release processes involving PTEs and to verify the type and the amount of elements that can be temporarily/permanently trapped by the solid phase from the contaminated solutions. The comparative analysis of the precipitates and waters of the Rosia Montana mining area indicated that the role of secondary minerals as ââmitigating agentsââ can be limited because even minor pHâEh oscillations would cause mineralogical transformations that could lead to trace elements mobilization in the environment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction One of {{the main}} targets of planners, {{decision}} makers and governments is increasing society health with promotion and production of suitable and healthy food. One of the basic commodities that have important role in satisfaction of required human food is milk. So, some part of government and producer healthy budget allocate to milk consumption promotion by using generic advertising. If effectiveness of advertising budget on profitability is more, producer will have more willing to spend for advertising. Determination of optimal generic advertising budget is one of important problem in managerial decision making in producing firm as well as increase in consumption and profit and decrease in wasting and non-optimality of budget. Materials and Methods: In this study, optimal generic advertising budget intensity index (advertising budget share of production cost) was estimated under two different scenarios by using equilibrium replacement model. In equilibrium replacement model, producer surplus are maximized in respect to generic advertising in retail level. According to market where two levels of farm and processing before retail exist and there is trade in farm and retail level, we present different models. Fixed and variable proportion hypothesis is another one. Finally, eight relations are presented for determination of milk generic advertising optimum budget. So, we use data from several resources such as previous studies, national (Iran Static center) and international institute (Fao) formal data and own estimation. Because there are several estimations in previous studies, we identify some scenarios (in two general scenarios) for calculation of milk generic advertising optimum budget. Results and Discussion: Estimation of milk generic advertising optimum budget in scenario 1 shows that in case of one market level, fixed supplies and no trade, optimum budget is 0. 4672539 percent. In case of one market level and no trade, optimum budget is 0. 3674844 percent. In case of one market level with trade, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of farm input, changed from 0. 3675013 to 0. 3674941 percent. In case of two market level and no trade at either market levels, optimum budget is 0. 5094457 percent. In case of two market levels with trade only at retail, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of retail goods are changed from 0. 509446 to 0. 3674844 percent. In case of two market levels with trade only at farm, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of farm input are changed from 0. 5094600 to 0. 5094951 percent. In case of two market levels with trade at both retail and farm, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of retail goods and farm input are changed from 0. 5085780 to 0. 5117381 percent. This index <b>in</b> <b>variable</b> <b>proportion</b> hypothesis will be changed from 0. 4143826 to 0. 4164392. Estimation of milk generic advertising optimum budget in scenario 2 shows that in case of one market level, fixed supplies and no trade, optimum budget is 9. 639368 percent. In case of one market level and no trade, optimum budget 8. 9480986 percent. In case of one market level with trade, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of farm input, changed from 8. 948178 to 8. 948440 percent. In case of two market level and no trade at either market levels, optimum budget is 14. 4113143 percent. In case of two market levels with trade only at retail, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of retail goods are changed from 14. 413087 to 14. 447182 percent. In case of two market levels with trade only at farm, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of farm input are changed from 14. 413301 to 14. 413689 percent. In case of two market levels with trade at both retail and farm, optimum budget according to own price trade elasticity of retail goods and farm input are changed from 14. 379081 to 14. 413792 percent. This index <b>in</b> <b>variable</b> <b>proportion</b> hypothesis will be changed from 13. 294219 to 13. 323525. Finally, Results indicate that milk generic advertising budget intensity index will be changed from 0. 3674844 to 14. 4474182 percent with mean of 0. 4617576 percent for scenario 1 and 13. 445766 percent for scenario 2. Conclusion: According to the results, we proposed that milk producer should spend 13. 44 percent of their production cost to generic advertising. This spending can increase milk consumption and it increase health society. Moreover, it decreases the household care and remedy spending and it increases the profitability of milk production firms. Also, government could spend to milk generic advertising from healthy budget of ministry of medical health, care and education or from agricultural promotion budget of ministry of Agri-Jahad...|$|E

40|$|A tying {{arrangement}} is a sellerâs requirement that a customer may purchase its âtyingâ product only by taking its âtiedâ product. In a variable proportion tie the purchaser can vary {{the amount of}} the tied product. For example, a customer might purchase a single printer, but either a contract or technological design requires the purchase of varying numbers of printer cartridges from the same manufacturer. Such arrangements are widely considered to be price discrimination devices, but their economic effects have been controversial. Tying has been attacked on the theory that price discrimination of this sort reduces consumer welfare. We show that this argument is based on a misunderstanding of the kind of price discrimination that is involved <b>in</b> <b>variable</b> <b>proportion</b> ties. The great majority of them almost certainly produce both welfare gains and net consumer benefits. We also consider and reject the argument that tying produces greater welfare losses when viewed from an ex ante rather than an ex post perspective. That argument rests on a flawed premise about the sources of the increased returns to innovations whose distribution requires tying. Further, it ignores the important role of fixed costs in producing innovation incentives. We also show that tying in concentrated markets produces significant benefits from the elimination of double marginalization, which occurs when firms in complementary markets have market power and the two are unable to coordinate their output. In other cases ties effect two-part tariffs, which can also address double marginalization problems. Then we extend our analysis to bundled discounts, focusing on the possibility of increased harm that can occur if the monopolist increases the standalone price of one good when inaugurating the bundled discount. Antitrustâs per se rule is reserved for practices that are so likely to cause antitrust harm and have so little to defend them that detailed case-by-case assessment is thought to be unnecessary. They can be condemned categorically simply upon a showing that a few basic conditions are satisfied and that they belong in a particular class of restraints. No kind of unilaterally imposed tying arrangement, even by a monopolist, falls into that category. Rather, the case for antitrust harm from tying is ambiguous at best and requires detailed scrutiny into market power, rationales for tying, and anticompetitive effects - all the subject of antitrustâs traditional rule of reason. Finally, we recommend that courts in antitrust cases forget about price discrimination or leveraging as independent anticompetitive concerns and focus on foreclosure, or antitcompetitive exclusion...|$|E
40|$|Intercalation and deintercalation {{of neutral}} organic {{molecules}} in the interlayer space of phyllosilicates represent an important {{interest in the}} development of new materials with desirable properties (catalysts, sorbents, [...] .) or in environmental protection and rehabilitation (waste deposits, polluted soils, [...] .). To analyse these mechanisms several approaches are usually profitable. The small dimensions and the high dipolar momentum value of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) give it a high ability to be intercalated in 1 : 1 phyllosilicates and initialize the intercalation of other larger organic molecules. The aim of this work is to show the interest of FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to characterise the deintercalation process of the DMSO-nacrite complex. The DMSO-nacrite complex was prepared by heating nacrite in a 92 / 8 wt % DMSO/H 2 O solution at 60 Â°C. In order to localize the interaction between DMSO molecule and the clay mineral, infrared absorption spectroscopy has been performed. Spectra of pure nacrite, freshly prepared DMSO-nacrite complex, and thermally-treated complex were recorded. The presence in the freshly prepared complex of OH bands at about 3400 cm- 1, 3500 cm- 1 et 3580 cm- 1 is characteristic of the interaction between DMSO and nacrite. These results allow to conclude that organic molecules are fixed by H-bonding between a DMSO oxygen and a nacrite surface hydrogen. These bands disappear after heating at 360 Â°C. The intercalated sample has been studied by high-temperature X-ray diffraction to follow the deintercalation. Samples have been heated from room temperature to 360 Â°C, with a heating rate of 100 Â°C/hour. The XRD patterns showed that (i) the deintercalation occurs at 120 Â°C, (ii) the reticular distances (001) and (002) are not in the expected 2 / 1 ratio, (iii) from T = 200 Â°C a strong and sharp reflection near 25 Â° (in 2 Î Cu KÎ) and a broad one around 12 Â° appear. In this range, the peak intensities are temperature dependent. This analysis indicates the presence of non-homogenous phases during the structural transformations. To quantify the structural evolution upon heating, a simulation method has been used. The model is based on the comparison between experimental and calculated XRD patterns. The model is obtained with a weighted sum of different contributions. Each contribution corresponds to a random interstratified phase formed with the two end-member phases (the intercalated complex and the deintercalated nacrite) <b>in</b> <b>variable</b> <b>proportion.</b> For example, a fair agreement between experimental and calculated intensities is obtained at 300 Â°C with the parameters given in the table.

40|$|Examples of {{classical}} Ewing's tumors ("Ewing's sarcomas") of both skeletal and extraskeletal locations were analyzed for {{the expression of}} intermediate filament (IF) and cell junction proteins, with the use of immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy as well as gel electrophoresis. In all 11 tumors examined vimentin filaments were abundant. A type of plaque-bearing small cell junction, which is common in these tumors but difficult to classify by morphologic criteria, was identified by antibodies to desmoplakins as true desmosomes. These were found in all cases, although <b>in</b> a very <b>variable</b> <b>proportion</b> of cells. Some of these junctions were associated with vimentin IFs. In addition, 9 of the cases examined showed scattered or clustered cells expressing the simple-epithelium type cytokeratins 8 and 18. Moreover, 3 cases displayed dispersed or clustered cells producing neurofilaments. The value of these observations, notably the cell type heterogeneity, for the diagnosis of tumors of this group is discussed. The results further indicate that Ewing's tumors are derived from a primitive, pluripotential cell that may differentiate, <b>in</b> <b>variable</b> <b>proportions,</b> into cells with mesenchymal, epithelial, and, more rarely, even neural features, suggesting that this tumor should be regarded as a blastoma, rather than as a true sarcoma...|$|R
40|$|Through {{histological}} analyses, {{this investigation}} reveals an unusual {{high incidence of}} hermaphroditism in Megapitaria squalida, a gonochoric species. A total of 684 specimens were sampled at monthly intervals from February 2007 to January 2008 at BahÄ±Â´a de La Paz and BahÄ±Â´a Magdalena, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Microscopic examination showed that 21. 8 % of specimens from BahÄ±Â´a de La Paz and 23. 5 % from BahÄ±Â´a Magdalena were hermaphroditic; in both areas, hermaphroditism was found throughout the year, although <b>in</b> <b>variable</b> <b>proportions.</b> <b>In</b> general, a significantly higher Lumber of females relative to males (chi-square, P < 0. 05) were observed in both areas. Our findings indicate that this unusual incidence of hermaphroditism was likely caused by the low population density resulting from overfishing...|$|R
