5000|$|Account {{stacking}} is {{a broadcast}} industry term, {{which refers to}} the deployment of subscription Direct To Home (DTH) satellite receiving equipment at multiple geographical locations under a single customer account. It {{is often referred to}} as 2nd address service, subscription sharing or account splitting. Account stacking is sometimes confused with satellite TV hacking and piracy but in fact, account stacking utilizes receiving apparatus which is legal in every material respect. A contentious issue exists since the receiving equipment is easily relocated and most DTH satellite providers prefer to charge a subscription fee on a per dwelling basis, much like cable-TV, and not on a per-receiver or per-customer basis. ----CRTC - Broadcasting Distribution Regulations In Canada, DTH satellite providers are licensed by the CRTC as Broadcast Distribution Undertakings, or BDU's for short. The regulations under which they are authorized to provide service are found in the CRTC's Broadcasting Distribution Regulations. 1. Under the regulations a [...] "customer" [...] means a person who is liable for payment for programming services that are distributed by a licensee and that are received directly or indirectly by one or more subscribers. [...] 2. A [...] "subscriber" [...] is a household of one or more persons, whether occupying a single-unit dwelling or a unit in a multiple-unit dwelling, to which service is provided directly or indirectly by a licensee. 3. A significant distinction exists between cable TV providers and DTH providers. The 'utility distribution model' used for cable TV does not readily apply to DTH undertakings. Cable TV is provided on a 'per dwelling' basis since it a closed-circuit wire-line service whereas DTH satellite is provided on a 'per customer' basis since the radio waves used for <b>distribution</b> <b>cover</b> a continent-wide area.|$|E

An outstanding question is whether such coincident changes (positive or negative) occur, especially in smaller regions in which management for change tends to be conducted.

We found that since the first recording period many more species have shifted their centres of gravity significantly northwards and uphill than have increased in population abundance (density) and <b>distribution</b> <b>cover.</b> At the same time, far fewer species have effectively shifted southwards and downhill than have decreased in density and <b>distribution</b> <b>cover.</b> A significant association between change in <b>distribution</b> <b>cover</b> and density is divorced from the weaker association between shifts in altitude and northing; whereas many species are gaining northwards and at higher altitude, they are doing so from a failing base at lower altitude and {{at the core of}} their distributions.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of a financial position of SME has very much importance as {{for the analysis of}} current situation in a regional economy, as for modeling of their development by drawing up medium-term forecasts. Definition of SMEsituationsshall be done for separate sectors (from 15 to 45) of economy. It would be required to observe over several thousand enterprises for full-scale research of SME situations in large regional economy on the basis of traditional statistical methods. Such assessmentsare possible with high costs to the past and practically aren't applicable for forecasting. Therefore it was required creating approach which would allow defining SMEs situation in each of business spheres on the basis of rather small samples. The proposed technique of financial situation assessment for SMEs based on David Durant's approach to determination of financial solvency and creation of probabilistic distributions such indicators as profitability of business (ROTA), solvency (cover ratio) and debts (dependenceratio). Samples examinations showed that ROTA is submitted to normal <b>distribution,</b> <b>cover</b> and dependenceratios - to logarithmic normal distribution.

30|$|Next, we {{used the}} TITAN {{function}} (Taxa Indicator Threshold ANalysis) in R (Baker and King 2010) to assess how vegetation changed with increasing maximum temperature and fire severity {{using data from the}} same 50 quadrats mentioned above. The TITAN function uses a novel technique combining indicator species analysis, change point analysis (Qian et al. 2003), and randomization procedures to detect how taxa change in <b>distribution</b> (<b>cover,</b> abundance, or frequency) along a gradient, as well as to detect possible community thresholds across that gradient. A community threshold represents synchronous response of multiple taxa to the same gradient value; in this case, it would be synchronous response of life form groups to fire severity. Briefly, TITAN converts indicator values to Z scores, and then sums all the z scores for each point along a gradient in which a given taxa is present or absent. The highest sum (Z) score of present taxa is evidence of a positive threshold, and the highest sum (Z) score for absent taxa is evidence for a negative threshold (Baker and King 2010). The TITAN function also gives two values, purity and reliability, that evaluate the confidence surrounding the indicator value estimates. Purity is the proportion of 500 bootstrap replicates with the same response direction (positive or negative). Reliability is the proportion of 500 bootstrap replicates with P values ≤ 0.05. Life form groups that have high purity (> 0.90) have high fidelity to a given response direction, and those with high reliability (> 0.90) have strong statistical confidence.|$|E
40|$|Different {{measures}} of species abundance, particularly cover and biomass, {{are often used}} {{as if they were}} interchangeable. We ask to what extent the measure of abundance affects conclusions reached in plant community ecology. The test data comprised 35 plots, each 1 m x 1 m, on serpentine vegetation in Tuscany, Italy, in which both cover and biomass were measured. The measure of abundance used made rather little difference when plots were examined in terms of the rank abundance of the species present, and little difference to the results of a DCA-ordination. Likewise, species showed similar variation across plots in cover as in biomass. In calculating species diversity, agreement between {{measures of}} abundance was lower, but still good. For evenness, the correlation between cover and biomass results was lower again, though more so with some indices than with others. For the shape of the RAD (Relative Abundance <b>Distribution),</b> <b>cover</b> and biomass gave quite different results, the Zipf-Mandelbrot RAD model most commonly giving the best fit to the cover data, but the General lognormal model to the biomass data. These tendencies can be related to the intrinsic characteristics of cover and biomass as measures of abundance. The parameters of the model fits also differed between abundance measures. We conclude that the importance of using biomass as the measure of abundance depends on the ecological feature being examined. The difference between the two measures may be greater in other vegetation; very little information is available. In the current state of knowledge it is dangerous to use another measure as a surrogate for biomass...|$|E

Using palinspastic reconstructions the relative positions of geologic units are restored to their pre-extensional configuration. Metallic "belts" are heterogeneous with numerous metal associations and deposit types superimposed in the same area. The reconstructions show that magmatism and mineralization were coeval and coincident.

40|$|Cymodosea nodosa meadows, {{known as}} ‘sebadales’ or ‘manchones’ at Canary Islands, {{represent}} EUNIS habitat type code A 5. 5311, called Macaronesian Cymodocea beds. As it’s described at European Union Habitats Directive (92 / 43 /CEE) Annex 1, sea grass meadows belong to 1110 Sandbanks which are slightly covered by seawater all the time, within Natura 2000 Network. Several ‘sebadales’ throughout the archipelago {{are included in}} this Network as Special Areas of Conservation. Cymodosea nodosa is regionally included within the Canary Islands Protected Species List (Ley 4 / 2010), as a species ‘of interest to ecosystems of Canary Islands”, is usually found at a narrow depth range (10 to 20 m of depth) and, on the whole, best structured meadows are settled at sheltered bays, away from wave and current beating, flimsier at exposed areas. Deeper meadows are also sparser, being C. nodosa replaced by green algae Caulerpa prolifera and Caulerpa racemosa, although mixed algae-sea grass meadows are often found at different depths. The project Assessment of marine flora (‘sebadal’, ma¨erl, ‘mujo’) of ‘La Graciosa e Islotes del Norte de Lanzarote’ Marine Reserve, funded by ‘Viceconsejer´ıa de Pesca y Aguas de la Consejer´ıa de Agricultura, Ganader´ıa, Pesca y Aguas’, Canary Islands Government, has had the aim of assessing sea grass meadows condition and distribution at ‘El R´ıo’ Natura 2000 Network Special Area of Conservation, the channel between La Graciosa and Lanzarote. ‘LA GRACIOSA 1311 ’ cruise was performed {{within the framework of}} the project. First of all previous information on sea grass shallow distribution (up to a depth of 20 m) in the study area was reviewed. Afterwards, a tugged underwater video camera was used onboard of the Marine Reserve Surveillance Vessel to update cartographic info performing a grid of sampling stations, covering previously known distribution limits and verifying current presence/absence data and density. Furthermore, population parameters were obtained in order to assess ‘sebadal’ condition. Fixed stations were selected in regards to this process, and methodology applied on them was as follows: five radial arranged transects were performed, identifying fragmentation (it estimates meadow continuity regarding observed cover), density (mean value of several shoots number counts with 20 x 20 cm grids placed every 2 m), height (mean value in cm of 10 independent samples by transect) and fish and macroinvertebrate species richness for each transect.

40|$|Food-searching {{behavior}} of two adult male Ferruginous Hawks (Buteo regalis) was studied by direct observation in Curlew Valley, Utah-Idaho, during the nesting seasons of 1974 and 1975. This paper analyzes {{the effects of}} vegetation type, prey <b>distribution,</b> <b>cover</b> density, previous experience, and time and energy budgets upon the predators 2 ̆ 7 choice of hunting methods and hunting sites. Both hawks hunted actively throughout the day (0600 to 2100 hours MDT). Male 1 (1974) and Male 2 (1975) captured an average of 8. 7 ± 2. 0 and 9. 0 ± 1. 5 prey items per day, respectively, during the 4 -wk observation period in each year. The hawks hunted by four distinguishable methods: (1) from a perch, (2) from the ground, (3) from low-altitude (active) flight, and (4) from high-altitude (soaring) flight. The birds made a total of 808 observed strikes and were successful in securing prey in 129 (16. 6 percent) of those strikes. Success rate (successful strikes/total attempted strikes) varied significantly with hunting method. The hawks were selective {{in their use of}} vegetation types for hunting. Both birds used the 2 ̆ 2 bare ground 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 pasture 2 ̆ 2 types more than expected by chance. Male 2 also over-used the 2 ̆ 2 alfalfa 2 ̆ 2 type. Both hawks significantly under-used the 2 ̆ 2 grass-shrub, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 grass or grain, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 old field, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 juniper, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 rush-grass 2 ̆ 2 cover types. The differences in use of vegetation types could not be related to differences in prey biomass. The birds were selective in their use of areas which differed in density of vegetative cover. Areas with no cover were used by both hawks more than expected by chance; all other areas were under-used with the single exception of 2 ̆ 2 dense 2 ̆ 2 cover in 1975. Previous experience was important to the birds 2 ̆ 7 choice of hunting sites and hunting methods. Each hawk returned directly to the site of its last prey capture on more than half of its hunting forays. Similarly, each hawk tended to initiate a new hunting effort by using the hunting method that had been successful on its previous hunt. In 1975, Male 2 switched its emphasis to a new major hunting area during the fourth week of observation. The apparent reason for the switch was a decline in success at the first hunting area due to the growth of vegetation which concealed prey. Males 1 and 2 averaged 0. 94 ± 0. 43 and 1. 27 ± 0. 55 prey captures per hour of hunting time, respectively. Capture rates (captures/time) varied with hunting method. The amount of time a hawk spent hunting by each method was not related to its capture rate by that method. However, each bird 2 ̆ 7 s total use of sit-and-wait hunting (from a perch or from the ground) and of hunting from low-altitude flight was proportional to {{estimates of the number of}} captures per unit of energetic cost for those methods. Both hawks hunted from high-altitude flight more than expected on the basis of their catch/cost ratios for that technique. This suggests that soaring was not exclusively a hunting technique, but that it had some additional purpose unrelated to food gathering. There was some evidence that the hawks used major hunting sites which provided high benefit/cost ratios relative to the rest of their foraging ranges. Both hawks foraged efficiently by concentrating more of their foraging time on the hunting method and in the hunting sites which yielded the highest number of prey captures per unit of energy ex-pended. The birds 2 ̆ 7 use of secondary hunting areas may have contributed to their long-term foraging efficiency by informing them of changes in the foraging potential of different portions of their home ranges. Such flexible foraging patterns may be critical to the survival of predators which rely on highly variable small-mammal populations...|$|E
