30|$|In an experiment, {{operators}} controlled {{a mobile}} robot by steering to trace reference lines. However, in our construction machine, operators {{control on the}} basis of a work plan without a detailed reference trajectory. Operators have common actions, e.g., excavation and manipulation of a <b>hoist</b> <b>arm.</b> Operators change these actions according to the work target, habitual actions, and work progress. In particular, in teleoperation, it is difficult for operators to control the tip of a construction machine in three-dimensional space without perspective.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The rear {{multi-stage}} cylinder direct-acting hydraulic body hoist {{mechanism is}} widely used in mining dump truck. The working principle of the body hoist mechanism is introduced. The dumping process is simplified through the introduction of “dumping line ” and the variation of ore mass and hoist torque are analyzed. The optimization design {{of the position of}} body hoist mechanism is done using Maple software on the basis of direct search method aimed at minimizing the initial hoist force and the stroke of cylinder and maximizing the <b>hoist</b> force <b>arm</b> when the second stage cylinder starts to stretch out...|$|R

At center, two men stand near two narrow palates, {{watching}} a crane <b>arm</b> <b>hoist</b> {{a stack of}} boxes full of Sil-O-Cel insulation brick. In the background, a large ship can be seen, {{the first in a}} line of several that extend backward into the left distance. Writing on the boxes reads "This side up. Handle with care. Use no hooks". The bricks were manufactured by the Johns Manville Corporation...|$|R
5000|$|For {{a jacket}} without a front strap, {{the most common}} way to escape is to <b>hoist</b> the <b>arms</b> over the head before undoing the crotch strap and at last the strap {{at the back of}} the neck. This allows the jacket to simply be peeled off upward over the head. The straitjacket escape was popularized by Houdini, who [...] "discovered" [...] it. Houdini first did it behind a curtain, forcing the {{audience}} to listen to thumps while watching a billowing curtain for many minutes. He found the trick went over better when the audience could see his struggles. In a few of his later and more popular acts, he performed the straitjacket escape while hung upside down from a crane, and also did the same when placed in a sealed milk can which was filled. Houdini's (and many other illusionists) acts shown the straitijacket in action, many ways possible.|$|R
50|$|In March 2017 Frisch's {{unveiled}} a restyled statue. The new statue resembles the original West Coast design with black pompadour hair and Big Boy hamburger <b>hoisted</b> atop one <b>arm.</b> The checkered outfit, however, is replaced with striped overalls including slingshot as {{used on the}} original East Coast Big Boy. Now displaying a healthy torso, the Big Boy's black and white saddle shoes are replaced with cap toed sneakers. The debut statue (wearing a Cincinnati Reds uniform) is placed at the Great American Ball Park; another is planned for an unnamed Frisch's restaurant. Frisch's will then swap the new statues for existing restaurant statues in need of repair.|$|R
40|$|An {{electrically}} detonated downhole seismic gun (EDG) {{that will}} fire blank 8 -guage shells underwater has been constructed and tested to 80 m depth (hydrostatic pressures of 130 psi or 8. 9 x 105 Pa). Although other engineering seismic guns which fire blank or projectile sources are available, {{they are for}} near-surface shots and {{are not meant to}} be used for downhold seismic surveys in water-filled boreholes. The EDG was designed primarily for checkshot surveys (well travel-time surveys) and high-quality reflection/refraction tests, but potential applications include shallow vertical seismic profiling and borehole to borehole or borehole to surface tomography, as well as optimum offset and common midpoint seismic reflection surveys. The EDG consists off four steel subassemblies: (1) chamber; (2) breech; (3) pipe; and (4) hanger. A blank 8 -gauge electrical shell is held by the chamber and is detonated by an electrode located inside the breech. O-ring seals prevent water from entering the breech and causing short circuits. The breech is screwed into a pipe which is also fitted with o-ring seals to keep the internal wiring dry. A hanger subassembly provides a convenient attaching point for the <b>hoist</b> cable. <b>Arming</b> of the EDG with an explosives blaster occurs only after lowering to operating depth. The EDG has been tested with various size black powder loads up to 750 grains. Frequency bandwidth and repeatability tests were carried out under saturated conditions in a fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary section. These preliminary tests show significant frequency content in the 25 - 200 Hz band (peak near 100 Hz) for reflections from depths of 150 - 300 m, and acceptable waveform repeatability for different shot records obtained with identical geometry and acquisition parameters...|$|R
60|$|Momentarily stunned, Gahan's fingers {{slipped from}} their hold upon the cordage {{and the man}} shot {{downward}} through the thin air of dying Mars toward the ground three thousand feet beneath, while upon {{the deck of the}} rolling Vanator his faithful warriors clung to their lashings all unconscious of the fate of their beloved leader; nor was it until more than an hour later, after the storm had materially subsided, that they realized he was lost, or knew the self-sacrificing heroism of the act that had sealed his doom. The Vanator now rested upon an even keel as she was carried along by a strong, though steady, wind. The warriors had cast off their deck lashings and the officers were taking account of losses and damage when a weak cry was heard from oversides, attracting their attention to the man hanging in the cordage beneath the keel. Strong <b>arms</b> <b>hoisted</b> him to the deck and then it was that the crew of the Vanator learned of the heroism of their jed and his end. How far they had traveled since his loss they could only vaguely guess, nor could they return in search of him in the disabled condition of the ship. It was a saddened company that drifted onward through the air toward whatever destination Fate was to choose for them.|$|R
2500|$|On 16/26 October William boarded his ship, the Den Briel (Brill in English). His {{standard}} was <b>hoisted,</b> displaying the <b>arms</b> of Nassau quartered {{with those of}} England. The words [...] ("For Liberty and [...] Religion"), the slogan of William's ancestor William the Silent while leading the Dutch Revolt against Catholic Spain, were shown next to the House of Orange's motto, [...] ("Iwill maintain"). William's fleet, which with about 40,000men aboard was roughly {{twice the size of}} the Spanish Armada – and assembled in a tenth of the time – consisted of 463ships. Among these were 49warships of more than twenty cannon (eight could count as third rates of 60–68cannon, nine were frigates), 28galliots, ninefireships, 76fluyts to carry the soldiers, 120 small transports to carry fivethousand horses, about seventy supply vessels and sixty fishing vessels serving as landing craft. Most of the warships had been provided by the Admiralty of Amsterdam. On 19/29 October William's fleet departed from Hellevoetsluis. The fleet was approximately halfway between the Republic and England when the wind changed to the northwest and a gale scattered the fleet, with the Brill returning to Hellevoetsluis on 21/31 October. Despite suffering from sea-sickness William refused to go ashore and the fleet reassembled, having lost only one ship that grounded, though about a thousand crippled horses had been thrown into the sea. Press reports were released that deliberately exaggerated the damage and claimed the expedition would be postponed till the spring. English naval command now considered to try blockading Hellevoetsluis but decided against it because it was feared that the English fleet would founder on the Dutch coast, a dangerous lee shore for a blocking force, by the stormy weather.|$|R
