5|$|In late September, the Italian fleet, {{including}} <b>Fiume,</b> made a sweep for a British troop convoy from Alexandria to Malta, {{but it made}} {{no contact}} with the British ships. <b>Fiume</b> was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier strike on Taranto {{on the night of}} 1112 November, but she was not attacked in the raid. Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the next day, in an engagement that lasted for about an hour. Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance. The British heavy cruiser HMS Berwick was hit twice by 203mm rounds during the engagement, either fired by <b>Fiume</b> or her sister Pola.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1916, Ganz Danubius of <b>Fiume</b> {{received}} {{authorization to}} build two boats of the class, U-50 and U-51. These first two boats, which comprised {{one-third of the}} six ocean-going submarines under construction in 1916, were followed by orders for U-56 and U-57 in September 1918.|$|E
5|$|U-32 {{was built}} by Danubius at <b>Fiume</b> and {{launched}} on 11 May 1917. The boat was commissioned on 29 June 1917. U-32 hit five ships of , sinking four and damaging one. At Pola at war's end, the boat was handed over to Italy and scrapped in 1920.|$|E

50|$|However, both German and Italian {{documents}} show that Palatucci {{was arrested for}} treason and for having transmitted to Britain official documents requesting negotiations for <b>Fiume’s</b> post-war status under Italian aegis.|$|R
5|$|The Havmanden {{class was}} {{a class of}} six {{submarines}} built for the Royal Danish Navy from 1911 to 1914. Also later known as the A class, the boats were designed by the Austro-Hungarian firm Whitehead & Co. of <b>Fiume.</b> The first three submarines were built by the company, while the remaining three were constructed under license in Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|The Monarch-class {{ships were}} ordered in May 1892 with Budapest and Wien {{to be built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. Both ships were laid down on 16 February 1893, the first ships in the class to be laid down. Budapest was launched on 27 April 1896 by Countess Marie Széchényí-Andrássy, wife of the Governor of <b>Fiume,</b> and commissioned on 12 May 1898.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} public film display in Somalia were Italian newsreels of key events {{during the colonial}} period in Italian Somaliland. Examples of such works include Somalia: Gheledi (1913), Somalia italiana (1913), Somalia: Le bellezze del <b>fiume</b> Nebi (1913), Sotto la Croce del Sud - Somalia Italiana (1926), Visioni della Somalia italiana (1929) and Viaggio di S.M. il Re in Somalia (novembre-dicembre 1934) (1934).|$|E

50|$|In 1975, the Calabrian {{village of}} Fiumefreddo Bruzio {{accepted}} Salvatore <b>Fiume's</b> proposal to beautify the historical centre {{with some of}} his works for free. Between 1975 and 1976, the artist painted several walls of the ancient tumble-down castle, and, in 1977, the cupola of the San Rocco chapel. In the 1990s he erected a bronze sculpture in each of the squares of Fiumefreddo with a panoramic view of the sea.|$|R
5|$|U-22 {{was one of}} two boats of {{the class}} to be built at the Hungarian UBAG yard in <b>Fiume.</b> Due to demands by the Hungarian government, {{subcontracts}} for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, and this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design, resulting in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general.|$|E
5|$|U-30 {{was built}} by Danubius at <b>Fiume,</b> {{launched}} on 27 December 1916, and commissioned on 17 February 1917. The boat, {{under the command of}} Linienschiffsleutnant Friedrich Fähndrich, sailed from Cattaro on 31 March 1917 and was never heard from again. U-30 sank no ships during her brief career.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of <b>Fiume.</b> That {{marked the beginning of}} the port's decline, as it lost a large portion of its major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or road links to the rest of the country, further adding to the already obvious economic decline.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{alleged that the}} killings {{were part of a}} purge aimed at {{eliminating}} potential enemies of communist Yugoslav rule, which would have included members of German and Italian fascist units, Italian officers and civil servants, parts of the Italian elite who opposed both communism and fascism (including the leadership of Italian anti-fascist partisan organizations and the leaders of <b>Fiume's</b> Autonomist Party, including Mario Blasich and Nevio Skull), Slovenian and Croatian anti-communists, collaborators and radical nationalists.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 he {{was already}} working on a cycle of ten large paintings, {{commissioned}} by the industrialist Bruno Buitoni, Sr., entitled Le avventure, le sventure e le glorie dell'antica Perugia, which he finished in 1952; <b>Fiume's</b> interest in Renaissance painting, particularly in Piero della Francesca and Paolo Uccello can be inferred from these works. In 1953, the New York magazines Life and Time commissioned him to do some works depicting an imaginary story of Manhattan and New York Bay, envisioned by the painter as statue islands.|$|R
5000|$|Kádár {{was born}} out of wedlock as János József Czermanik as the son of the soldier János Krezinger and Borbála Czermanik. Krezinger came from a peasant family in a remote village (Pusztaszemes) in Western Hungary. While his surname {{suggests}} his father had German origins, Kádár was [...] "Hungarian by language and culture". During his military service his father met with Borbála. She was born in Ógyalla (today: Hurbanovo, Slovakia) to a landless Slovak father and Hungarian mother. The story however on how they met is unknown. Abandoned, Borbála gave birth to János in <b>Fiume's</b> Santo Spirito Hospital on 26 May 1912. Having given birth {{in the middle of the}} holiday season, no one wanted to employ a single mother with a child. His mother, Borbála went to look for Krezinger, but his family wanted nothing to do with them. She walked ten kilometres to the city of Kapoly, she was able to persuade a family by the name of Bálint to care for her child. For this however, they wanted pay. In the meantime Borbála looked for work in the nation's capital, Budapest.|$|R
5|$|Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet {{was largely}} {{obsolete}} at {{the outbreak of}} World War I, and over {{the first two years}} of the war the Austro-Hungarian Navy focused its efforts on building a U-boat fleet for local defense within the Adriatic. Beginning in 1916, the Navy began building larger, ocean-going vessels for operation in the wider Mediterranean, outside the Adriatic. With six of the larger submarines under construction, the Navy considered either building German Type UB III submarines under license or implementing the Type 1916 S 1 design submitted by Ungarische Unterseebotsbau AG (UBAG) of <b>Fiume.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 21 September 1923, {{the ship}} transported to Taranto {{the bodies of}} the members of the Boundary Commission killed on Corfu on 27 August (their deaths sparked the Corfu incident). On 1 October, San Marco ferried the last {{occupation}} troops from Corfu to Brindisi. On 16 March 1924, she saluted King Victor Emmanuel III when he arrived in <b>Fiume</b> to attend the ceremony commemorating the city's annexation by Italy. San Marco escorted Crown Prince Umberto, travelling aboard San Giorgio, during his South American tour in July–September 1924.|$|E
5|$|R 187 had {{maintained}} radio silence and sailed east to evade detection. It linked {{up with the}} convoy sailing from Šibenik at approximately 23:45, and proceeded to escort it north. The combat engineer landing craft reached Kraljevica, except for two which made port in Senj due to poor weather conditions. The rest of the convoy reached <b>Fiume</b> on 2 November. The Royal Navy destroyers sailed back to Ist with empty magazines.|$|E
50|$|After {{graduating in}} International Law at Naples University, attends {{cinematography}} class at Centro sperimentale di cinematografia (Experimental film centre or Italian National film school), in Rome. His career as photographer starts in 1993: in 1999 Studio d’Arte Memoli in Milan publishes the first catalogue of his photographic collected works. The debut as professional cinematographer is in 2003 with Maurizio <b>Fiume's</b> full feature E io ti seguo (I will follow you), selected at Montreal World Film Festival. Amongst {{the other major}} credits since 2003, the collaboration with the Italian film director Vincenzo Marra, with three documentaries (Pasaggio a Sud, L’udienza è aperta, Il grande progetto) and the 2004 fictional full feature movie Vento di terra (Earth Wind), awarded at 61st Venice Film Festival by Fipresci as most innovative movie. Amura’s cinematography of Vento di Terra has been awarded with Giuseppe Rotunno award. With film director Paolo Sorrentino, Amura works at the TV version of Eduardo De Filippo’s drama Sabato, domenica e lunedì, the short movie La notte lunga and the documentary La primavera del 2002. L’Italia protesta. L’Italia si ferma. In 2004 Amura works with Luca Guadagnino at Cuoco contadino (Farmer chef), and the following year for the full feature movie Melissa P. In 2005 he works at Nessun messaggio in segreteria by Paolo Genovese and Luca Miniero. With Luca Miniero Amura also shoot several advertising spots. In 2007 he works at Saverio Costanzo’s movie In memoria di me (in memory of me), for whose cinematography Amura is once again awarded with Giuseppe Rotunno award, and nominated for Ciak d’oro award. In 2010 Amura works on Sabina Guzzanti’s documentary Draquila, Alessandro Aronadio’s Due vite per caso (One life, maybe two), and Paola Randi’s Into paradiso. The list of collaboration with Italian film directors also includes Nina Di Maio, Volfango De Biasi, Serafino Murri.As a film director in 2003 Amura shot Racconto di guerra (A War’s tale), a short movie set in Sarajevo during the Balkan war. The short movie has been awarded with David di Donatello for best short movie in 2003 and Ciak d'oro for best short movie in 2004.Since 2007 Amura is working at a photographic live-performance project, StopEmotion, now developed by Emoticron s.r.l. as a special software to live-edit real time videos from sequences of pictures played on music. In November 2014 Amura founded and became CCO of Emoticron s.r.l., an innovative startup based in Naples, Italy. Its mission is simplifying and reinventing photo/video sharing through a software enabling users to ‘play images as music notes’, live-recording and editing sequences of pre-selected pictures on a chosen musical score. Since then, Emoticron has developed and patent-pending a web application and mobile app, StopEmotion.|$|R
5|$|Starting in November 1918, Andrea Doria {{was based}} in Taranto. On 10 November, she was sent to Corfu, where she {{remained}} until 19 February 1919. She then returned to Taranto, before proceeding to Constantinople in July, departing on the 4th and arriving on the 9th of the month. She joined an Allied fleet {{in the city and}} remained there until 9 November, when she returned again to Taranto. In 1920, most of the Italian fleet was temporarily demobilized to provide crews to bring ex-German warships that had been awarded to Italy under the Treaty of Versailles; Andrea Doria was the only battleship to remain operational during the period. In November, the Treaty of Rapallo was signed with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Andrea Doria was sent to remove the rebellious forces of Gabriele d'Annunzio from <b>Fiume</b> that month. On 24 December, she joined the attack on <b>Fiume,</b> and two days later fired three salvos from her 76mm guns at the destroyer , which had rebelled and joined d'Annunzio. Andrea Dorias gunfire badly damaged Espero. Andrea Doria also shelled d'Annunzio's headquarters and wounded him; he surrendered on 31 December.|$|E
5|$|Szent István, {{built at}} <b>Fiume,</b> {{differed}} from her half-sisters mainly in her machinery. She only had two shafts and two turbines, unlike the four shaft {{arrangement of the}} other ships of her class. External differences included a platform built around the fore funnel which extended from the bridge to the after funnel and on which several searchlights were installed. A further distinguishing feature was the modified ventilator trunk {{in front of the}} mainmast. She was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with torpedo nets.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 1 November 1944 {{also known}} as the Ambush off Pag Island was a naval {{engagement}} in the Kvarner Gulf of the Adriatic Sea, between the islands of Pag and Lussino (present-day Lošinj) on 1 November 1944. It was fought between a British Royal Navy destroyer flotilla and a Kriegsmarine force of two corvettes and a destroyer. The German flotilla was deployed to escort a convoy retreating from Šibenik to <b>Fiume</b> (present-day Rijeka). The British managed to destroy all three German ships in return for no loss.|$|E
5|$|The U-5 {{class was}} built to the same design as the C class for the US Navy and was built by Robert Whitehead's firm of Whitehead & Co. under license from Holland and his company, Electric Boat. Components {{for the first two}} Austrian boats were {{manufactured}} by the Electric Boat Company and assembled at <b>Fiume,</b> while the third boat was a speculative private venture by Whitehead that failed to find a buyer and was purchased by Austria-Hungary upon the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} planned boats is {{reported}} by Conway's as 35, numbered from U-107 to U-141. The book, however, provides no {{explanation of the}} apparent overlap of U-118 through U-120, which are also reported as assigned to three s. Regardless of the number planned, Conway's reports only four boats had any sort of construction activity. U-107 and U-108 were laid down by Ganz Danubius in <b>Fiume</b> in March and May 1918.|$|E
5|$|Thetis {{was ordered}} in May 1911 from Whitehead & Co. in <b>Fiume.</b> She was {{launched}} on 19 June 1912. She initially received the pennant number of T 1, but was assigned the number 4 in April 1913. Thetis was designated A 4 when the class {{became known as}} the A class later in her career. She and Havmanden were stricken on 26 April 1928, the first two boats of the class to be removed from service.|$|E
5|$|With {{the plans}} purchased, the Austro-Hungarian Navy began the {{intricate}} political negotiations to assign the six boats—to be designated U-27 to U-32—between Austrian and Hungarian firms. Of the initial order of six boats, two were {{allocated to the}} Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) operating out of the Pola Navy Yard, and the balance to the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius in <b>Fiume.</b> The Navy ordered the first six boats of the class on 12 October 1915.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rescue}} of Mussolini and the {{establishment}} of the Italian Social Republic (RSI), in spite of urging by local German officials, Hitler refused to officially annex South Tyrol, instead he decided that the RSI should hold official sovereignty over these territories, and forbade all measures that would give the impression of official annexation of South Tyrol. However, in practice the territory of South Tyrol within the boundaries defined by Germany as Operationszone Alpenvorland that included Trent, Bolzano, and Belluno, were de facto incorporated into Germany's Reichsgau Tirol-Vorarlberg and administered by its Gauleiter Franz Hofer. While the region identified by Germany as Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland that included Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola, <b>Fiume</b> (Rijeka), and Ljubljana were de facto incorporated into Reichsgau Kärnten and administered by its Gauleiter Friedrich Rainer.|$|E
5|$|All four ships {{served with}} the main fleet in the interwar period, where they were {{primarily}} occupied with training exercises and fleet reviews. During the Spanish Civil War, Gorizia evacuated Italian nationals and Pola took part in non-intervention patrols. All four ships supported the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. After Italy joined the wider conflict in 1940, the four ships saw extensive action in the Mediterranean Sea against British forces. The ships {{took part in the}} battles of Calabria and Cape Matapan, and in the latter engagement, Zara, Pola, and <b>Fiume</b> were all sunk in a ferocious night action with three British battleships.|$|E
5|$|At 09:15, {{two more}} ships {{appeared}} on the scene– Mount Temple and Californian, which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty– but by then {{there were no more}} survivors to be rescued. Carpathia had been bound for <b>Fiume,</b> Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), but as she had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after. Carpathia departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.|$|E
5|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, the Navy {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} political situation because the Hungarian government demanded that {{a substantial portion of the}} submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 built at the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 built at the Hungarian UBAG yard at <b>Fiume.</b> The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle also {{despatched}} several officers, including Hoste, {{to operate}} independently. Hoste in Bacchante returned to Apulia and attacked {{a string of}} ports, castles and anchorages, while Captain George Cadogan in HMS Havannah effectively halted the movement of supplies along the northern Italian coast {{in support of the}} approaching Austrian armies. In June, Fremantle himself led his whole squadron against the important port city of <b>Fiume,</b> seizing or burning 90 vessels from the harbour and huge quantities of naval stores after a sharp battle in the city streets. Three months later, Fremantle attacked the city of Trieste, blockading it from the sea, bombarding its defences and landing marines and cannon to join with the besieging Austrian armies and force the city's surrender.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, after {{allowing}} the navies {{of other countries}} to pioneer submarine developments, the Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee (MTK) to produce a submarine design. The January 1905 design developed by the MTK and other designs submitted by the public {{as part of a}} design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. They instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland for a competitive evaluation. The two Holland submarines comprised the U-5 class. The Navy authorized two boats, U-5 and U-6, from Whitehead & Co. of <b>Fiume</b> in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Kearsarge {{returned}} to Bar Harbor, Maine on 26 July, and resumed her position as flagship. On 1 December the ship sailed from New York for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, {{where she was}} present as the United States took formal possession of the Guantanamo Naval Reservation on 10 December. On 26 March 1904 Captain Raymond P. Rodgers assumed command of the ship. Following maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea, Kearsarge left with the North Atlantic Squadron for Lisbon, Portugal, where she met King Carlos I of Portugal on 11 June 1904. Independence Day was celebrated in Phaleron Bay, Greece, with King George I of Greece and his son and daughter-in-law, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg. The squadron visited Corfu, Trieste, and <b>Fiume</b> before returning to Newport, Rhode Island, on 29 August 1904.|$|E
