40|$|The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and {{collaborators}} {{from the}} Johns Hopkins University and the University of New Hampshire are developing for the Polar Science Community a remotely-controlled underwater robotic vehicle {{capable of being}} tele-operated under ice under remote real-time human supervision. The Nereid Under-Ice (Nereid-UI) vehicle will enable exploration and detailed examination of biological and physical environments at glacial ice-tongues and ice-shelf margins, delivering high-definition video in addition to survey data from on board acoustic, chemical, and biological sensors. Preliminary propulsion system testing indicates the vehicle {{will be able to}} attain standoff distances of up to 20 km from an ice-edge boundary, as dictated by the current maximum tether length. The goal of the Nereid-UI system is to provide scientific access to under-ice and ice-margin environments that is presently impractical or infeasible. FIBER-OPTIC TETHER: The heart of the Nereid-UI system is its expendable fiber optic telemetry system. The telemetry system utilizes many of the same components pioneered for the full-ocean depth capable HROV Nereus vehicle, with the addition of continuous fiber status monitoring, and new float-pack and depressor designs that enable single-body deployment. POWER SYSTEM: Nereid-UI is powered by a pressure-tolerant lithium-ion battery system composed of 30 Ah prismatic pouch cells, arranged on a 90 volt bus and capable of delivering 15 kW. The cells are contained in modules of 8 cells, and groups of 9 modules are housed together in oil-filled plastic boxes. The power distribution system uses pressure tolerant components extensively, each of which have been individually qualified to 10 kpsi and operation between - 20 C and 40 C. THRUSTERS: Nereid-UI will employ eight identical WHOI-designed thrusters, each with a <b>frameless</b> <b>motor,</b> oil-filled and individually compensated, and designed for low-speed (500 rpm max) direct drive. We expect an end-to-end propulsive efficiency of between 0. 3 and 0. 4 at a transit speed of 1 m/s based on testing conducted at WHOI. CAMERAS: Video imagery is one of the principal products of Nereid-UI. Two fiber-optic telemetry wavelengths deliver 1. 5 Gb/s uncompressed HDSDI video to the support vessel in real time, supporting a Kongsberg OE 14 - 522 hyperspherical pan and tilt HD camera and several utility cameras. PROJECT STATUS: The first shallow-water vehicle trials are scheduled for September 2013. The trials are designed to test core vehicle systems particularly the power system, main computer and control system, thrusters, video and telemetry system, and to refine camera, lighting and acoustic sensor placement for piloted and closed-loop control, especially as pertains to working near the underside of ice. Remaining vehicle design tasks include finalizing the single-body deployment concept and depressor, populating the scientific sensing suite, and the software development necessary to implement the planned autonomous return strategy. Final design and fabrication for these remaining components of the vehicle system will proceed through fall 2013, with trials under lake ice in early 2014, and potential polar trials beginning in 2014 - 15.

5000|$|Electric Motor: The {{electric}} motor {{is the main}} component of electric thrusters and drives the propeller. Modern underwater thrusters usually use brush-less Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs). In some low quality thrusters brushless D.C. motors are used. The gain is lower price and the penalty is lower efficiency. In most modern designs, <b>frameless</b> PMSM <b>motors</b> (mainly produced by Kollmorgen) are used to reduce the weight and increase the thermal efficiency. This improves the power to weight ratio, but the penalty is higher assembly cost. Danish based Copenhagen Subsea produces electrical ring thrusters, where the power is applied on the perimeter, and the motor components are integrated with a duct.|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} ultra-precision lathe {{designed}} to machine micron-scale features on a large-area roll mold. The lathe can machine rolls up to 600 mm {{in diameter and}} 2, 500 mm in length. All axes use hydrostatic oil bearings to exploit the high-precision, stiffness, and damping characteristics. The headstock spindle and rotary tooling table are driven by <b>frameless</b> direct drive <b>motors,</b> while coreless linear motors are used for the two linear axes. Finite element method modeling reveals {{that the effects of}} structural deformation on the machining accuracy are less than 1 µm. The results of thermal testing show that the maximum temperature rise at the spindle outer surface is approximately 0. 5 °C. Finally, performance evaluations of the error motion, micro-positioning capability, and fine-pitch machining demonstrate that the lathe is capable of producing optical-quality surfaces with micron-scale patterns with feature sizes as small as 20 µm on a large-area roll mold...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, analysis, fabrication, {{and control of}} a rotary-linear axis; this axis is a key subsystem for high speed, 5 -axis machine tools intended for fabricating centimeter-scale parts. The rotary-linear axis is a cylinder driven independently in rotation and translation. This hybridization minimizes machine inertias and thereby maximizes accelerations allowing {{for the production of}} parts with complex surfaces rapidly and accurately. Such parts might include dental restorations, molds, dies, and turbine blades. The hybrid rotary and linear motion provides special challenges for precision actuation and sensing. Our prototype rotary-linear axis consists of a central shaft, 3 / 4 inch (1. 91 cm) in diameter and 15 inches (38. 10 cm) long, supported by two cylindrical air bearings. The axis has one inch (2. 54 cm) of linear travel and unlimited rotary travel. Two <b>frameless</b> permanent magnet <b>motors</b> respectively provide up to 41 N continuous force and 0. 45 N-m continuous torque. The rotary motor is composed of commercially available parts; the tubular linear motor is completely custom-built. The prototype axis achieves a linear acceleration of 3 g's and a rotary acceleration of 1, 300 rad/s 2. With higher power current amplifiers and reduced sensor inertia, we predict the axis could attain peak accelerations of 12 g's and 17, 500 rad/s 2 at low duty cycles. This thesis also examines several concepts for developing a precision rotary-linear sensor that can tolerate axial translation. Our prototype rotary sensor uses two laser interferometers to measure the orientation of a slightly tilted mirror attached to the shaft. A third interferometer measures shaft translation. The rotary axis has a control bandwidth of 40 Hz; the linear axis has a bandwidth of 70 Hz. The rotary-linear axis has 2. 5 nm rms linear positioning noise and 3. 1 prad rms rotary positioning noise. This thesis presents one novel 5 -axis machine topology which uses two rotary-linear axes. The first axis rotates and translates the part. The second axis carries the cutting tool and provides high speed spindle rotation as well as infeed along the axis of rotation. For use as a spindle, precision rotary sensing is not required, and a sensorless control scheme based on motor currents and voltages can be used. by Michael Kevin Leibman. Thesis (Ph. D.)
