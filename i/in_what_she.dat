When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago {{asked if there was}} any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> deemed a more practical way.|$|E
5|$|Buffy {{died at the}} end of {{the fifth}} season ("The Gift"), sacrificing herself in place of her younger sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) in order to save the world. In the first episode of the sixth season, Willow, believing Buffy to be in Hell, used magic to bring her back from the grave. Buffy was in fact at peace, <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thinks was heaven, but she has kept this a secret from her friends. Since her resurrection, Buffy has been lost and without {{inspiration}} to perform her duties as a Slayer. Willow is romantically involved with Tara Maclay (Amber Benson), a powerful but ethical witch. Tara has previously expressed concern at Willow's use of her emergent magical powers for trivial or personal matters. In the preceding episode ("All the Way"), Willow cast a spell to make Tara forget an argument about her abuse of magic. In the same episode, Dawn, who has been stealing from stores, including Anya's magic shop, lies to Buffy and goes on a clandestine and almost deadly date. Left to take care of Dawn after the death of their mother Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland) in the fifth season ("The Body"), Buffy has come to depend more heavily on Giles. Following Dawn's date, Buffy asks Giles to shoulder responsibility for disciplining her, much to his discomfort.|$|E

25|$|After feeling jilted by Bianca {{a second}} time <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{believes}} to be Bianca having chosen Babe as a lover, she enters into a romantic relationship with bad boy Jonathan Lavery. Maggie, unaware when finding Bianca in bed with Babe earlier {{that it was a}} ploy to trap JR into confessing that he framed Jamie, wraps herself deeply into Jonathan's life. It is not long before Jamie goes on the run with Babe, leaving Maggie without a roommate. She has Jonathan move in with her. Everything goes well with Jonathan at first, their relationship seeming to be more about sex in the beginning. Jonathan is even aware of Maggie's sexual confusion and asks her how she could have ever thought she was gay. Maggie says she was wrong. Although Bianca and Maggie share a second kiss together, Maggie stresses to Bianca that she is not a lesbian. Things begin to fall apart for Jonathan and Maggie's romance when she finds him destroying the shirt Bianca wore the night Miranda was born. Jonathan convinces Maggie that the shirt would have provided the evidence needed to prove that the Cambias heir, Ethan, is really a Cambias, and would have resulted in Jonathan's brother, the current heir to the Cambias fortune, Ryan, to lose everything. Maggie covers for him with Bianca.|$|E

He too praised the comedy storylines, particularly the League of Doom plot and the academic decathlon scenes, as: [...] "it's this type of off-topic shenanigans (read: not about fitting in or Rachel Berry becoming a star) that breathes refreshing life into Glee and keeps reminding us how funny and entertaining this series can be." [...] He was less impressed with the benefit concert, which he felt harmed the episode's pacing, and as with Gonzalez, found the nature of Mercedes' storyline repetitive.|$|E
500|$|Lawson met {{journalist}} John Diamond in 1986, {{when they}} were both writing for The Sunday Times. They married in Venice in 1992, and have a daughter, Cosima, and a son, Bruno. Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, [...] "How proud I am of you and what you have become. The great thing about us is that we have made us who we are." [...] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; [...] "I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral.

She was raised <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> describes as a [...] "conventional" [...] home, with [...] "the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table." [...] Her elementary school was down the street. They enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides. She played piano, learning from her great-aunt who was a piano teacher. The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church. They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan. She and her 21-month older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.|$|E
500|$|In October 1868 Cosima {{asked her}} husband for a divorce, to which he would not {{initially}} agree. To sceptical enquirers he explained her absence from the von Bülow family home by a supposed visit to her half-sister in Versailles. In June 1869, immediately {{after the birth of}} her and Wagner's third and final child, Siegfried, Cosima wrote to von Bülow <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> called a [...] "final attempt at an understanding". His reply was conciliatory; he wrote: [...] "You have preferred to consecrate the treasures of your heart and mind to a higher being: far from censuring you for this step, I approve of it". Legal processes extended the marriage until 18 July 1870, when the divorce was finally sanctioned by a Berlin court. After the divorce von Bülow distanced himself from both Wagner and Cosima; he never again spoke to Wagner, and 11 years passed before his next meeting with Cosima.|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2008 World Championships in Östersund, Sweden, Neuner {{tried to}} lower expectations, stating a repeat of last year's {{performance}} would be impossible. She failed to defend her titles in the sprint and pursuit races, with shooting errors preventing better results; she finished 17th and sixth respectively. [...] On 12 February 2008, she won the mixed relay with Sabrina Buchholz, Andreas Birnbacher and Michael Greis to claim her first gold medal. Four days later, she won her second title in the mass start, beating Norway's Tora Berger by 3.0seconds. She had four shooting errors compared to Berger's one and skied {{side by side with}} the Norwegian for most of the last lap, <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> later described as her hardest fought victory ever. [...] Alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm, Neuner also claimed gold in the relay race on 17 February 2008. By winning three more titles, she became the youngest six-time world champion, solidifying her status as Germany's biggest biathlon star.|$|E

500|$|In December 1963 Keeler {{admitted}} her perjury at Gordon's June trial, {{and subsequently}} served {{six months in}} prison. [...] Since then, after two brief failed marriages which produced two children, she has largely lived alone. [...] Most of the considerable amount she made from newspaper stories was dissipated by lawyers; during the 1970s, she said, [...] "I was not living, I was surviving." [...] She has published several inconsistent accounts of her life, in which Ward has been variously represented as a [...] "gentleman", her truest love, a Soviet spy, and a traitor ranking alongside Philby, Burgess and Maclean. She has also claimed that Profumo impregnated her and that she subsequently underwent a painful abortion. Her portrait, by Ward, was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 1984. Rice-Davies enjoyed a more successful post-scandal career, as nightclub owner, businesswoman, minor actress and novelist. She was married three times, <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> described as her [...] "slow descent into respectability".

500|$|English-Tamil {{musician}} M.I.A. (Mathangi [...] "Maya" [...] Arulpragasam) {{released her}} second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified {{gold in the}} United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of {{the work on the}} album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> called a [...] "commune environment", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, [...] "he simply makes good music". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track [...] "Meds and Feds" [...] prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.|$|E
500|$|For the HBO {{television}} film Wit (2001), however, Thompson happily {{took the lead}} role <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> felt was [...] "one of the best scripts to {{have come out of}} America". Adapted from Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play, it focusses on a self-sufficient Harvard University professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Thompson was instrumental in bringing Mike Nichols to direct the project, and the pair spent months in rehearsal to get the complex character right. [...] She was greatly drawn to the [...] "daredevil" [...] role, for which she had no qualms about shaving her head. Reviewing the performance, Roger Ebert was touched by [...] "the way she struggles with every ounce of her humanity to keep her self-respect", and in 2008 he called it Thompson's finest work. Caryn James of The New York Times also described it as [...] "one of her most brilliant performances", adding [...] "we seem to be peering into a soul as embattled as its body." [...] The film earned Thompson nominations at the Golden Globes, Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards.|$|E

That year, she starred in Mark Robson's war picture Lost Command for Columbia Pictures opposite Anthony Quinn, Alain Delon, and George Segal. Quinn expressed his love of working with Cardinale, stating that although he adored Cardinale and Loren equally, [...] "I relate easier to Claudia, Sophia creates an impression of something larger than life, something unobtainable. But Claudia – she's not easy, still she's within reach". She also played a Mexican marquessa in Richard Brooks' Western The Professionals, uniting her on screen once again with Burt Lancaster <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> [...] considered to be her best American film. The following year, she appeared in Una rosa per tutti (A Rose for Everyone) and in Alexander Mackendrick's sex farce Don't Make Waves opposite Tony Curtis. Although occasional funny moments were noted, Don't Make Waves was generally panned by the critics {{and the lack of}} chemistry with co-star Curtis was highlighted.

500|$|Although Boston {{suggested}} that Gibbons's rating [...] {{in the academic}} English Literature world ought to be high, her literary status is indeterminate. She did not promote herself, and was indifferent to the attractions of public life: [...] "I'm not shy", she told Oliver, [...] "I'm just unsociable". [...] Truss records that Gibbons had [...] "overtly rejected the literary world... she didn't move in literary circles, or even visit literary squares, or love in literary triangles". Truss [...] posits further reasons why Gibbons did not become a [...] literary canon. Because {{she was a woman}} who wrote amusingly, she was classified as [...] "middlebrow"; furthermore, she was published by Longmans, a non-literary publisher. Her lampooning of the literary establishment in the spoof dedication of [...] Cold Comfort Farm to one [...] "Anthony Pookworthy" [...] did not amuse that establishment, who were further offended by the book's mockery of the writing of such canonical figures as Lawrence and Hardy—hence Virginia Woolf's reaction to the Prix Étranger award. Her belief <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> called [...] "the gentle powers (Pity, Affection, Time, Beauty, Laughter)" [...] also flew {{in the face of a}} disillusioned modernism.|$|E

Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, [...] "I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist {{in the here and now}} and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" [...] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. [...] "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," [...] she writes. [...] "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." [...] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls [...] "the real world" [...] by [...] "the maps of pacifism and feminism".|$|E
