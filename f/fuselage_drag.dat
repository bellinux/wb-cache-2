40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of a new methodology to predict fuselage aerodynamic drag through CFD aerodynamic calculations. The investigation has been focused on typical large turboprop fuselage geometry. The geometry has been divided into three main components: nose, cabin, and fuselage tail.

40|$|International audienceA {{comprehensive}} experimental {{investigation of}} helicopter blunt <b>fuselage</b> <b>drag</b> reduction using active flow control is {{being carried out}} within the Clean Sky project. The objective is to demonstrate the capability of several active technologies to decrease <b>fuselage</b> <b>drag</b> by alleviating the flow separation occurring in the backdoor area of some helicopters (with pronounced ramp for backdoor loading). The work is performed on a simplified blunt fuselage at model scale. Several active flow control actuators are considered for evaluation: steady blowing, unsteady blowing (or pulsed jets), and zero-net-massflux blowing (or synthetic jets). Laboratory tests of each individual actuator are first performed to assess their performance and properties. The fuselage model is then equipped with these actuators distributed in eight slots forming a U-shape on the fuselage backdoor. This paper addresses the promising results obtained during the wind tunnel campaign, since significant drag reductions are achieved {{for a wide range}} of fuselage angles of attack. Moreover, a flow control strategy depending on the fuselage attitude is proposed. The link between the best actuation scheme for this attitude and the corresponding flow topology of the backdoor separation is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{turnaround}} time and increasing passenger comfort are requirements {{that should be}} tackled for medium range flights. Reducing {{turnaround time}} could be achieved by increasing the fuselage aisle width and increasing passenger comfort by increasing the space allocated to carry-on luggage.

Thus, to what extend can the turnaround time be reduced and passenger comfort be enhanced by conventional and novel fuselages? What would be the opportunities offered by a Prandtl Plane configuration on the reduction of turnaround time and enhancement of passenger comfort? A parametric fuselage model is extended and used to answer this question.

In {{the first half of this}} task, emphasis is placed on the US generic fuselage, the ROBIN-mod 7, with the experimental work being conducted on the US side and complementary US and French CFD analysis of the baseline and controlled cases. Fuselage simulations were made using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes ow solvers and with multiple turbulence models. Comparisons were made to experimental data for numerical simulations of the isolated fuselage and for the fuselage as installed in the tunnel, which includes modeling of the tunnel contraction, walls, and support fairing. The numerical simulations show that comparisons to the experimental data are in good agreement when the tunnel and model support are included. The isolated fuselage simulations compare well to each other, however, there is a positive shift in the centerline pressure when compared to the experiment. The computed flow separation locations on the rear ramp region had only slight differences with and without the tunnel walls and model support. For the simulations, the flow control slots were placed at several locations around the flow separation lines as a series of eight slots that formed a nearly continuous U-shape. Results from the numerical simulations resulted in an estimated 35 % <b>fuselage</b> <b>drag</b> reduction from a steady blowing flow control configuration and a 26 % drag reduction for unsteady zero-net-mass flow control configuration.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of unsteady zero-net-mass-flux jets for <b>fuselage</b> <b>drag</b> reduction was evaluated numerically on a generic rotorcraft fuselage in forward flight with a rotor. Previous efforts have shown significant <b>fuselage</b> <b>drag</b> reduction using flow control for an isolated fuselage by experiment and numerical simulation. This work will evaluate a flow control strategy, that was originally developed on an isolated fuselage, {{in a more}} relevant environment that includes {{the effects of a}} rotor. Evaluation of different slot heights and jet velocity ratios were performed. Direct comparisons between an isolated fuselage and rotor/fuselage simulations were made showing similar flow control performance at a - 3 deg fuselage angle-of-attack condition. However, {{this was not the case}} for a - 5 deg angle-of-attack condition where the performance between the isolated fuselage and rotor/fuselage were different. The fuselage flow control resulted in a 17 % drag reduction for a peak C(sub mu) of 0. 0069 in a forward flight simulation where mu = 0 : 35 and CT/sigma = 0 : 08. The CFD flow control results also predicted a favorable 22 % reduction of the fuselage download at this same condition, which can have beneficial compounding effects on the overall performance of the vehicle. This numerical investigation was performed in order to provide guidance for a future 1 / 3 scale wind tunnel experiment to be performed at the NASA 14 -by 22 -Foot Subsonic Tunnel...|$|E

In addition, trim characteristics cannot be determined with a model with a truncated fuselage. The stability and control tests were conducted with a model (model 20) having a flared aftbody. This type aftbody was needed in order to provide additional clearance between the base of the model and the sting.

The experiments were {{conducted at the}} Kazan National Research Technical University (Kazan Aviation Institute) T- 1 K wind tunnel, investigating four versions of a fuselage similar to the Ansat helicopter. It was found that, for the range of pitch angles − 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg− 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg, the skids added 80 % to the drag of the bare fuselage, whereas the tailplane increased the drag by 20 %.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{supersonic}} aircraft are liable to possess some trim drag under cruise conditions. Fuselage camber has been suggested as one means of reducing this component of the drag, {{and the purpose of}} this investigation was to obtain quantitative data on the pitching moment increments obtainable from fuselage camber and incidence, and the associated increments in <b>fuselage</b> <b>drag.</b> Lift, drag and moment measurements have been made on a body representative of the fuselage of a supersonic transport aeroplane. The fineness ratio of the body was 15 : 1, the cross-sectional area distribution being of modified Sears-Haack form. Parabolic nose and tail camber was used, the nose and tail portions being made removable so that a variety of different configurations could be tested. The Reynolds number of the tests was 14. 1 x 106 based on the length of the model, and the Mach number was 0. 2. The tests were made with a transition wire attached to the model at 10 % of the length from the nose. A preliminary investigation indicated that the Reynolds number was probably sufficiently large to ensure that the results would give a good guide to the full scale characteristics. The experiments showed that nose camber produces a pitching moment increment in very close agreement with the predictions of inviscid slender body theory. The increments in lift and drag, whilst not zero as predicted by inviscid theory, axe small. Tail camber on the other hand gives rise to much larger lift and drag increments, and the increment in pitching moment is quite different from that predicted by inviscid theory. In the present tests the pitching moment increment due to tail camber amounted to about 10 % of the theoretical value. The scope of the experiment was insufficient to answer the question “What is the optimum fuselage shape for minimum trim drag?" However, the indications are that an uncambered fuselage at incidence will provide a given pitching moment for less drag than any cambered fuselage. This however neglects the interference effects of the wing and tail unit on the fuselage, and of the fuselage on the wing and tail unit. For reasons of (i) tail clearance on take-off and landing, (ii) cockpit layout and view, and (iii) cabin layout, fuselages with camber may be required. Some indication of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>drag</b> penalties likely to be sustained by these modifications of the fuselage are given by the results of this experiment...|$|E
