Sullivan {{simultaneously}} idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son {{feels the same}} about his own father. Rooney's son, Connor, <b>has</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{features}} are sparse or unresolved {{in this part}} of Mercury. The Kuiper quadrangle apparently <b>has</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the scarps that occur elsewhere on the planet that have been interpreted as high-angle reverse faults. The most prominent structures are the rings associated with some large craters or basins, faults that transect crater floors, and lobate scarps and ridges in the plains materials. Most of the faults and scarps that transect crater floors clearly delineate crater-filling materials standing at different levels, and in at least two craters (19° S., 31°; 16° N., 30°), the traces of the faults on the crater walls indicate that the faults have normal displacements. A few faults cut intercrater areas and trend generally northwest or northeast (Scott and others, 1976).|$|E
25|$|In Half-Blood Prince, Harry {{is invited}} to {{the first meeting of}} the Slug Club held on the Hogwarts Express. Slughorn sets less-stringent entry {{criteria}} for Advanced Potions than his predecessor, lowering the required grade from a perfect O (Outstanding) to the above-average E (Exceeds Expectations). This last-minute change enables Harry and Ron to take Potions at NEWT level. However, since Harry had not expected to be allowed to join the course, he <b>has</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the necessary materials, and Slughorn lends him an old textbook until Harry can procure his own. Later, Harry does buy a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making from Flourish and Blotts, but switches the covers and gives back the new book. During his first class, Slughorn offers a small amount of Felix Felicis to the student who brews the best cauldron of the Draught of Living Death. Harry wins with the help of handwritten notes in the borrowed textbook, which had once belonged to Snape, unbeknownst to him. When Ron falls victim to a high-strength love potion, Slughorn administers an antidote, but then nearly kills him with a drink of poisoned mead, not knowing that the bottle had been planted by Draco Malfoy in an attempt to kill Dumbledore. Harry later uses the Felix Felicis to help retrieve a memory from Slughorn that details the conversation between the professor and Riddle about Horcruxes as well as the possibility of creating more than one Horcrux.|$|E

500|$|David Williams {{from the}} DVD Movie Guide gave Volume One of the Family Guy a {{positive}} review, {{saying that the}} first season did well in introducing the characters of the series; he ended his review as [...] "If you’re a fan of shows like The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, or Married... with Children and enjoy your humor topical, dry, and with tongue firmly planted in cheek, then Family Guy is right up your alley". Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk said {{at the end of}} his review, [...] "Often brilliant, extremely witty and darkly hilarious, Family Guy was unfortunately cancelled after Fox bumped it around six or seven different time slots. Fans of the show should definitely pick up this terrific sets , while those who haven't seen it should consider giving it a look. Highly recommended". Josh Wolk of Entertainment Weekly gave volume one a B, saying that [...] "Family Guy Volume One: Seasons 1 & 2 rips through edgy gags, TV references, and fantasy sequences (some of which are hilariously inspired), but Fox's other buffoonish family <b>has</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> The Simpsons heart.

500|$|John Kinnaird later {{commented on}} Hazlitt's words terming Iago [...] "an amateur of tragedy in real life", {{pointing}} out that Bradley and others after him developed the idea that Hazlitt saw Iago as an artist in his own right, [...] "a dramatic artist manqué". [...] "But the form Iago's will to 'mischief' takes is not primarily aesthetic or creative but practical and critical. Soldier that he is, he has a 'craving after action {{of the most difficult}} and dangerous kind,' and he <b>has</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the artist's sympathy with pleasure; his 'licentious' bent is always 'saturnine,' and stems from 'a desire of finding out the worst side of every thing, and of proving himself an over-match for appearances' [...] ". David Bromwich later warned against carrying too far the idea that Iago is an artist figure within the play, a representation of Shakespeare himself, as Iago's [...] "genius is [...] the opposite of Shakespeare's. It presents all things in a distorting medium [...] Iago's peculiar genius is" [...] as Hazlitt represented it, [...] "the exuberance of one part of Shakespeare's mind—not an allegorical representation of the whole of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Irene {{has never}} been the most admired of Johnson's works. [...] Even James Boswell found it wanting:Analysed into parts, it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments, fine imagery, and {{beautiful}} language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principle end of the drama. [...] Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnson not only had not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy, but that he had not the sensibility to perceive them. Johnson's friend Bennet Langton recorded the author's own later disenchantment with the piece:At another time, when one was reading his tragedy Irene to a company at a house in the country, he [...] left the room; and somebody having asked him the reason of this, he replied, [...] "Sir, I thought it had been better."' The early 20th century consensus of opinion was summed up by George Sampson in 1941: [...] "Of his early tragedy Irene [...] it is enough to say that its moral dialogues, its correctness of plan and its smoothness of verse do not suffice to give it any rank as drama." [...] T. S. Eliot suggested an explanation for the play's unpopularity and neglect:His verse <b>has</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the dramatic qualities; it is correct, but correctness in such isolation becomes itself a fault. [...] The play would be more readable to-day, if he had written it in rhyme; the whole would be more easily declaimed, and the good things more easily remembered; it would lose none of its excellence of structure, thought, vocabulary and figures of speech. [...] What would be mellifluous in rhyme, is merely monotonous without it.|$|E
500|$|On the film's Rotten Tomatoes listing, 57% {{of critics}} gave the film {{positive}} reviews from {{a total of}} 23 reviews. DVD Authority says [...] "After this one, the other Jaws movies seemed to just not be as good." [...] One review says: [...] "it's obviously not a patch on Spielberg's classic, but it's {{about as good as}} could be hoped for, with some excellent sequences, almost worthy of the original, several genuine shocks, a different enough story and some pretty decent characters." [...] The performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton are particularly praised. George Morris for the Texas Monthly preferred Jaws 2 over the original because it is [...] "less insidious in its methods of manipulation" [...] and [...] "because director Jeannot Szwarc streamlines the terror ... By crosscutting among the teenagers, Scheider, and the officials' efforts to rescue them, Szwarc works up enough suspense to keep the adrenaline going." [...] However, Morris' review is not entirely complimentary. He would have preferred the shark to have been seen less, positing [...] "producers and audiences alike seem to have forgotten that the greatest suspense derives from the unseen and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster." [...] Similarly, John Simon felt that the [...] "shark's waning is caused by a decline in direction: Jeannot Szwarc <b>has</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> Steven Spielberg's manipulative cleverness. For one thing, he allows us close and disarming close-ups of the shark almost immediately..."Simon praises Scheider and Hamilton, but is less complimentary about Gary. A reviewer for the BBC complained that the additional screen time awarded to the shark makes it [...] "seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary". [...] The Radio Times was not pleased with Jaws 2, calling it a [...] "pale imitation of the classic original" [...] and stating that [...] "the suspense comes unglued because the film floats in all-too-familiar waters. You just know how everyone is going to react — from the stars to the director, and even the mechanical shark." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Gosling co-starred in the {{psychological}} thriller Murder by Numbers with Sandra Bullock and Michael Pitt, where Gosling and Pitt portrayed {{a pair of}} high school seniors who believe they can commit the perfect murder. Bullock played the detective tasked with investigating the crime. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described him as [...] "a phenomenal talent even in junk like this" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "strong and [...] "charismatic" [...] young actors were [...] "let down by the screenplay". The film was a minor commercial success, grossing $56 million worldwide from a production budget of $50 million. His second screen appearance of 2002 was in The Slaughter Rule with David Morse which explores the relationship between a high school football player and his troubled coach in rural Montana. Gosling has said that the opportunity to work with Morse made him [...] "a better actor". Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Gosling as [...] "major star material" [...] with a [...] "rawness and an intensity that recall the young Matt Dillon" [...] while Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times was won over by his [...] "raw talent". The film was released in just three US theatres and grossed $13,411. In 2003, Gosling starred in The United States of Leland as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was [...] "emotionally disconnected for the whole film." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the [...] "gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the character comes from a writer's conceits, not from life." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times noted that he [...] "struggles to rescue Leland from the clutches of cliché" [...] while David Rooney of Variety felt that his [...] "one-note, blankly disturbed act <b>has</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in The Believer". The film grossed $343,847 in the United States and was not released overseas.|$|E
