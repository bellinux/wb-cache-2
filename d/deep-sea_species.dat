25|$|Belugas play an {{important}} role in the structure and function of marine resources in the Arctic Ocean, as they are the most abundant toothed whales in the region. They are opportunistic feeders; their feeding habits depend on their locations and the season. For example, when they are in the Beaufort Sea, they mainly eat Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and the stomachs of belugas caught near Greenland were found to contain rose fish (Sebastes marinus), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), while in Alaska their staple diet is Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In general, the diets of these cetaceans consist mainly of fish; apart from those previously mentioned, other fish they feed on include capelin (Mallotus villosus), smelt, sole, flounder, herring, sculpin, and other types of salmon. They also consume a great quantity of invertebrates, apart from shrimp, such as squid, crabs, clams, octopus, sea snails, bristle worms, and other <b>deep-sea</b> <b>species.</b> Animals in captivity eat 2.5% to 3.0% of their body weight per day, which equates to 18.2 to 27.2kg.|$|E
500|$|An older study, {{examining}} whales {{captured by}} the New Zealand whaling fleet in the Cook Strait region, found a 1.69:1 ratio of squid to fish by weight. Sperm whales sometimes take sablefish and toothfish from long lines. Long-line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska complain that sperm whales {{take advantage of their}} fishing operations to eat desirable species straight off the line, sparing the whales the need to hunt. However, the amount of fish taken is very little compared to what the sperm whale needs per day. Video footage has been captured of a large male sperm whale [...] "bouncing" [...] a long line, to gain the fish. Sperm whales are believed to prey on the megamouth shark, a rare and large <b>deep-sea</b> <b>species</b> discovered in the 1970s. In one case, three sperm whales were observed attacking or playing with a megamouth.|$|E
500|$|Each starfish arm {{contains}} two gonads that release gametes through openings called gonoducts, {{located on the}} central disc between the arms. Fertilization is generally external but in a few species, internal fertilization takes place. In most species, the buoyant eggs and sperm are simply released into the water (free spawning) and the resulting embryos and larvae live {{as part of the}} plankton. In others, the eggs may be stuck to the undersides of rocks. In certain species of starfish, the females brood their eggs â€“ either by simply enveloping them or by holding them in specialised structures. Brooding may be done in pockets on the starfish's aboral surface, inside the pyloric stomach (Leptasterias tenera) or even in the interior of the gonads themselves. Those starfish that brood their eggs by [...] "sitting" [...] on them usually assume a humped posture with their discs raised off the substrate. Pteraster militaris broods a few of its young and disperses the remaining eggs, that are too numerous to fit into its pouch. In these brooding species, the eggs are relatively large, and supplied with yolk, and they generally develop directly into miniature starfish without an intervening larval stage. The developing young are called lecithotrophic because they obtain their nutrition from the yolk as opposed to [...] "planktotrophic" [...] larvae that feed in the water column. In Parvulastra parvivipara, an [...] brooder, the young starfish obtain nutrients by eating other eggs and embryos in the brood pouch. Brooding is especially common in polar and <b>deep-sea</b> <b>species</b> that live in environments unfavourable for larval development and in smaller species that produce just a few eggs.|$|E

2500|$|Squat {{lobsters}} feed on {{a variety}} of foods, with some species filter feeding, while others are detritus-feeders, algal grazers, scavengers or predators. Some are highly specialised; Munidopsis andamanica is a <b>deep-sea</b> <b>species</b> that feeds only on sunken wood, including trees washed out to sea and timber from ship wrecks. Squat lobsters are large enough to be caught by top predators, and can thus form a [...] "direct trophic shortcut" [...] between the primary producers {{at the bottom of the}} food web, and the carnivores at the top.|$|E
2500|$|Although what {{first comes}} to mind as the common domain of {{jellyfish}} is living well up off the ocean floor in the plankton, a few species of jellyfish are {{closely associated with the}} bottom for much of their lives (that is, they can be considered benthic). The upside-down jellyfish in the genus Cassiopea typically lie on the bottom of shallow lagoons where they sometimes pulsate gently with their umbrella top facing down. The tiny creeping jellyfish Staurocladia and Eleutheria (see section on Size, above) cannot swim and [...] "walk" [...] around on seaweed fronds or rocky bottoms on their tentacles. Most hydromedusae and scyphomedusae that live in coastal habitats find themselves on the bottom periodically, where they may stop swimming for a while, and certain box jellyfish species also rest on the sea bed in shallow water. Even some <b>deep-sea</b> <b>species</b> of hydromedusae and scyphomedusae are usually collected on or near the bottom. All of the stauromedusae are found attached to either seaweed or rocky or other firm material on the bottom.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cephalothorax}} {{is made of}} 13 body segments (somites), {{although the}} divisions are not obvious and are most easily inferred from the paired appendages. From front to back, these are, the two pairs of antennae, six pairs of mouthparts (mandibles, maxillae, maxillules and three pairs of maxillipeds), five pairs of pereiopods. The cephalothorax {{is covered with a}} thick carapace, which may extend forwards in front of the eyes to form a rostrum; this is highly variable among squat lobsters, being vestigial in Chirostylus, wide and often serrated in some genera, and long, narrow, and flanked with [...] "supraorbital spines" [...] in others. The degree of ornamentation {{on the surface of the}} carapace also varies widely, and there are almost always at least a few setae (bristles), which can be iridescent in some members of the Galatheidae and Munididae. A pair of compound eyes also project on stalks from the front of the carapace; these are made up of ommatidia with square facets, which is typical of the [...] "reflecting superposition" [...] form of eye. Many <b>deep-sea</b> <b>species</b> have reduced eyes, and reduced movement of the eyestalks. In the families Munididae and Galatheidae, there is often a row of setae close to the eyes, forming [...] "eyelashes".|$|E

40|$|Biogeography of deep-sea comatulid crinoids {{is poorly}} {{understood}} owing partly {{to the lack}} of detailed taxonomic studies. Recent cruises off Peru dredged up two new, well-preserved specimens of Thalassometra bispinosa, a <b>deep-sea</b> comatulid <b>species</b> which was heretofore only known from the Southern Ocean. These new records enabled re-evaluation of intra-specific variation for both quantitative and qualitative morphological characters. We thus provide a new description of the species, including these new specimens, and discuss the affinities with closely related species. As a consequence, we re-evaluate the systematic position of material previously assigned to T. bispinosa dredged from the Campbell Plateau, Southern Ocean. Discrete morphological characters, measurements and SEM photographs justify reassignment of these specimens to Thalassometra villosa. This species, another poorly known deep-sea comatulid crinoid previously known only from the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific, is also redescribed. The biogeography of these two <b>deep-sea</b> comatulid <b>species</b> is discussed and hypotheses of their geographical distribution are proposed...|$|R
