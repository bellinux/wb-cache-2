2500|$|In 2007, the BBC {{announced}} {{the cancellation of}} a planned television special Planet Relief, which would have highlighted the global warming issue and included a mass electrical switch-off. The editor of BBC's Newsnight current affairs show said: [...] "It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of people who}} think that, but it must be stopped." [...] Author Mark Lynas said [...] "The only reason why this became an issue {{is that there is a}} small but vociferous group of extreme right-wing climate 'sceptics' lobbying against taking action, so the BBC is behaving like a coward and refusing to take a more consistent stance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich {{has been}} very {{critical}} of Obama's handling {{of the crisis in}} Egypt, and has warned of the possibility that Egypt might [...] "go the way of Iran". Gingrich said, [...] "I think this is a period of tremendous challenge and is a sign of the general failure of our strategy of not dealing with radical Islamists and not being honest and aggressive of what's going on around the world." [...] Gingrich also said that the Obama administration had failed to take the Middle East seriously and that Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo designed to improve relations with the Muslim world was a mistake. Gingrich said, [...] "The president went to Cairo and gave his famous speech in which he explained that we should all be friends together because we're all the same people doing the same things and there are no differences between us. Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lot of differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and the rest of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Moderator," [...] Putney called sharply, {{from his}} place, [...] "this is {{altogether}} unparliamentary. That resolution is properly before the meeting. Its adoption {{has been moved}} and seconded, and it cannot be withdrawn without leave granted {{by a vote of}} the meeting. I wish to discuss the resolution in all its bearings, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> great many present who share with me a desire to know how far it represents the sense of this society. I don't mean as to the supposed personal reflections which it was intended to punish; that is a very small matter, and as compared with the other questions involved, of no consequence whatever." [...] Putney tossed his head with insolent pleasure in his contempt of Gerrish. His nostrils swelled, and he closed his little jaws with a firmness that made his heavy black moustache hang down below the corners of his chin. He went on with a wicked twinkle in his eye, and a look all round to see that people were waiting to take his next point. [...] "I judge my old friend Brother Gerrish by myself. My old friend Gerrish cares no more really about personal allusions than I do. What he really had at heart in offering his resolution was not any supposed attack upon himself or his shop from the pulpit of this church. He cared no more for that than I should care for a reference to my notorious habits. These are things that we feel may be safely left to the judgment, the charitable judgment, of the community, which will be equally merciful to the man who devours widows' houses and to the man who 'puts an enemy in his mouth to steal away his brains.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|I love that! I was so {{stunned when}} I first heard it. I {{thought it was}} wonderful. It's very rare for people to cover my songs. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> couple of reasons. One is they're {{personal}} - they don't have a universal quality to them. And I think maybe it's because I've already sung them, and who wants to compete with that? But it's always flattering when somebody does.|$|E
5000|$|Co-curator of the Whitney Biennial {{containing}} the painting, Mia Locks, said {{in defense of}} the painting's inclusion, [...] "Right now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lot of sensitivities not just to race but to questions of identities in general. We welcome these responses. We invited these conversations intentionally in the way that we thought about the show." [...] She added that the inclusion of the painting in the Whitney show was a way of [...] "not letting Till’s death be forgotten, as Mamie, his mother so wanted." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a January 2013 {{interview}} with Phoenix New Times, Keenan announced {{he is working}} on an autobiography. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lot of misconceptions with some people that, all of a sudden, I was born when my first band came out," [...] Keenan says. [...] "I actually had a life before that, {{and there were a lot}} of accomplishments. book will kind of chronicle why it is I got to where I am, and why I got to where you knew about me.|$|E

5000|$|Bai debated and {{discussed}} {{the book with}} commenters {{on some of the}} major progressive blogs, including Daily Kos and the Huffington Post. In an interview on Daily Kos Bai shrugged off his critics: “A {{lot of people who have}} criticized the book online admit they haven’t actually read it,” he said. “They’re going on what other bloggers have said. That is a little disappointing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> whole lot of smart people who read the blogs who will read the book and make their own judgments.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 16, [...] "I Remember Me" [...] was {{announced}} {{as the first}} single taken from Hudson's second studio album in the UK. Hudson explained in her interview with Digital Spy, [...] "I'm not sure how it happened, but it doesn't matter to me! I love the album so much, and we got so tied up and confused on what to release that it felt better instead to spread the good music out! We're still {{not sure what to}} pick as the next single - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lot of strong contenders!" ...|$|E

You can't throw your voice like that. You can't throw harmony like that. That is a very distinct voice. Her technique is a thread between the really far-out stuff and opera and pop music. It's distinct. It's all her own. Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 2008 {{speech by}} Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Donald Kerr, [...] "Our National Counterproliferation Center {{is trying to}} lead the way in {{developing}} a plan to have a Counterproliferation Reserve Corps. It's really an adjunct to the Intelligence Reserve Corps that we already have, but we're really trying to bring these people back {{in a way that we}} can get another ten years or so out of their accumulated knowledge. It's going to be very important not just in the proliferation area. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of others where we're going to have that same issue." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2011 Wilson was {{replaced}} by Paul Larsen (also with The Celibate Rifles). Dominique Genot of I-94 Bar reviewed the group's live album, Live 2011, which is [...] "as live as you hope to see them (and I did during the 2011 Euro tour). The record was done at the Excelsior Hotel's closing night in Sydney in May, and the thing was quickly mixed by guitarist-keyboardist Brent Williams. The album's got a big sound, with Dave Kettley's guitar high in the ears. My personal criticisms is that Rob Younger's voice is too low in the mix - also <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few cuts between the songs." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cleaver {{has stated}} that there are {{similarities}} between her own personality and Eileen's: [...] "On a soap, you can't come in and create a character that's very far removed from yourself, because it's such a lot of work, so {{of course there are}} elements to Eileen that I've brought in. But I think we're very different. She's more generous than I am quite frankly!" [...] She has added, [...] "I think Eileen is happy. She's a very together person ... She's got a very realistic view ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lot of women who would aspire to be like her, how she holds everything together and juggles her job, the kids and everyone else's problems." ...|$|E

5000|$|At a January 2014 GOP {{forum in}} Montgomery County, Iowa, Ernst warned that Agenda 21, a 1992 United Nations {{voluntary}} action plan for sustainable development, could force Iowa farmers off their land, dictate what cities Iowans must live in, and control how Iowa citizens travel {{from place to}} place. During the general-election campaign, Ernst moderated her tone, saying: [...] "I don’t think that the U.N. Agenda 21 {{is a threat to}} Iowa farmers... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lot of people that follow that issue in Iowa. It may be something that is very important to them, but I think Iowans are very smart and that we have a great legislature here, we have a very intelligent governor, and I think that we will protect Iowans." ...|$|E
5000|$|After leaving school, Davis {{spent three}} years as a freelancer working {{on a variety of}} commissions. In 1933 she spent six months {{studying}} modern techniques and design under Buckminster Fuller at the Dymaxion factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. At the factory, she wrote later, she learned [...] "the principles of good workmanship. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> great many 'artists' but awfully few real craftsmen. Use of tools and neat, fast, strong construction are not taught much in art schools." [...] It was there that she learned how to work with wood, and began experimenting with abstract forms. Her figurative sculptures from the 1930s reflect her interest in the naive art of various folk cultures; for example, [...] "Grotesque Bull" [...] (shown), a terra cotta sculpture which was included in Dorothy Miller's [...] "Americans 1942" [...] exhibition at MoMA.|$|E
