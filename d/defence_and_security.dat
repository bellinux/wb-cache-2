5|$|The F-FDTL's {{budget for}} 2015 is $US19.9million. The Ministry of <b>Defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> and Secretariat of State for Defence are funded {{separately}} from the F-FDTL, and were allocated $US4.6million and $US7.9million respectively in 2015. The total expenditure on defence during 2014 was $US31.1million, which was equivalent to 2.4 {{percent of gross domestic}} product.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of East Timor {{states that the}} president is the supreme commander of the defence force and has the power to appoint the F-FDTL's commander and chief of staff. The Council of Ministers and National Parliament are responsible for funding the F-FDTL and setting policy relating to East Timor's security. Cirilo José Cristovão serves as the current minister of <b>Defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security,</b> and Julio Tomas Pinto is the Secretary of State for Defense. Both men were sworn into these roles on 8 August 2012. A Superior Council for <b>Defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> was established in 2005 to advise the president on <b>defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>security</b> policy and legislation and the appointment and dismissal of senior military personnel. The council is chaired by the president and includes the prime minister, the defence, justice, interior and foreign affairs ministers, the heads of the F-FDTL and PNTL a national state security officer and three representatives from the national parliament. The council's role is not clear, however, and neither it nor the parliament served as a check against the decision to sack large numbers of F-FDTL personnel in 2006. A parliamentary committee also provides oversight of East Timor's security sector. Major General Lere Anan Timor is the current commander of the F-FDTL, and was appointed to this position on 6 October 2011.|$|E
5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of <b>Defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of <b>Defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E

5|$|Reports in mid-2011 {{suggested}} that a purchase of up to five P-8 Poseidons was under consideration, while in January 2015 {{it was reported that}} attempts had been made to sell the Kawasaki P-1 as another possible replacement. In November 2015, as part of the Strategic <b>Defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> Review, the Ministry of Defence announced the procurement of nine P-8 Poseidons, which will undertake the range of tasks that were undertaken by the Nimrod MR.2 and intended for the MRA.4.|$|E
5|$|Both {{carriers}} will {{be completed}} as originally planned, in a Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) configuration, deploying the Lockheed Martin F-35B. Following the 2010 Strategic <b>Defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> Review, the British government had intended to purchase the F-35C carrier version of this aircraft, and adopted plans for Prince of Wales to be built to a Catapult Assisted Take Off Barrier Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration. After the projected costs of the CATOBAR system rose to around twice the original estimate, the government {{announced that it would}} revert to the original design on 10 May 2012.|$|E

The review also confirmed {{that one of the}} carriers would have enhanced amphibious capabilities. The government also reaffirmed its commitment to ordering 138 F-35 Lightning IIs, although the specific variant(s) was not mentioned. The review stated that 24 of these aircraft would be available to the aircraft carriers by 2023.|$|E
5|$|The Council of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a {{politically}} independent think tank dedicated to <b>defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>security</b> issues, elected Dannatt as the Institute's Chairman in June 2009.

5|$|While the UN was {{reluctant}} to engage with the F-FDTL, several bilateral donors have assisted the force's development. Australia has provided extensive training and logistical support to the F-FDTL since it was established, and currently provides advisors who are posted to the F-FDTL and Ministry of <b>Defence</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security.</b> Portugal also provides advisors and trains two naval officers each year in Portugal. China provided US$1.8million in aid to the F-FDTL between 2002 and 2008 and agreed {{to build a new}} US$7million headquarters for the force in late 2007. East Timor is one of Brazil's main destinations for aid and the Brazilian Army is responsible for training the F-FDTL's military police unit (Maubere Mission). The United States also provides a small amount of assistance to the F-FDTL through the State Department's International Military Education and Training Program. While Malaysia has provided training courses and financial and technical aid, this assistance was suspended after the 2006 crisis. Under current arrangements Portugal provides the F-FDTL with basic and advanced training while Australia and other nations provide training in specialised skills. As of 2013 the East Timorese government had posted a single member of the F-FDTL to serve overseas as an observer with the United Nations Mission in Liberia. In 2015 the government was considering joining Australia's Pacific Patrol Boat Program.|$|E
