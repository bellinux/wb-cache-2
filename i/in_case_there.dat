But while only Albrecht VII, Duke of Mecklenburg, and Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, of the secular princes were still faithful to the Roman Catholic cause, and while united action might at the time easily have resulted in the triumph of Protestantism, there was no union of purpose. Duke Maurice of Saxony and Joachim II of Brandenburg would not join the Schmalkaldic League; Cleves was successfully invaded by imperial troops; and Protestantism was rigorously suppressed in Metz.|$|E
25|$|No-limit hold 'em {{has grown}} in {{popularity}} and is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and is the game played in the main event of the World Series of Poker. In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise up {{to all of the}} chips the player has at the table (called an all-in bet). The minimum raise is equal {{to the size of the}} previous bet or raise. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a raise of $6 to a total of $8, a re-raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise (or half the size in some casinos), the initial raiser cannot re-raise again (<b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>there</b> are other players also still in the game). In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot (including the amount needed to call).|$|E

The Department of Defense allocated funds for the North River Depot, a weapons storage facility to the northwest of the base. It later became Caribou Air Force Station and was absorbed into the facility in the 1960s. The end of the year brought the completion of a communications facility, a hospital, three barracks, a school, an officers club, a bakery, and a briefing and training building.

500|$|In {{common with}} many {{operational}} canals, {{the remains of}} the Shropshire Union system, including what had been the Chester Canal, were nationalised on 1 January 1948, and became the responsibility of the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive, which was part of the British Transport Commission. At the time, the function of canals was still viewed as commercial. An official reply to the Inland Waterways Association in 1947 stated that the Ministry of Transport [...] "...do not look very favourably upon any scheme for pleasure craft on the canals at the present time." [...] Despite such official attitudes, Eric Wilson, who produced the first edition of Inland Waterways of Great Britain in 1939, noted that those wishing to use the Shropshire Union for leisure cruising should apply to the Agent at Chester. He advised that application should be made well in advance, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>there</b> were problems due to the condition of the waterway and its locks.|$|E

Adam wins her back by serenading her while wearing nothing but a rose between his buttocks.|$|E

By the time production for Off the Deep End was nearing completion, Yankovic had already written all of the original songs that would be eventually included on Alapalooza. Fearing that his track [...] "I Was Only Kidding" [...] would be outdated {{by the time of}} his next album, he rearranged Off the Deep End to allow for the song to be released with the album, saving [...] "Waffle King" [...] for Alapalooza. Nevertheless, [...] "Waffle King" [...] was released as a B-side to Off the Deep Ends [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] single, [...] "just <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>there</b> wasn't going to be a next album."

Yankovic eventually decided to title his new album Alapalooza, a reference to the Lollapalooza music festival.

500|$|All {{disability}} types {{were eligible}} to participate at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC oversaw classification based on functional disability. General and functional classification {{took place in}} the Paralympic Village, with functional swimming classification taking place on the same dates at the Piscines Bernat Picronell. The process became a contentious issue at the Paralympics because of on-the-spot reclassifications that resulted in changes to the competition schedule. On-the-spot classification or re-classification was viewed as a negative aspect of the 1996 Summer Paralympics, and the Paralympic movement overall. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 54 assessments were conducted, resulting in 13 class changes. There was one Paralympic New Status (PNS) protest and two Paralympic Permanent Status (PPS) protests by a national Paralympic committee, with one classification upheld and two denied. Six classification appeals were lodged for swimming at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving four athletes, resulting in two class changes. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. [...] This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. [...] <b>In</b> <b>case</b> <b>there</b> was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, swimming classification was scheduled to take place at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, with visually impaired swimmers getting classified from September 4 to 6 and all other swimmers being classified from September 3 to 5.
