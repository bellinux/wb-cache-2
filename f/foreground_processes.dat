40|$|One of {{the major}} {{environmental}} challenges of the textile industry is the emissions of toxic substances during the production of textiles. It is therefore vital that toxicity impact potential is included when calculating {{the environmental impact of}} textile products with life cycle assessment (LCA). Generally, toxicity is considered a weak point in LCA, and specifically for LCA of textile products {{there is a lack of}} guidance in the literature. This paper shares the experiences from using USEtox 2. 0 for calculating the toxicity footprint of Swedish clothing consumption. The most commonly occurring garments, production processes and related toxic emissions were inventoried for the Swedish clothing consumption. The selected case offered the possibility to compare a variety of bio-based as well as synthetic materials and their production processes. The inventoried substances were matched against existing databases for USEtox characterization factors (CF) : the USEtox databases and COSMEDE. For the substances that did not have any CF, USEtox 2. 0 was used to calculate new CF. The potential contribution to freshwater ecotoxicity from the Swedish clothing consumption was calculated to 7. 9 billion CTUe which can be interpreted as 7. 9 cubic kilometres of freshwater where 50 % of the species in the ecosystem are exposed daily to a concentration above their EC 50. It was found that background processes in the life cycle (exhaust gases from fuel combustion, leakage of substances from mining waste etc.) accounted for 5. 5 billion CTUe, or 70 %. Direct emissions of toxic substances from the <b>foreground</b> <b>processes</b> (dyestuff, solvents, pesticides etc.) accounted for 2. 4 billion CTUe, or 30 %. It is important to note that there is a considerable amount of uncertainty in these values. An interesting discovery was that the wet treatment (dyeing and finishing) had the largest contribution to freshwater ecotoxicity impact, both regarding background and <b>foreground</b> <b>processes.</b> The cotton fibre production, infamous for its use of pesticides, had only the second largest contribution, followed by the yarn production. The paper concludes that emissions of toxic substances from textile production are an important environmental aspect to include in LCA studies of textile products. The results also contribute to the understanding of the order of magnitude that use and emissions from textile chemicals have in relation to a nations total clothing consumption. Sharing the experiences from the study can facilitate the inclusion of toxic substances in future LCA studies of textiles and other products...|$|E

Our model is easy to interpret, does not exhibit the dependency on image size, and results in higher accuracy.

Finally, we use the adaptive kernel variance method of Narayana et al. [5] to adapt the KDE covariance at each pixel. With a simpler and more intuitive model, we can better interpret and visualize the effects of the adaptive kernel variance method, while achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art on a standard backgrounding benchmark. ...|$|E

Addressing questions of aesthetics and politics, freedom and belonging, betrayal and responsibility, and tracing the Bildungsroman's links with life-writing forms such as immigrant narrative, mother-daughter story, biomythography, and illness narrative, the study outlines the various ways in which the novel of individual development becomes an appropriate site for the negotiation of several enduring and contentious tensions in ethnic American writing. Of potential interest to scholars of American literature, but also ethnic, feminist and postcolonial literatures, and to students of American literature and culture, the book demonstrates the Bildungsroman's ongoing relevance and expanded capacity of representation in an ethnic American and postcolonial context...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to develop a methodological {{approach}} allowing to assess the influence of parameters of one or more elementary <b>processes</b> in the <b>foreground</b> system, on the outcomes of a life cycle assessment (LCA) study. From this perspective, the method must be able to: (1) include <b>foreground</b> <b>process</b> modeling in order to avoid the assumption of proportionality between inventory data and reference flows; (2) quantify influences of foreground processes’ parameters (and, possibly, interactions between parameters); and (3) identify trends (either increasing or decreasing) for each parameter on each indicator in order to determine the most favorable direction for parametric variation. These objectives can be reached by combining foreground system modeling, a set of two different sensitivity analysis methods (each one providing different and complementary information), and LCA. The proposed method is applied to a case study of hemp-based insulation materials for buildings. The present study will focus on the agricultural stage as a foreground system and as a first step encompassing the entire life cycle. A set of technological recommendationswere identified for hemp farmers in order to reduce the crop’s environmental impacts (from – 11 % to – 89 % according to the considered impact category). One of the main limitations of the approach is the need for a detailed model of the <b>foreground</b> <b>process.</b> Further, the method is, at present, rather time-consuming.

40|$|This thesis explores a {{cultural}} history of cinema-going in the Illawarra region of New South Wales {{over the first}} half of the twentieth century through oral history interviews with cinema-goers of the period. The research was originally intended to explore the Australian cinema industry from a regional perspective. However, while the interviews contained fascinating details and stories of cinema-going in this period, they did not fit seamlessly into existing academic discussions about cinema which often focus on film texts and national cinema industries. Therefore, as well as considering how the oral histories I collected contributed to pre-existing academic discourses about the cinema industry and national screen content, I have also explored other discourses that are articulated in audience narratives. Through exploring the debates in cultural studies about audience research and the work of the Popular Memory Group and other critical oral historians, I critically evaluate the oral history narratives as well as the methodology of oral history itself. I look at the intersection of oral history practice with cultural studies in order to highlight issues of representation and power and to celebrate the way that differences between written and oral histories can <b>foreground</b> <b>processes</b> of meaning-making. My contention in this thesis is that cinema-going is a strategy of mediation through which people make sense of themselves, their lives and their relationships with others. I test this theory by considering cinema-going in relation to a series of identifications: national identity, local identity, personal identity and political identity (age being one strategic location from which older individuals can draw on age-related discourses and experiences to achieve particular narrative ends). In conclusion I argue that any cultural history of cinema-going is a mediated history which is constructed within a matrix of meaning-making strategies. It is created through audience members 2 ̆ 7 narratives of cinema-going which re-configure memories in accordance with particular discourses of significance either in the narrated past or in the narrating present. The researcher, who tells the story with reference to specific research priorities and current academic discourses, further mediates such a history. Therefore, as well as setting out {{a cultural}} history of cinema-going in the Illawarra for debate and further research, the emphasis on mediation is intended to encourage reflection on the creation of history as a complex, collaborative and political process which creates one story as it silences others...|$|E

Abstract of Master's Thesis, levert 8. juni, 2014 :Life Cycle Assessment of Farmed Salmon, Comparing a Closed with an Open Sea Cage System. The {{goal of this}} Master's Thesis is to do a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on {{a closed}} fish farm system and compare it to an open fish farm system, for so to make {{recommendations}} based on the results. Life Cycle Assessment is a method to calculate the environmental impacts that comes from producing a product or a service. In this case the product is one tonne of salmon at farm gate. We compare this with the impacts from producing one tonne at an open fish farm. In {{the first part of}} the thesis we describe the reasons for carrying out the LCA, and the theory used. Closed fish farm systems might be the solution to the salmon lice problem the industry is facing, the developer Akvafuture in Br&# 248;nn&# 248;ysund is developing such a system, and the have agreed to deliver numbers for use in the LCA. These and numbers from big actors in the industry makes up the data used in the LCA. The <b>foreground</b> <b>processes</b> included in the study is smolt and feed production, smolt and feed transport, and the fish farm. The categories covered in the study is climate change, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, and marine ecotoxicity. The LCA showed that the closed system used alot more electric energy than the open system, this mainly from pumps and production of oxygen. This makes the impacts from the closed system sensitive to changes in impacts from the electric energy, it is therefore important to know what power is used on the fish farm. For farms in Norway this have little impacts due to the clean energy from Norwegian hydro power, but it increases for the climate and acidification category when the energy gets dirtier, e. g. by using Eurpean electricity mix. The feed production is by far the most contributing process in all four categories. For freshwater eutrophication and marine ecotoxicity the contribution is almost a hundred percent of the impacts. In conclusion we can see that for use in Norwegian waters and with Norwegian el-mix, the closed fish farm system is a environmentally good alternative to open fish farm systems when looking on the categories in this LCA. I can be argued that closed systems have other positive aspects like no lice, better feed factor, healthier fish and more, but has yet to be shown, and the closed systems have much yet to prove. It should be noted this LCA used data from early testing, and for that period the salmon was lice free. </p...|$|E

The study employs a combination of ‘middle range’ discourse analytical techniques. In the first instance, critical discourse analysis is applied to company documentation to distil the ideological stance of an international organization’s CBMD programme. Critical discursive psychology is then used to assess the ways in which employees’ evaluative accounts both support and resist such stance. The analysis builds upon previous insights from Foucauldian studies of CBMD by <b>foregrounding</b> <b>processes</b> of discursive agency.

A set of tools has been developed which automates the process of transforming the output of a standard 32 bit C compiler to 16 bit interrupt code which directly handles the real mode interrupts.

By improving {{the accuracy of the}} <b>foreground</b> segmentation <b>process,</b> the overall performance of a video processing system has the potential for improvement. This work introduces a Fuzzy Foreground Segmentation System (FFSS) that uses Mamdani-type Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) to control pixel-level accumulated statistics. The error of the FFSS is quantified by comparing its output with hand-segmented ground-truth images from a set of image sequences that specifically model canonical problems of foreground segmentation. Optimization of the FFSS parameters is achieved using a Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA). Additionally, multiple central composite designed experiments used to analyze the performance of RCGA under selected schemes and their respective parameters. The RCGA schemes and parameters are chosen as to reduce variation and execution time for a set of known multi-dimensional test functions. The selected multi-dimensional test functions represent assorted function landscapes.

A critical method for analyzing how virtual reality work engages {{with the concept of}} empathy (specifically defined as "inner imitation for the purpose of gaining knowledge of another") does not exist.

To construct this framework, a variety of contemporary virtual reality works are studied which suggest the emergence of specific techniques that are referred to in this thesis as "intentional looking" and "direct address". Applying theories of affordances and revealed phantasms from environmental philosophy and cultural computing to these techniques, staged empathy provides a framework for the analysis of virtual reality work that is sensitive to the new potentials of the medium as well as the limitations of empathy. by Elisabeth Ainsley Sutherland.

The uncertainty reduction benefits of such refinements {{depend upon the}} structure of the inventory model. The structure of inventory models in general are investigated using an economic input/output life cycle assessment model of the US economy. Percentiles for the share of total upstream emissions contributed by the set of processes in each supply tier are presented for US commodities and several important pollutants. Capturing at least 90 % of the total direct plus upstream emissions for criteria air pollutants and toxic releases for at least 75 % of the commodities in the US economy requires full modeling of direct emissions plus the first five supply tiers. A method is developed and applied for streamlining Input/Output models. The method yields several conclusions relevant to risk-based life cycle impact assessment. The depth and breadth requirements for capturing a high percentage (e. g.,> 80 %) of total emissions vary widely across products or commodities. Models focusing on just direct plus the 15 - 20 most important processes in tier 1 can capture a median of just over 40 % of emissions. To capture more than 60 % of total emissions {{for more than half of}} all commodities requires models requires models with more than 4000 process instances.

40|$|We analyze first-year data of WMAP to {{determine}} the significance of asymmetry in summed power between arbitrarily defined opposite hemispheres, using maps that we create ourselves with software developed independently of the WMAP team. We find that over the multipole range l=[2, 64], the significance of asymmetry is ~ 10 ^- 4, a value insensitive to both frequency and power spectrum. We determine the smallest multipole ranges exhibiting significant asymmetry, and find twelve, including l=[2, 3] and [6, 7], for which the significance -> 0. In these ranges there is an improbable association between the direction of maximum significance and the ecliptic plane (p ~ 0. 01). Also, contours of least significance follow great circles inclined relative to the ecliptic at the largest scales. The great circle for l=[2, 3] passes over previously reported preferred axes and is insensitive to frequency, while the great circle for l=[6, 7] is aligned with the ecliptic poles. We examine how changing map-making parameters affects asymmetry, and find that at large scales, it is rendered insignificant if {{the magnitude of the}} WMAP dipole vector is increased by approximately 1 - 3 sigma (or 2 - 6 km/s). While confirmation of this result would require data recalibration, such a systematic change would be consistent with observations of frequency-independent asymmetry.
