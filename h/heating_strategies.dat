Two different catalyst/activator compositions were used to study the influence of a di-functional activator on polymerisation.

The temperature gradient between the bloom surface and center was measured by two thermocouples incorporated directly into the bloom. Scanning electron microscopy equipped by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, hot tensile tests, and interdendritic solidification software was used for modeling of steel thermophysical properties {{with respect to the}} alloying-elements macrosegregation. The model of the bloom was programmed in the Fortran language. The FEM software MARC/MENTAT 2012 was used for simulation of two <b>heating</b> <b>strategies</b> (plane strain formulation). The first heating model was fitted to the commonly used heating strategy when internal defects grew above the critical limit. The second heating model was a newly proposed strategy that consisted of slower heating up to 1073 K when the first warming-through period occurred. The FEM simulations included determinations of the temperature gradient, the equivalent of stress, the equivalent of elastic strain, the equivalent of plastic strain, and the equivalent of total strain. The simulation results were in good agreement with experimental observations. The new heating strategy based on the FEM simulations led to significantly lower occurrence of internal defects in hot-rolled billets that are used for cylinder production.

30|$|The aim in {{this work}} {{was to provide a}} {{practical}} method to easily estimate how much heating energy could be saved by employing an occupancy-based <b>heating</b> <b>strategy</b> in private households. We derive occupancy patterns from unlabelled electricity consumption data by applying an unsupervised classification algorithm to generate an occupancy schedule. We use this schedule together with basic characteristics of the dwelling (such as its age and its size), and the local weather data to simulate the heating process in the households and to determine how much energy could be saved if an occupancy-based <b>heating</b> <b>strategy</b> was applied. If households have a smart metering system and provide the few basic parameters about their dwelling, our approach could be used to individually estimate the usefulness of a smart heating system or to teach the inhabitants to what extent it may be beneficial to change their habits of heating usage. Moreover, our approach could also be used to assess investments in building improvements, by varying the characteristic parameters in the simulation. The algorithms we presented require little computational power and can easily be run locally in the home, so there would be no need to disclose occupancy or other data and thus privacy concerns could be avoided. We applied our system to the CER dataset, consisting of data of several thousand households. Our results indicate that on average over 9 % heating energy can theoretically be saved, which would result in significant monetary and ecological benefits.|$|R

Three test porosities were considered, 0. 3, 0. 45 and 0. 6. A preliminary understanding of enhanced heating and power absorption within the material {{was obtained from the}} average power vs slab depth plots. The maxima in power, also termed as ‘resonances’, are observed for specific sample thicknesses and the two consecutive resonances are termed as R 1 and R 2 modes. It is observed that, for both b/a and b/o samples, higher intensity of resonances for power absorption occur in the presence of metallic and alumina–metallic composite supports. The detailed spatial distribution of power illustrates that the sample {{attached with}} the metallic support attains lower power distribution for both b/a and b/o samples. The low power absorption near the unexposed face has been enhanced by ceramic–metallic composite support. The overall heating efficiency is also enhanced with ceramic– metallic composite supports.

40|$|Abstract—Manufacturing {{components}} of fiber-reinforced thermoplastics requires three steps: heating the matrix, forming and {{consolidation of the}} composite and terminal cooling the matrix. For the heating process a pre-determined temperature distribution through the layers and {{the thickness of the}} pre-consolidated sheets is recommended to enable forming mechanism. Thus, a design for the heating process for forming composites with thermoplastic matrices is necessary. To obtain a constant temperature through thickness and width of the sheet, the heating process was analyzed by the help of the finite element method. The simulation models were validated by experiments with resistance thermometers as well as with an infrared camera. Based on the finite element simulation, heating methods for infrared radiators have been developed. Using the numeric simulation many iteration loops are required to determine the process parameters. Hence, the initiation of a model for calculating relevant process parameters started applying regression functions.
