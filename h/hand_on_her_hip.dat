2500|$|John Marshall, another {{archeologist}} at Mohenjo-daro, {{described the}} figure as [...] "a young girl, her <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats {{time to the}} music with her legs and feet." [...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, [...] "We may not be certain {{that she was a}} dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.|$|E
60|$|James {{approached}} Miss Forrester with {{a beating}} heart. She made a charming picture {{as she stood}} there in the sunlight, one <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> the other swaying a tennis racket.|$|E
60|$|And {{having said}} that she turned on her heel and slowly walked away, leaving behind her an ocean of desolation. She walked away--with a slow, {{swinging}} stride, one <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> her head thrown back.|$|E
60|$|Entering Manston's empty bedroom, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> she indifferently {{cast her}} eyes upon the bed, {{previously}} to dismantling it.|$|R
5000|$|The series portrays Darna as a {{more modern}} version of the {{original}} comic icon; prone to overconfidence and heroic jaunty poses (<b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips)</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom McChesney," [...] said Polly Ann, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and <b>her</b> sunbonnet tilted, [...] "that's {{the longest}} speech you ever made in your life." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} {{they were all}} very stiff, but glad of the sun on {{sagebrush}} and river, and the boy and girl sang over breakfast. While Milt was gathering fuel {{he looked up at}} Claire standing against a background of rugged hills, her skirt and shoes still smug, but her jacket off, her blouse turned in at the throat, her hair blowing, her sleeves rolled up, one <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> erect, charged with vigor--the spirit of adventure.|$|E
60|$|She nerved {{herself by}} an effort, entered the swing-gate, and rang the door-bell. The thing was done; {{there could be}} no retreat. No; the thing was not done. Nobody {{answered}} to her ringing. The effort had to be risen to and made again. She rang a second time, and the agitation of the act, coupled with her weariness after the fifteen miles' walk, led her support herself while she waited by resting her <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> and her elbow {{against the wall of the}} porch. The wind was so nipping that the ivy-leaves had become wizened and gray, each tapping incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir of her nerves. A piece of blood-stained paper, caught up from some meat-buyer's dust-heap, beat up and down the road without the gate; too flimsy to rest, too heavy to fly away; and a few straws kept it company.|$|E
60|$|Madame Bouclet now {{traced the}} line with her forefinger, as it were to confirm and settle herself in her parting snap at Monsieur Mutuel, and so placing her right <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> with a defiant air, as if nothing should ever tempt her to unsnap that snap, strolled out into the Place to glance up at the windows of Mr. The Englishman. That worthy {{happening}} to be looking out of window at the moment, Madame Bouclet gave him a graceful salutation with her head, looked {{to the right and}} looked to the left to account to him for her being there, considered for a moment, like one who accounted to herself for somebody she had expected not being there, and reentered her own gateway. Madame Bouclet let all her house giving on the Place in furnished flats or floors, and lived up the yard behind in company with Monsieur Bouclet her husband (great at billiards), an inherited brewing business, several fowls, two carts, a nephew, a little dog in a big kennel, a grape-vine, a counting-house, four horses, a married sister (with a share in the brewing business), the husband and two children of the married sister, a parrot, a drum (performed on by the little boy of the married sister), two billeted soldiers, a quantity of pigeons, a fife (played by the nephew in a ravishing manner), several domestics and supernumeraries, a perpetual flavour of coffee and soup, a terrific range of artificial rocks and wooden precipices at least four feet high, a small fountain, and half-a-dozen large sunflowers.|$|E
60|$|I {{enjoyed it}} so little, indeed, that I fell to poking the sitting-room fire {{when she entered}} with the Mercury; and read the Mercury assiduously while she brought in breakfast. She set down the tray with a slam and stood beside it, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> <b>her</b> whole {{attitude}} breathing challenge.|$|R
6000|$|She pointed {{dramatically}} at the door, but {{the woman}} retained her position, only moving to cuff the boy, who was kicking Henderson on his shins. Then, setting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> she said defiantly: ...|$|R
60|$|Bostil's sister came in {{from the}} kitchen. She was a huge person with a severe yet motherly face. She had <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and she cast a rather disapproving glance at father and daughter.|$|R
60|$|But let me not so hasten {{over this}} part of my friend's journey as to omit all mention of the amphibious Irish houses which stand about on the low lands along the railroad-sides, and which you half expect to see plunge into the tidal mud of the neighborhood, {{with a series of}} hoarse croaks, as the train approaches. Perhaps twenty-four trains pass those houses every twenty-four hours, and it is a wonder that the {{inhabitants}} keep their interest in them, or have leisure to bestow upon any of them. Yet, as you dash along so bravely, you can see that you arrest the occupations of all these villagers as by a kind of enchantment; the children pause and turn their heads toward you from their mud-pies (to the production of which there is literally no limit in that region); the matron rests one parboiled <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> letting the other still linger listlessly upon the wash-board, while she lifts her eyes from the suds to look at you; the boys, who all summer long are forever just going into the water or just coming out of it, cease their buttoning or unbuttoning; the baby, which has been run after and caught and suitably posed, turns its anguished eyes upon you, where also falls the mother's gaze, while her descending palm is arrested in mid air. I forbear to comment upon the surprising populousness of these villages, where, in obedience to all the laws of health, the inhabitants ought to be wasting miserably away, but where they flourish in spite of them. Even Accident here seems to be robbed of half her malevolence; and that baby (who will presently be chastised with terrific uproar) passes an infancy of intrepid enjoyment amidst the local perils, and is no more affected by the engines and the cars than by so many fretful hens with their attendant broods of chickens.|$|E
5000|$|Resident Evil: Chris {{crosses his}} arms and waits. Jill puts her left <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> and pats her gun against her leg with her right hand.|$|E
50|$|Lean: The {{base and}} flyer stand side by side, with the base's <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> The base lunges sideways, {{away from the}} flyer, holding her hip to his. She keeps one leg {{straight}} and styles with the other, often a figure-4 knee bend.|$|E
6000|$|... "He came {{in about}} five minutes ago," [...] said the furmity woman, joining the rest with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> [...] "And then 'a stepped back, and then 'a looked in again. I'm not a penny the better for him." ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{nodded to}} Andor, but by tacit consent {{they had not}} shaken hands. Klara now put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and, like a young animal let free after days of captivity, she drew in deep breaths of sweet-scented air.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{blocking}} up the doorway with <b>her</b> <b>'ands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>'ips,</b> while I explained, with Kumbo still 'anging {{on my arm}} and a crowd collecting behind, and the more I explained, the more I could see she didn't believe a word of it.|$|R
5000|$|Azure a {{sailing ship}} with three masts Argent, with pennants Or, on {{waves of the}} second; and in base a mermaid [...] crowned, crined and tailed of the third, with her {{sinister}} <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> and maintaining in her dexter hand a salmon of the second.|$|E
5000|$|..... {{just like}} a doll, she was, but alive. Her hair was red, her sarafan blue, and she held a blue kerchief in her hand. She looked around them merrily and her teeth sine white. Then she put one <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> raised the blue kerchief with the other and began to dance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{painting}} depicts May, a tattooed black-haired woman, {{smoking a}} pipe. May is coolly scrutinizing the viewer, her other <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> with her trousers unbuttoned such that her pubic hair is visible. McCall's intention in painting May {{was to explore}} [...] "how women choose to express their sexual identity beyond the male gaze".|$|E
60|$|The moment I {{opened the}} door I see there was {{something}} wrong. Three times my missis licked 'er lips afore she could speak. Her face 'ad gone a dirty white colour, and she was leaning forward with <b>her</b> <b>'ands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>'ips,</b> trembling all over with temper.|$|R

" Sister Moira stands with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> {{in front of}} the circular opening in a brick wall topped by a cross. She wears a white habit and black veil. A group of barefoot girls standing with their backs to the camera mimic her pose...|$|R
60|$|When he thus spoke we were come {{opposite}} a small, rude dwelling situate in {{one corner}} of a pasture wherein even a sheep would have found it difficult to satisfy its hunger, and in the door of this building stood a motherly looking old woman, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and <b>her</b> eyes fixed <b>on</b> us in curiosity, as I fancied.|$|R
50|$|Jan Hunt (born 15 February 1938) is a British comedian, {{actress and}} Music Hall performer, who {{appeared}} on BBC television series Crackerjack with Michael Aspel, Ed Stewart, Peter Glaze and Don Maclean in the 1970s. She would often be seen playing {{an old lady}} in dramatisations, involving her donning a grey wig and glasses and putting her <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> to suggest a bad back.|$|E
50|$|On Demetrius, Anders {{returns from}} a recon flight and finds Leoben with Starbuck, guiding {{her hand in}} {{painting}} her mural - his other <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> Anders furiously rips Leoben {{away from her and}} Starbuck protests the intrusion. As the guards take Leoben away, Helo steps in and reminds Starbuck of the months of mind-games that Leoben played on her back on New Caprica, but she argues that Leoben can help find Earth.|$|E

6000|$|The {{woman with}} the coffee-pot here faced about, stood up, and, either from design or some odd coincidence, fell into the same dogged {{attitude}} {{that her husband had}} previously taken, except that she rested <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> She was prematurely aged, like many of her class, and her black, snake-like locks, twisting loose from her comb as she lifted her head, showed threads of white against the firelight. Then with slow and implacable deliberation she said: ...|$|R
50|$|Parallel Lines {{took its}} name from an unused track written by Harry, the lyrics of which were {{included}} in the first vinyl edition of the album. The cover sleeve image was photographed by Edo Bertoglio and was chosen by Blondie's manager, Peter Leeds, despite being rejected by the band. The photo shows the band posing in matching dress suits and smiling broadly in contrast to Harry who poses defiantly with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> while wearing a white dress and high heels.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of people}} {{carrying}} their toboggans in the snow, ca. 1930. At right, {{a line of}} people carrying their toboggans make {{their way through the}} snow toward the left. In the foreground stand two women and a man. The man smokes a cigarette at right, while the woman next to him has her back to the camera. Beside her stands a woman with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> At left is a wooden structure on which a crowd stands. In the background is a snow-covered slope with some people standing atop it. The distance is thick with trees...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea came}} to Dunn after {{a show in}} Minnesota. According to McBride, who played bass guitar in Brooks & Dunn's road band, Dunn [...] "comes busting onto the bus and says, 'how about this idea?' and he howls that ah oooh, aw, play {{something}} country!" [...] Inspired by Gretchen Wilson, with whom they had been touring, McBride and Dunn decided to base the song's central character on Wilson's image, creating a [...] "ballsy chick that bursts into the barroom, puts her <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> … and goes, 'play something country!'" [...] After McBride told Wilson {{that she was the}} inspiration for [...] "Play Something Country," [...] Wilson replied that she loved the song.|$|E
5000|$|Winehouse (1983-2011) was a British {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} {{who had become}} strongly associated with Camden Town until her death in 2011. Winehouse died at her nearby Camden Square home of alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011. The 1.59 m tall statue depicts Winehouse with her <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> wearing high heels, and with her signature beehive hairstyle. The singer's statue also wears a Star of David necklace and {{on the day of}} the unveiling had a real red rose in her hair. The charcoal grey work was created by the British sculptor Scott Eaton, who said that it had been designed to convey Winehouse's [...] "attitude and strength, but also give subtle hints of insecurity".|$|E
5000|$|John Marshall, another {{archeologist}} at Mohenjo-daro, {{described the}} figure as [...] "a young girl, her <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats {{time to the}} music with her legs and feet". He is known to reacted with surprise when he saw this statuette. He said [...] "When I first saw them I {{found it difficult to}} believe that they were prehistoric." [...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl described Dancing Girl as [...] "the most captivating piece of art from an Indus site" [...] and qualified the description of her as a dancer by stating that, [...] "We may not be certain that she was a dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{waitress}} {{was instantly}} back with soup, {{and a collection}} of china gathered by a man of much travel, catholic interests, and no taste. One of the plates alleged itself to belong to a hotel in Omaha. She pushed a pitcher of condensed milk to the exact spot where it would catch Mr. Boltwood's sleeve, brushed the crumb from in front of Claire to a shelter beneath the pink and warty sugar bowl, recovered a toothpick which had been concealed behind her glowing lips, picked for a while, gave it up, put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and addressed Claire: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{commission}} by State Street Global Advisors specified {{that the}} statue should depict {{a girl with}} <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and chin up, with a height of 36 inches, which Kristen Visbal and her collaborators then increased to 50 inches, to better match the size of Charging Bull. Still, Visbal commented that [...] "I made sure to keep her features soft; she's not defiant, she's brave, proud, and strong, not belligerent". She modeled the sculpture on two children from Delaware, a friend's daughter who was instructed to pretend she was facing a bull, and a Latina girl, [...] "so everyone could relate to the Fearless Girl." ...|$|R
60|$|The younger lady {{looked down}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{companion}} with {{something of the}} calm expert attention that a plumber gives to a tap that is misbehaving, and like a plumber refrained from precipitate action. She stood with the backs of <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> resting <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b>|$|R
