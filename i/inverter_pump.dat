40|$|Abstract: The inter-line dynamic voltage restorer (IDVR) {{consists}} of several voltage source inverters connected to different independent distribution feeders with common dc bus. When {{one of the}} inverters compensates for voltage sag that appears in its feeder (voltage control mode), the other <b>inverters</b> <b>pump</b> the required power into the dc bus (power control mode). Each inverter will have both voltage and power controllers; only one controller is in use during the abnormal conditions according to its feeder state. The voltage controller uses one of the dynamic voltage restoration techniques. In this paper, the in-phase technique is applied and two types of loads are considered (constant impedance and three phase induction motor). Since the voltage restoration process may need real power injection into the distribution system, the power controller injects this power via voltage injection. This voltage injection is simulated by voltage drop across series virtual impedance. A new scheme is proposed to select the impedance value. The impedance value is selected such that the power consumed by this impedance represents the required power to be transferred without perturbing the load voltage. The performance of this system is also studied during voltage swell. A scheme for operation of multi-feeder IDVR system is proposed in this paper. Simulation results substantiate the proposed concept...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a single-stage solution for PV fed three-phase induction motor (IM) water pumping system. The given solution uses time tested, two two-level cascaded H-bridge inverters to give three-level voltage output to the IM pump drive. The proposed system is operated using the control strategy which includes Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT), Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) and V/f control. The MPPT algorithm generates the modulation index ‘ma’ {{which is used}} to operate the cascaded inverter and generates three-level output voltage under all environmental conditions. This helps in improving the THD of IM phase current, thereby reducing the torque ripple. In addition, the ‘ma’ value is used to define the IM operating frequency.

40|$|Energy {{savings and}} {{greenhouse}} gas emission reductions are increasingly becoming important design targets in many industrial systems where fossil fuel based electrical energy is heavily utilised. In water distribution systems (WDSs) {{a significant portion of}} operational cost is related to pumping. Recent studies have considered variable speed pumps (VSPs) which aim to vary the operating point of the pump to match demand to pumping rate. Depending on the system characteristics, this approach can lead to considerable savings in operational costs. In particular, cost reductions {{can take advantage of the}} demand variability and can decrease energy consumption significantly.

The design, construction and testing of a photovoltaic-powered reverse-osmosis (PV -RO) desalination system is presented The system operates from seawater and requires no batteries, since the rate of production of freshwater varies throughout the day according to the available solar power. Initial testing of the system, with the modest solar resource available in the UK, provided freshwater at approximately 1 5 m 3 /day. Nearer to the equator and with a PV array of only 2. 4 kWp, a software model of the system predicts production of over 3 m 3 /day throughout the year.

40|$|With {{decreasing}} feature sizes, lowered supply voltages {{and increasing}} operating frequencies, the radiation tolerance of digital circuits {{is becoming an}} increasingly important problem. Many radiation hardening techniques have been presented in the literature for combinational as well as sequential logic. However, the radiation tolerance of clock generation circuitry has received scant attention to date. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that in the deep submicron regime, the clock network contributes significantly to the chip level Soft Error Rate (SER). The on-chip Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is particularly vulnerable to radiation strikes. In this thesis, we present a radiation hardened PLL design. Each of the components of this design-the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), the phase frequency detector (PFD) and the charge pump/loop filter-are designed in a radiation tolerant manner. Whenever possible, the circuit elements used in our PLL exploit the fact that if a gate is implemented using only PMOS (NMOS) transistors then a radiation particle strike can result only in a logic 0 to 1 (1 to 0) flip. By separating the PMOS and NMOS devices, and splitting the gate output into two signals, extreme high levels of radiation tolerance are obtained. Our design uses two VCOs (with cross-coupled <b>inverters)</b> and charge <b>pumps,</b> so that a strike on any one is compensated by the other. Our PLL is tested for radiation immunity for critical charge values up to 250 fC. Our SPICE-based results demonstrate that after exhaustively striking all circuit nodes, the worst case jitter of our hardened PLL is just 37. 4 percent. In the worst case, our PLL returns to the locked state in 2 cycles of the VCO clock, after a radiation strike. These numbers are significant improvements over those of the best previously reported approaches...|$|R
40|$|The current energy {{situation}} {{in the world where}} most of the energy needed is generated from non-renewable sources such as fossil fuels is no longer sustainable. During few years, nonrenewable sources have become an interesting solution to provide energy to areas with small needs of electricity, rather than using non-renewable sources. Therefore, this project has pursued to implement photovoltaics panels to supply energy in a rural region in central Africa, contributing {{to the development of the}} area and proving that this technology is viable to pump water for irrigation instead of the conventional electric grid. A rural area between Kidogo Lake and Rilima town, in Bugesera district of Rwanda, has been chosen as target. This analysis has focused on typical plantations of the country, being the main crops banana, cassava and maize, each one with very similar maximum water needs; 71 m 3 /ha_day, 70 m 3 /ha_day and 67 m 3 /ha_day, respectively. The eastern province of Rwanda is formed by seven districts. A preliminary study was developed in order to find the target area in terms of weather conditions, high temperature and low rainfall. Therefore, parameters such as precipitation, solar irradiance and evapotranspiration, among others, have been crucial for deciding the driest zone. Indeed, the Bugesera district is an ideal candidate due to the reception of a large amount of solar irradiation, with an annual average of 5, 28 kWh/m 2 _day. In order to dimension the photovoltaic and water-pumping system, a preliminary research including a large amount of background was required to determine the best structure. Indeed, knowing the water demand, we decided the water should be pumped up into a tank, letting it irrigate the field via gravitation only. A sample irrigation layout was then designed to ensure that with a number of pipes, water was conveyed to every plant. The use of a tank not only for storing water, but also as a source of system’s pressure lead us to calculate the minimum distance from the ground to the bottom. The height obtained of 2, 2 meters provides the necessary pressure to distribute water and irrigate the field. With the energy needed for the water supply, a photovoltaic pumping system, consisting of a PV generator, <b>inverter</b> and <b>pump,</b> was selected. Our main findings was that the photovoltaic system must have a rated power of 1, 73 kW in order to guarantee proper functioning.

The main objectives of this project were to investigate the changes to the measured indoor environmental parameters, when a higher capacity non indoor polluting replacement heater was installed and to examine if this intervention was sufficient to provide the households with a healthy indoor environment. Baseline monitoring {{was carried out in}} the living rooms and child’s bedrooms of 33 homes including the real time measurement of four gaseous key pollutants, room temperature, relative humidity (RH) and usage of the original heater (unflued gas heater (UGH) or portable electric heater) for up to one week. Airborne fungi level and fungi level from the floor dust were measured and a visual inspection of fungi was undertaken. The suitability of the wall environment for fungi development was estimated via a fungal detector and correlated to wall psychrometric conditions (temperature, RH). The different fungi assessment methods were compared. The measurements were repeated in 36 homes, following the replacement of the UGH or portable electric heater with a higher capacity non indoor polluting heater such as flued gas heater, wood pellet burner or heat pump in the intervention homes. Of these homes, 27 were monitored for both winters. Excessive levels of pollutants were found when the UGH was operated, even for short periods. Acceptable air quality levels were achieved for all replacement heater homes. The study showed that the replacement heaters were operated for longer periods than the heaters they replaced. The homes with the replacement heaters installed were warmer and dryer and had less mould than the homes with UGHs. The replacement heater also had a positive impact on the wall psychrometric conditions with reduced water availability for mould to grow. Replacing the UGH with a higher capacity non indoor air polluting heater reduced the asthmatic children’s exposure to harmful indoor environment.

40|$|A {{flexible}} {{air source}} heat pump testing platform {{is being developed}} at the National Renewable Energy Centre that will have the advantages of both a field trial and a laboratory test. It may be considered as a “black box” testing method that will be able to produce performance data that reflects the actual operating performance of the heat pump. At the same time it will also enable more experimental investigations to be carried out to understand the parameters that influence a heat pump’s coefficient of performance. The testing platform is controlled by automated instruments programmed in NI Labview software that enables customised tests to be carried out. The heat pump is installed normally as it would in operating condition. The heat pump under investigation in this study is a transcritical CO 2 <b>inverter</b> controlled heat <b>pump.</b> It is installed with a 220 litre buffer tank that provides combined hot water and space heating and is supported by an optional solar pre-heat system. The characteristics of two alternative heating circuits for controlling heating in the test platform are compared based on experimental and theoretical findings. The first heating circuit is based on standard radiator installation and it is entirely controlled by flow rate. The second heating circuit combines both water temperature and flow rate control. The first heating circuit required a complex multi-band variable step control strategy, partly to overcome resonances and slow valve traverse. The second heating circuit required a much simpler control algorithm and achieved more responsive heating control. Dynamic behaviour of the cooling tank in the test platform for heat transfer from the first heating circuit was investigated using vertical tank temperatures and theory. At low level heating of 3 kW, long duration (12 minutes) temperature fluctuations were observed due to on/off cycling of chiller. Short duration (1 - 2 minutes) temperature fluctuations were also observed and attributed to natural convection. At high levels of heating of 7 - 8 kW, only short duration (1 - 3 minutes) temperature fluctuations with larger amplitudes were seen with fluctuations due to chiller cycling masked by these fluctuations. According to theory and published experimental work on turbulence, the conclusion can be drawn that the temperature fluctuations are primarily due to laminar convection in the cooling tank. Daily and night-time COPs were obtained using the second heating circuit continuously for a month in the winter season. Daily COPs showed an unexpected positive linear correlation with average daily heating. The COP varied from 1. 8 to 2. 6 for heating between 3 and 7 kW. Based on the theory of CO 2 as a heat pump refrigerant and published experimental work, it is suggested that the rise in COP with higher heat output {{can be explained by the}} rise in refrigerant pressure as the heat pump tries to output more heat...|$|R
