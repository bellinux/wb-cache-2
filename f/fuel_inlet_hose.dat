50|$|The main {{fuel valve}} was a butterfly-type valve, {{spring-loaded}} to the closed position, pneumatically operated {{to the open}} position, and pneumatically assisted to the closed position. It was mounted between the fuel high-pressure duct from the fuel turbopump and the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> manifold of the thrust chamber assembly. The main fuel valve controlled the flow of fuel to the thrust chamber. Pressure from the ignition stage control valve on the pneumatic control package opened the valve during engine start and, as the gate started to open, it allowed fuel to flow to the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> manifold.|$|R
50|$|Both {{variants}} of the 4300 {{have been criticized}} for poor acceleration, rough operation, and a potential for fire due to a poor <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> design. This negative reputation is not universally accepted amongst users of these carburetors.|$|R
25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as the fuel is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} the fuel bowl. The float lifts upward toward the bottom of the inverted fuel bowl. With the float at the bottom of the fuel bowl, the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> valve opens, as it would when there is not enough fuel in the fuel bowl. With the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> valve open, the fuel pump continues pumping fuel into the fuel bowl, where the resulting excess fuel causes the fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R

40|$|A small {{cogeneration}} {{system based}} on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) fed on the renewable energy source biogas is presented. An existing farm biogas production site (35 m 3 per day), currently equipped with a SOFC demonstration stack, is taken for reference. A process flow diagram was defined in a software package allowing to vary system operating parameters like the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> composition, reforming technology, stack temperature and stack current (or fuel conversion). For system reforming simplicity, a base case parameter set {{was defined as the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> of 60 % CH 4 : 40 % CO 2 mixed with air in a 1 : 1 ratio, together with 800 8 C operating temperature and 80 % fuel conversion. A model stack, consisting of 100 series elements of anode supported electrolyte cells of 100 cm 2 each, was calculated to deliver 3. 1 kWel and 5. 16 kWth from an input of 1. 5 N m 3 /h of biogas (8. 95 kW LHV), corresponding to 33. 8 and 57. 6 % electrical and thermal efficiencies (Lower Heating Values (LHVs)), respectively. The incidence on the efficiencies of the model system was examined by the variation of a number of parameters such as the CO 2 content in the biogas, the amount of air addition to the biogas stream, the addition of steam to the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet,</b> the air excess ratio l and the stack operating temperature, and the results discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} the anode and cathode {{potentials}} of a phosphoric acid fuel cell under various conditions were studied using a single cell equipped with four reversible hydrogen electrodes located near the inlets and outlets. When pure hydro-gen gas {{was used as a}} fuel, the polarizations under load were homogeneous in the plane of the cell. However, when the re-formate gas was used, inhomogeneity in the plane arose under load. The cathode and anode potentials hifted in the posi-tive direction at the fuel outlet area. The potential shifts increased with an increase of fuel utilization or due to CO poisoning. The voltage loss due to CO poisoning (CO loss) caused an increase not only of the anode polarization but also of the cathode polarization in the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> area. The increase of cathode polarization at the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> area was due to current convergence into the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> area. The potential shifts at the fuel outlet can be attributed to he acidity change of electro-lyte there. The local acidity change of electrolyte can arise from a local starvation of hydrogen and hence of protons. Half-cell investigations have been conducted to evaluate overpotentials of the electrodes in a phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC). For example, Appleby et al. (1 - 3) and Kunz et al.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> {{temperature}} on performance, emission and combustion {{characteristics of a}} diesel engine is evaluated. A single cylinder direct injection diesel engine developing a power output of 2. 8  kW at 1500  rev/min is tested using preheated animal fat as fuel. Experiments are conducted at the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures of 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70  °C. Animal fat at low temperature results in higher ignition delay and combustion duration than diesel. Preheated animal fat shows reduced ignition delay and combustion duration. Peak pressure and rate of pressure rise are found as high with animal fat at high <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures. Heat release pattern shows reduced premixed combustion phase with animal fat as compared to neat diesel at normal temperature. Preheating improves the premixed combustion rate. At low temperature, animal fat results in lower smoke emissions than diesel. The maximum smoke density is K= 6. 5  m− 1 with diesel and K= 3. 6  m− 1 with animal fat at 30  °C. Preheated animal fat further reduces smoke levels at all temperatures. The smoke level is reduced up to K= 1. 7  m− 1 with preheated animal fat at the temperature of 70  °C. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are higher with animal fat at low temperature as compared to diesel. Fuel Preheating reduces these emissions. emission is found as low with animal fat at low temperature. Fuel preheating results in increased emission. However, the level is still lower than diesel even at high temperature (i. e. 70  °C). On the whole it is concluded that preheated animal fat {{can be used in}} diesel engines with reduced smoke, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions with no major detoriation in engine performance...|$|R

40|$|The study {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} structural parameters of an electronic fuel injector on its dynamic response (the opening delay and the closing delay). The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied. Secondly, the importance and effects of main structural parameters on dynamic response were examined, as were their interactions. Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through scattering charts and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, <b>fuel</b> oil <b>inlet</b> passage diameter, <b>fuel</b> oil outlet passage diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the opening delay, while the <b>fuel</b> oil <b>inlet</b> passage diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay.
