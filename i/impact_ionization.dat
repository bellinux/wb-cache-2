The cell efficiency operating under unconcentrated radiation is a few percent lower than in the ideal case (i. e., with perfect cooling). Wider band gap materials are recommended for those applications where the cell cooling is not effective. The best operation of naturally ventilated cells is under unconcentrated or slightly concentrated solar radiation. Increasing the (forced) ventilation rate allows an increase of the optimum concentration ratio. Additional effects such as the radiation reflectance and radiative pair recombination efficiency are also considered. A sort of threshold minimum band gap depending on the last effect is emphasized: materials with band gaps narrower than this threshold are characterized by very low cell efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{electron}} processes occur {{widely in}} atoms, molecules, clusters, and condensed matters {{when they are}} interacting with energetic particles or intense laser fields. In this work, a unified and accurate theoretical formalism is proposed on the direct multielectron processes of atoms including the multiple Auger decay and multiple <b>ionization</b> by an <b>impact</b> of an energetic electron or a photon based on the atomic collision theory described by a correlated many-body Green's function. Such a practical treatment is made possible due to different coherence features of the particles (matter waves) in the initial and final states. We first explain how the coherence characteristics of the ejected continuum electrons is largely destructed, by taking the electron <b>impact</b> direct double <b>ionization</b> process as an example. This process is completely different from the single ionization where the complete interference can be maintained. The detailed expressions are obtained for the energy correlations among the continuum electrons and energy resolved differential and integral cross sections according to the separation of knock-out and shake-off mechanisms for the electron <b>impact</b> direct double <b>ionization,</b> direct double and triple Auger decay, and double and triple photoionization processes.
