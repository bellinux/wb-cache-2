5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause <b>genital</b> <b>warts,</b> and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and penile cancer. <b>Genital</b> <b>warts</b> and cervical cancer {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E
25|$|Gardasil {{has been}} shown to also be {{effective}} in preventing <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> in males. On 9 September 2009, an advisory panel recommended that the FDA licence Gardasil in the United States for boys and men ages 9–26 for the prevention of <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b> Soon after that, the vaccine was approved by the FDA for use in males aged 9 to 26 for prevention of <b>genital</b> <b>warts</b> and anal cancer. While Gardasil and Gardasil-9 vaccines have been approved for males, the third HPV vaccine, Cervarix, is not administered to males. Unlike the Gardasil-based vaccines, Cervarix does not protect against <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The lack of {{information}} on the care for sexually transmitted infections (STI) associated syndromes may contribute for its non-inclusion as prevention and control strategy for STI in Brazil. This study aims to analyze the cases of STI – Associated Syndromes assisted in primary health care center in a city in Northeast Brazil associating them with socio-demographic and behavioral variables. Methods This is a retrospective study that analyzed 5148 consultation forms and medical records of patients assisted in a primary health care center who presented at least one genital syndrome from 1999 to 2008. Was considered as dependent variables the genital syndromes and serologies for syphilis and HIV and as independent variables the socio-demographic and behavioral aspects. It was used Pearson’s chi-square test to analyze the differences between the categorical variables, with a significance level of 5 %. It was performed a multivariate analysis through the multivariate logistic regression model with the variables with p Results The most frequent syndromes were vaginal discharge and/or cervicitis (44 %) and <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> (42. 2 %). Most people were between 20 and 39 years old (70 %) and women (74. 2 %). Genital ulcer was most prevalent among men (OR[*]=[*] 2. 67; CI 95 % 1. 99 - 3. 58) and people who studied more than eight years (OR[*]=[*] 1. 33; CI 95 % 1. 00 - 1. 75) and wart prevailed among men (OR[*]=[*] 3. 92; IC 95 % 3. 36 - 4. 57), people under 29 years old (OR[*]=[*] 1. 81; CI 95 % 1. 59 - 2. 07) and who studied more than eight years (OR[*]=[*] 1. 75; CI 95 % 1. 54 - 1. 99). The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) was positive in 7. 3 % of men and in 7. 1 % of women and the Anti-HIV in 3. 1 % of men and 0. 7 % of women. Conclusion Vaginal discharge was the most frequent syndrome assisted in primary health care, followed by <b>genital</b> <b>wart.</b> The high prevalence of <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> justifies the greater effort for the proper follow-up of these cases. Men presented more <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> and ulcer and reported having more sexual partners, showing their need for a greater access and inclusion in health activities developed in primary health care in Brazil. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of sexually transmitted infections (STI) varies widely from region to region in our country. Aims: To highlight {{the pattern of}} STIs and the profile of patients with HIV infection in STD patients as seen at our hospital. Methods: A retrospective chart analysis of clients attending STI clinic, JIPMER, Puducherry, from June 2004 to June 2006 was done. Results: A total of 866 clients attended our STI clinic, out of whom 435 (50. 2 &#x 0025;) had proven STI. STIs were more common in men, with a male (290) : female (145) ratio of 2 : 1. Their age ranged from 1 year to 75 years (mean age = 32. 38 years) with {{the maximum number of}} patients in the age group of 21 - 30 years, while children constituted only 2. 8 &#x 0025;. Herpes genitalis (107 patients, 32. 8 &#x 0025;) was the most common ulcerative STI, while <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> was the most common nonulcerative STI (56 patients, 17. 1 &#x 0025;). Non-gonococcal urethritis (46 patients, 14. 1 &#x 0025;) was more common than gonococcal urethritis. HIV infection was the most common STI in our study, at an alarmingly high rate of 34. 5 &#x 0025; (151 / 435). HIV seropositivity was more common in patients who presented with ulcerative STIs than with nonulcerative STIs. Conclusions: Herpes genitalis was the most common ulcerative STD, while <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> was the most common nonulcerative STI in our study. The {{prevalence of}} HIV among STI clients in India has been on the rise, but has quite alarmingly become the most common STI in our study...|$|R
25|$|HPV (Human Papillomavirus)—skin and mucosal contact. 'High risk' {{types of}} HPV cause almost all {{cervical}} cancers, {{as well as}} some anal, penile, and vulvar cancer. Some other types of HPV cause <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Together, {{these two}} HPV types {{currently}} cause about 70 {{percent of all}} cervical cancer. Gardasil also targets HPV types 6 and 11, which together currently cause about 90 percent of all cases of <b>genital</b> <b>warts.</b>|$|E

40|$|A 25 -year-old {{black man}} had a 20 -year history of disseminated plaques on his body. Two years before {{consultation}} he noticed several tumors on the genitalia. Physical examination revealed generalized, coalescing, hypopigmented plaques with a very defined and keratotic border that resembled actinic porokeratosis. (Fig. 1). Multiple verrucous and moist tumors were observed on the scrotum (Fig. 2). His past medical history was unremarkable, and no family member had the disease. Histology of the body lesions revealed hyperkeratosis with a horny-layer, basket-weave appearance, large and clear blue–gray keratinocytes with finely granular cytoplasm and vacuolized nuclei, and abundant keratohyaline granules located in the upper epidermal layer (Fig. 3). Scrotum biopsy showed hyperkeratosis, irregular acanthosis with papillomatosis, and koilocytic figures. The genital lesions were treated with monthly cryotherapy plus surgical excision with complete disappearance of the lesions. A decrease in ultraviolet exposure and daily sun-block were encouraged for epidermodysplasia verruciformis lesions. After <b>genital</b> <b>wart</b> clearance, follow-ups are being scheduled every 4 months, with no new lesions to date...|$|R
25|$|Genital human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is a common}} virus that most sexually active people in the U.S. will have {{at some time in}} their lives. It is passed on through genital contact and is also found on areas that condoms do not cover. Most men who get HPV of any type never develop any symptoms or health problems. Some types of HPV can cause <b>genital</b> <b>warts,</b> penile cancer, or anal cancer. MSM and men with compromised immune systems are more likely than other men to develop anal cancer.

25|$|In most cases, {{there are}} no {{symptoms}} of HPV infection other than the warts themselves.

25|$|<b>Genital</b> <b>warts,</b> {{which are}} a form of benign tumor of {{epithelial}} cells, are also caused by various strains of HPV.
