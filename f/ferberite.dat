50|$|Since hübnerite {{comes from}} a family with only two end members {{it would be easier}} to explain the {{composition}} of the wolframite family since there is not enough data on hübnerite itself.

The iron dominated one will result in forming <b>ferberite</b> while the manganese dominated one will result in forming hübnerite. Hübnerite is rarer than <b>ferberite</b> due to the difficulty of iron and manganese substitution. There is also a magnesium substitution involved to form an MgWO4.

Textural relations of the breakdown products characterized by the total absence of any depleted primary phase in the BSE images indicate that the secondary assemblage did not originated from an exsolution-type process.
