5|$|Krishna's {{childhood}} {{illustrates the}} Hindu concept of lila, playing {{for fun and}} enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were <b>doing,</b> <b>to</b> {{the banks of the}} Yamuna River, and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.|$|E

5|$|Blackburn {{and his son}} Cary {{traveled}} to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in September 1854 to secure an apprenticeship for Cary under noted physician Samuel D. Gross. While they were there, a yellow fever outbreak hit Fort Washington near Long Island, New York. The mayor of New York City asked Blackburn to help treat victims of the outbreak; Blackburn accepted the invitation and refused compensation for his services. When he returned home in November 1856, he found his wife Ella, who suffered from dropsy and a nervous condition, ailing with a fever. Despite Blackburn's efforts to save her, Ella Blackburn's condition worsened and she died {{before the end of}} the month. Blackburn was stricken with grief, and friends encouraged him to tour Europe, as he had often spoken of <b>doing,</b> <b>to</b> ease his sorrow. He did so in early 1857, visiting hospitals in England, Scotland, France, and Germany. While in Paris, Blackburn met fellow Kentuckian Julia M. Churchill, who was traveling with her sister and niece. Blackburn and Churchill cut their journeys short, returned home, and were married in November 1857. After their honeymoon, the couple took up residence in New Orleans in January 1858, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice. A brief poem written by Blackburn indicates that the couple had a daughter named Abby, but the child apparently died as an infant, and her birth and death dates are unknown.|$|E

5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the Order of Canada be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the Order of the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the Order of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.|$|E

Production {{was provided by}} Hit-Boy, Da Internz, Lex Luger and Key Wane. Before the album's release, Big Sean released a handful of his inspirational video blogs, which gets in touch on how far he has gotten to where he’s at throughout his career and what he plans on <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> further his position in music. Most of his vlogs feature cameo appearances from Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Pusha T, Common, No I.D., Rita Ora, Trey Songz, Wale, Wiz Khalifa, Lupe Fiasco, Teyana Taylor and T-Pain, among others. Starting on February 23, 2013, Sean began a European tour in promotion of the album, which continued until March 13, 2013.

At the core of Shingon worship are the various mandalas, diagrams of the spiritual universe that influenced temple design. The temples erected for this new sect {{were built in the}} mountains, far away from the court and the laity in the capital.

25|$|Racial {{violence}} continued {{by whites}} against blacks as they enforced white supremacy. Despite this, freedmen pursued education, organize new churches and fraternal organizations, and entered politics, winning local offices. By the 1890s, more than 100,000 blacks were voting in state elections. In 1896 and 1898, Republican Robert B. Hawley {{was elected to}} Congress from the state by a plurality, when most white voters split between the Democratic and Populist parties. Democrats were determined to end competition by Republicans and Populists, and reviewed what other Southern states were <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> disenfranchise blacks and poor whites. Mississippi's new constitution of 1890 had survived a Supreme Court case, although in practice it was highly discriminatory against freedmen.|$|E
25|$|The damage George Holloway was <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> the Head and the {{coastline}} became apparent and local opposition grew. There was also some dispute {{as to whether}} he had violated the terms of his lease. Even so, {{by the time he was}} stopped in 1867, a third of the Head had been removed or lost through increased erosion and his mine had almost cut through to the sea beyond. Removal of the ironstone doggers on the sea side of the Head caused the Spit at the Harbour entrance to grow in length, extending to Steamer point by 1890. A long groyne had to be constructed to take the place of the missing doggers and check the erosion. In 1930, after Christchurch Council had refused to meet the asking price, Hengistbury Head (then in private ownership) was sold to Bournemouth for £25,000.|$|E
25|$|Dessalines and Pétion {{remained}} {{allied with}} France until they switched sides again, in October 1802, and {{fought against the}} French. As Leclerc laid dying of yellow fever and heard that Christophe and Dessalines had joined the rebels, he reacted by ordering all of the blacks living in Le Cap be killed by drowning them in the harbour. In November, Leclerc died of yellow fever, like much of his army. His successor, the Vicomte de Rochambeau, fought an even more brutal campaign. Rochambeau waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Haitians, simply killing everybody who was black. Rochambeau imported about 15, 000 attack dogs from Jamaica, who had trained to savage blacks and mulattoes. At the Bay of Le Cap, Rochambeau had blacks drowned so that no-one would eat fish from the bay for months afterward as no one wished to eat the fish that had eaten human flesh. Bonaparte, hearing {{that most of his}} army in St. Domingue had died of yellow fever and the French only held Port-au-Prince, Le Cap and Les Cayes sent about 20, 000 reinforcements to Rochambeau. Dessalines matched Rochambeau in his vicious cruelty. At Le Cap, when Rochambeau hanged 500 blacks, Dessalines replied by killing 500 whites and sticking their heads on spikes all around Le Cap, so that the French could see what he was planning on <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> them. Rochambeau's atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the rebel cause. Many on both sides had come to see the war as a race war where no mercy was to be given, and the Haitians were just as brutal as the French, as they burned French prisoners alive, cut them up with axes, or tied to a board and sawed them into two. Having sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in April 1803, Napoleon began to lose interest in his failing ventures in the Western Hemisphere. He was more concerned about France's European enemies such as Great Britain and Prussia. With that, he withdrew a majority of the French forces in Haiti to counter the possibility of an invasion from Prussia, Britain, and Spain on a weakened France.|$|E
