5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm <b>just</b> <b>tired,</b> and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} Rosa story {{featuring}} The Three Caballeros, Donald Duck is {{shocked by the}} sight of a capybara standing on its hind legs, with shrubs, leaves and fruit in front of its body, coincidentally making it look like Mickey Mouse. José Carioca and Panchito Pistoles, never having seen Mickey Mouse, ask Donald what is wrong, but Donald replies he is <b>just</b> <b>tired.</b> Later in the same story, the Caballeros free several animals from a poacher. One panel shows the animals fleeing; Mickey can be seen among them.|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} escalated to {{the point}} where death threats were sent to Time-Warner executives, and stockholders threatened {{to pull out of the}} company. Finally, Ice-T decided to remove [...] "Cop Killer" [...] from the album of his own volition, a decision which was met by criticism from other artists who derided Ice-T for [...] "caving in to external pressure." [...] In an interview, Ice-T stated that [...] "I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the only reason that record sold. It just got outta hand and I was <b>just</b> <b>tired</b> of hearing it. I said, 'fuck it,' I mean they're saying we did it for money, and we didn't. I'd gave the record away, ya know, let's move on, let's get back to real issues, not a record, but the cops that are out there killing people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laird and Eastman's creations went on {{to become}} a popular {{cultural}} phenomenon, forcing both of them to take regular sabbaticals from the comic to deal with the day to day pressures of running what had become a multimedia franchise. Eastman sold his share of the franchise, with the exception of a small continuing income participation, to Laird and the Mirage Group on June 1, 2000. On March 1, 2008, Laird and Mirage bought out Eastman's remaining rights and interest and the two went their separate ways. Concerning Eastman's departure, Laird stated his belief that Eastman [...] "was <b>just</b> <b>tired</b> of it." [...] On October 19, 2009, Laird sold the franchise to Viacom parent company of Nickelodeon, but still retains the rights to create and publish up to eighteen black-and-white comics based on the franchise per year.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the release}} of the Use Your Illusion albums, Stradlin had become {{dissatisfied}} with life in Guns N' Roses. He later recalled, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was <b>just</b> <b>tired</b> of it; I needed to get out." [...] On November 7, 1991, it was announced that Stradlin had left Guns N' Roses. He had played his final show as an official member of the band on August 31 at Wembley Stadium. Of his reasons for leaving, Stradlin later said, [...] "I didn't like the complications that became such a part of daily life in Guns N' Roses," [...] citing the Riverport riot and Axl Rose's chronic lateness on the Use Your Illusion Tour as examples. He stated that getting sober played a part in his decision to leave, saying, [...] "When you're fucked up, you're more likely to put up with things you wouldn't normally put up with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was <b>just</b> <b>tired</b> of it; I needed to get out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, we realized that we either had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but nobody seemed right. For a while it looked like Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was going to join, but he couldn't get it together, so that never happened." [...] Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke, whom Slash credited for saving the band.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 April 1802, the {{situation}} suddenly changed when Christophe defected {{with much of}} the Haitian Army over to the French. Louverture was promised his freedom if he agreed to integrate his remaining troops into the French army. Louverture agreed to this on 6 May 1802. Just why Toussaint was motivated to just give up {{has been the subject of}} much debate with most probable explanation being after he was <b>just</b> <b>tired</b> after 11 years of war. Under the terms of surrender, Leclerc gave his solemn word that slavery would not be restored in St. Domingue, that blacks could be officers in the French Army, allowed the Haitian Army to be integrated into the French Army, and gave Toussaint a plantation at Ennery. Toussaint was later deceived, seized by the French and shipped to France. He died months later in prison at Fort-de-Joux in the Jura region. Shortly afterwards, the ferocious Dessalines rode into Le Cap to submit to France and was rewarded by being made the governor of Saint-Marc, a place that Dessalines ruled with his customary cruelty. However, the surrender of Christophe, Toussaint and Dessalines did not mean the end of Haitian resistance. Throughout the countryside, guerrilla warfare continued and the French staged mass executions via firing squads, hanging and drowning Haitians in bags. Rochambeau invented a new means of mass execution, which he called [...] "fumigational-sulphurous baths" [...] of killing hundreds of Haitians in the holds of ships by burning sulphur to make sulphur dioxide to gas them.|$|E

5000|$|The {{really good}} {{idea was to}} provide habitat for marine critters so we could double or triple marine life in the area, ...It just didn't work that way.

I know I'll be fearfully cranky by the time I'm sixty. But perhaps all I need is a course of blue pills."
