40|$|An {{index was}} {{developed}} to estimate the bioeconomic efficiency of production systems, <b>identifying</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> that could improve their efficiency, and building isoefficiency relations in beef cattle production systems in Rio Grande do Sul. The concept of return on investment was used to develop the indicator. Scenarios regarded as efficient showed values higher than 3. The bioeconomic efficiency index for beef cattle production in the theoretical reference scenario was considered inefficient. At least four modifications in the variables method made it a bioeconomically efficient activity. These circumstances were studied using sensitivity analyses, with theoretical changes in the scenarios by changing variables two by two, while the others were kept constant. In Rio Grande do Sul, alternatives that make the activity efficient were identified by changing productivity, production cost, land price and product price. Isoefficiency relationships were identified in other scenarios. The application of this indicator in other agricultural activities, {{as well as the}} design of bioefficiency studies including both environmental and social welfare characteristics are recommended...|$|E

The proposed method intends to provide the foundation for an intelligent system that can assist design engineers and managers of the design process. The IDEF 3 methodology is {{used to describe the}} concurrent design process. The logical semantics of IDEF 3 provide a much more detailed description than traditional project management methods, such as CPM. The IDEF 3 model is then used to <b>identify</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> that result in the successful completion of a design project. Using estimates of the likelihood that a scenario will fail to produce a successful design and the consequences that result, <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> are evaluated.

40|$|Two {{opposing}} narratives are {{now facing}} on marginal rural areas. The first {{one looks at}} these areas as monolithic, characterized by overwhelming negative trends. The continuous decrease of population {{and the absence of}} immigration processes represent insurmountable obstacles to any chance of development and revitalization. It is difficult to establish a virtuous circle: even if the role of institutions is active in promoting projects for the revitalization of local micro-economies. A second narrative emphasize cases of people who have chosen an opposite migration project: leave the cities to settle in remote areas. The paper focuses on a case study, the neo-rural network in the Borbera and Curone Valleys (North Italy). The reconstruction of their experience and the analysis of the their social networks allow us to focus on the dynamics of marginal areas, <b>identifying</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>scenarios.</b> It is necessary, therefore, to reverse the perspective, highlighting the signs of a change...|$|R

Prague: Charles University, Faculty of Social Sciences, Institute of International Studies, 2009. 69 p. Supervisor Doc. PhDr. Jiri Vykoukal, CS. Annotation The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a clear view of the current {{conflict}} of the United States' and Russia's geopolitical and geostrategic interests in Europe. Furthermore, the author will try - by addressing the most relevant problems - to <b>identify</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> that may result from this conflict in the near future. At the same time the author is advocating the point that tensions in relations between the US and Russia will not improve any time soon because of fundamentally confronted interests as well as because of the influence of realist logic that dominates the political spectrum on both sides. The author argues that the basis of the new security arrangement in Europe can emerge from the tightening of Russia-Germany relations (especially in the sphere of energy security) and more independent EU policies in the sphere of military affairs.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this critical review is twofold. Firstly, we intend to tackle a number of assumptions that view the Greek crisis {{as the result of}} a marked resistance to (neoliberal) structural reforms and the failure to engage constructively with the challenges of globalisation. Instead, we argue that Greece was set on a neoliberal trajectory much before the crisis erupted, and that it is precisely this sustained neoliberalisation process – rather than its absence – that lays behind much of Greece’s current troubles. Secondly, we attempt an assessment of the prospect that SYRIZA’s victory may be signalling the start of a counter-neoliberal mobilisation. Drawing on the work of Brenner and others, we <b>identify</b> four <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> – capitulation, divorce, compromise, transformation – and discuss their implications for Greece and the Eurozon...|$|R
40|$|In its {{broadest}} sense, perestroika may encompass {{economic reforms}} or restructuring, openness to criticism, and democratization. One may attribute perestroika significantly to low performance, if not failure, in the Soviet system-notably, {{the need to}} modernize and to rectify lagging growth rates. The economic content of perestroika embodies fairly radical and comprehensive changes-notably, expanding enterprise autonomy and price mechanisms, reducing the scope and intensity of centralized planning, and allowing a larger role for individual and cooperative enterprise. Soviet experience supports the view that economic and political reforms are connected. " Glasnost (openness) "and democratization have expanded, partly as means to foster public support for economic restructuring. Such support is crucial, due to competing factions within the Communist Party and to the Party's opposition to more radical or democratizing reforms. Mikhail Gorbachev, after rejecting both Stalinism and post-Stalinism, has turned to pre-Stalinist sources-the Bolshevik Revolution, Lenin, Bukharin-for intellectual inspirations. Obstacles to reforms are substantial, and one may <b>identify</b> several <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios.</b> " Copyright 1989 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R
30|$|The <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> {{is defined}} {{in the body of}} investigation, in which both FAPs and 802.11 n APs have a total {{bandwidth}} of 20 MHz with different frequency reuse pattern 1 and 3, respectively. The result of 1 FAP and 1 802.11 n AP for both conventional and <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> are identical as shown in Figure 4 a. Figure 4 c,d, average user data rate and ERG performance for 1 FAP and 3 FAPs in both conventional and <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> with a baseline 802.11 n network. In the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario,</b> FAP outperforms 802.11 AP when the number of APs is 3. The average user data rate for three FAPs is 1.12 Mbit/s while this value for 3 802.11 APs is 0.22 Mbit/s. This is because 802.11 AP suffers server interference from other APs in the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> and its PHY adopts convolution codes which is less efficient than turbo codes used in LTE-femtocell. Figure 4 d indicates three FAPs provides an ERG of 20.08 % in <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> while 3 802.11 n APs offers an ERG of 21.80 % in conventional scenario.

30|$|The NAIADE multicriteria {{analysis}} aims at ranking <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> on {{the basis}} of their performance as to certain evaluation criteria. Towards this end, the impact matrix is used (criteria/alternatives matrix), incorporating scores that can take the following forms: crisp numbers, stochastic elements, fuzzy elements and linguistic elements (such as ‘good’, ‘moderate’ etc.) [54, 56]. The comparison of <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> is based on the concept of ‘distance’ between two <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> as to a certain evaluation criterion. When dealing with crisp numbers, this distance is calculated by subtracting respective crisp numbers. In any other case, the concept of ‘semantic distance’ is used, measuring the distance between two functions, via which the scores of the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> are expressed. The final ranking of alternatives is the outcome (intersection) of two separate rankings: the Φ+(a) ranking that is based on the ‘better’ and ‘much better’ preference relationships; and the Φ−(a) ranking that is based on the ‘worse and ‘much worse’ preference relationships (for more information see [56]).|$|R

30|$|Roinioti et al. (2012) {{examined}} the Greek energy {{system with a}} focus on electricity production system. The authors used LEAP and created a business-as-usual <b>scenario</b> and four <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> based on uncertainties and growth assumptions. Specifically, the first <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> is the green scenario which assumes low emissions and high growth rate, with the introduction of advanced RES technologies. The orange scenario assumes high emissions and high growth rate, the red scenario assumes high emissions and low growth rate, and the blue scenario assumes low emissions and low growth rate. The results indicated that from an environmental point of view, the best is the green scenario and the worst is the orange scenario. In addition, green is the only scenario to achieve the 40 % RES target in electricity production by 2020. Ikonomopoulos et al. (2013) investigated the greenhouse gas emissions in the Greek electricity sector by 2030. The authors created a reference <b>scenario</b> and three <b>alternatives.</b> The reference <b>scenario</b> assumes that old power stations will close and new RES stations will open according to the announcements and time schedule of the Ministry of Environment. The first <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> assumes delays in closing of old thermal stations and opening new advanced ones. The second <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> assumes the connection of islands to the mainland grid, and the last scenario assumes the introduction of hard coal in Greek power generation. The results revealed that all four scenarios reduce emissions and highlighted the key role of RES.|$|R
30|$|The equity {{analysis}} {{constitutes the}} second step of the NAIADE method. The aim of the analysis is to explore potential ‘alliances’ or ‘conflicts’ among groups of stakeholders against alternative scenarios’ prioritization. For this purpose, an equity matrix is constructed, whose elements represent, in a qualitative way (linguistic expressions), the judgments of stakeholders’ groups in respect of <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> (i.e. different prioritization for each specific group according to own interests). Elaboration of these data results in the calculation of a similarity matrix, where the degree of judgments’ similarity of each pair of stakeholders’ groups (i, j) is presented. Calculations involved in this respect {{are based on the}} ‘semantic distance’ among the judgments of each single pair of stakeholders’ groups for each <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> [56]. The interpretation of the results emanating from this step can provide planners valuable information with respect to ‘resistance’ or ‘consensus’ reached among stakeholders’ groups as to the proposed <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios.</b>|$|R
40|$|The benefit (or additionality) {{attributable}} to a conservation action {{is the difference}} between the outcomes of two scenarios: (1) the scenario with the conservation action, and (2) the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario,</b> in which action did not occur.

We review recent scientific literature and conservation policies to examine how conservation benefit is calculated in three situations: systematic reserve selection, investment in agri-environment schemes, and biodiversity offset trades. In the examples we considered, the approaches used to calculate conservation benefit often involved assumptions about the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> that were not explicit, demonstrably wrong or both. We suggest that assumptions about how conservation value changes over time in the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> can often be substantially refined, and that making these assumptions explicit by calculating directly the expected difference between the two scenarios is likely {{to improve the quality of}} conservation decision-making...|$|R
