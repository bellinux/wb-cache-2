5|$|A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of {{convergence}} {{in plants}} is {{the evolution of}} edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the site}} was {{considered}} for scheduling by English Heritage, because of its national importance as a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of a late 20th-century power station. It was also important because of its use as a testing ground for various generating sizes, from which came success in the UK's electricity industry. However, by then the station's buildings were in poor condition {{and it would have}} been financially difficult to ensure their long term preservation. Instead, it was decided a comprehensive study and photographic record of the station would be commissioned.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present paper investigates {{identification}} of indexed families L of recursively enumerable languages from <b>good</b> <b>examples.</b> We distinguish class-preserving learning from <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> (the <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> {{have to be}} generated {{with respect to a}} hypothesis space having the same range as L) and class-comprising learning from <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> (the <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> have to be selected with respect to a hypothesis space comprising the range of L). A learner is required to learn a target language on every finite superset of the <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> for it. If the learner's first and only conjecture is correct then the underlying learning model is referred to as finite identification from <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> and if the learner makes a finite number of incorrect conjectures before always outputting a correct one, the model is referred to as limit identification from <b>good</b> <b>examples.</b> In the context of class-preserving learning, it is shown that the learning power of finite and limit identification from <b>good</b> text <b>examples</b> coincide. When class comprising learning from <b>good</b> text <b>examples</b> is concerned, limit identification is strictly more powerful than finite learning. Furthermore, if learning from <b>good</b> informant <b>examples</b> is considered, limit identification is superior to finite identification in the class preserving {{as well as in the}} class-comprising case. Finally, we relate the models of learning from <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> to one another as well as to the standard learning models in the context of Gold-style language learning...|$|R

5|$|This {{larger scale}} {{building}} activity, from the mid-8th century on, was {{a manifestation of}} the emergence of tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures on a new level.

5|$|Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, {{also known}} as Becker's Marathon Gas Station, is a {{historic}} filling station located {{at the intersection of}} Old U.S. Route 66 and Illinois Route 17 in the village of Dwight, Illinois, United States. The station has been identified as the longest operating gas station along Route 66; it dispensed fuel for 66 continuous years until 1999. The station is a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of a domestic style gas station and derives its most common names from ownership stints by two different men. North of the station is an extant outbuilding that once operated as a commercial icehouse. Ambler's was the subject of major restoration work from 20052007, and reopened as a Route 66 visitor's center in May 2007. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E

5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|During World WarI, the palace, {{then the}} home of King GeorgeV and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more {{valuable}} contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much {{to the dismay of}} his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to set a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more {{as a warning to}} the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
5|$|First {{announced}} in 2005, Titan Quest received generally positive reviews when released, being both praised as a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> {{of the genre}} {{while at the same}} time being criticized for its traditional gameplay. Sales of the main game and its expansion have been estimated as approaching one million units. The mobile port was tricky for its developers due to adapting the game for touchscreen controls: like the console version, it received positive reviews upon release. The engine and gameplay of Titan Quest later became the foundation for Grim Dawn, a video game developed by team members from Iron Lore following the studio's closure. In 2016, an improved and expanded Anniversary Edition was released and received very positive reviews.|$|E
