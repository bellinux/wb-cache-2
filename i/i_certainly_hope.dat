500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>hope</b> that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to try to come up with a way to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could recall}} no more the {{hallucination}} of the Eastern Archipelago which <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>hoped</b> to see again. The story of [...] "Almayer's Folly" [...] got put away under the pillow for that day. I {{do not know}} that I had any occupation to keep me away from it; {{the truth of the matter}} is that on board that ship we were leading just then a contemplative life. I will not say anything of my privileged position. I was there [...] "just to oblige," [...] as an actor of standing may take a small part in the benefit performance of a friend.|$|R
50|$|Tribunal president: <b>I</b> would <b>certainly</b> <b>hope</b> so, {{especially}} {{since you are}} {{under the care of}} the U.S. government while you are here.

I have asked {{a man from the}} city to dinner; he will put in an appearance before I am fit. So sorry we cannot stop to see the boy in his nest. I understand he slumbers on a roof top--under the stars--like every one else out here. Isn't sleeping out of doors a fad? So admirable for the complexion! Really one might leave the country with a decent bank balance, if only one had nerve to rent an oak tree instead of rooms in a hotel."

[...] <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>hope</b> the Irish people force that newspaper's editor to apologise for the great hurt caused by that article". Scotland Yard received a complaint. Gately's record company also issued a complaint to the PCC. The PCC did not uphold the complaint, stating: [...] "It found the article caused some offence but there was insufficient evidence it breached the law." [...] Tony Connell, CPS London complex casework lawyer, said: [...] "In coming to this conclusion I have paid particular attention to Article 10 of the Human Rights Act which protects individuals' freedom of expression. It is an established legal principle that this freedom applies equally to information and ideas that are favourably received as to those which offend, shock and disturb. Though the complainants and many others found this article offensive, this does not make its publication unlawful." ...|$|E

But until 1916 I never saw a dolphin. <b>Certainly</b> <b>I</b> never <b>hoped</b> to take one of these rare and beautiful deep-sea fish. Never would have the luck.

6000|$|... "Mr. Homos," [...] I broke in, {{with the}} {{strength}} I found in his assurance {{that no one had}} seen him helping the porter black boots, [...] "I want to speak very seriously with you, and I hope you will not be hurt if I speak very plainly about a matter in which I have your good solely at heart." [...] This was not quite true, and I winced inwardly a little when he thanked me with that confounded sincerity of his which was so much like irony; but I went on: [...] "It is my duty to you, as my guest, to tell you that this thing of doing for others is not such a simple matter here, as your peculiar training leads you to think. You have been deceived by a superficial likeness; but, really, I do not understand how you could have read all you have done about us and not realize before coming here that America and Altruria are absolutely distinct and diverse in their actuating principles. They are both republics, I know; but America is a republic where every man is for himself, and you cannot help others as you do at home; it is dangerous--it is ridiculous. You must keep this fact in mind, or you will fall into errors that will be very embarrassing to you in your stay among us, and," [...] I was forced to add, [...] "to all your friends. Now, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>hoped,</b> after what <b>I</b> had said to you and what my friends had explained of our civilization, that you would not have done a thing of this kind. I will see the porter, as soon as I am up, and ask him not to mention the matter to any one, but, I confess, I don't like to take an apologetic tone with him; your conditions are so alien to ours that they will seem incredible to him, and he will think I am stuffing him." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper briefly {{reviews the}} history and {{progress}} of trace metal marine ecotoxicology {{over the past few}} decades. Three main areas of metal ecotoxicology are transport in the environment, accumulation and toxicity, as well as the risk assessment. We have seen tremendous progresses in these areas as a result of interdisciplinary efforts by biologists, chemists, engineers, governmental regulators and managers. I then discuss the future perspectives of metal ecotoxicology. It is expected that this field will receive increasing attention in China. <b>Certainly</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that Xiamen can become a center for metal ecotoxicology and biogeochemistry research...|$|R
5000|$|June Jordan, {{writing in}} the New York Times called it [...] "Beautifully written" [...] but criticised the stories writing [...] "If these folk tales were not meant for {{children}} (quiet or otherwise), then the relentless chicanery of the protagonist would not matter so much, nor would the sometimes positively homicidal humor of the material." [...] and concluded [...] "This misbegotten resurrection is a terrible waste of very considerable talents. Julius Lester comes through at his irresistible best, as a compelling and frequently hilarious teller of tall tales. Every single illustration by Jerry Pinkney is fastidious, inspired and a marvel of delightful imagination. Perhaps Mr. Lester and Mr. Pinkney will soon collaborate on new material more worthy of their labors. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> so." ...|$|R

40|$|I wish {{to thank}} my advisor Vibhav Gogate without whom this {{dissertation}} {{would not have been}} possible. Vibhav has been a great advisor who inspired me to work hard and maintain high standards of research by setting a fine example.

Best of all, he has always been patient, friendly and approachable. <b>I</b> would <b>certainly</b> <b>hope</b> to emulate some of his traits as I embark on my own academic career. Next, I {{wish to thank}} members of my dissertation committee, Dr. Gopal Gupta, Dr. Sanda Harabagiu, Dr. Ray Mooney and Dr. Vincent Ng, for the time they have taken not only for my dissertation but also in my job search process. Particularly, Dr. Mooney was kind enough to serve on my committee from UT-Austin and I am grateful for this. I also wish to thank Somdeb, Chen, Dr. Parag Singla and Dr. Vincent Ng for collaborating with me on various projects due to which I gained a lot of insight into several different research areas. Needless to say, my family has supported me enormously in completing this dissertation. It is hard to thank Krithika enough for the love, patience and faith that she has shown in me during numerous ups and downs associated with Ph. D. life. Were it not for her support,...|$|R

60|$|I may frankly confess {{now that}} at the time I did not quite {{comprehend}} what Mr. Pater really meant; and it was not till I had carefully studied his beautiful and suggestive essays on the Renaissance that I fully realised what a wonderful self-conscious art the art of English prose- writing really is, or may be made to be. Carlyle's stormy rhetoric, Ruskin's winged and passionate eloquence, had seemed to me to spring from enthusiasm rather than from art. I do not think I knew then that even prophets correct their proofs. As for Jacobean prose, I thought it too exuberant; and Queen Anne prose appeared to me terribly bald, and irritatingly rational. But Mr. Pater's essays became to me 'the golden book of spirit and sense, the holy writ of beauty.' They are still this to me. It is possible, of course, that I may exaggerate about them. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>hope</b> that I do; for where there is no exaggeration there is no love, and where there is no love there is no understanding. It is only about things that do not interest one, that one can give a really unbiassed opinion; and this is no doubt the reason why an unbiassed opinion is always valueless.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few weeks}} ago, I wrote to our friend Harry Drury of facetious [...] memory, to request he would prevail on his brother at Eton to receive [...] {{the son of}} a citizen in London well known unto me as a pupil; the [...] family having been {{particularly}} polite during the short time I was [...] with them, induced me to this application. [...] "Now mark what follows," [...] as [...] somebody or Southey sublimely saith: on this day, the 17th December, [...] arrives an epistle signed B. Drury, containing not the smallest [...] reference to tuition or intuition, but a petition for Robert [...] Gregson, [2] of pugilistic notoriety, now in bondage for certain [...] paltry pounds sterling, and liable to take up his everlasting abode in [...] Banco Regis. Had this letter been from any of my lay acquaintance, [...] or, in short, from anyone but the gentleman whose signature it bears, [...] I should have marvelled not. If Drury is serious, I congratulate [...] pugilism on the acquisition of such a patron, and shall be happy to [...] advance any sum necessary for the liberation of the captive Gregson; [...] but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>hope</b> to be certified from you or some reputable [...] housekeeper of the fact, before I write to Drury on the subject. When [...] I say the fact, I mean of the letter being written by Drury, not [...] having any doubt as to the authenticity of the statement. The letter [...] is now before me, and I keep it for your perusal. When I hear from you [...] I shall address my answer to him, under your care; for as it is now [...] the vacation at Eton, and the letter is without time or place, I [...] cannot venture to consign my sentiments on so momentous a concern [...] to chance.|$|E

I was stunned, though, by the suggestion that there were some people questioning about whether she would have actually done this or not. That shocked me.
