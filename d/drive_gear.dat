25|$|Lever drags {{work through}} cam action to {{increase}} or decrease pressure on the drag washers located on the spool itself. Most lever drags offer preset drag positions for strike (reduced drag to avoid tearing the hook out of the fish), full (used once the hook is set) and freespool (see above). Lever drags are simpler and faster to adjust during the fight. And, since they use the spool for the washer stack rather than the <b>drive</b> <b>gear,</b> the washers can be larger, offering more resistance and smoother action. The disadvantage is that in freespool, there can be residual and unwanted resistance since the drag mechanism may not be {{completely out of the}} picture without resorting to more complex mechanics.|$|E

25|$|Only {{available}} as a hatchback (later also a convertible) in the United States, the Canadian market also received Japanese-built four-door sedans. Canadian sales of the Geo Metro only began in 1992, after {{the demise of the}} As√ºna brand. For 1990, the Metro's second model year, Geo introduced the Metro LSi models, which included an automatic transmission, air conditioning and a stereo with cassette player. Geo also introduced the frugal XFi model, featuring a lower powered economy-tuned version of the three-cylinder engine, a higher final <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> ratio, and certain deleted interior amenities (e.g., the passenger mirror). It thereby achieved 43 city, 51 highway per the revised 2007 EPA mileage standards. XFi made up less than 10% of Metro sales. A little bit later, the Japanese-built convertible model debuted, available in LSi trim. In 1991, GM increased convertible production and added paint options. In 1992, the Metro received a facelift with new hubcaps, exterior modification and new interior controls.|$|E
25|$|Unexpected {{problems}} and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced {{abandonment of the}} station for safety reasons, had these problems not been resolved. During STS-120 in 2007, following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly. An EVA {{was carried out by}} Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas Wheelock. The men took extra precautions {{to reduce the risk of}} electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight. The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint, and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage. Repairs to the joint were carried out during STS-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint.|$|E

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, dynamic behaviors of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks {{are yet to}} be investigated. Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives,</b> dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion dedendum fatigue cracks of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives.</b> These contributions would improve engineering applications of face <b>gear</b> <b>drives</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{theoretical}} flow ripple of an external gear pump is studied for pumps of similar size using different numbers of teeth on the driving and <b>driven</b> <b>gears.</b> External gear pumps {{with three different}} types of tooth profiles are studied. Nondimensional flowrates and fluctuation coefficients of gear pumps are discussed. By using the formula, flowrates can be calculated accurately and efficiently. Results indicate that: {{in the case of}} the same displacement (except teeth number and tooth width, other parameters of the gear pump are the same) the gear pump flow pulsation decreases with the increasing of the teeth number. We also concluded that changing tooth profiles on the driving and <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> can get different pulse amplitude of the flow ripple...|$|R
2500|$|The 567 is {{laid out}} with engine {{accessories}} (oil and water pumps and governors) at the [...] "forward" [...] end and the power take off at the [...] "rear" [...] end. The blowers and camshafts are at the [...] "rear" [...] end of the engine, with the blowers mounted above the power take off."The full line of engines was designed with the same general arrangement, revising basically only the length of crankshaft and crankcase to [...] the required number of cylinders. It appeared that the most satisfactory method of having the engine accessories such as pumps, governor, etc. easily maintained would be to drive them through a gear train at the forward end of the engine, that is, opposite the power take-off end. Having {{the location of the}} pumps all {{at one end of the}} engine, called the accessory drive end, fitted very well into locomotive installation. A leaf spring flexible <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> mounted on the crankshaft was used to eliminate all crankshaft torsional vibration from the gear train."By using either one or two blowers for an 8 or 12 cylinder engine respectively and mounting them above the main generator, it was possible to shorten the overall length of the engine and generator installation. This was one of the main original objectives. The blowers as well as the camshafts were driven at the power take-off end of the engine by another gear train." ...|$|E
2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator <b>drive</b> <b>gear.</b> About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|E
