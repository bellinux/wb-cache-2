500|$|Ultimately, Nile Rodgers {{was chosen}} by Madonna as the {{producer}} of the album, {{with the approval of}} the Warner Brothers executives. Madonna chose Rodgers mostly because of his work {{as a member of the}} seventies band Chic, and his most recent production work with David Bowie on his 1983 album Let's Dance. She commented, [...] "When I was making the record, I was just so thrilled and happy to be working with Nile Rodgers. I idolized Nile because of the whole Chic thing. I couldn't believe that the record company gave me the money so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1891, {{after many}} failed {{attempts}} at reconciliation by the pair, Tom Chappell, the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, {{stepped in to}} mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded. [...] Two more operas resulted: Utopia, Limited (1893) and The Grand Duke (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (His Excellency, 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protegée from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal. Utopia, concerning an attempt to [...] "anglicise" [...] a south Pacific island kingdom, was only a modest success, and The Grand Duke, in which a theatrical troupe, {{by means of a}} [...] "statutory duel" [...] and a conspiracy, takes political control of a grand duchy, was an outright failure. After that, the partnership ended for good. Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later. In 1904, Gilbert would write, [...] "...Savoy opera was snuffed out by the deplorable death of my distinguished collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan. When that event occurred, I saw no one with whom I felt that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with satisfaction and success, and so I discontinued to write libretti." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{spite of}} everything, {{it was a}} very fertile period for me. During the first weeks, I had a dream almost every night, some of which {{anticipated}} my future work. In my cell I was surrounded by a profound silence. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> on myself and that is when I began to write a novel. My neighbors simply waited for each day to pass. That time of captivity was precious to me because I could exercise zazen meditation and remain in immobility for hours." ...|$|E

2500|$|After 18 {{months at}} Oxford, she dropped out, finding {{work in a}} factory and a burger bar and hoping to write in her spare time. She later said [...] "I had a loopy idea that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with my hands {{during the day and}} in the evening come home and write novels and poetry, and be Tolstoy... But I very quickly {{discovered}} why people who work in factories don't usually have the energy to write when they get home." [...] She went into journalism, working on the diary at The Observer, and turned her eight months of experience in manual work (along with [...] "undercover" [...] stints as a nurse and an Army recruit) into the book A Working Life (1970).|$|E
2500|$|Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and {{the family}} moved to Mountain View, California in 1961. It was during this time that Paul built a {{workbench}} in his garage for his son in order to [...] "pass along his love of mechanics." [...] Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship [...] "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad." [...] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood. He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a [...] "loner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1843, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol was published, {{during the}} mid Victorian {{revival of the}} holiday. The word Merry was then {{beginning}} to take on its current meaning of [...] "jovial, cheerful, jolly and outgoing". [...] "Merry Christmas" [...] in this new context figured prominently in A Christmas Carol. The cynical Ebenezer Scrooge rudely deflects the friendly greeting: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> my will … every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding." [...] After the visit from the Ghosts of Christmas affects his transformation, Scrooge exclaims; [...] "I am as merry as a school-boy. A merry Christmas to everybody!" [...] and heartily exchanges the wish to all he meets. The instant popularity of A Christmas Carol, the Victorian era Christmas traditions it typifies, and the term's new meaning appearing in the book popularized the phrase [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E

2500|$|Yorke {{wrote of}} meeting Donwood at university: [...] "He {{had a better}} hat and suit on than me. That pissed me off. So I figured I'd either end up really not liking this person at all, or working {{with him for the}} rest of my life." [...] Donwood said his first {{impression}} of Yorke was that he was [...] "mouthy. Pissed off. Someone <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with." [...] Whereas Donwood, in his own words, has a [...] "tendency towards Virgo-like detailing and perfectionism", Yorke is [...] "completely opposed, fucking everything up ... I do something, then he fucks it up, then I fuck up what he’s done … and we keep doing that until we’re happy with the result. It’s a competition to see who 'wins' the painting, which one of us takes possession of it in an artistic way." [...] Yorke is credited for Radiohead artwork alongside Donwood under the monikers [...] "The White Chocolate Farm", [...] "Tchock", [...] "Dr. Tchock" [...] or similar abbreviations.|$|E
