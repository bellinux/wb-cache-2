40|$|The {{nematode}} can infect Italian millet and {{a sort of}} Fox-tail (Selaria viridis). Barnyard grass (Panicum crus-galli) is not {{the host}} plant. The nematode situates exo-parasitic within the folded youngest leaf of rice before {{the formation of the}} youngest ear. After the youngest ear is formed, it is found most frequently within the pubescence of the ear, but sometimes it enters the inner side of the young <b>flowering</b> <b>glume.</b> From the earing to the flowering stage, it is found commonly on the ear [...] outside of the <b>flowering</b> <b>glume.</b> At the flowering stage it usually enters the inner side of the <b>flowering</b> <b>glume,</b> and is found stuck to the inner wall of <b>flowering</b> <b>glume</b> until next spring. The number of the nematode found on well-developed unhulledgrain is larger than that on waste unhulled-grain. Examination of the distribution of the nematode on rice straw {{at the beginning of the}} next season, indicates that the population of the nematode is extemely dense on the residual grain. On straw after perfect thrashing, there were found no significant differences in numbers of living nematode due to height difference. The nematode could hardly survive the winter when unhulledgrain is scattered in the field...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} examine the detail {{structure}} of <b>flowering</b> <b>glume</b> and leaf surface, the studies were made on the flowering glumes of 22 species and leaves of 20 species belonging to the genus Oryza by the convenient SUMP (SUZUKI 2 ̆ 7 s Universal Microprinting) method and maceration method. 1) Glume surface: i : Section Sativae: The cells are square-shaped or rectangular and regularly arranged. Each cell bears a round tubercle and has a smooth surface. The tubercle gives {{the impression of a}} bursting membrane. Histologically, the short cells and the long cells are adjacent to one another as the tubercles result from uneven thickening at the points of contacts of six cells which consisted of four long and two short cells. The cells are much reduced in size. ii : Section Granulatae : The cells are rectangular and have irregular contours. Each cell has a tubercle composed of several tuberclets. Histologically, with short cells not usually adjacent in arrangement, the tubercles are formed over the area, where two short and two long cells are in contact. iii : Section Coarctatae : The cells are slender and without tubercles. They are arranged in long stripes with deep grooves between them. Species belonging to this section show a great variation in structure. Histologically, one of the species, O. ridleyi has not tubercle. Otherwise the cells are very {{similar to those of the}} species belonging to Section Sativae. iv : Section Rhynchoryza: The cells are polygonal, varying in size and are arranged like the scales of a tortoise shell. They have in the middle a globe-shaped tubercle. Histologically, the cells are of equal size and are arranged like fish scales, and seldom short cells occur. 2) Leaf surface: Specific characteristic of each species found in leaf surface are fewer than that of glume surface. However, the following characters are useful for taxonomical keys; ratio of long and short cells; shape of cells; number and arrangement of knots found in each cell; location, shape, size of stoma; degree of differences found in high and low from the cell surface (=groove 2 ̆ 7 s depth); thickening of cell wall; number and length of hairs. 3) It is concluded that the morphology of <b>flowering</b> <b>glume</b> and leaf could be used as a good taxonomic characters in the genus Oryza. ...|$|E
40|$|The grasses {{constitute}} a very well defined natural group of plants, but {{the division of}} this family into tribes and subtribes is a difficult problem. We know that ROBERT BROWN divided the family into the Panicaceae and the Poaceae. BENTHAM already indicated that {{in the former the}} tendency to imperfection lies in the lower flowers of the spikelets, whereas in the Poaceae the tendency is in the opposite direction, but he observes {{at the same time that}} this principle is too indefinite to serve as a practical character to recognize both groups. In combination with other characters, especially those taken from the fruits (the caryopsis, enclosed by the scales), these two groups become however more stabile. KUNTH gave us no less than 13 tribes, many of them indeed very natural and accepted in recent works. The earlier agrostologists have given a considerable importance to the presence or absence of awns on the back or on the apex of the <b>flowering</b> <b>glume</b> (lemma). We know however at present that this character, although important to recognize species, is not very valuable for the different tribes and must be used with great reserve...|$|E
50|$|This is a {{perennial}} bunchgrass, growing erect to under a meter-3 feet in height, and the <b>flower</b> <b>glumes</b> often assumes a light brown to reddish-purple color. There are several varieties with overlapping geographical ranges. This {{is not considered}} to be a good graze for livestock because the awns are sharp and the protein content of the grass is low.|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies on}} {{inheritance}} in barley have been made, but very little progress has as yet been obtained. Barley {{in many ways}} is an attractive plant with which to make inheritance studies. Unlike common wheat with 21 chromosome pairs and few distinct characters, barley has only 7 chromosome pairs and consequently only 7 possible linkage groups and many distinct characters that may be readily recognized. The chief difficulty {{is that many of}} these characters cannot be readily classified because a number of factors may be responsible for their production. The purpose of this project has been to study in considerable detail the Mendelian inheritance of several character pairs as they appear in barley crosses and to study possible linkage relationships between factors. The characters studied are rough versus semi-smooth awn, black versus white color of the <b>flowering</b> <b>glumes</b> and pericarp, long-haired vergus short-haired rachilla, fertility of the lateral florets and hulled versus naked caryopsis...|$|R
50|$|A {{spikelet}} {{can refer}} to a small spike, although it is primarily {{used to refer to}} the ultimate flower cluster unit in grasses (family Poaceae) and sedges (family Cyperaceae), in which case the stalk supporting the cluster becomes the pedicel. A true spikelet comprises one or more florets enclosed by two glumes (sterile bracts), with <b>flowers</b> and <b>glumes</b> arranged in two opposite rows along the spikelet. Examples occur on rice (species Oryza sativa) and wheat (genus Triticum), both grasses.|$|R
50|$|Carex archeri {{grows up}} to 25 cm high, with leaves less than 0.5 mm wide. Its {{inflorescence}} comprises a single spike subtended by a bract that {{is longer than}} the inflorescence. The spike contains few flowers, with the female flowers towards {{the base of the}} spike, and a very short portion towards the tip containing male <b>flowers.</b> The <b>glumes</b> of the female flowers are 2.5 - 4.0 mm long, and the utricles that form in the female flowers are 3 - 5 mm long, with a 1.3 - 2.5 mm notched beak.|$|R
5000|$|The bambusoid taxa {{have long}} been {{considered}} the most [...] "primitive" [...] grasses, mostly {{because of the presence}} of bracteate, indeterminate inflorescences, pseudospikelets (units of the inflorescence in woody bamboos, consisting of one to many <b>flowers</b> and associated <b>glumes,</b> that rebranch to produce successive orders of spikelets), and flowers with three lodicules (minute scales of the florets of grasses, found between the lemma and the sexual organs of the flower), six stamens, and three stigmas. Bamboos are some of the fastest growing plants in the world.|$|R
40|$|Kyllinga cataphyllata, a {{new species}} of Cyperaceae from the {{highlands}} of Western and Central Africa, is described and illustrated. This new species is easy recognized by the ascending rhizome densely covered by large cataphylls. The head-like inflorescence consisting of a single spike with spikelets made up of two to three glumes and only one <b>flower,</b> and the <b>glumes</b> characterized by a spinulose greenish keel. It {{is closely related to}} K. brevifolia, but differs in having conspicuous cataphylls, glumes with a strongly toothed keel and an asymmetrical pedicel to the nutlet...|$|R
40|$|Background : Pycreus, Kyllinga, and Queenslandiella cluster {{together}} with Cyperus within the Cyperus s. lat. clade, {{one of the}} two large clades in Cypereae. However, in contrast with Cyperus, they have laterally flattened pistils/nutlets. Pycreus, Kyllinga and Queenslandiella form morphologically well circumscribed independent genera. In the context of a broader systematic project to work out a well supported, evolution based taxonomy for Cyperus s. lat., we present in this paper general morphological and developmental data of species of Pycreus in comparison with three species of Cyperus, including C. laevigatus with dorsiventrally flattened nutlets. Approach : Freshly collected material was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM). Special attention was given to spikelet and gynoecial development. Results : SE micrographs of all species studied show an indeterminate rachilla with distichously arranged glumes, each subtending a bisexual flower. In spikelets of C. capitatus and P pumilus, the proximal glume sometimes subtends a lateral spikelet instead of a flower. In the species of Pycreus studied, each flower sits in a cavity formed by the growth of the rachilla, which is congenitally fused with the wings of the glume of the higher, alternate <b>flower.</b> <b>Glumes</b> appear successively, each soon forming a flower primordium in its axil, which develops according to a general cyperoid ontogenetic pattern. In Pycreus, the stigma branches grow out from dorsiventrally positioned primordia. During gynoecium development, a hypogynous stalklet (gynophore) appears in all species studied. Conclusion : In spikelets of Pycreus, the rachilla and wings of the glumes are congenitally fused and consequently develop with epicaulescent displacements of the glumes resulting in typical spikelets with flowers in cavities. In spikelets of Cyperus, a similar though less pronounced development results in spikelets with zigzagging rachilla. The particular positions of the stigma branches in C. laevigatus and Pycreus are explained by the development of the gynoecium from an annular primordium, which facilitates shifts in localisation of the stigma primordia. Though we consider the combination of the typical spikelet ontogeny and the independently originated laterally flattened nutlets to be strong arguments in favour of a genus Pycreus, a phylogenetic confirmation that the taxon is monophyletic is an absolute, until now unfulfilled, condition. Moreover, the consequences for the giant genus Cyperus must be taken in consideration...|$|R
