2500|$|Häkkinen {{remained}} at McLaren for 1999, with Coulthard partnering {{him for the}} upcoming season. The team suffered problems with their car, the McLaren MP4/14, during pre-season testing, resulting in a lack of preparation. Despite these setbacks, Häkkinen was confident going into the season, saying: [...] "I've gained confidence and experience and am more relaxed. With this title <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to tell myself every morning I can win, {{to put pressure on}} myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 31 July, Kaiser Wilhelm II {{wrote in}} a lengthy commentary: [...] "For <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any doubt that England, Russia and France have agreed among themselves—knowing that our treaty {{obligations}} compel us to support Austria-Hungary—to use the Austro-Serb conflict as a pretext for waging a war of annihilation against us.... Our dilemma over keeping faith with the old and honorable Emperor has been exploited to create a situation which gives England the excuse she has been seeking to annihilate us with a spurious appearance of justice on the pretext that she is helping France and maintaining the well-known Balance of Power in Europe, i.e. playing off all European States for her own benefit against us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rameau pursued his {{activities}} as a theorist and composer until his death. He {{lived with his}} wife and two of his children in his large suite of rooms in Rue des Bons-Enfants, which he would leave every day, lost in thought, to take a solitary walk in the nearby gardens of the Palais-Royal or the Tuileries. Sometimes he would meet the young writer Chabanon, who noted some of Rameau's disillusioned confidential remarks: [...] "Day by day, I'm acquiring more good taste, but <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any genius" [...] and [...] "The imagination is worn out in my old head; it's not wise at this age wanting to practise arts that are nothing but imagination." ...|$|E
60|$|The old gentleman had now reached them, red-faced and incoherent. He {{addressed}} {{himself to}} Mr. Cullen, and <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> any doubt whatever that the affair was a plant of the detective.|$|R

60|$|It {{seemed as}} if we were wasting time in {{allowing}} the enemy to come so near before giving them a taste of our quality; but because of the rating which Colonel Prescott had given those who offended, <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> any desire save to await the word of command.|$|R
2500|$|In {{his later}} years, Musashi {{said in his}} The Book of Five Rings: [...] "When I apply the {{principle}} of strategy to the ways of different arts and crafts, <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> need for a teacher in any domain." [...] He proved this by creating recognized masterpieces of calligraphy and classic ink painting. His paintings are characterized by skilled use of ink washes and an economy of brush stroke. He especially mastered the [...] "broken ink" [...] school of landscapes, applying it to other subjects, such as his Kobokumeikakuzu ("Shrike Perched on a Withered Branch"; part of a triptych whose other two members were [...] "Hotei Walking" [...] and [...] "Sparrow on Bamboo"), his Hotei Watching a Cockfight, and his Rozanzu ("Wild Geese Among Reeds").|$|E
2500|$|When {{his first}} film was released, Buñuel {{became the first}} filmmaker to be officially welcomed {{into the ranks of}} the Surrealists by the movement's leader André Breton, an event {{recalled}} by film historian Georges Sadoul: [...] "Breton had convoked the creators to our usual venue ... one summer's evening. Dalí had the large eyes, grace, and timidity of a gazelle. [...] To us, Buñuel, big and athletic, his black eyes protruding a little, seemed exactly like he always is in Un Chien Andalou, meticulously honing the razor that will slice the open eye in two." [...] After he joined the Communist Party in Spain, however, it was quickly made clear to him that he could not be both a Communist and a Surrealist; his artistic collaborator Pierre Unik recounted in a letter of 30 January 1932 that [...] "a comrade from Agit-Prop" [...] called Buñuel and others together to tell them that, [...] "Surrealism was a movement of bourgeois degeneration", continuing, [...] "What will the rank-and-file comrades say the day I have to announce to them, 'Comrades, <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> the right to militate amongst you...because I'm a degenerate bourgeois?'" [...] In consequence, on 6 May 1932, Buñuel wrote a letter to André Breton renouncing his membership in the Surrealist group: [...] "Given the current state of things there could be no question for a Communist of doubting for an instant between the choice of his party and any other sort of activity or discipline". He {{even went so far as}} to try to re-issue a drastically cut version of L'Age d'Or (over two-thirds of the original were eliminated) in response to complaints that the full 60-minute original was formally too difficult for the proletariat. Nonetheless, he retained a lifelong affinity with the Surrealist movement and longstanding friendships with many of the most prominent Surrealists.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years she {{revealed}} a talent for clarifying doctrine to those who had not received as much education as she. A kaleidoscope, whose three mirrors transform scraps of coloured paper into beautiful designs, provided an inspired illustration for the Holy Trinity. [...] "As long as our actions, even the smallest, do not fall away from the focus of Divine Love, the Holy Trinity, symbolized by the three mirrors, allows them to reflect wonderful beauty. Jesus, who regards us through the little lens, that is to say, through Himself, always sees beauty in everything we do. But if we left the focus of inexpressible love, what would He see? Bits of straw … dirty, worthless actions." [...] "Another cherished image was that of the newly invented elevator, a vehicle Thérèse used many times over to describe God's grace, a force that lifts us to heights we can't reach on our own." [...] Her sister Céline's memoir is filled with numerous examples of the teacher Thérèse. [...] "Céline: - 'Oh! When I think how much I have to acquire!' Thérèse: - 'Rather, how much you have to lose! Jesus Himself will fill your soul with treasures in the same measure that you move your imperfections out of the way." [...] And Céline recalled a story Thérèse told about egotism. 'The 28 month old Thérèse visited Le Mans and was given a basket filled with candies, at the top of which were two sugar rings. 'Oh! How wonderful! There is a sugar ring for Céline too!' On her way to the station however the basket overturned, and one of the sugar rings disappeared. 'Ah, <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any sugar ring for poor Céline!' Reminding me of the incident she observed; 'See how deeply rooted in us is this self-love! Why was it Céline's sugar ring, and not mine, that was lost?' Martha of Jesus, a novice who spent her childhood in a series of orphanages and who was described by all as emotionally unbalanced, with a violent temper, gave witness during the beatification process of the 'unusual dedication and presence of her young teacher. [...] "Thérèse deliberately 'sought out the company of those nuns whose temperaments she found hardest to bear.' What merit was there in acting charitably toward people whom one loved naturally? Thérèse went {{out of her way to}} spend time with, and therefore to love, the people she found repellent. It was an effective means of achieving interior poverty, a way to remove a place to rest her head." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{shouted to}} him. He took <b>no</b> notice. <b>I</b> shouted again, {{and he only}} {{increased}} his pace. I watched him disappear, and <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> any doubts at all. He {{was not in the}} least like a tramp, and his flight could bear but one interpretation. Isobel was not safe even here. We had been followed from London--we were being watched every hour. For the first time I began seriously to doubt what the end of these things might be.|$|R

ESPN, which was trying to cut expenses, had asked him to take a pay cut and to sign a three-year contract. Palmer said he would sign a one-year contract for less pay, but ESPN refused. [...] "I wouldn't be here today if the broadcasting climate had been more to my liking. That was really my prime motivation, the fact that <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> that obligation", Palmer said during spring training.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} move. I {{was afraid of}} what I had done. And then she dropped on her knees by my side, and real arms were about my neck, real kisses were upon my lips. Then <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> any fear, for from {{whatever}} world she had come the joy of {{it was like a}} foretaste of heaven. I drew her to me, held her passionately, and I knew that this was no creature of my mind's fashioning, but a live woman, whose heart beat so wildly against my own....|$|R

[...] Our movements having been successful up to this point, <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> any object in concealing from the President all my movements, and the objects I had in view.

50|$|When his {{daughter}} Margaret died in 1457, Count Palatine Otto <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> {{a reason to}} oppose the division. This tipped the balance in favour of dividing the country. A treaty to that effect was sealed in January 1458. Philipp the Elder received {{the part of the}} county south of the river Main, that is the district of Babenhausen and the Hanau share of Umstadt. So, the downside of a partition was mitigated by giving Philipp the Elder much less than half the county. Even so, Philipp the Elder was happy that he was finally allowed to marry, and did so later that year. In both parts, the primogeniture statute would continue to apply.|$|R
6000|$|My Catholic {{friend had}} left the table and was saying a Pater Noster and Ave Maria in the corner. Presently all became still and so dark that I could not see anybody.

I said to myself, [...] "I am now in a trance but <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any desire to resist." [...] But when I turned {{my eyes to the}} fireplace I could see a faint gleam of light, so I thought [...] "no, I am not in a trance."

The medium said in a faint voice, [...] "we are through the bad spirits." [...] I said, [...] "will they ever come again, do you think?" [...] and he said, [...] "no, never again, I think," [...] and in my boyish vanity I thought it was I who had banished them. For years afterwards I would not go to a seance or turn a table and would often ask myself what was that violent impulse that had run through my nerves? was it a part of myself--something always to be a danger perhaps; or had it come from without, as it seemed? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{can never}} insist enough, my dear Cyril, upon the illogicality of American life. You {{know what the}} plutocratic {{principle}} is, and what the plutocratic civilization should logically be. But the plutocratic civilization {{is much better than}} it should logically be, bad as it is; for the personal equation constantly modifies it, and renders it far less dreadful than you would reasonably expect. That is, the potentialities of goodness implanted in the human heart by the Creator forbid the plutocratic man to be what the plutocratic scheme of life implies. He is often merciful, kindly, and generous, as I have told you already, in spite of conditions absolutely egotistical. You would think that the Americans would be abashed {{in view of the fact}} that their morality is often in contravention of their economic principles, but apparently they are not so, and I believe that for the most part they are not aware of the fact. Nevertheless, the fact is there, and you must keep it in mind, if you would conceive of them rightly. You can in no other way account for the contradictions which you will find in my experiences among them; and these are often so bewildering that I have to take myself in hand, from time to time, and ask myself what mad world I have fallen into, and whether, after all, it is not a ridiculous nightmare. I am not sure that, when I return and we talk these things over together, I shall be able to overcome your doubts of my honesty, and I think that when <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> them before my eyes I shall begin to doubt my own memory. But for the present I can only set down what I at least seem to see, and trust you to accept it, if you cannot understand it.|$|E

2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal.

But my hesitancy was, I suspect, the result of other considerations impacting on its completion. One of these was deciding on the content to include in the discussion and it was no mean feat to come to where I now am given the corpus of writing John Shotter has produced over the years. But on reflection, it was not until I realised I needed to write with someone/a group as an audience that I was able to proceed. In other words, it was not until I could place myself within conversation that I was able to begin...|$|R
5000|$|Horner was lauded for her {{leadership}} of Radcliffe and her {{stance on the}} issue of coeducation. Many resisted the coeducation movement of merging Harvard University and Radcliffe College because it would have meant the elimination of Radcliffe College. Ellen Sackson Heller (Radcliffe Class of 1939) stated, [...] "If Radcliffe had merged, it would have meant to me that <b>I</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> a college." [...] A merger would also have meant that Radcliffe would lose its autonomy. Horner said, [...] "The challenge was to see if the mandate of Radcliffe could provide a leadership model for true coeducation that gave weight to women's voices, as opposed to just letting women enter a male world." [...] Although Horner had many responsibilities, she made contact with Radcliffe students a priority during her presidency by holding weekly conferences and teaching several classes. Horner remained president until 1989, when she was succeeded by Linda Wilson.|$|R
