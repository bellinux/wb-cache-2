40|$|Abstract Background We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} {{the hypothesis that the}} high incidence of cutaneous melanoma in white persons in central Alabama is associated with a predominance of Irish and Scots descent. Methods Frequencies <b>of</b> country <b>of</b> <b>ancestry</b> reports were tabulated. The reports were also converted to scores that reflect proportional countries <b>of</b> <b>ancestry</b> in individuals. Using the scores, we computed aggregate country <b>of</b> <b>ancestry</b> indices as estimates <b>of</b> group <b>ancestry</b> composition. HLA-DRB 1 * 04 allele frequencies and relationships to countries <b>of</b> <b>ancestry</b> were compared in probands and controls. Results were compared to those of European populations with HLA-DRB 1 * 04 frequencies. Results Ninety evaluable adult white cutaneous melanoma probands and 324 adult white controls reported countries <b>of</b> <b>ancestry</b> <b>of</b> their grandparents. The respective frequencies of Ireland, and Scotland and "British Isles" reported countries <b>of</b> <b>ancestry</b> were significantly greater in probands than in controls. The respective frequencies of Wales, France, Italy and Poland were significantly greater in controls. 16. 7 % of melanoma probands and 23. 8 % of controls reported "Native American" ancestry; the corresponding "Native American" country <b>of</b> <b>ancestry</b> index was not significantly different in probands and controls. The frequency of HLA-DRB 1 * 04 was significantly greater in probands, but was not significantly associated with individual or aggregate countries <b>of</b> <b>ancestry.</b> The frequency <b>of</b> DRB 1 * 04 observed in Alabama was compared to DRB 1 * 04 frequencies reported from England, Wales, Ireland, Orkney Island, France, Germany, and Australia. Conclusion White adults with cutaneous melanoma in central Alabama have a predominance of Irish, Scots, and "British Isles" ancestry and HLA-DRB 1 * 04 that likely contributes to their high incidence of cutaneous melanoma. </p...|$|R
