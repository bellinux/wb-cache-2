5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely <b>determines</b> <b>the</b> strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).|$|E

5|$|Apo{{lipoprotein}} B, in its ApoB100 form, is {{the main}} apolipoprotein, or protein part of the lipoprotein particle. Its gene {{is located on the}} second chromosome (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12Mb long. FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located on a part of the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced {{as a result of the}} mutation. Like LDLR, the number of abnormal copies <b>determines</b> <b>the</b> severity of the hypercholesterolemia.|$|E

In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, {{tend to have a}} high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.|$|E
