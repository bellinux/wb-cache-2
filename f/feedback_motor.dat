In this paper, the authors proposed a visual force-feedback system suitable for neuroscience experiment. With this system, the force output produced by participants can be detected and recorded in real time, while force output was visually displayed as a feedback cue to the participants simultaneously. Furthermore, this force feedback system is MRI compatible, and can be used both in fMRI and ERP experiments. The proposed system has been applied in hand-grip tasks and finger movement experiments, which were designed to explore the relationship between force output and brain activation mode in normal subject and stroke patient. The results demonstrated that various force levels were well detected and visual feedback signals enabled the accomplishment of experiments with both fixed and variable target force levels.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{correlations}} between four clinical measures (Fugl–Meyer upper extremity scale, Motor Activity Log, Action Research Arm Test, and Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test) and four robotic measures (smoothness of movement, trajectory error, average number of target hits per minute, and mean tangential speed), used to assess motor recovery. Data were gathered {{as part of a}} hybrid robotic and traditional upper extremity rehabilitation program for nine stroke patients. Smoothness of movement and trajectory error, temporally and spatially normalized measures of movement quality defined for point-to-point movements, were found to have significant mod-erate to strong correlations with all four of the clinical measures. The strong correlations suggest that smoothness of movement and trajectory error may be used to compare outcomes of different rehabilitation protocols and devices effectively, provide improved resolution for tracking patient progress compared to only pre-and post-treatment measurements, enable accurate adaptation of therapy based on patient progress, and deliver immediate and useful feedback to the patient and therapist.

40|$|In typical movement, humans use a {{combination}} of feed-forward and <b>feedback</b> <b>motor</b> control strategies to interact with the world around them. However, when sensory input is impaired or absent, {{as in the case of}} various neuropathies or amputation, the ability to perform everyday tasks, like modulating grip force to object weight, can be affected.

Subjects lifted an object of various weights using their own hand, with the SHP without feedback, and the SHP with force feedback. As expected, significant differences were found between the two SHP conditions and the native hand, but surprisingly not between the SHP conditions. A closer look at the data suggests the feedback may help diminish the overall grip force used during grasping even if it does not alter the grip force modulation to object weight. The lack of significance may be due in part to high intra- and inter-subject variability. Additional training with the CUFF and/or customization of the feedback may enhance the effects and warrants further stud...|$|E

These parallel approaches have emphasized sophisticated, goal-directed feedback control, but also reveal that flexible perturbation responses are expressed at different latencies depending on what sensory system is engaged by the perturbation. Across studies, goal-directed visuomotor responses consistently emerge in muscle activity ∼ 100 ms after a perturbation, while mechanical perturbations evoke goal-directed muscle responses in as little as ∼ 60 ms (long-latency responses). We discuss the limitation of current models of multisensory integration in light of these asynchronous processing delays, and suggest that understanding how the brain performs real-time multisensory integration is an open question for future studies...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Steer-by-Wire (SBW) technology has been applied in the flight area, and it could be used in motor vehicles in the near future. The vehicle SBW system has been recently proposed to replace the traditional vehicle steering system by moving the mechanical linkage between the steering wheel and the front wheel. It has many advantages, including providing vehicle design freedom and improving vehicle handling. Two of the most challenging problems faced by the vehicle SBW system are 1) how to establish the effective force feedback between driver and the wheel so that the driver’s steering signal can be accurately followed by the wheels so the road condition can be felt by the driver, and 2) how to design and choose the available hardware so that a reliable transmission with high speed can guarantee the reliability and stability of the SBW system. It is therefore necessary to develop advanced SBW control systems and to design advanced architectures for the SBW system. In this thesis, a new SBW control system with the consideration of the variable gear-ratio is presented and the hardware in-the-loop is designed. This SBW system includes two control loops, which are called upper control loop and lower control loop, to achieve bilateral control. The force <b>feedback</b> <b>motor,</b> which is installed with the steering wheel, and the steering motor, which is installed in the front wheel, are adopted in these two loops, and two PID controllers are designed for them, respectively, so that steering signal and road feeling can be tracked.

40|$|PURPOSE: Motor imagery {{can improve}} motor {{function}} and reduce pain. This {{is relevant to}} individuals {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI) in whom motor dysfunction and neuropathic pain are prevalent. However, therapy efficacy could be dependent on motor imagery ability, and a clear understanding of how motor imagery might be facilitated is currently lacking. Thus, the aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the immediate effects of interactive virtual feedback on motor imagery performance after SCI. METHODS: Nine individuals with a traumatic SCI participated in the experiment. Motor imagery tasks consisted of forward (i. e. simpler) and backward (i. e. more complex) walking while receiving interactive versus static virtual <b>feedback.</b> <b>Motor</b> imagery performance (vividness, effort and speed), neuropathic pain intensity and feasibility (immersion, distraction, side-effects) were assessed. RESULTS: During interactive feedback trials, motor imagery vividness and speed were significantly higher and effort was significantly lower as compared static feedback trials.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) We use {{gestures}} {{frequently in}} daily life—to interact with people, pets, or objects. But interacting with computers using mid-air gestures continues {{to challenge the}} design of touchless systems. Traditional approaches to touchless interaction focus on exploring gesture inputs and evaluating user interfaces. I shift the focus from gesture elicitation and interface evaluation to touchless interaction mechanics. I argue for a novel approach to generate design guidelines for touchless systems: to use fundamental interaction principles, instead of a reactive adaptation to the sensing technology. In five sets of experiments, I explore visual and pseudo-haptic <b>feedback,</b> <b>motor</b> intuitiveness, handedness, and perceptual Gestalt effects. Particularly, I study the interaction mechanics in touchless target selection. To that end, I introduce two novel interaction techniques: touchless circular menus that allow command selection using directional strokes and interface topographies that use pseudo-haptic feedback to guide steering–targeting tasks. Results illuminate different facets of touchless interaction mechanics. For example, motor-intuitive touchless interactions explain how our sensorimotor abilities inform touchless interface affordances: we often make a holistic oblique gesture instead of several orthogonal hand gestures while reaching toward a distant display. Following the Gestalt theory of visual perception, we found similarity between user interface (UI) components decreased user accuracy while good continuity made users faster. Other findings include hemispheric asymmetry affecting transfer of training between dominant and nondominant hands and pseudo-haptic feedback improving touchless accuracy. The results of this dissertation contribute design guidelines for future touchless systems. Practical applications of this work {{include the use of}} touchless interaction techniques in various domains, such as entertainment, consumer appliances, surgery, patient-centric health settings, smart cities, interactive visualization, and collaboration...|$|E

40|$|Ample {{evidence}} attests {{that social}} intention, elicited through gestures explicitly signaling a request of communicative intention, affects the patterning of hand movement kinematics. The current study {{goes beyond the}} effect of social intention and addresses whether the same action of reaching to grasp an object for placing it in an end target position within or without a monitoring attendee’s peripersonal space, can be moulded by pure social factors in general, and by social facilitation in particular. A motion tracking system (Optotrak Certus) was used to record motor acts. We carefully avoided the usage of communicative intention by keeping constant both the visual information and the positional uncertainty of the end target position, while we systematically varied the social status of the attendee (a high, or a low social status) in separated blocks. Only thirty acts performed {{in the presence of}} a different social status attendee, revealed a significant change of kinematic parameterization of hand movement, independently of the attendee's distance. The amplitude of peak velocity reached by the hand during the reach-to-grasp and the lift-to-place phase of the movement was larger in the high rather than in the low social status condition. By contrast, the deceleration time of the reach-to-grasp phase and the maximum grasp aperture was smaller in the high rather than in the low social status condition. These results indicated that the hand movement was faster but less carefully shaped in presence of a high, but not of a low social status attendee. This kinematic patterning suggests that being monitored by a high rather than a low social status attendee might lead participants to experience evaluation apprehension that informs the control of motor execution.

40|$|Data {{transmission}} {{between an}} electric motor and a frequency converter is required in variablespeed electric drives because of sensors installed at the motor. Sensor information {{can be used for}} various useful applications to improve the system reliability and its properties. Traditionally, the communication medium is implemented by an additional cabling. However, the costs of the traditional method may be an obstacle to the wider application of data transmission between a motor and a frequency converter. In any case, a power cable is always installed between a motor and a frequency converter for power supply, and hence it may be applied as a communication medium for sensor level data. This thesis considers power line communication (PLC) in inverter-fed motor power cables. The motor cable is studied as a communication channel in the frequency band of 100 kHz− 30 MHz. The communication channel and noise characteristics are described. All the individual components included in a variable-speed electric drive are presented in detail. A channel model is developed, and it is verified by measurements. A theoretical channel information capacity analysis is carried out to estimate the opportunities of a communication medium. Suitable communication and forward error correction (FEC) methods are suggested. A general method to implement a broadband and Ethernet-based communication medium between a motor and a frequency converter is proposed. A coupling interface is also developed that allows to install the communication device safely to a three-phase inverter-fed motor power cable. Practical tests are carried out, and the results are analyzed. Possible applications for the proposed method are presented. A speed <b>feedback</b> <b>motor</b> control application is verified in detail by simulations and laboratory tests because of restrictions for the delay in the feedback loop caused by PLC.

40|$|Proprioceptive {{information}} from paraspinal tissues including muscle contributes to neuromuscular {{control of the}} vertebral column. We investigated whether {{the history of a}} vertebra's position can affect signalling from paraspinal muscle spindles. Single unit recordings were obtained from muscle spindle afferents in the L 6 dorsal roots of 30 Nembutal-anaesthetized cats. Each afferent's receptive field was in the intact muscles of the low back. The L 6 vertebra was controlled using a displacement-controlled <b>feedback</b> <b>motor</b> and was held in each of three different conditioning positions for durations of 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 s. Conditioning positions (1. 0 – 2. 2 mm dorsal and ventral relative to an intermediate position) were based upon the displacement that loaded the L 6 vertebra to 50 – 60 % of the cat's body weight. Following conditioning positions that stretched (hold-long) and shortened (hold-short) the spindle, the vertebra was repositioned identically and muscle spindle discharge at rest and to movement was compared with conditioning at the intermediate position. Hold-short conditioning augmented mean resting spindle discharge by + 4. 1 to + 6. 2 impulses s− 1; however, the duration of hold-short did not significantly affect this increase (F 4, 145 = 0. 49, P = 0. 74). The increase was maintained at the beginning of vertebral movement but quickly returned to baseline. Conversely, hold-long conditioning significantly diminished mean resting spindle discharge by − 2. 0 to − 16. 1 impulses s− 1 (F 4, 145 = 11. 23, P < 0. 001). The relationship between conditioning duration and the diminished resting discharge could be described by a quadratic (F 1, 145 = 9. 28, P = 0. 003) revealing that the effects of positioning history were fully developed within 2 s of conditioning. In addition, 2 s or greater of hold-long conditioning significantly diminished spindle discharge to vertebral movement by − 5. 7 to − 10. 0 impulses s− 1 (F 4, 145 = 11. 0, P < 0. 001). These effects of vertebral positioning history may be a mechanism whereby spinal biomechanics interacts with the spine's proprioceptive system to produce acute effects on neuromuscular control of the vertebral column...|$|E

Second, to qualitatively assess the effect of specific verbal <b>feedback</b> on student <b>motor</b> performance. Six undergraduate students enrolled in the Adapted Physical Activity and Lab class at Oregon State University served as teachers for 6 children who were classified as having a mild to moderate disability. Teachers were individually videotaped teaching the same fundamental motor skill each week for 14 weeks in the actual clinic setting. Week 4 teachers were sequentially introduced to the intervention package which included: (a) defining specific skill feedback and discussing its role in skill development, (b) a single viewing of a master teacher videotape, (c) verbally and physically reviewing critical elements of skill being taught, and (d) reviewing teacher <b>feedback</b> and student <b>motor</b> performance each lesson. A variation of the single subject, multiple baseline design across subjects was used to assess the effect of the intervention package on teacher <b>feedback</b> and student <b>motor</b> performance.

In addition, evidence suggests a positive relationship between teachers' use of specific skill <b>feedback</b> and student <b>motor</b> performance.
