2500|$|Erratics {{are formed}} by glacial ice erosion {{resulting}} from the movement of ice. Glaciers erode by multiple processes: abrasion/scouring, plucking, ice thrusting and glacially-induced spalling. Glaciers crack pieces of bedrock off {{in the process of}} plucking, producing the larger erratics. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood, producing smaller glacial till. [...] In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. Glacially-induced spalling occurs when <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> formation with the rocks below the glacier spall off layers of rock, providing smaller debris which is ground into the glacial basal material to become till.|$|E

50|$|The {{dominant}} {{cause of}} soil displacement in frost heaving {{is the development}} of <b>ice</b> <b>lenses.</b> During frost heave, one or more soil-free <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> grow, and their growth displaces the soil above them. These lenses grow by the continual addition of water from a groundwater source that is lower in the soil and below the freezing line in the soil. The presence of frost-susceptible soil with a pore structure that allows capillary flow is essential to supplying water to the <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> as they form.|$|R

5000|$|Ice forms rapidly when {{liquid is}} readily available. When liquid is readily available, the {{segregated}} ice (<b>ice</b> <b>lens)</b> grows {{parallel to the}} exposed cold surface. It grows rapidly until the heat liberated by freezing warms the <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> boundary, reducing the temperature gradient and controlling the rate of further ice segregation. Under these conditions, ice grows {{in a single layer}} which gets progressively thicker. The surface is displaced and soil repositioned or rock fractured.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>lenses</b> {{play the}} {{key role in}} {{fracture}} of bedrock and frost induced heaving of soils, which are fundamental to weathering in cold regions. Frost heaving creates debris and dramatically shapes landscapes into complex patterns. Rock fracture in periglacial regions (alpine, subpolar and polar) has often been attributed to the freezing and volumetric expansion of water trapped within pores and cracks. However the majority of frost heaving and of bedrock fracture results instead from ice segregation in <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> in the near-surface frozen regions. Ice segregation results in rock fracture and frost heave.|$|R
50|$|Palsa, a low oval {{elevation}} {{in areas}} with permafrost, frequently peat bogs, where a perennial <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> has developed within the soil.|$|E
5000|$|Ice {{forms in}} a {{different}} pattern when liquid is less readily available. When liquid is not readily available, the segregated ice (<b>ice</b> <b>lens)</b> grows slowly. The heat liberated by freezing is unable to warm the <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> boundary. Hence the area through which the water is diffusing continues to cool until another ice segregation layer forms below the first layer. With sustained cold weather, this process can repeat, producing multiple ice layers (ice lenses), all parallel to the surface. The formation of multiple layers (multiple lenses) producing more extensive frost damage within rocks or soils.|$|E
50|$|Lithalsa is a frost-induced raised {{land form}} in {{permafrost}} areas with mineral-rich soils, where a perennial <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> has developed within the soil. The term sometimes also refers to palsas and pingos.|$|E
5000|$|The {{percolation}} zone is an {{area with}} some surface melt, causing meltwater to percolate into the snowpack. This zone is often marked by refrozen <b>ice</b> <b>lenses,</b> glands, and layers. The snowpack also never reaches melting point.|$|R
5000|$|Frost heaving (or a frost heave) is an upwards {{swelling}} of soil during freezing conditions {{caused by an}} increasing presence of ice as it grows towards the surface, upwards from the depth in the soil where freezing temperatures have penetrated into the soil (the freezing front or freezing boundary). Ice growth requires a water supply that delivers water to the freezing front via capillary action in certain soils. The weight of overlying soil restrains vertical growth of the ice and can promote the formation of lens-shaped areas of ice within the soil. Yet the force {{of one or more}} growing <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> is sufficient to lift a layer of soil, as much as 1 ft or more. The soil through which water passes to feed the formation of <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> must be sufficiently porous to allow capillary action, yet not so porous as to break capillary continuity. Such soil is referred to as [...] "frost susceptible". The growth of <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> continually consumes the rising water at the freezing front. [...] Differential frost heaving can crack road surfaces—contributing to springtime pothole formation—and damage building foundations.|$|R
40|$|Dome-shaped mounds {{containing}} <b>lenses</b> of transparent <b>ice</b> {{were found}} in a one-half acre area in Cedar Bog, Champaign County, Ohio. The occurrence of ice-lens mounds in tem-perate latitudes such as Ohio has not previously been reported. Formation of the <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> caused heaving of the overlying soil to form small topographic mounds, which re-mained after the ice had melted. The ground surrounding the area of mounds did not develop <b>ice</b> <b>lenses,</b> either because of standing water or because the water table was too deep to allow ground water to be drawn upward to the freezing surface. Ice-lens forma-tion was apparently controlled by {{the depth of the}} water table, by variations in the soil, and by the rate and duration of freezing...|$|R
50|$|Frost heave {{is common}} in arctic tundra because the {{permafrost}} maintains ground frozen at depth and prevents snowmelt and rain from draining. As a result, conditions are optimal for deep <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> formation with large ice accumulations and significant soil displacement.|$|E
50|$|An <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> or ice lenses {{are formed}} when moisture, {{diffused}} within soil or rock, accumulates in a localized zone. The ice initially accumulates within small collocated pores or pre-existing crack, and, {{as long as}} the conditions remain favorable, continues to collect in the ice layer or <b>ice</b> <b>lens,</b> wedging the soil or rock apart. Ice lenses grow parallel to the surface and several centimeters to several decimeters (inches to feet) deep in the soil or rock. Studies between 1990 and present have demonstrated that rock fracture by ice segregation (i.e., the fracture of intact rock by ice lenses that grow by drawing water from their surroundings during periods of sustained subfreezing temperatures) is a more effective weathering process than the freeze-thaw process which older texts proposed.|$|E
50|$|Another {{water-transport}} {{effect is}} {{the preservation of}} a few molecular layers of liquid water {{on the surface of}} the <b>ice</b> <b>lens,</b> and between ice and soil particles.

50|$|As {{this process}} occurs, the upper soil {{material}} gradually dries out (because the soil moisture {{moves from the}} warm surface layer to the colder layer {{at the top of}} the permafrost) so that it forms a granular structure with many very distinctive crystalline shapes (such as <b>ice</b> <b>lenses).</b> Separation of coarse from fine soil materials produces distinctive patterned ground with different types of soil.|$|R
50|$|A key {{phenomenon}} {{for understanding}} ice segregation in soil or porous rock (also {{referred to as}} an <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> due to its shape) is premelting, which {{is the development of}} a liquid film on surfaces and interfaces at temperatures significantly below their bulk melting temperature. The term premelting is used to describe the reduction in the melting temperature (below 0 °C) which results from the surface curvature of porous media confining water (the Gibbs-Thomson effect). Premelted water exists as a thin layer on the surface of ice. Under premelting conditions, ice and water can coexist at temperatures below -10 °C in a porous medium. The Gibbs-Thomson effect results in water migrating down a thermal gradient (from higher temperatures to lower temperatures); Dash states, “…material is carried to colder regions…” This can also be viewed energetically as favoring larger ice particles over smaller (Ostwald ripening). As a result, when conditions exist for ice segregation (<b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> formation) water flows toward the segregated ice and freezes on the surface, thickening the segregated ice layer.|$|E
5000|$|Palsas may be {{initiated}} {{in areas of}} a moor or bog where the winter freezing front penetrates relatively faster than surrounding areas, perhaps due to an unusually thin cover of snow. The lack of thermal insulation provided by thick snow permits much deeper freezing in winter. This ice may then last through the summer with a persistent 'bump' of up to several cm due to frost heave. The elevated surface of a palsa will tend also to have thinner snow cover, allowing greater winter cooling, while in summer the surface material (especially if organic) will dry out and provide thermal insulation. Thus the interior temperature is consistently {{lower than that of}} adjacent ground. This contributes to the formation of an <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> which grows by drawing up surrounding water. The expansion of the ice upon freezing exerts pressure on the surrounding soil, further forcing water out of its pore spaces which then accumulates on and increases the volume of the growing <b>ice</b> <b>lens.</b> A positive feedback loop develops. Changes in surface moisture and vegetation will then be such as to preserve the newly formed permafrost.|$|E
50|$|Fine-grained soils such as clays and silts enables greater {{negative}} pressures {{than more}} coarse-grained soils {{due to the}} smaller pore size. In periglacial environments, this mechanism is highly significant {{and it is the}} predominant process in <b>ice</b> <b>lens</b> formation in permafrost areas.Several models for ice-lens formation by cryosuction exist, among others the Hydrodynamic model and the Pre-melting model, many of them based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relation with various assumptions, yielding cryosuction potentials of 11 to 12 atm per degree Celsius below zero depending on pore size.|$|E
50|$|Research {{suggests}} that the main cause is actually 'frost-shrinkage' due to the freezing-out of cell well moisture into lumens of wood cells and other causes are the expansion of freezing water in cell lumens, and additionally the formation of <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> within wood. As stated, previous defects such as healed wounds, branch stubs, etc. in tree trunks function as stress raisers and trigger the frost cracking.|$|R
50|$|Taber {{demonstrated}} that liquid water migrates towards the freeze line within soil. He showed that other liquids, such as benzene, which contracts when it freezes, also produce frost heave. This excluded molar volume changes {{as the dominant}} mechanism for vertical displacement of freezing soil. His experiments further demonstrated the development of <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> inside columns of soil that were frozen by cooling the upper surface only, thereby establishing a temperature gradient.|$|R

The frost action reacts {{on the highway}} structure that {{is a major concern}} at the locations constructing a highway in cold regions, and the frozen damage of road is a phenomenon of great practical importance in highway engineering design and construction. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) study the effects of frozen damage on road performance in cold climate regions, (2) investigate the factors contributing to the changes in highway structure physical and mechanical properties, (3) provide guidelines for anti-freezing design of highway in seasonal frost areas. The approach focuses on analyzing the characteristics and the mechanisms of frost heaving and frost boiling, and adopting initiative methods to reduce the frozen damage to highways. This thesis gives a review and summary of the preventive measures to minimize highway distress in seasonally frozen regions that will benefit the design and maintenance for highway structure.

50|$|The same intermolecular {{forces that}} cause premelting at {{surfaces}} contribute to frost heaving at the particle scale {{on the bottom}} side of the forming <b>ice</b> <b>lens.</b> When ice surrounds a fine soil particle as it premelts, the soil particle will be displaced downward towards the warm direction within the thermal gradient due to melting and refreezing of the thin film of water that surrounds the particle. The thickness of such a film is temperature dependent and is thinner on the colder side of the particle.|$|E
5000|$|Owing to the Gibbs-Thomson {{effect of}} the {{confinement}} of liquids in pores, water in soil can remain liquid at a temperature that is below the bulk freezing point of water. Very fine pores {{have a very high}} curvature, and this results in the liquid phase being thermodynamically stable in such media at temperatures sometimes several tens of degrees below the bulk freezing point of the liquid. [...] This effect allows water to percolate through the soil towards the <b>ice</b> <b>lens,</b> allowing the lens to grow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>lens</b> growth {{within the}} bedrock below the glacier is {{projected}} {{during the summer}} months when there is ample water {{at the base of the}} glacier. Ice lenses will form within the bedrock, accumulating until the rock is sufficiently weakened that it shears or spalls off. Layers of rock along the interface between glaciers and the bedrock are freed, producing much of the sediments in these basal regions of glaciers. Since the rate of glacier movement is dependent upon the characteristics of this basal ice, research is ongoing to better quantify the phenomena.|$|E

40|$|Rivers cut {{vertically}} and laterally into bedrock. However, {{control on}} the width of bedrock rivers is an unsolved problem. In alpine settings, frost cracking {{is one of the}} mechanisms that break down bedrock. Segregation ice drives growth of <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> within rock masses. When the temperature of the rock is within the "frost cracking window" of - 3 to - 8 ??C, <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> can attract liquid water. Expanding <b>ice</b> <b>lenses</b> can exert sufficient pressure to fracture the rock. We hypothesize that alpine rivers may promote segregation ice growth at the river margin by supplying water, but also may inhibit frost cracking by supplying heat. We find support for this hypothesis in data collected along the Tuolumne and Mokelumne rivers in the Sierra Nevada, California. A ID heat flow model predicts that frost cracking should occur above 2325 masl in this area. To test for a river effect, I measured fracture density along the Tuolumne River at 2600 masl, finding that density at the river margin is significantly greater than on adjacent hillslopes in the Cathedral Peak granodiorite. We then deployed data loggers on the Mokelumne River (at 2490 masl) over the winter of 2013 / 2014 to record water, surface and subsurface rock temperatures at varying depths and distances from the river. Temperatures within the frost cracking window were only recorded at a distance of 5 m from the river, suggesting an insulating effect from the river and snow cover. Rock temperature 1 m deep equilibrated at 2 ??C. This result requires subsurface heat flow into the model space. Ongoing work includes terrestrial LiDAR scans to detect erosion of the river bank at the Mokelumne site, and further development of a 2 D heat flow model to predict subsurface rock temperatures for varying surface boundary conditions and channel morphology. We expect that further analysis will reveal systematic relationships between the surface boundary conditions and rock temperature at depth, enabling predictive modeling of frost cracking intensity at the river margin...|$|R
