50|$|When a body is {{subjected}} to <b>ion</b> <b>milling</b> in vacuum, we do not get {{to know about the}} geometry of the surface of the body. So to study it we will keep the field emission probes which will emit electrons as soon as a voltage is applied across it.

The research {{objective is to}} reduce thermal damage of the <b>ion</b> <b>mill</b> heatless etching process. First the process parameters and slider burn defect of the <b>ion</b> <b>mill</b> heatless etching process are studied. Next, a CAD model and mesh are constructed. Boundary conditions for heat transfer analysis are applied on the mesh. Temperature distribution is calculated and set as thermal load for thermal stress analysis. Then thermal deformation is computed. A new model of slider fixture is designed. The thermal deformation of the new model is computed. The {{results show that the}} new model reduces thermal deflection 3 % and increases real clamp force 2. 5 times the old model.

A subclass of this is focused <b>ion</b> beam <b>milling,</b> where gallium <b>ions</b> are used to produce an electron transparent membrane in a specific region of the sample, for example through a device within a microprocessor. <b>Ion</b> beam <b>milling</b> may {{also be used for}} cross-section polishing prior to SEM analysis of materials that are difficult to prepare using mechanical polishing.|$|R

50|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>milling</b> machine thins samples {{until they}} are {{transparent}} to electrons by firing ions (typically argon) at the surface from an angle and sputtering material from the surface. By making a sample electron transparent, it can be imaged and characterized in a transmission electron microscope (TEM).

50|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>milling,</b> or sputter etching, uses lower pressures, {{often as}} low as 10−4 Torr (10 mPa). It bombards the wafer with {{energetic}} ions of noble gases, often Ar+, which knock atoms from the substrate by transferring momentum. Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one direction, this process is highly anisotropic. On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity. Reactive-ion etching (RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching (between 10-3 and 10−1 Torr). Deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features.|$|E
50|$|A liquid {{metal ion}} source (LMIS) is an ion source which uses metal that is heated to {{the liquid state}} and used to form an {{electrospray}} to form ions. An electrospray Taylor cone is formed by {{the application of a}} strong electric field and ions are produced by field evaporation at the sharp tip of the cone, which has a high electric field. Ions from a LMIS are used in ion implantation and in focused ion beam instruments. Typically gallium is preferred for its low melting point, low vapor pressure, its relatively unreactive nature, and because the gallium ion is sufficiently heavy for <b>ion</b> <b>milling.</b>|$|E

50|$|The FIB is also {{commonly}} used to prepare samples for the transmission electron microscope. The TEM requires very thin samples, typically ~100 nanometers. Other techniques, such as <b>ion</b> <b>milling</b> or electropolishing {{can be used to}} prepare such thin samples. However, the nanometer-scale resolution of the FIB allows the exact thin region to be chosen. This is vital, for example, in integrated circuit failure analysis. If a particular transistor out of several million on a chip is bad, the only tool capable of preparing an electron microscope sample of that single transistor is the FIB. The same protocol used for preparing samples to transmission electron microscopy {{can also be used to}} select a micro area of a sample, extract it and prepare it for analysis using a Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} steps in contact fabrication are semiconductor surface cleaning, contact metal deposition, patterning and annealing. Surface cleaning may {{be performed by}} sputter-etching, chemical etching, reactive gas etching or <b>ion</b> <b>milling.</b> For example, the native oxide of silicon may be removed with an hydrofluoric acid dip, while GaAs is more typically cleaned by a bromine-methanol dip. After cleaning, metals are deposited via sputter deposition, evaporation or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Sputtering is a faster and more convenient method of metal deposition than evaporation but the ion bombardment from the plasma may induce surface states or even invert the charge carrier type at the surface. For this reason the gentler but still rapid CVD is increasingly preferred. Patterning of contacts is accomplished with standard photolithographic methods such as lift-off, where contact metal is deposited through holes in a photoresist layer that is later dissolved away. Post-deposition annealing of contacts is useful for relieving stress {{as well as for}} inducing any desirable reactions between the metal and the semiconductor.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Cross-sectional {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (TEM) sample preparation of ZnSeiGaAs epitaxial films is investigated. Conventional argon <b>ion</b> <b>milling</b> is shown to produce a high density (- 5 - 8 x 101 ’icm 2) of small (diameter- 60 - 80 A) extended defects (stacking faults, microtwins, double positioning twins, etc. ?. In addition, transmission electron diffraction results indicate a thin ZnO layer can also occasionally form upon <b>ion</b> <b>milling</b> or electron-beam irradiation although the exact conditions for ZnO formation are not well understood. Conventional TEM (amplitude contrast) and high-resolution TEM (phase contrast) imaging in combination with trans-mission electron diffraction studies were performed to determine the optimum method of removing the <b>ion</b> <b>milling</b> related damage and ZnO layers during sample preparation. HFiHCl, NaOH/H,O, H 2 S 0, 1 H 202 /H, 0 and Br,/CH,OH etching mixtures as well as low voltage argon or iodine <b>ion</b> <b>milling</b> were studied. A low energy (2 keV) iodine or argon <b>ion</b> <b>milling</b> step was shown to remove the ZnO layer and reduced {{the density of the}} extended defects associated with Ar + <b>ion</b> <b>milling,</b> but was unsuccessful in removing all of the defects. Auger electron spectroscopy results indicate re-sidual iodine was either left on the surface or implanted beneath the surface during iodine <b>ion</b> <b>milling.</b> Etching the XTEM samples in HFiHCl was shown to be effective in removing the ZnO layer but had little or no effect on the <b>ion</b> <b>milling</b> induced defects. Etching the samples in a 0. 5 % Br,iCH,OH solution resulted in complete elimination of the <b>ion</b> <b>milling</b> induced extended defects including the residual defects associated with iodine <b>ion</b> <b>milling.</b> In addition the Br,iCH,OH etch produced the best surface morphology. Thus a brief (1 - 2 seconds) Br,/CH,OH etch after conven-tional preparation (argon <b>ion</b> <b>milling)</b> of cross-sectional ZnSeiGaAs TEM samples appears to be an inexpensive and superior alternative to iodine <b>ion</b> <b>milling.</b> Sample preparation, ZnO formation, Ion millin...|$|E
