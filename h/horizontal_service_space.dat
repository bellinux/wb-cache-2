40|$|Web service {{composition}} {{is the process}} of synthesizing a new composite service using a set of available Web services in order to satisfy a client request that cannot be treated by any available Web services. The Web <b>services</b> <b>space</b> is a dynamic environment characterized by a huge number of elements. Furthermore, many Web services are offering similar functionalities. In this paper we propose a model for Web service composition designed to address the scale effect and the redundancy issue. The Web <b>services</b> <b>space</b> is represented by a two-layered network architecture. A concrete similarity network layer organizes the Web services operations into communities of functionally similar operations. An abstract interaction network layer represents the composition relationships between the sets of communities. Composition synthesis is performed by a two-phased graph search algorithm. First, the interaction network is mined in order to discover abstract solutions to the request goal. Then, the abstract compositions are instantiated with concrete operations selected from the similarity network. This strategy allows an efficient exploration of the Web <b>services</b> <b>space.</b> Furthermore, operations grouped in a community can be easily substituted if necessary during the composition's synthesis's process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Efficient and {{accurate}} discovery of user desired Web services {{is a key}} component for achieving the full potential of service computing. However, service discovery is a non-trivial task considering the large and fast growing <b>service</b> <b>space.</b> Meanwhile, Web <b>services</b> are typically autonomous and a priori unknown. This further complicates the service discovery problem. We pro-pose a service community learning algorithm that can generate homogeneous communities from the heterogeneous <b>service</b> <b>space.</b> This can greatly facilitate the service discovery process as the users only need to search within their desired service commu-nities. A key ingredient of the community learning algorithm is a co-clustering scheme that leverages the duality relationship between services and operations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real Web services demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed service community learning algorithm. I...|$|R

This {{publication}} is {{with permission}} of the rights owner freely accessible due to an Alliance licence and a national licence (funded by the DFG, German Research Foundation) respectively. Purpose – The {{purpose of this study}} is to provide insights into the role of governance mechanisms in fostering innovativeness in <b>horizontal</b> <b>service</b> cooperations. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 225 <b>horizontal</b> <b>service</b> cooperations in the logistics industry via an online survey. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the empirical data. Findings – The choice of governance measures helps to improve the innovativeness of service cooperations. The use of formalization and balanced mutual influence, combined with cultural similarity provides the basis for the development of new or enhanced services within the cooperation. In contexts that build on equity-based contracts, innovativeness is driven by the degree of mutual influence among partners. Research limitations/implications – Empirical data were collected in a single industry (logistics) and in a single country (Germany). A confirmation of the results in different service settings is therefore encouraged. Practical implications – This research emphasizes the importance of governance in facilitating innovation in service cooperations. By applying the right governance mechanisms in possible settings of co-opetition, managers can foster coordination and the exchange of knowledge and diminish opportunistic behavior among parties. Originality/value – The research is extended by developing a model based on the knowledge of service innovation, cooperation performance and governance mechanisms and by empirically testing this model...|$|R
