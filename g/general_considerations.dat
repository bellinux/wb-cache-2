2500|$|For a given n, the {{elementary}} symmetric polynomials e'k(x1,…,x'n) for k=1,…, n form an algebraic {{basis for the}} space of symmetric polynomials in x1,…. x'n: every polynomial expression in the x'i that is invariant under all permutations of those variables is given by a polynomial expression in those elementary symmetric polynomials, and this expression is unique up to equivalence of polynomial expressions. This is a general fact known as the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, and Newton's identities provide explicit formulae {{in the case of}} power sum symmetric polynomials. Applied to the monic polynomial [...] with all coefficients a'k considered as free parameters, this means that every symmetric polynomial expression S(x1,…,x'n) in its roots can be expressed instead as a polynomial expression P(a1,…,a'n) in terms of its coefficients only, in other words without requiring knowledge of the roots. This fact also follows from <b>general</b> <b>considerations</b> in Galois theory (one views the a'k as elements of a base field with roots in an extension field whose Galois group permutes them according to the full symmetric group, and the field fixed under all elements of the Galois group is the base field).|$|E

60|$|Of the sixty-nine species {{recorded}} {{in my first}} edition fourteen have been since discovered on the continent, while no less than twenty-two species and eleven varieties {{have been added to}} the list. As we can hardly suppose continental entomologists to be less thorough collectors than ourselves, it ought to be more and more difficult to find any insects which are unknown on the continent if all ours really exist there; and the fact that the list of apparently peculiar British species is an increasing one renders it probable that many of them are not only apparently but really so. Both <b>general</b> <b>considerations</b> dependent on the known laws of distribution, and the peculiar habits, conspicuous appearance, and restricted range, of many of our species, alike indicate that some considerable proportion of them will remain permanently as peculiar British species.|$|E

No positive facts are opposed to this view, and some <b>general</b> <b>considerations</b> render it probable. There is evidence of change in form, whether or not from subsidence, on some of these coral-islands; and there is evidence of subterranean disturbances beneath them.
