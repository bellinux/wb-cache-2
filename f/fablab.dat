40|$|We put the {{movement}} of creation of many <b>fablabs</b> in a socio-historical perspective by returning to {{the genesis of the}} model invented at the MIT and to its replication in France. Accordingly, we present the frameworks and methods of a field study conducted during the expansion of French <b>fablabs</b> during 2013. By limiting our investigation to <b>fablabs</b> that have been opened to the public, we distinguish two categories and we analyse the intermediation activities at work as well as the institutionalisation processes conducted by their founders. In the light of a comparative analysis of these two types of Third-Places, we interpret <b>fablabs</b> as a form of collective experimentation and distributed open innovation that owes much to the trajectories of the founders and to their strategy of “soft hacking” within institutions. Nous replaçons le mouvement de création de nombreux <b>fablabs</b> dans une perspective socio-historique en revenant sur la gestation du modèle inventé au MIT et sur sa réplication en France.

En limitant notre enquête aux <b>fablabs</b> ouverts au public, nous en distinguons deux catégories. Nous analysons les activités d’intermédiation en leur sein ainsi que le travail d’institutionnalisation réalisé par leurs fondateurs. À l’aune d’une analyse comparée de ces deux types de Tiers-Lieux, nous interprétons les <b>fablabs</b> comme une forme d’expérimentation collective et distribuée de l’innovation ouverte qui doit beaucoup aux trajectoires des fondateurs et à leur stratégie de « soft hacking » des institutions...|$|R

Through an analysis of an in–depth case study on <b>FabLabs,</b> this paper aims to provide insights into the practices emerging in these workshops, and realities of the relationship between its members and technologies that are currently under–researched. It does this by drawing upon the domestication literature that concerns itself with how people use, adapt and reject technologies and integrate them into their life.

40|$|<b>Fablabs</b> are {{platforms}} {{that provide}} machine tools for personal digital manufacturing. They {{are devoted to}} collaborative practices. In this work, we question their identity in term of boundary objects of {{a new form of}} public understanding of science ? Our theorical frames are based on empirical sociology. The work of articulation and coordination of the actors in the social, physical and temporal dimensions is analyzed through the collective of actors, places and objects. This approach is particularly suited to study the mobilization of technologies in heterogeneous groups. Our empirical work has been conducted in France on 6 different <b>fablabs</b> operating or being installed. <b>Fablabs</b> are service innovations. Because of the always intangible nature of service innovations, we present theoretical bases necessary to understand the organization of the group of users, the concept of service - rendering these devices, and how the network of actors fits into local logic design and logic of institutionalization through control of key resources. This thesis also presents the reading frame established for the analysis of our materials. We characterize the <b>fablabs,</b> their users, the variety of their activities and the design process of these boundary objects. We distinguish two types of <b>fablabs</b> because of their investment objectives and values they support. The first ("generic ") are the result of individual initiatives or micro- group’s and their activities are pretty much in the range of a service innovation. We show in particular how the institutionalization strategies result in terms of structure and construction of the device and how <b>fablabs</b> fit into the system, not by providing a simple prototyping service but trying to fill a “structural gap” through action intermediary between academic research and entrepreneurs. The second ones (called " Inmédiats ") have been devised by science museums with the aim to renew their practices. They differ from the generic ones by breaking into an existing institution with a network of actors. We examined the reorganization which follows. In particular, the business of public understanding sciences is re-interviewed in its practices and identities. These learning situations are experimented with stakeholders, especially teachers. We then explore the learning practices and we question their suitability to the ambition to open <b>fablabs</b> to the lay people. In conclusion, we emphasize the hybrid nature of <b>fablabs</b> and how they are finding their place in complex ecosystems. Our approach in terms of boundary object suggests cooperative action in the organization, production and circulation of knowledge between these actors and complex ecosystems. It also allows us to characterize how organizational learning occurred during the design process...|$|R

The <b>fablab</b> in Technopark, Trivandrum is {{established}} inside the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management- Kerala (IIITM-K). A Fabrication Laboratory (<b>FabLab)</b> is a technical prototyping platform for innovation and invention which aims at providing stimulus for local entrepreneurship {{and serves as a}} platform for learning and innovation. It is a small scale workshop offering digital fabrication which empowers the users to create smart devices for themselves which can be tailored to local or personal needs. The <b>FabLab</b> also becomes a medium for connecting to a global community of learners, educators, technologists, researchers and innovators - essentially becoming a self-sustaining global knowledge sharing network. The <b>FABLAB</b> programme involves setting up state-of-the-art Fabrication laboratories in the state to encourage startups in printed electronics and other such fields.

30|$|Several {{barriers}} in adopting technology and ICT {{have been identified}} and studied, like for example the unwillingness of citizens to accept and use new technologies, the lack of trust of social institutions providing access or limited access to technical infrastructure for {{a big part of}} the target population (Bertot, Jaeger, & Grimes, 2010). A premise of making in terms of the maker philosophy is the motivation to realize projects without any fear of touching new technologies. As a caveat, costly devices such as 3 D printers or milling machines are needed for industry-like customization or fabrication. <b>FabLabs</b> provide open and democratic access to this hardware, without following any commercial interests. The benefits of introducing the maker philosophy into formal education are obvious: from technology-skills to computational literacy and critical thinking (Blikstein & Krannich, 2013), from design, planning and communication skills to practical making skills (Steeg, 2008) - all this can be characterized as 21 st century skills. While <b>FabLabs</b> are not generally available due to a lack of widespread distribution, the costs for establishing and maintaining such an institution even prevent their further spread.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} 20 years, companies’ {{innovation}} practices have been revolutionised {{with the emergence}} of Web 2. 0 and the possibilities offered by digital technology. Having paved the way with the concepts of open innovation (OI), Chesbrough (2003, 2006) and Von Hippel (2006) have conceptualised a trend that radically alters our classic design and research model. Challenging the traditional principle of innovation, which is internal and “closed”, the concept of OI has shed light on brand new practices that aim to boost a company’s innovative capacity through its relations and exchanges with the exterior. Even though this concept alone does not cover completely new tools (licence agreements or partnerships and networks are well-known mechanisms), it nonetheless remains that Open Innovation promotes new mechanisms that enable companies to open up to the outside world (in the widest sense of the term). Internet-based digital tools make it possible to create intermediation platforms and websites for companies whose aim is to seek out knowledge, skills and expertise beyond their own borders and beyond their well-identified circles of more or less direct partners (Liotard & Revest, 2017). The great strength of Web 2. 0 is, then, to open the company up to the exterior, in the broadest sense because the “the exterior” now includes everyone (Internauts, students, employees, etc.), with the unprecedented characteristic of their having no previous connection with the company in question. Crowdsourcing now gives access to a great number of innovative proposals, and contributes to bottom-up forms of innovation. However, these new practices {{are not the only ones}} to emerge, and other formats are now radically transforming innovation’s traditional foundations. In particular, spaces known as <b>FabLabs</b> (FL) are currently springing up all over the world. This wave, instigated in 1998 by MIT professor Neil Gerhenfeld, has become widespread, and has led to the constitution of a network of <b>FabLabs</b> in both developed countries and the Global South. Notably, these collaboration spaces, stemming from a desire to share knowledge and openings, call into question production (which becomes local), intellectual property (more open, based on open source files and pooling material), hierarchy (peer communities enable projects to be carried out and <b>FabLabs</b> are emerging as non-hierarchical, horizontal spaces), and lastly, the role of the individual in a certain number of initiatives. These digital manufacturing spaces make digitally-controlled machines and 3 D printers available, representing not only a possibility for decentralised production and design for individuals but also offering open production spaces for both small and large companies, which also go there to seek training. The aim of this paper is to shed light on this new type of space and to define the different business models. It is based on a series of interviews we conducted between January and April 2017 with FabManagers from the Paris area and other regions in Franc...|$|R
50|$|Open source {{hardware}} and easy-to-use development boards {{such as the}} Arduino and the Raspberry Pi have increased community interest in electronics, particularly in <b>fablabs,</b> hackerspaces and makerspaces. The leading EDA software vendors traditionally lack free versions, and professional licenses are unaffordable for amateurs. This resulted in high piracy rates for professional software packages, or users sticking to outdated software, including CircuitMaker 2000. Several initiatives such as Eagle have attempted to fill this void, releasing restricted versions of semi-professional EDA tools. The rise of KiCAD further fragmented the market. This pressure eventually provided the incentive for Altium to release a simplified and more user friendly version of their professional EDA software package and flagship product, Altium Designer, targeted at less complex circuit board projects, culminating in the rebirth of CircuitMaker as schematic capture and PCB design software.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Inderscience via [URL] spaces (fab-spaces), such as TechShops or <b>FabLabs,</b> provide access to sophisticated digital manufacturing technologies to individuals. They could be a new institutional context which influences entrepreneurial behaviour. To understand how this might happen, we used a grounded approach to examine the experience of 8 individuals who have benefitted from fab-spaces to push forward their entrepreneurial ventures. This examination {{led to the development}} of new hypotheses regarding the potential role of fabspaces in the entrepreneurial journey. In particular, it has emerged that fab-spaces might affect the entry phase of a new venture by lowering the "perception of performance" threshold. Fab-spaces also affect post-entry barriers, as they provide an opportunity to entrepreneurs for fast learning, and consequently, to establish effective routines. However, this paper also shows how these positive effects might be moderated by fab-spaces’ institutional setup, chiefly their location and cultural characteristics.
