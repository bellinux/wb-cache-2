25|$|Just to make sure: <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any of {{the above}} is valid reasoning. I am writing this just to point out what I think are the central 'ideas' the authors had when writing their {{articles}} and how this led them to their conclusions.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is {{impossible}} or even difficult. There are genius women {{just as there}} are genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.|$|E

500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he did, but there were tears in his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
500|$|Biographer Robert Tate {{went further}} in his examination. During his {{research}} he contacted Professor Rafael Scheck, Head of History at Colby College. Scheck published Hitler's African Victims: The German Army Massacres of Black French Soldiers in 1940 {{and is an}} acknowledged expert on racial theory and in Nazi Germany. Without being familiar with Marseille, Scheck identified his friendship with Matthias was in direct contradiction to the Nazi mandate. Sheck doubted Marseille's [...] "acquisition" [...] of Matthais and his role as Marseille's [...] "batman", was done out of disrespect. Sheck said, [...] "I know of the camp commandant of the concentration camp of Mathausen, who held a black man as his personal servant. This was done out of disrespect, however. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> aspect was relevant for Marseille." [...] When questioned on Marseille's behaviour, Sheck said, [...] "I do not find it odd because I am accustomed to seeing many nuances among the Germans of the Third Reich. But his behaviour would probably be startling for many other researchers." [...] Tate also noted Marseille's penchant for Cuban rumba by Ernesto Lecuona, jazz and swing which he believes was another way of resisting Nazi ideals.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|St Stephen's Chapel {{remained}} largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, {{at the time}} the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as [...] "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small... when an important debate occurred... the members were really to be pitied". When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted [...] "What I may term corporeal conveniences were... marvellously small. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." [...] The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked [...] "Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no more than {{a foot and a half}} square?" ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{philosophy}} discovers {{something wrong}} with science, sometimes science has to be changed—Russell's paradox comes to mind, as does Berkeley's attack on the actual infinitesimal—but more often it is philosophy {{that has to be}} changed. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; and I think that the philosophical interpretations of mathematics that we are being offered on every hand are wrong, and that [...] "philosophical interpretation" [...] is just what mathematics doesn't need.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{hope that}} we can reach a {{commercial}} and viable solution which will enable the yard to stay in production. However, I must point out that the assistance voted by this House in the Shipbuilding Industry Act was meant to be used not to save uneconomic yards but to assist reorganisation with a view to promoting competitiveness in the industry. If the Burntisland yard fits that pattern, I shall be pleased, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> an inquiry would help us as of now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Shai Piron, Yesh Atid party MK, [...] {{and former}} {{education}} minister of Israel, called for Israel {{to have all}} schools include the Nakba in their curriculum. [...] "I’m for teaching the Nakba to all students in Israel. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a student can go through the Israeli educational system, while 20% of students have an ethos, a story, {{and he does not}} know that story." [...] He added that covering the topic in schools could address some of the racial tensions that exist in Israeli society. His comments broke a taboo in the traditional Israeli narrative, and conflicts with efforts {{on the part of some}} Israeli lawmakers to defund schools that mark Nakba.|$|E
2500|$|Nazi Germany {{engaged in}} a {{concentrated}} effort to destroy Polish culture. To that end, numerous cultural and educational institutions were closed or destroyed, from schools and universities, through monuments and libraries, to laboratories and museums. Many employees of said institutions were arrested and executed as part wider persecutions of Polish intellectual elite. Schooling of Polish children was curtailed to {{a few years of}} elementary education, as outlined by Himmler's May 1940 memorandum: [...] "The sole goal of this schooling is to teach them simple arithmetic, nothing above the number 500; writing one's name; and the doctrine that it is divine law to obey the Germans[...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> reading is desirable".|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, in {{the same}} addendum, a {{critical}} analysis of their work made by post-doc Urs Schreiber, and affirmed by the Bogdanovs as [...] "very accurate", was included {{with the exception of}} the concluding remark [...] "Just to make sure: <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any of the above is valid reasoning", thus inverting the meaning from criticism into ostensible support. [...] Moreover, a comment by physicist Peter Woit written as, [...] "It's certainly possible that you have some new worthwhile results on quantum groups", was translated as [...] "Il est tout à fait certain que vous avez obtenu des résultats nouveaux et utiles dans les groupes quantiques" [...] ("It is completely certain that you have obtained new and useful results on quantum groups") and published by the Bogdanovs in the addendum of their book.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April, in the Commons, Powell claimed [...] "it is {{difficult}} to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken". He added: [...] "We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and {{the wishes of the}} inhabitants of the Falkland Islands... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we need be too nice about saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people".|$|E

"I cannot see," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "why {{every one}} speaks of my uncle as a heartless person. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I ever met any one more kind, {{and he looks}} it, too. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I ever saw any one with such a benevolent face." ...|$|E
60|$|The court {{received}} it of me, {{but it was}} not different from the plat already on the record. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could ever have argued the case better than <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> nothing else, but prepare to argue and argue this case, from Friday morning till Monday evening. Very sorry for the result; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it could have been prevented.|$|R
