5|$|After landing, {{members of}} Company E under Captain Leveridge {{were sent to}} take the {{railroad}} station, while Ellsworth, Major Charles Loeser, Lieutenant H. J. Winser and several men from Company A set out to secure the telegraph office. On the way there, Ellsworth spotted a Confederate flag atop the Marshall House inn. It was the same flag Ellsworth had seen for weeks from the White House during his visits with Lincoln. Ellsworth's group entered the inn and quickly cut down the flag, but they encountered the proprietor, James Jackson, as they descended the stairs. Jackson killed Ellsworth with a shotgun blast to the chest, and Cpl. Francis Brownell responded <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> by fatally shooting the innkeeper.|$|E

5|$|As Naiad, Triton and Alcmene {{streamed}} past {{in pursuit}} of Santa Brigida, Young focused his attention on Thetis, coming within range at 11:30. Mendoza, seeing that battle was inevitable, bore up across Ethalions bows {{in an effort to}} rake Young's ship. Young turned in order to thwart the manoeuvre and fired two rapid broadsides into Thetis, which responded <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> For an hour the frigates exchanged running fire until Mendoza, realising escape was impossible, surrendered. Thetis had lost one man killed and nine wounded in the exchange while Ethalion had suffered no casualties.|$|E
5|$|As the Doctor investigates, {{he realizes}} that alien energy lifeforms were beamed onto the ship within the {{containment}} field into which the protostar samples were transported. The missing crew members have been converted to energy by the lifeforms from the protostar, presumably as hostages in retaliation for Voyagers actions. The Doctor releases the energy lifeforms on the holodeck; <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> the missing crew are returned to their original forms. Afterwards, upon reflection, the Doctor decides not to keep the name Schweitzer, as his memories associated with it are too painful.|$|E
5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch {{on issues such as}} abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> with attack ads of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E

On the night of 17–18 September, Bulgarian positions were targeted by nine salvos of gas shells, however the attack failed to produce any considerable effect due to the preceding arrival of new gas masks and the adequate training of the defenders.|$|E

5|$|The Patagonian {{tensions}} heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant {{ships which}} had been licensed {{to operate in the}} disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River. The Chilean Navy responded <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty.|$|E

5|$|The {{system was}} {{the topic of}} intense inter-service rivalry {{throughout}} its lifetime. When the ABM role {{was given to the}} Army in 1958, the United States Air Force began a long series of critiques on Zeus, both within defense circles and in the press. The Army returned these attacks <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> taking out full page advertisements in popular mass market news magazines to promote Zeus, as well as spreading development contracts across many states in order to garner the maximum political support. As deployment neared in the early 1960s, the debate became a major political issue. The question ultimately became whether or not a system with limited effectiveness would be better than nothing at all.|$|E

For a while, payments were made <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> using goods that were in short supply in East Germany, such as oranges, bananas, coffee and medical drugs.

5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E
5|$|After his {{conquest of}} Bulgaria, Basil II {{prevented}} revolts and discontent by retaining {{the rule of}} the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing them to be paid <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> instead. He also allowed the Bulgarian Patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status and all its dioceses, but reduced it to an archbishopric. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.|$|E

5|$|By 21:15, Pinsum {{realised}} {{that his}} heavily laden ship could not outrun Amethyst and reduced his speed, turning sharply {{in front of}} the British ship in an attempt to rake her. Seymour was prepared for the manoeuvre and countered it by turning sharply away from Thétis so that the French broadside fell harmlessly into the sea and both frigates performed a complete circle before returning to their previous course. Seymour then swung back towards the French ship, bringing Amethyst alongside and pouring a heavy fire into Thétis, which replied <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> For 25 minutes, the frigates continued firing on one another from close range as they sailed westwards. At 21:40, Pinsum again attempted to rake Amethyst, trying to cross the British ship's stern as she pulled ahead. Seymour countered by slowing his ship and the French rigging became tangled in the British, the firing continuing as the crews worked to free their ships from one another. Separating a few minutes later, the frigates continued their close-range duel. Amethyst again pulled ahead at 22:05, Seymour successfully crossing the bow of the French ship from port and raking her before swinging back along the starboard side to resume the close range exchange of broadsides.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the odds}} against him, the Batavian captain engaged Stag, Yorke laying his ship {{alongside}} Alliantie and the frigates exchanging broadsides for {{an hour before the}} Batavian captain, his situation hopeless and his ship outnumbered and battered, surrendered at 17:15. While Stag and Alliantie fought their duel, the action continued elsewhere, with the remaining Batavian ships making progress eastwards along the Norwegian coastline with the British squadron attempting to cut them off from the channel between Eigerøya and the Norwegian mainland in which the Batavian ships could shelter, protected by Danish neutrality. Vlugheid rapidly outdistanced pursuit, but Argo was slower and came under heavy but distant fire from Reunion and Isis, replying <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> Argo was subsequently found to have been hit thirty times by 24-pounder shot and had much of its sails and rigging torn away, requiring extensive repairs. Eventually the Batavian persistence paid off, and Vlugheid and Argo successfully escaped into the neutral harbour of Eigerøya before Alms could intercept them.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian's {{expansion}} {{of the army and}} civil service meant that the empire's tax burden grew. Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms here would be especially costly. The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs. Arrears became the norm for most troops. Many were even given payment <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> in place of their salaries. Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely be civil conflict, potentially open revolt. Diocletian was led to devise a new system of taxation.|$|E
