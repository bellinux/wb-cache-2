5|$|After {{realizing that}} no {{reinforcements}} would come, Thomas decided {{to launch a}} counter offensive. Early in {{the third week of}} September 634, Thomas drew men from all sectors of the city to form a force strong enough to break through the Gate of Thomas. He was there faced by Shurahbil with his corps of about 5,000 men. The Byzantine attack began with a concentrated shower of arrows against the Muslims. The Byzantine infantry, covered by the archers on the wall, rushed through the gate and fanned out into battle formation. Thomas himself led the assault. During this action, Thomas was struck in his right eye by an arrow. Unsuccessful in breaking the Muslim lines, the Byzantines retreated back to the fortress. The wounded Thomas is said to <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> to take a thousand eyes in return. He ordered another great sortie for that night.|$|E
5|$|Wounded, he {{is taken}} to a Resistance safehouse in Brooklyn. With the Germans {{controlling}} the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, it is revealed that the aliens, known as the Na'kuhl, <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> allegiance to Nazi Germany. Further, they are providing them with advanced weapons and technology in exchange for material and supplies to build a conduit that will take {{them back to their}} own time period. Meanwhile, Silik (John Fleck), the leader of the Suliban Cabal, had boarded Enterprise and manages to steal a shuttlepod to fly to Earth. Tucker and Mayweather are then sent to find Silik along with the shuttlepod. Archer contacts Sub-commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) using a stolen communicator and is transported back to Enterprise. Before dying, Daniels asks Archer to stop the Na'Kuhl from using the conduit and becoming even more dangerous. On Earth, the away team find and destroy the shuttlepod, but are captured and taken in for interrogation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to pin point any one reason as being the main cause or catalyst of the mutiny. However, a recent perspective has emerged {{of the role of}} global connections. The mutiny has revealed the permeable nature of colonial boundaries and the way that external influences were able to reach the colonies in Southeast Asia. The sepoys of the 5th Light Infantry were constantly being bombarded with information about what was happening outside of Singapore. As news of the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan spread, an anti-British movement spearheaded by the Ghadar Party was also disseminating special pamphlets in a variety of languages which were reaching through secret channels {{into the hands of the}} sepoys. Acrimonious slogans against the British only fuelled the anti-colonial sentiment among the sepoys. Some of the slogans were “the wicked English and their allies are now attacking Islam, but the German Emperor and the Sultan of Turkey <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> to liberate Asia from the tyranny. Now is the time to rise.... Only your strength and religious zeal are required”. The sepoys were clearly being bombarded with a lot of anti-British sentiments while being stationed on the small island of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The Bereans {{were formed}} by John Barclay in Edinburgh in 1773. Barclay {{was one of}} the most {{prominent}} followers of moral philosopher Archibald Campbell and espoused a rigorous form of pre-destination and insisted on Biblical-based preaching. Having been rejected from various pastorships and by the General Assembly, he founded independent churches in Scotland and then in England, taking the name Bereans from the people mentioned in Acts 17:11. After Barclay's death in 1798 his followers joined the congregationalists. The Buchanites were a Millenarian cult that broke away from the Relief Church when Hugh White, minister at Irvine, declared Elspeth Buchan to be a special saint identified with the woman described in Revelation 12. They attracted less than fifty followers and having been expelled by local magistrates they formed a community at a farm known as New Cample in Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire. The sect collapsed after the death of Buchan in 1791. Other minor sects include the McMillanites, reported as a group of Covernanters who had separated from kirk discipline in Dumfrisshire in 1721. Another group in the same area, called the Hebronites, were alleged to <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> at a minister. The Hebronites were later absorbed into the Secession Church with other Covenanters after 1736.|$|E

As the series progresses she shows that she deeply cares for and loves Yuto, but struggles with demons within herself. At {{the end of the}} series, Yuto saves Himari and confesses his love back to her. The anime differs from the manga {{when it comes to the}} final battle at the end. Reception of her character has been mostly positive.|$|E
25|$|Tsuna and {{his group}} defeat Byakuran {{and return to the}} present, where they learn that he is to be {{installed}} as Vongola X. The ceremony is disrupted by the Shimon Family, who <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> revenge on the Vongola founding father for allegedly betraying the first Shimon boss. Tsuna confronts the Shimon Family on a secluded island; the Vindice, a group of former Arcobaleno who protect the laws of the mafia, are involved in the fight and imprison the losers. After several battles it is learned that Daemon Spade, an illusionist and first Vongola generation guardian, was manipulating Shimon, using the conflict to control Mukuro Rokudo and remake the Vongolas in his image. The combined strength of Tsuna and Shimon's leader, Enma Kozato, defeats him.|$|E

500|$|During August and September 1987, Echo & the Bunnymen co-headlined {{a tour of}} the United States {{with popular}} {{electronic}} group New Order. Despite the tour passing without incident, the performances were deemed to be of poor quality. Although American audiences were apparently satisfied by the shows, when the group returned to the United Kingdom for an autumn tour the British music press and audiences were not as equally enthusiastic. Shortly thereafter the band announced plans to record a self-produced album of [...] "savage rock" [...] when there was more free time. The group toured the UK and the US again in early 1988. These concerts were more positively received than their tour the previous year, with guitarist Will Sergeant being singled out for praise– BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel said, [...] "Will Sergeant was superb, moving in a trice from squalls of angry sound to playing with such care and subtlety that there were whispered asides from his guitar that I would <b>have</b> <b>sworn</b> only he and I had heard."
