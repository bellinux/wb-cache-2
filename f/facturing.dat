40|$|AbstractWithin {{the context}} of molds and dies production, {{frequent}} changes in design and increased competitiveness require an overall optimized manu- <b>facturing</b> process. The finishing process is typically composed of an accurate milling stage to manage shape deviations, followed by polishing operations to reach required surface roughness. Local improvements of milling and polishing set independently do not necessarily lead to an op- timal manufacturing process planning. This study aims to propose a method to improve the whole sequence of milling and polishing considering constraints from polishing process and machine tool. The turning point between milling and polishing operations consists in linking them by {{the evaluation of the}} surface topography obtained after milling. From there, thanks to a predictive model of surface roughness, the design of polishing operations can be performed, and polishing time evaluated. On the other hand, for a given machine tool and a desired intermediate surface topog- raphy, milling parameters for finishing can also be modified and actual machining time predicted. Thus the whole process is evaluated balancing the milling and polishing times to reduce the total manufacturing time. Experiments are carried out on an aluminum mold for blowing process of plastic bottles...|$|E

Most of these devices are obtained by consolidating high purity, suitable sized particle ceramic powders; structured synthesis methods are required to ensure such requirements. BaTiO 3 powders were synthesised by a polymeric precursor method (Pechini) in this work. Very pure, small particle sized, raw material was obtained. These powders were characterised using thermo- gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TGDT), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results indicated that samples treated at 650 °C presented cubic BaTiO 3 as unique crystalline phase. If a sample were treated at 1, 100 °C, the tetragonal phase having a c/a < 1. 007 relationship was the main crystalline phase. Samples treated at 1, 100 °C showed ferroelectric paraelectric transi- tion at T ≈ 123 °C. BaTiO 3 tetragonal ceramic powders were uniaxially pressed and then synthesised at 1, 200 °C for 2 hours.

An ALBP consists of distributing the total workload for manu- <b>facturing</b> any unit of the products to be assembled among the work stations along the line sub- ject to a strict or average cycle time. Traditionally, stations {{are considered to be}} manned by one operator, respectively, or duplicated in form of identical parallel stations, each also manned by a single operator. In practice, this assumption is usually too restrictive. This is particularly true for large products like cars, trucks, busses and machines, which can be handled by several op- erators performing different tasks at the same time. Only restricted research has been done on such parallel workplaces within the same station though they have significant relevance in real- world assembly line settings. In this paper, we consider an extension of the basic ALBP to the case of flexible parallel work- places (VWALBP) as they typically occur in the automobile and other industries assembling large products. The problem is defined and modelled as an integer linear program. As a solution approach a branch-and-bound procedure is proposed which also can be applied as a heuristic.

An examination of the characteristic of industrial sector is an essential aspect of growth studies. The growth of a country can be measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is substantially affected by the industrial output. In dustrial gross output is mainly a function of capital and labor input. If the effect of labor and capital input to output is at a satisfactory level in an industry or {{in a group of}} industries, then industrial investment will increase. As a result, the number of industries will increase, which will directly affect GDP and also will decrease the unemployment rate.

40|$|The {{positioning}} accuracy of computer numer- ical control (CNC) machine tools is mainly {{limited by the}} manufacturing accuracy of their linear and circular motion axes and by the long-term dimensional stability of their structures. Maximizing this accuracy can {{prove to be a}} particularly challenging task, especially for large-sized systems. In fact, heat-induced deformations, long-period deformation of foundations and the manu- <b>facturing</b> process itself, these all cause time-dependent structural deformations of the machine body, which are difficult to model and to predict. The usual approach is a model-based prediction of structural deformations, which is followed by a compensation of positioning er- rors at CNC level. This approach is often limited by the complexity of the problem from both geometrical (sys- tem geometry can be very complex and it can vary in time) and physical (it is difficult to model and consider any possible load type and loading condition) point of view. As a consequence, only limited success has been achieved in active error compensation based on the modelling {{of the relationship between the}} generalized dynamic loads and the structural deformation field.

The variations {{may be due to}} e. g. aging or shift and they may occur within a single process step or within a process sequence. The application of advanced process control methods offer the possibility to reduce deviation of process centering and, therfore, improving process capability. In this work, we investigated the feed-forward concept applied for a litography/etch sequence to control the deviation of the critical dimension (CD) of polysilicon wires an also the implmentation of feed-forward control into existing manu <b>facturing</b> execution systems. The process sequence investigated consists of pho toresist on a polysilicon layer and an intermediate antireflective coating (ARC). The aim was to reduce the variability of the polysilicon wire. The antireflective coating is structured by a dry etching step followed by etching the polysilicon layer performed in the same process chamber. The overetch of the ARC serves as process step where corrective actions for the development demensioncan be conducted. The CD is controlled after photoresist development and after etching of the polysilicon, but not after ARC etching. Therefore, a model was created to calculate the overetch time {{as a function of the}} development dimension and polysilicon dimension. Additionally, a concept was developed to integrate the feed-forward control into proprietary manufacturing execution systems used and allowing a fully automated compensation of the CD Variability of polysilicon.

I find that there are strong positive differential effects to big plants in terms of employment and average wages of both skilled and unskilled workers relative to average sized and small plants with increased industry-level inward FDI. Further, this relative increase in employment of production workers at big plants is biased to- wards male workers. Average sized and smaller plants experience negative effects of inward FDI which can be explained in terms of intra-industry reallocation of output from smaller to bigger plants and poaching of higher quality production and skilled workers by bigger plants as industry-level FDI increases. However, in a more detailed analysis, I find that in regions where FDI inflows are large and persistent, there are strong positive effects in terms of increases in skill composition and wage-skill premium to both big and small plants alike. This suggests that for plants to experience positive effects of industry-level FDI, a critical mass of inward FDI needs to be achieved. The findings are important especially in the context of India’s recent Make-in-India campaign which combined with the objectives of the National Manufacturing Policy and the National Skill Development Corporation strives to increase India’s productive capacity in order to generate positive employment effects, and especially increase the pool of skilled workers in India’s manufacturing sector...|$|E

The proportion of commercial vehicle trips to and from South Shoreditch firms affected by the bans would be low and one-quarter of the firms would be affected by a 16 ton GW ban. One in five trips to and from Brimsdown firms is currently made by a vehicle in excess of 16 ton GVW, and two-thirds of the sample of firms would be affected. The majority of affected movements are by suppliers' vehicles rather than firms' own fleets. Three firms particularly likely to be affected were examined in more detail, and the implications of their changing to lighter vehicles investigated. A weight-specific 16 ton GVW ban would impose annual operating cost increases on all firms if they were to maintain existing levels of service with their own vehicle fleets. Under a 24 ton GVW ban two firms would incur cost increases while, for the operations considered, there would be a saving in annual operating costs for the third. The assumption that regulations governing vehicle dimensions and carrying capacity remain unaltered is crucial to the conclusions.

The bending of the micro pillars {{is a measure}} for the local wall shear stress (WSS) or a visualisa- tion of near wall flow phenomena. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was chosen as material for the sensor. Within the thesis the experimental work with the shear stress sensor mainly has {{the focus on the}} transition to turbulence. Closely connected are improvements of the measurement techniques. The transition is thereby investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. Another huge part of the thesis was the improvement of the reliability of the manu- <b>facturing</b> process of the micro pillars. For this purpose new manufacturing methods for single pillars and pillar arrays have been tested. Further on, dif- ferent detection methods for capturing the bending of the pillar were tested, too. The measurements of the transitional flow were performed at flat plate boundary layer in an oil channel. Ondina 913 was used as test fluid. The physical properties of the PDMS changed dramatically while longer exposed to Ondina 913. Hence, it was unfeasible to receive reproducible quantita- tive results. Better results were achieved if the pillars are used as flexible micro tufts revealing the flow and WSS topology directly at the wall quali- tatively. With the pillar sensor it was possible to detect turbulent spots in the transitional state of the flat plate boundary layer. Furthermore, coherent structures and their typical sign in the viscous sublayer could be identified and the occurrence of critical points and back flow could be experimentally verified...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFree-form {{parametric}} {{surfaces are}} common tools nowadays in many applied fields, such as Computer-Aided Design & Manu- <b>facturing</b> (CAD/CAM), virtual reality, medical imaging, and many others. A typical {{problem in this}} setting is to fit surfaces to 3 D noisy data points obtained through either laser scanning or other digitizing methods, so that the real data from a physical object are transformed back into a fully usable digital model. In this context, the present paper describes an immunological- based approach to perform this process accurately by using the classical free-form Bézier surfaces. Our method applies a powerful bio-inspired paradigm called Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), which is receiving increasing attention from the sci- entific community {{during the last few}} years because of its appealing computational features. The AIS can be understood as a computational methodology based upon metaphors of the biological immune system of humans and other mammals. As such, there is not one but several AIS algorithms. In this chapter we focus on the clonal selection algorithm (CSA), which explicitly takes into account the affinity maturation of the immune response. The paper describes how the CSA algorithm can be effectively applied to the accurate fitting of 3 D noisy data points with Bézier surfaces. To this aim, the problem to be solved as well as the main steps of our solving method are described in detail. Some simple yet illustrative examples show the good performance of our approach. Our method is conceptually simple to understand, easy to implement, and very general, since no assumption is made on the set of data points or on the underlying function beyond its continuity. As a consequence, it can be successfully applied even under challenging situations, such as the absence of any kind of information regarding the underlying function of data...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Strategic use of IT among SMEs has gained much attention recently as both reseachers and practitioners view this {{as one of the}} avenues for smaller firms to compete successfully. However, very little empirical work has been done to understand the issue. This study helps to fill this gap in the important research area by exploring the alignment of business strategy and IT strategy among UK man <b>facturing</b> firms with less than 150 employees. A mail survey of Chief Executive Officers generated 256 responses to an eight page questionnaire. Factor analysis of the nine business strategy and the nine IT strategy variables yielded three business strategy factors and three IT strategy factors which could be sensibly identified with strategy areas and which clearly showed a fit between the two sets. Based on these two set offactors, the measurement of IS alignment was explored using two methods: (1) the 'moderation' or interaction approach, and (2) the 'matching' or difference approach. The finding of this study provides support for past observation that the `moderation' approach of measuring fit' is more meaningful when the performance criterion is included in the research model. By using a multistep cluster analysis, two distinct groups of SMEs are identified based on the alignment between quality-oriented, product-oriented, and market-oriented business strategy and IT strategy which support these strategies. The group of SiviEs which has a high degree of alignment for the three strategy areas are found to achieve better organisational performance than the group of SÄLIEs with a low degree of IS alignment. Interestingly, {{the findings of this study}} also indicate that the degree of alignment between business strategy and IT strategy is related to the level of IT sophistication and the level of CEO's commitment to IT. In summary, this study has extended our understanding of IS alignment and has provided useful insights for CEOs of small and medium-sized companies in planning their IT utilisation...|$|E

According to foreign experience, clusters provide an opportunity not only for the development of small and middle-sized businesses, but also for the development of regions. This cooperation opportunity is also used by firms in the region of South Bohemia. At present, there are three active clusters: CEVTECH - The centre of waterworks technologies, EKOGEN, Ltd. - cluster for proces- sing small inorganic waste materials in construction industry and the South Bohemia wood manu- <b>facturing</b> cluster. In preparation are: Brewery cluster, Renewable sources of energy (Technology for utilization of biomass) and Welding cluster. First clusters of CEVTECH and EKOGEN were established in 2006. The surveyed manager of these clusters considered the first year as positive. They were not fully satisfied with the cooperation with certain institutions and with complicated administration. They also emphasized the importance of subsidies for further activities of the clus- ters. In the region of South Bohemia, 12 new subsidy applications were submitted to the clusters program, 7 of them were approved. The survey among small and middle-sized companies revealed that the middle-sized companies have certain awareness of the business clusters, but small businesses know almost nothing about them. Small businesses showed only a minimal interest in the cluster membership, the present state of entrepreneurship suits them well. Good running clusters could increase interest in cluster formation...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{globalization}} today {{the competition in}} the market has in- creased and it requires flexibility and produce according to customer demand. In {{order to reduce the}} cost of wages industrial companies are now considering moving the manufacturing to low-cost countries. To keep up with the competition in the market without moving the manu- <b>facturing</b> abroad, Lean Automation was developed. The concept of Lean Automation is to reduce the perceived complexity with automa- tion and make automation available for new users and in new applica- tions. Haldex Brake Products are situated in Sweden and want to maintain the manufacturing of the automatic brake adjusters in the country. It is a product well-known and highly exposed to the competition in the mar- ket. Due to this situation Haldex are collaborating with Mälardalen University to develop a robotic cell based on the concept of Lean Au- tomation. It will be installed on their assembly line in 2012. The goal with this master thesis is to create a development process for automation, which can enable the company to be more competitive in the market and this by using their own knowledge to develop automat- ed solutions for higher efficiency in the production line. In addition to the development process for automation, programming of the Lean Au- tomation robotic cell is to be conducted. The conducted work in the master thesis was the programming of the robotic cell and the development process for automation. The pro- gramming was made Lean by reducing waste of time when working with the programmed code. This by a clear structure in the program- ming which makes it easy to handle. A development process for auto- mation was made and used for developing a robotic cell for the assem- bly line. The robotic cell was then tested at Haldex, an important stage before implementing the cell on the assembly line. Testing the robotic cell will give important information about how the equipment actually runs and failures can be observed and adjusted. Testing of the robotic cell will continue after the end of this master thesis. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} deliverable D 4. 18 {{defined as}} ‘Techniques for off-site fabrication and on-site assembly of new bridges’, {{which is a}} result from Work package 4, Task 4. 2. The main aim of the PANTURA project is to "improve highly flexible off-site production and construction processes, create resource-efficient construction sites with minimum carbon emissions, improve technol- ogies and tools for bridge construction in densely populated areas and enhance communication between local authorities and construction companies. ” With regard to this main aim, {{the goal of this}} report is to develop technologies for construction of new bridges in densely populated areas that enable total con- struction time reduction by at least 20 %. To reach this goal, interest is focused on fast on-site assembly with regard to the connections between bridge elements, such as fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) decks and steel girders. Firstly, an extensive literature review about industrialized construction methods is conducted. The practi- cal problems involved mainly during assembly are brought up and new assembly techniques involving fibre reinforced polymer materials are proposed. The new assembly techniques are developed by transfer- ring knowledge from other sectors for potential use in construction with an emphasis on design for manu- <b>facturing</b> and assembly. These techniques are evaluated taking into account the voice of the customer. After evaluation, the promising techniques are further studied by advanced numerical analyses. Laborato- ry testing is performed on one potential connection between FRP bridge deck panels and it is found that this connection is sufficiently stiff and strong for use in bridges, and it enables immediate assembly. The potential use of this technique is demonstrated in one case study bridge, Koninginne bridge located in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Design recommendations for the FRP-steel composite bridges are devel- oped. In addition, a life-cycle assessment and life-cycle cost analysis is performed to determine the cost efficiency and environmental impact of the new proposed solutions compared with traditional bridge con- struction methods. The participating partners in WP 4 /Task 4. 2 and in the preparation of this deliverable are CTH (Sweden), ACC (Spain), MOS (Poland), AIC (Italy) and TRV (Sweden). The work in this report has been carried out from January 2011 to December 2013...|$|E
