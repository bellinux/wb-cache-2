An enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a holoenzyme (or <b>haloenzyme).</b> The term holoenzyme can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the DNA polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of substitution in transition metal complexes are reviewed with {{particular emphasis on}} recent developments. Strong support is available for a dissociative mechanism in formation reactions, in which the release {{of water from the}} metal ion controls the rate of entry of ligand. This generalization breaks down in the case of certain protonated ligands as well as multidentate ligands of special structure. Some substitution reactions of carbonic anhydrase (in the native and cobalt forms) are reviewed. These include the interaction of enzyme with inhibitors, including sulphonamides and cyanate ion. Kinetic data for these are discussed. The results of studies of the regeneration of the <b>haloenzyme</b> from apoenzyme and metal ion or metal complexes are given and discussed. I had the pleasure of helping Dr. Chatt in the organization of the first I. C. C. C. (although it was not recognized as such at that time). It was held in the I. C. I. Research Laboratories at Weiwyn in 1950 and forty people attende...|$|E

To survive under such extreme conditions, haloarchaea and their enzymes have evolved to function optimally in environments with high salt concentrations and, sometimes, with extreme pH and temperatures. These features make haloarchaea attractive sources {{of a wide variety of}} biotechnological products, such as hydrolytic enzymes, with numerous potential applications in biotechnology. The unique trait of haloarchaeal enzymes, <b>haloenzymes,</b> to sustain activity under hypersaline conditions has extended the range of already-available biocatalysts and industrial processes in which high salt concentrations inhibit the activity of regular enzymes. In addition to their halostable properties, <b>haloenzymes</b> can also withstand other conditions such as extreme pH and temperature. In spite of these benefits, the industrial potential of these natural catalysts remains largely unexplored, with only a few characterized extracellular hydrolases. Because of the applied impact of haloarchaea and their specific ability to live in the presence of high salt concentrations, studies on their systematics have intensified in recent years, identifying many new genera and species. This review summarizes the current status of the haloarchaeal genera and species, and discusses the properties of <b>haloenzymes</b> and their potential industrial applications. </p...|$|R
40|$|Search for new enzymes of {{industrial}} relevance, bestowed with novel properties {{continues to be}} a desirable pursuit in enzyme research. Halophilism is the unusual existence of life in saline/ hypersaline habitats and <b>haloenzymes,</b> are the proteins from such origin, naturally endowed with unique structural features which enable them to sustain functionality under high salt. Driven by industrial requirements, halophilic enzymes have been explored for their stability and catalytic abilities under harsh operational conditions. These have been documented to withstand high temperature, pH, organic solvents, and chaotropic agents. However, this stability is modulated by salt. Understanding the basis of salt mediated protection amidst a denaturing milieu will add significantly to the existing knowledge about structure function relationships in halophilic proteins. Exploring their protein architecture may provide template for rationale design of stable enzymes. The article encompasses the current level of understanding about haloadaptations in halophiles and structural basis of their stability against classical denaturants...|$|R
