5|$|The RAAF and Army jointly {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} the Chinooks from service in May 1989. This {{decision was made to}} reduce costs, the Army believing that the Black Hawks would provide sufficient air lift capability. Due to the Chinooks' high operating costs, only six of the helicopters were in service at the time. No. 12 Squadron ceased <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> 30 June 1989, and was disbanded on 25 August that year.|$|E
5|$|The Shuttle–Mir Program was a {{collaborative}} space program between Russia and the United States, which involved American Space Shuttles visiting the Russian space station Mir, Russian cosmonauts <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> the shuttle, and an American astronaut flying aboard a Soyuz spacecraft {{to engage in}} long-duration expeditions aboard Mir.|$|E

5|$|Between January and March 1952 the {{journalist}} Ian Fleming wrote Casino Royale, his first novel, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. Fleming conducted research for Live and Let Die, and completed the novel before Casino Royale {{was published in}} January 1953, four months before his second book was published. Fleming and his wife Ann flew to New York before taking the Silver Meteor train to St. Petersburg in Florida and then <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> to Jamaica. In doing so they followed the same train route Fleming had taken with his friend Ivar Bryce in July 1943, when Fleming had first visited the island.|$|E

5|$|During the war RAF Uxbridge was {{tasked with}} {{despatching}} personnel {{to and from}} training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised formation <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with radios, compasses and speed indicators. British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was re-posted to NAS Corpus Christi, {{first as}} a student at the Naval School of All-Weather Flight, and then as a flight instructor. In July 1951, he was sent to the Amphibious Warfare School at Marine Corps Base Quantico in {{northern}} Virginia for a six-month course. He then joined the staff of the Commandant, Marine Corps Schools. Given only four hours of flying time per month, he maintained his proficiency (and flight pay) by <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> weekends. He was promoted to major in July 1952.|$|E
5|$|He {{was then}} {{grounded}} from <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> operations, as his experience and leadership qualities {{were regarded as}} too valuable to risk further in front line combat. He did fly on occasional sorties, the most famous involving the shooting down of a Lancaster bomber of No. 44 Squadron RAF piloted by Warrant Officer G. T. Rhodes in April 1942, during a rare RAF daylight raid on targets in Augsberg. It was his 101st kill. In August 1942, the Geschwaderstab of JG 2 exchanged their Bf 109 F aircraft for the FW 190 A–2s.|$|E

5|$|In November 1974, British Airways Flight 870 was hijacked {{shortly after}} {{take-off}} from Dubai for London Heathrow. The Vickers VC10 landed at Tripoli for refuelling before <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> to Tunis. The captain, Jim Futcher, {{returned to the}} aircraft to fly it knowing the hijackers were on board. The hijackers eventually surrendered after 84 hours, but not before a hostage was murdered. Futcher was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal, the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators Founders Medal, the British Air Line Pilots Association Gold Medal and a Certificate of Commendation from British Airways for his actions during the hijacking.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the horizontal stabilizer {{of the second}} prototype was strengthened and it resumed <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> 20 July. The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical stabilizer was enlarged by , but this {{was just one of}} numerous problems, and it was not ready to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the powerplant. However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1941 Roekiah and Djoemala {{completed}} Poesaka Terpendam (Buried Treasure), an action-filled film {{which followed}} two groups– the rightful heirs (Roekiah {{being one of}} them) and a band of criminals– in a race to find treasure buried in Banten. Roekiah and Djoemala worked on their final film together, Koeda Sembrani (The Enchanted Horse), in early 1942. In the film, adapted from One Thousand and One Nights, Roekiah took the role of Princess Shams-al-Nahar and was shown <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> a horse. The film was still incomplete when the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies began in March 1942, though it was screened by October 1943.|$|E

5|$|On 30 May he was graded First Class Flier. The {{grade was}} based upon his achievements; he had {{achieved}} a dead-stick landing within a fifty-yard marker, a 15-minute flight at 6,000 feet, a 60-mile cross-country flight and 15 hours solo <b>flying.</b> <b>On</b> 24 May he passed his final test with a two-hour flight from Salisbury, to Southampton and onto Basingstoke. His 74 hours flying experience was well above the minimum. By {{the time he left}} for France in June he had accumulated 121 flying hours, given 177 lessons as instructor, and had personally tutored 40 student pilots.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1945, Rudel {{was badly}} {{wounded in the}} right foot, and crash landed inside German lines. Rudel's leg was amputated below the knee.

On 19 April 1945, the day before Hitler's final birthday, Rudel met with Hitler in the Führerbunker at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. On 8 May 1945, Rudel fled westward from an airfield near Prague, landing in US controlled territory, and surrendered.|$|E
5|$|One set of deleted scenes charted the Space Exploration Center's {{attempts}} to enlist International Rescue to escort the second Zero-X. Meanwhile, the Hood telepathically contacts his half-brother Kyrano, coercing him to relay the Tracy family's actions. With {{the removal of}} the one scene in which he appears, Kyrano, another character voiced by David Graham, was completely cut from the film. A second deleted scene featured Lady Penelope and Parker en route to Glenn Field via New York, <b>flying</b> <b>on</b> board the aircraft Fireflash which made its first appearance in the pilot episode of Thunderbirds. Another deleted scene saw Jeff Tracy give a speech, broadcast worldwide over the Trans American TV Network.|$|E
