5|$|The Lincolns {{generally}} conducted {{area bombing}} missions, {{as well as}} strikes against pinpoint targets. They operated singly and in formations, sometimes in concert with RAF bombers. Not having to contend with anti-aircraft fire, the Lincolns flew mainly by day. After completing a bomb run, they would make another pass over the target to strafe with machine guns and 20mm cannon. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, {{as well as their}} firepower and heavy bomb load. No.1 Squadron also flew night missions—the only Commonwealth air force unit authorised to do so—of up to six hours duration, dropping one bomb <b>every</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> or so. To reduce the risk of collateral damage, all air strikes had to be approved by the Joint Operation Centre, located at Kuala Lumpur in central Malaya and staffed by military, police and civilian personnel. Although the original purpose of the bombing campaign was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving them out of their bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops.|$|E

The Royal Navy's Operational Intelligence Centre collated {{information on these}} topics, and regularly provided assessments to the Home Fleet and other commands. The decision to attack the Bodø area was {{made on the basis}} of Ultra intelligence obtained by decoding German radio signals, from which the Allies learned that the ships in the region included the large oil tanker , which was carrying fuel for the German battle group at Altafjord. In addition, at the time of Operation Leader two groups of Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) agents operated radio transmitters on the coast of Helgeland: [...] "Crux III" [...] on the island of Renga and [...] "Pisces" [...] on Lurøy.

500|$|Spector made various {{changes to}} the songs. His most {{dramatic}} embellishments occurred on 1 April 1970, the last ever Beatles recording session, when he added orchestral overdubs to [...] "The Long and Winding Road", [...] "Across the Universe" [...] and [...] "I Me Mine" [...] at Abbey Road Studios. The {{only member of the}} Beatles present was Starr, who played drums with the session musicians to create Spector's characteristic [...] "Wall of Sound". Already known for his eccentric behaviour in the studio, Spector was in a peculiar mood that day, according to balance engineer Peter Bown: [...] "He wanted tape echo on everything, he had to take a different pill <b>every</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> and had his bodyguard with him constantly. He was on the point of throwing a wobbly, saying 'I want to hear this, I want to hear that. I must have this, I must have that.'" [...] The orchestra became so annoyed by Spector's behaviour that the musicians refused to play any further; at one point, Bown left for home, forcing Spector to telephone him and persuade him into coming back after Starr had told Spector to calm down.|$|E
500|$|To {{protect the}} {{unloading}} transports during the night, Crutchley divided the Allied warship forces into three groups. A [...] "southern" [...] group, {{consisting of the}} Australian cruisers HMAS Australia and , cruiser , and destroyers [...] and , patrolled between Lunga Point and Savo Island to block the entrance between Savo Island and Cape Esperance on Guadalcanal. A [...] "northern" [...] group, consisting of the cruisers , [...] and , and destroyers [...] and , conducted a box-shaped patrol between the Tulagi anchorage and Savo Island to defend the passage between Savo and Florida Islands. An [...] "eastern" [...] group consisting of the cruisers [...] and [...] and two U.S. destroyers guarded the eastern entrances to the sound between Florida and Guadalcanal Islands. Crutchley placed two radar-equipped U.S. destroyers {{to the west of}} Savo Island to provide early warning for any approaching Japanese ships. The destroyer [...] patrolled the northern passage and the destroyer [...] patrolled the southern passage, with a gap of 12–30 kilometres (8–20mi) between their uncoordinated patrol patterns. At this time, the Allies were unaware of all of the limitations of their primitive ship-borne radars, such as the effectiveness of the radar could be greatly degraded by the presence of nearby landmasses. [...] Chicagos Captain Bode ordered his ship's radar to be turned off in the mistaken belief it would reveal his position. [...] He allowed a single sweep <b>every</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> with the fire control radar, but the timing of the last pre-engagement sweep was too early to detect the approaching Japanese cruisers. [...] Wary of the potential threat from Japanese submarines to the transport ships, Crutchley placed his remaining seven destroyers as close-in protection around the two transport anchorages.|$|E
