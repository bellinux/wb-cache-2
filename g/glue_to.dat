Contrary to this view, James Beck and {{numerous}} artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in a wash of <b>glue</b> <b>to</b> lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, a secco.

25|$|Painting taken {{literally}} is {{the practice}} of applying pigment suspended in a carrier (or medium) and a binding agent (a <b>glue)</b> <b>to</b> a surface (support) such as paper, canvas or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means {{the use of this}} activity in combination with drawing, composition and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to The Sistine Chapel to the human body itself.|$|E

25|$|Glue smears and {{droplets}} {{are sometimes}} present around the joints of furniture. They {{can be removed}} {{using a combination of}} scraping, scrubbing and sanding. These approaches remove surface glue, but not the glue beneath the wood surface. Sub-surface glue will reduce the absorption of stain by wood, and may alter the scratch pattern created by sanding. Both these effects will influence {{the way in which the}} wood colours when stains are used to finish the wood. To overcome this problem it may be necessary to locally stain and touch-up areas previously covered by <b>glue</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the finish on such areas matches that of the surrounding wood.|$|E
25|$|Silk fibers {{from the}} Bombyx mori {{silkworm}} have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5–10 μm wide. The fibroin-heavy chain is composed mostly of beta-sheets, {{due to a}} 59-mer amino acid repeat sequence with some variations. The flat surfaces of the fibrils reflect light at many angles, giving silk a natural sheen. The cross-section from other silkworms can vary in shape and diameter: crescent-like for Anaphe and elongated wedge for tussah. Silkworm fibers are naturally extruded from two silkworm glands {{as a pair of}} primary filaments (brin), which are stuck together, with sericin proteins that act like <b>glue,</b> <b>to</b> form a bave. Bave diameters for tussah silk can reach 65 μm. See cited reference for cross-sectional SEM photographs.|$|E
25|$|The {{parabolic}} form of St Paul's {{was made}} possible by the use of glued laminated timber for the internal arches. Laminated timber arches, constructed by overlapping and bolting together small pieces of timber to make a single, large member, have been in use in Australia since the mid-19th century. Cost-effective and able to span large distances without intermediate posts, laminated timber arches also became an alternative system for roof structures of large buildings such as markets, factories and, from the early 20th century, large auditoria and picture theatres. The process of glue lamination, using casein <b>glue</b> <b>to</b> bond the layers of timber rather than bolts, originated in Germany before being introduced to the United States in the 1920s. Several publications in the 1930s and early 1940s provided the necessary data for constructing glued laminated timber arches, and became a source of inspiration for Australian designers. The earliest experiments in Australia took place in the early 1940s and the arrival of powerful synthetic resin adhesives in the post- World War II period increased the reliability and range of applications of glue lamination. The former Burge Bros Factory in Melbourne (1945–46) is considered to be the oldest known surviving example of this technology in Australia, with semi-circular arches spanning 30 metres, manufactured by Sydney-based company Ralph Symonds Ltd.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the flower}} is {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way as to make the surface almost impossible to cling to, with smooth, downward-pointing hairs; the bees commonly slip and fall into the fluid in the bucket, and the only navigable route out is a narrow, constricting passage that either glues a [...] "pollinium" [...] (a pollen sack) on their body (if the flower has not yet been visited) or removes any pollinium that is there (if the flower has already been visited). The passageway constricts after a bee has entered, and holds it there for a few minutes, allowing the <b>glue</b> <b>to</b> dry and securing the pollinium. It has been suggested that this process involves [...] "inebriation" [...] of the bees, but this effect has never been confirmed.|$|E
500|$|The crystal {{is mounted}} for {{measurements}} {{so that it}} may be held in the X-ray beam and rotated. There are several methods of mounting. In the past, crystals were loaded into glass capillaries with the crystallization solution (the mother liquor). [...] Nowadays, crystals of small molecules are typically attached with oil or <b>glue</b> <b>to</b> a glass fiber or a loop, which is made of nylon or plastic and attached to a solid rod. [...] Protein crystals are scooped up by a loop, then flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. This freezing reduces the radiation damage of the X-rays, as well as the noise in the Bragg peaks due to thermal motion (the Debye-Waller effect). However, untreated protein crystals often crack if flash-frozen; therefore, they are generally pre-soaked in a cryoprotectant solution before freezing. Unfortunately, this pre-soak may itself cause the crystal to crack, ruining it for crystallography. Generally, successful cryo-conditions are identified by trial and error.|$|E

500|$|When Kenyan {{officials}} {{decided to}} destroy their stockpile in 1989, {{they had to}} find a way to do so that would create powerful images. Leakey turned to fellow conservationist Kuki Gallmann, who described their discussions and experiments in her memoir I Dreamed of Africa. She asked Hollywood special effects professional Robin Hollister what he would recommend, and introduced him to Leakey. Hollister understood Leakey's intention to create a spectacle, and the importance of producing an immediate dramatic flare-up. He suggested a combination of flammable <b>glue</b> <b>to</b> coat the tusks, and a hidden system of pipes to spray them with fuel. His plans were adopted, and when the Kenyan President held a torch to the waiting pile, [...] "Flames flared up in a scalding blaze. [...] The ivory blackened and started burning, crackling.

500|$|The {{stitching}} of {{the binding}} uses [...] "Coptic sewing", that is [...] "flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round {{one another in}} a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)" [...] Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. [...] Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. [...] In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. [...] This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. [...] The first appearance of the cords or supports that these [...] "unsupported" [...] bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques. [...] The cords run horizontally across the spine, and are thicker than the threads that hold the pages together. [...] They are attached, typically by lacing through holes or <b>glue,</b> <b>to</b> the two boards of the cover, and the threads holding the gatherings are knotted to them, resulting in a stronger binding.|$|E
