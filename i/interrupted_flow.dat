40|$|The {{reduction}} in the intake rate (IR) during interrupted irrigation is difficult to predict. Sediments in irrigation water decrease the effect of interrupted irrigation on IR. Polyacrylamide (PAM) reduces rill erosion, but its effect on IR is controversial. The effects of water quality (tap water, tap water containing sediments, and 10 g m− 3 PAM solution) and <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> on IR and rill erosion in an Alfisol (Calcic Haploxeralf) and a Vertisol (Typic Chromoxerert) were studied using laboratory miniflumes. Rill erosion in both soils was eliminated by the PAM treatment in both continuous and <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow.</b> The PAM application reduced IR in the Alfisol and increased it in the Vertisol. In the Alfisol, <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> reduced IR of the PAM solution by 37 % compared with only 18 % for tap water. In the Vertisol, <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> reduced IR only slightly and the decrease was not affected by the polymer. When the water contained sediments, cumulative infiltration was reduced by 22 % for the Vertisol and 59 % for the Alfisol in comparison with tap water. These reductions were attributed to depositional seal formation. The IR of the Alfisol was more susceptible to depositional seal formation than the Vertisol. The presence of sediments in water was effective in reducing rill erosion. The effects of <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> with PAM on reducing IR were explained by partial blocking of the conducting pores leading to greater suction and compaction of the soil surface. For sediment-laden irrigation water, <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> had no advantage over continuous flow in reducing IR because of depositional seal formation associated with the sediments in the water.

40|$|Efficiency {{of surface}} {{irrigation}} is often low {{because of poor}} infiltration uniformity, resulting from relatively long periods of infiltration at the upstream end and short periods of infiltration at the downstream end of the field. Surge irrigation, the intermittent supply of water to furrows, generally reduces soil intake rate (IR) and improves moisture uniformity over the entire field. However, IR reduction varies from one irrigation scheme to another, depends on soil and water properties, and is difficult to predict. A laboratory study using miniflumes was designed to investigate the effect of <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> on IR and soil loss from short rills. Two soils differing in their textures, a silt loam (Calcic Haploxeralf) derived from loess and a clay soil (Typic Haploxerert), were studied. Intake rate in the clay soil was greater than that in the silt loam. Therefore, different inflow rates were applied to the two soils to achieve similar runoff flow rates from the two soils. Cumulative infiltration decreased from 646 mL in continuous flow to 539 mL in <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> for the silt loam and from 1142 to 1068 mL in the clay soil. <b>Interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> also reduced cumulative soil loss by 84 % in the clay soil but had only a small effect on soil loss from the silt loam. However, when flow rate was increased from 80 to 320 mL min− 1, <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> reduced soil loss in the silt loam {{as much as in}} the clay soil. Consolidation of the soil surface and formation of cohesive forces between soil particles of the silt loam with unstable structure during flow interruption was suggested as the explanation for the effect of flow interruption on intake rate and soil detachment. These results need to be verified in field experiments. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to try to objectify assessment of pediatric uroflowmetry curves. Nine professionals in pediatric incontinence care judged 480 pediatric uroflows. On a 1 - 5 scale, where 1 [*]=[*]anomalous and 5 [*]=[*]normal, uroflows were assessed on four items: staccato, <b>interrupted,</b> <b>flow</b> time and obstruction. Eighty uroflows were re-evaluated for intra-observer agreement. After staccato and <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> had been defined more sharply, another 100 uroflows were analyzed. Cohen's Kappa test for nominally classified data was applied to assess agreement. Kappa value of < 0. 20 denoted poor agreement, 0. 21 - 0. 40 fair, 0. 41 - 0. 60 moderate, 0. 61 - 0. 80 substantial and 0. 81 - 1. 0 perfect or almost perfect agreement. A second analysis was done using a 3 point scale, anomalous, intermediate and normal. For interobserver agreement, Kappas were 0. 45 for staccato flow, 0. 67 for interrupted, 0. 59 for flow time, and 0. 66 for obstruction. For intra-observer agreement, Kappas were 0. 47 for staccato, 0. 65 for interrupted, 0. 55 for flow time, and 0. 65 for obstruction. On a three-point scale, anomalous, intermediate, and normal, interobserver agreement was equal to 0. 80 or above. In the second 100 uroflows, the interobserver agreement Kappas were 0. 44 for staccato, 0. 95 for interrupted, 0. 71 for flow time and 0. 73 for obstruction. Moderate to substantial agreement on uroflowmetry curves can be reached, except for staccato. Agreement increases if staccato and interrupted flows are defined more sharply.

40|$|We {{present an}} interrupted-flow {{centrifugation}} technique to characterise preferential flow in low permeability media. The method entails {{a minimum of}} three phases: centrifuge-induced flow, no flow and centrifuge-induced flow, which may be repeated several times in order to most effectively characterise multi-rate mass transfer behaviour. In addition, the method enables accurate simulation of relevant in situ total stress conditions during flow by selecting an appropriate centrifugal force. We demonstrate the utility of the technique for characterising the hydraulic properties of smectite-clay-dominated core samples. All core samples exhibited a non-Fickian tracer breakthrough (early tracer arrival), combined with a decrease in tracer concentration immediately after each period of <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow.</b> This is indicative of dual (or multi-) porosity behaviour, with solute migration predominately via advection during induced flow, and via molecular diffusion (between the preferential flow network(s) and the low hydraulic conductivity domain) during <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow.</b> Tracer breakthrough curves were simulated using a bespoke dual porosity model with excellent agreement between the data and model output (Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient was > 0. 97 for all samples).

40|$|International {{interest}} in fluidised bed combustion (F. B. C.) {{derives from the}} fact that it involves new technology and it is the only combustion system that can use low grade fuels (including those of high or variable ash content) efficiently. This thesis presents a study of the combustion of straw in a fully fluidised and systematically <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> test rig. In the <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> mode, it was found that during the period in the cycle when the bed was slumped, due to the reduction in primary air, a gasification process took place. This resulted in a higher percentage of volatiles being burned in the bed and preliminary results indicated that interruption gave an increase in overall efficiency of approximately 4 %. It also led to lower losses being incurred in the flue gases and, to a lesser extent, to a reduction in the losses expected due to incomplete combustion of the fuel. Elutriation and carbon losses were also reduced to 88 % and 86 % respectively of those recorded during uninterrupted fluidisation. By increasing the area of the zone directly above the fluidised bed, the products of combustion were decelerated sufficiently to ensure that ash was not found on the walls or roof to the same extent as that previously noticed on commercial straight-sided combustion chambers. Small quantities of ash were found in the ducting leading to the cyclone but they were approximately the same for operation in both the uninterrupted and interrupted fluidisation mode...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of mobile phone use while driving on traffic speed and headways, with {{particular}} focus on young drivers. For this purpose, a field survey {{was carried out in}} real road traffic conditions, in which drivers' speeds and headways were measured while using or not using a mobile phone. The survey took place within a University Campus area, allowing to distinguish between settings approximating to either free flow or <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow</b> conditions. Linear and loglinear regression methods were used to investigate {{the effects of}} mobile phone use and several other young driver characteristics, such as gender, driving experience and annual distance travelled, on vehicle speeds and headways. Separate models were developed for average free flow, <b>interrupted</b> <b>flow,</b> as well as for total average speed. Results show that mobile phone use leads to a statistically significant reduction in traffic speeds of young drivers in all types of traffic conditions. Furthermore, male and female drivers reduce their speed similarly when using a mobile phone while driving. However, male drivers using their mobile phone drive at lower speeds than female drivers not using their mobile phones. Sensitivity analysis revealed that, among all explanatory variables, the effect of mobile phone use on speed was most important. Accordingly, vehicle headways appear to increase for drivers using their mobile phone. However, this effect could not be statistically validated, due to the strong correlation between speed and headway. © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
