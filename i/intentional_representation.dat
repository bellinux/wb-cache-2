40|$|The {{concept of}} {{representation}} has {{a vast and}} highly diverse extension. In this paper I distinguish four kinds of representation, viz. proxy, make-believe, and <b>intentional</b> <b>representation,</b> as well as representation simpliciter. The bulk of the paper is devoted to <b>intentional</b> <b>representation.</b> I argue that the relation of <b>intentional</b> <b>representation</b> is non-reflexive, non-symmetrical, and non-transitive. I articulate a fundamental distinction between two aspects {{of the content of}} intentional representations, viz. subject and predicative content. Finally, I qualify and defend the distinction between iconic and symbolic <b>intentional</b> <b>representation.</b> Along the way, I also argue that psychological intentions play a constitutive role in representation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel neuro-dynamical model {{that accounts for}} pos-sible mechanisms of action imitation and learning. It is considered that imitation learning require at least two classes of generalization. One is gen-eralization over sensory-motor trajectory variances, and the other class is on cognitive level which concerns on more qualitative understanding of compo-sitional actions by own and others which do not necessarily depend on exact trajectories. This paper describes a possible model dealing with these classes of generalization with focusing {{on the problem of}} action compositionality. The model was evaluated in the experiments using a small humanoid robot. The robot was trained with a set of different actions concerning object manip-ulations which can be decomposed into sequences of action primitives. Then the robot was asked to imitate a novel compositional action demonstrated by human subject which are composed from prior-learned action primitives. The results showed that the novel action can be successfully imitated by decomposing and composing it with the primitives by means of organizing uni ed <b>intentional</b> <b>representation</b> hosted by mirror neurons even though the trajectory-level appearance is different between the ones of observed and those of self-generated. 1...|$|E

In order to study his strong presence and reality in sculpture represented by full figured abdominous women, shapes of his sculptures were compared between those made before and after becoming blind and also ones by another blind person by use of a numerical evaluation. The evaluated results showed that characteristic features of his sculptures made in sighted still persisted in those made after his loss of sight These characteristics are <b>intentional</b> <b>representation</b> by Zuniga. It is confirmed from the discussion that Zuniga had been pursuing a reality even after becoming blind, and had found out the reality in sculptures made by palpation.

40|$|International audienceThe UML Profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems {{promises}} a general modeling framework {{to design and}} analyze systems. Lots of works have been published on the modeling capabilities offered by MARTE, much less on available verification techniques. The Clock Constraint Specification Language (CCSL), first introduced as a companion language for MARTE, was devised to offer a formal support to conduct causal and temporal analysis on MARTE models. This work relies on a state-based semantics for CCSL to establish correctness properties on MARTE/CCSL specifications. We propose and compare two different techniques to build the state-space of a specification. One {{is an extension of}} some previous work and is based on extended finite state machines. It relies on integer linear programming to solve the constraints and reduce the state-space. The other one is based on an <b>intentional</b> <b>representation</b> and uses pure Boolean abstractions but offers no guarantee to terminate when the specification is not safe. The approach is illustrated on one simple example where the architecture plays an important role. We describe a process where the logical description of the application is progressively refined {{to take into account the}} execution platform through allocation...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of an "Ontology-based Information System" (OIS) is to provide an {{explicit}} description of the domain of interest, called ontology, and let all {{the functions of the}} system be based on such representation, thus freeing the users from the knowledge about the physical repositories where the real data reside. The functionalities that an OIS should provide to the user include both query answering, whose goal is to extract information from the system, and update, whose goal is to modify the information content of the system in order to reflect changes in the domain of interest. The "ontology" is a formal, high quality <b>intentional</b> <b>representation</b> of the domain, designed in such a way to avoid inconsistencies in the modeling of concepts and relationships. On the contrary, the extensional level of the system, constituted by a set of autonomous, heterogeneous data sources, is built independently from the conceptualization represented by the ontology, and therefore may contain information that is incoherent with the ontology itself. This dissertation presents a detailed study on the problem of dealing with inconsistencies in OISs, both in query answering, and in performing updates. We concentrate on the case where the knowledge base in the OISs is expressed in Description Logics, especially the logics of the DL-lite family. As for query answering, we propose both semantical frameworks that are inconsistency-tolerant, and techniques for answering unions of conjunctive queries posed to OISs under such inconsistency-tolerant semantics. As for updates, we present an approach to compute the result of updating a possibly inconsistent OIS with both insertion and deletion of extensional knowledge...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{outlined in}} this document explores an aesthetic philosophical problem – the making and reception of visual representations – via an interdisciplinary methodology based in material-­‐based studio art practice. The studio work {{took the form of}} a representative exercise in which a photograph’s pictorial space is extended outwards into a larger handmade picture that continues the image’s structural logic through new materials. Various material methods were tested and selected based on their effectiveness in continuing the picture beyond the boundaries of the photograph. This document questions the means by which an <b>intentional</b> visual <b>representation,</b> inherently requiring of the artist creative stylistic choices, is constructed and evaluated as successful. It was determined that plausibility in representation beyond the frame requires a certain adherence to the referent which is achieved through careful observation and reflection upon relationships between visual elements at every scale, as well as a delicate balancing of invention with repetition...|$|R
40|$|Memories are of {{the past}} but for the future, {{enabling}} individuals to implement intended plans and actions at the appropriate time. Prospective memory is the specific ability to remember and execute an intended behavior at some designated point in the future. Although sleep is well-known to benefit the consolidation of memories for past events, its role for prospective memory is still not well understood. Here, we show that sleep as compared to wakefulness after prospective memory instruction enhanced the successful execution of prospective memories two days later. We further show that sleep benefited both components of prospective memory, i. e. to remember that {{something has to be}} done (prospective component) and to remember what has to be done (retrospective component). Finally, sleep enhanced prospective remembering particularly when attentional resources were reduced during task execution, suggesting that subjects after sleep were able to recruit additional spontaneous-associative retrieval processes to remember intentions successfully. Our findings indicate that sleep supports the maintenance of prospective memory over time by strengthening <b>intentional</b> memory <b>representations,</b> thus favoring the spontaneous retrieval of the intended action at the appropriate time...|$|R
40|$|Beginning with {{hierarchical}} view {{of theories}} and models, I argue for an <b>intentional</b> conception of <b>representation</b> in science that requires bringing scientific agents and their intentions into the picture. So the formula is: Agents 1) intend; 2) to use model, M; 3) {{to represent a}} part of the world, W; 4) for some purpose, P. This conception legitimates using similarity as the basic relationship between models and the world. This whole approach is further supported by a brief exposition of some recent work in cognitive, or usage-based, linguistics. Finally, with all the above as background, I examine the recently much discussed idea that abstract scientific models should be thought of as fictional entities...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} Kant???s {{transcendental}} deduction in the Critique of Pure Reason is {{to prove that}} certain concepts not derived from experience (called categories) apply to and govern the objects of our experience. Kant seeks to dispel Hume???s skeptical assertion that concepts such as cause and substance fail to identify features of reality. His proof appeals to our cognitive abilities, and he argues that, if the application of these concepts to experience makes cognition of objects possible, then these concepts must apply to any object that we can cognize. However, there is extensive disagreement in the secondary literature {{on the nature of}} the ability named by the term ???cognition. ??? What is this capacity that the categories make possible? My dissertation provides an answer to this question. First, I argue that ???cognition??? refers to the phenomenon of intentionality. This means that the capacity for mental representations to refer to, or be about, objects is made possible by the application of the categories to experience. Second, I argue that cognition is the capacity to intend the full scope of objects in space and time ??? including the past, the future, and remote space. Many commentators focus only on Kant???s theory of perception, according to which rudimentary sensory information is synthesized into the perception of an object. Although the categories do play a role in synthesizing perceptions, I argue that more importantly they play a role in enabling the representation of objects that are not given in perception. On the reading I defend, the categories ground our ability to represent the wider spatio-temporal world. I term this ability ???global intentionality. ??? In the first part of the dissertation, I argue against epistemological interpretations of the nature of cognition. According to this reading, the categories make empirical knowledge possible. This reading situates Kant within a philosophical tradition that is concerned with knowing whether our representations are accurate or correct portrayals of the world, and commentators have sought to find in Kant???s project a refutation of empirical knowledge and external world skepticism. I argue that instead of ensuring correctness of representation, the application of the categories to experience is necessary for the more basic capacity for representations to be about the world in the first place. The first part concludes by showing that the scope of intentionality is global. I appeal to the Postulates, Antinomies, and Analogies, as well as the Deduction, to support this claim. In the second part of the dissertation, I develop Kant???s theory of global intentionality. I argue that he offers a rule-based analysis, according to which <b>intentional</b> <b>representations</b> are simply rules for encountering objects. Since on Kant???s view objects are spatio-temporal in nature, rules for encountering them take the form of instructions for repositioning oneself in space and time, such that, if obeyed, would put one in their perceptual vicinity. I claim that this view is in many respects similar to William James???s understanding of cognition. Kant???s position, however, raises a special problem for representation of the past, because it is not possible to formulate rules that would put one in the vicinity of a past object. I argue that Kant???s proof of the category of substance is designed to solve this problem...|$|R

40|$|Methodological {{questions}} concerning Chomsky’s generative approach to linguistics have been debated without consensus. The status of linguistics as psychology, the psychological reality of grammars, {{the character of}} tacit knowledge {{and the role of}} intuitions as data remain heatedly disputed today. I argue that the recalcitrance of these disputes is symptomatic of deep misunderstandings. I focus attention on Michael Devitt’s recent extended critique of Chomskyan linguistics and I suggest that his complaints are based on a failure to appreciate the special status of Chomsky’s computational formalisms found elsewhere in cognitive science. Devitt ascribes an <b>intentional</b> conception of <b>representations</b> that Chomsky repudiates and that is independently implausible. I argue that Devitt’s proposed “linguistic reality” as the proper subject matter of linguistics neglects the problems of tokens as opposed to types and he misses the force of Chomsky’s arguments against Behaviourism and nominalism. I suggest that Devitt’s case against intuitions as data misunderstands their standard role throughout perceptual psychology. Finally, of more general interest, I argue that Devitt’s position exemplifies compelling errors concerning mental representation seen throughout cognitive science and philosophy of mind...|$|R
40|$|Actions are goal-directed. It can be {{the goal}} of an action to change the {{environment}} (i. e. to produce an effect), but also to change one´s own situation in the environment (i. e. {{to move to a}} physical target). Previous research has shown that kinematics of actions directed towards physical targets are not only mere reactions to such targets. Instead, targets evoke <b>intentional</b> goals. <b>Representations</b> of such <b>intentional</b> goals influence action execution. However, thus far, most studies {{in the context of the}} ideomotor theory of action control have focused on the influence of anticipated action effects on action planning. The role of targets as action goals as well as the role of goal anticipations on overt action execution has mostly been neglected. In this dissertation the role of goal representations in action control was investigated. The ideomotor theory served as a theoretical framework. It was assumed that targets function as action goals similar to action effects and that action goals influence action execution by the anticipation of upcoming events. Action execution towards targets and towards effects was compared. This was done in the temporal and the spatial domain. Furthermore, goal representations were manipulated in order to evaluate their influence on action execution and to disentangle the role of physical target characteristics and the role of goal representations. The findings obtained strengthen the assumption that goal representations play an important role in action control. First, both targets and effects can be viewed as goals of an action in the temporal and spatial domain. Second, movement kinematics are shaped by the way targets are represented as action goals, rather than by physically target properties. In conclusion, as goal representations are formed before the action is actually executed they influence action execution by the anticipation of upcoming events. The ideomotor theory of action control should incorporate action targets as goals similar to action effects...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{argue that the}} work of the unorthodox Stoic Posidonius - as {{reported}} to us by Galen - can be seen as making an interesting contribution to contemporary debates about the nature of emotion. Richard Sorabji has already argued that Posidonius' contribution highlights the weaknesses in some well-known contemporary forms of cognitivism. Here I argue that Posidonius might be seen as advocating a theory of the emotions which sees them as being, in at least some cases, two-level intentional phenomena. One level involves judgments, just as the orthodox Stoic account does. But Posidonius thinks that emotions must also include an element sometimes translated as an "irrational tug". I suggest that we see the "irrational tug" as involving a second level of <b>intentional,</b> but non-conceptual <b>representation.</b> This view satisfies two desiderata: it is a viewwhich would have been available to Posidonius and which is compatible with the views reported to us; and it is a view which is independently attractive. It also makes Posidonius' position less far removed from that of orthodox Stoics than it might otherwise do, while remaining genuinely innovative...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{answering}} whether photographic representations exist or not. The answer is searched for in discussions of Roger Scruton {{and some of his}} critics. According to Scruton's argument presented in the essay entitled Photography and Representation a photograph cannot be a representation. Scruton claims that only such medium can become a representation that has a certain intentional relation to its subject, however a photograph is defined merely by its causal relation to such object. Scruton's critics believe that a photograph is a representation and criticize him for: i) underestimating the role a photographer's intentions play in a photograph; ii) disregarding a photograph's ability to provide a new way of seeing and thus becoming representational; iii) equivocating between the subject of a painting and the subject of a photograph. It is demonstrated that arguments of Scruton's critics are not able to show Scruton's concept of photography to be false. However, an alternative approach to representation provides a basis to demonstrate in what sense a photograph may be a representation. For that reason it is suggested to consider a photography as an essentially paradoxical medium merging into itself the intentional and causal.

60|$|We {{found the}} entire length of the third chasm three hundred and twenty yards. At the point a was an opening about six feet wide, and {{extending}} fifteen feet into the rock, where it terminated in a bed of marl, there being no other chasm beyond, as we had expected. We were about leaving this fissure, into which very little light was admitted, when Peters called my attention to a range of singular-looking indentures in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the cul-de-sac. With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left, or most northern of these indentures might have been taken for the <b>intentional,</b> although rude, <b>representation</b> of a human figure standing erect, with outstretched arm. The rest of them bore also some little resemblance to alphabetical characters, and Peters was willing, at all events, to adopt the idle opinion that they were really such. I convinced him of his error, finally, by directing his attention to the floor of the fissure, where, among the powder, we picked up, piece by piece, several large flakes of the marl, which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion from the surface where the indentures were found, and which had projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus proving them to have been the work of nature.|$|R
50|$|Although {{predictive}} and postdictive {{accounts of}} agency are often cast as competitors, they {{may in fact}} be reconcilable when attributions of self-agency are viewed within the framework of cognition under uncertainty. In particular, a comparator model based on efference copy {{can be seen as a}} more sophisticated way of characterizing Wegner’s consistency parameter and the computations that are likely to be a part of it. Basing outcome predictions on motor commands, rather than just higher-level representations of the goal state that an action is intended to bring about, is likely to provide finer-grained predictions with which to compare outcomes, thereby reducing uncertainty in agency attributions. This higher predictive resolution, in turn, could be useful in making exclusivity judgments (Wegner’s second condition): even if a particular goal state is brought about, if the way it is brought about does not closely match the motoric prediction, the attribution of agency may be reduced or blocked entirely. Similarly, given evidence (discussed above - see Haggard, Clark, & Kalogeras 2002) that whether or not an action is volitional affects <b>intentional</b> binding, motoric <b>representations</b> and predictions seem also to affect Wegner’s priority parameter. As such, predictive and postdictive accounts may simply differ in emphasis and in the level at which they describe the phenomenon (viz., attribution of agency), rather than being fundamentally incompatible.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally the {{intentionality}} {{of consciousness}} has been {{understood as the}} idea that many conscious states are about something, that they have objects in a broad sense - including states of affairs - which they represent, and it is on account of being representational that {{they are said to}} have contents. It has also been claimed, more controversially, that conscious intentional contents must be available to the subject as reasons for her judgments or actions, and that they are therefore necessarily conceptual. This paper challenges the assumptions (1) that all conscious <b>intentional</b> contents are <b>representations</b> of objects, and (2) that they are essentially conceptual. Both assumptions will be shown to be intimately connected. The first main part of the paper offers an account of conscious intentionality that is not prejudicial on the issue of whether all intentional contents of conscious mental states represent objects which the mental state can be said to be about. The author then shows that many personal-level perceptual contents, including those involved in our evaluative stance towards aspects of the world, have non-conceptual components even on a wide construal of the conceptual sphere (associated especially with the work of John McDowell), allowing for demonstrative concepts. In the second main part of the paper it is argued that experiences themselves, as contrasted with what they are experiences of, are non-conceptual contents. To this purpose the author reconstructs and develops some suggestive observations found in the phenomenology of Husserl to the effect that experiences as directly presented or 'lived through' are not objects of consciousness. It is argued that this thesis, properly understood, is true and that it entails that experiences as directly presented in consciousness are themselves non-conceptual intentional contents. Husserl's thesis is illuminating and important, allowing among other things a more satisfactory account of the elusive phenomenon of depth we normally attribute to the conscious self - {{the idea that there is}} always more to our experienced selves at any moment than what we are capable of articulating at the time...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that images have an ontological support by which they obtain an {{independent}} existence from the mind. In accordance with the new theories of aesthetics, we will see that the object of art is taken as an object of thought. Image has an important role in the existence of the work of art; therefore the image becomes an object of thought. To show how the image is independent from the mind or to show how it is not a mind-dependent object, the analysis has to start from the pre-ontological level of the work of art in order to understand the existence of images in correlation with the work of art. At the beginning there is only the object. The object is the work of art before its concretization. It is not nature; it is the natural support of art. From this point of view, the role of the image can be explored in all ontological stages of the work of art. Firstly, it can be argued that the intuition of the artist is the image of the idea underlying the work of art. The intentional image is a subjective image. Secondly, it seems that people can see or have in mind different images (representations) referring to a work of art. This is possible in time and space and implies cultural differences, historical events and so on. A question arises: what supports the intentional image? One answer put forward is that the mind is the support of the image, but it seems that the original intentional image has something that can make other intentional images possible, an infinite number of representations, in other words an infinite number of images. The aim of this paper is to show that we can talk about an original intentional image (the first idea), <b>intentional</b> images (the <b>representations</b> of the work of art in time and space), and the transcendental image which can be defined as the ontological condition for the existence of the intentional image. At the end I will argue that the transcendental image is the support or the entity which offers the ontological conditions necessary for all intentional images.
