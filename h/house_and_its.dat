5|$|Since 1965, George Harrison and his wife, Pattie Boyd, {{had lived}} in Kinfauns in Surrey, south of London. The house was a {{bungalow}} and too small to accommodate a home recording studio, so the couple began a year-long search for a larger property, concentrating on an area west of London encompassing the counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire. In January 1970, Harrison purchased the 120-room Friar Park, set on 33 acres of land, just west of Henley-on-Thames. Previously the home of an order of Roman Catholic nuns, the Salesians of Don Bosco, the four-storey <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>its</b> grounds were in a dilapidated state, {{and it was not}} until the start of March that the Harrisons moved from a worker's cottage and into the main residence.|$|E
