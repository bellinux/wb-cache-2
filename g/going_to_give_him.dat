25|$|After {{finding out}} that Lucifer's gone and that Castiel is back, they find a fatally injured Chuck. As a result of Chuck's injuries, the sun is now dying and the world along with it. Realizing that the only chance {{for the world to}} survive is to kill the Darkness along with Chuck, the Winchesters begin {{gathering}} ghosts to create a bomb to destroy the Darkness.

Making his way through the woods, Dean finds his resurrected mother.|$|E

The episode features former American President Theodore Roosevelt {{with the use of}} archival audio recordings. The use of Roosevelt's voice was first announced at the San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, on July 23, 2011. Showrunner Al Jean revealed to the press that [...] "we [...] have actual audio of Roosevelt (taken from a speech circa 1918) in the show. I thought, 'Finally! We can put a president in the show.' And a good one too. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a little credit at the end." ...|$|E

He told MacArthur that when Walker showed up he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a reprimand and send him back to Australia on leave for two weeks. [...] "Alright George," [...] MacArthur replied, [...] "but if he doesn't come back, I'm going to send his name in to Washington recommending him for a Congressional Medal of Honor." [...] All available aircraft were sent to search for Walker, preventing attacks on the Japanese convoy as it headed for Lae.

500|$|Khánh {{participated in}} the 1963 South Vietnamese coup that deposed Diệm, playing a minor role, {{although}} he {{claimed to be a}} key player. Khánh expected a large reward, but the junta instead sidelined him, excluding him from the twelve-man Military Revolutionary Council. In mid-December he was moved from the II Corps in the central highlands to the command of the I Corps based around Huế and Da Nang in the far north of the Republic of Vietnam. This, it was speculated, was to keep him far away from Saigon in an attempt to stop him from involving himself in politics. This was contrary to Khánh's request for a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, where most of the fighting was taking place. In an interview with journalist Robert Shaplen, Khánh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job. With respect to the 1963 coup that overthrew and killed Diệm, he cryptically commented [...] "It is too soon yet to tell the whole story, but someday I will tell it to you". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also reported that Khánh was motivated by a suspicion that Minh's junta knew he was untrustworthy and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an overseas government post to sideline him completely.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

"Oh yes, Tim's here," [...] Ralph said, laughing, [...] "but he {{ran across}} {{a couple of}} Irishmen {{belonging}} to the foreign legion and--as {{he would have been}} in our way, and we did not know where we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep--we <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> leave till to-morrow morning, when he is to meet us in front of the railway station." ...|$|R

500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E
2500|$|US President Theodore Roosevelt was an honored guest. Mark Twain and Henry H. Rogers {{also paid}} a visit, in the latter's yacht [...] "Kanawha". Twain's humorous talk was partly an {{introduction}} of Rear Admiral Purnell F. Harrington, former Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Said Twain, [...] "In my remarks of welcome of Admiral Harrington, I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> compliments. Compliments always embarrass a man. You {{do not know}} what to say. It does not inspire you with words. There is nothing you can say in answer to a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and they always embarrass me. I always feel they have not said enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|At about 5:30p.m. that night, Casolaro {{happened}} to meet Mike Looney who rented {{the room next}} to Casolaro's Room 517. They chatted on two occasions—first at about 5:30p.m. and then again at about 8:00p.m. Looney later explained, [...] " [...] said {{he was there to}} meet an important source who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> what he needed to solve the case." [...] According to Looney, Casolaro claimed that his source was scheduled to arrive by 9:00p.m. Around that time, Casolaro left Looney, explaining that he had to make a telephone call. He returned a few minutes later and said that his source might have [...] "blown him off." [...] Casolaro and Looney talked until about 9:30p.m. At about 10.00 p.m., Casolaro bought coffee at a nearby convenience store. That was the last time anyone reported seeing him alive.|$|E

2500|$|Once Kennedy won the nomination, Stevenson, {{always an}} {{enormously}} popular public speaker, campaigned actively for him. Due to his two presidential nominations and previous United Nations experience, Stevenson perceived himself an elder statesman {{and the natural}} choice for Secretary of State. However, according to historian Robert Dallek, [...] "neither Jack nor Bobby [...] thought all that well of Stevenson...they saw him as rather prissy and ineffective. [...] never met their standard of tough-mindedness." [...] Stevenson's refusal to publicly endorse Kennedy before the Democratic Convention was something that Kennedy [...] "couldn't forgive", with JFK telling a Stevenson supporter after the election, [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> anything." [...] The prestigious post of Secretary of State went instead to the (then) little-known Dean Rusk. However, [...] "although Jack and Bobby {{would have been just}} as happy to freeze Stevenson out of the administration, they felt compelled to offer him something" [...] due to his continued support from progressive Democrats. President Kennedy offered Stevenson the choice of becoming [...] "ambassador to Britain, attorney general (a post that eventually went to Robert Kennedy), or United States Ambassador to the United Nations." [...] Stevenson accepted the latter position.|$|E

Cyrus's good treatment of Amorges prompted the Saka {{to submit to the}} Persians. Amorges or Thambradas went with Cyrus to Lydia. The Amyrgians fought under Cyrus in the Battle of Thymbra of 547 BC. Sparethra’s forces later helped Cyrus conquer yet another opponent: Croesus, whom Cyrus ordered to be set on fire.
