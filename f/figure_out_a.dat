5|$|Each {{level is}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} challenges that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The game also features some elements of action-adventure games. Players often have to speak with NPCs and then <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> way to help them. It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie's energy bar by collecting extra honeycombs that are hidden throughout the levels. Banjo and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. Most of these moves are learned by finding Bottles, a friendly mole, inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items {{so that they can be}} performed. For instance, red feathers allow Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage. Some items also allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment. For instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight {{it would be to}} make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E

Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics before Graham returns home and retires permanently.|$|E

25|$|Augustus' final {{goal was}} to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> method to ensure an orderly succession, {{something}} necessary in any monarchial constitution and to avoid the resurgence of civil war. Augustus could not transfer his powers to a successor upon his death, as they were given to specifically to him for some fixed term or during his life. Thus, any successor would need to have his own authority and influence. In 6BC Augustus granted tribunician powers to his stepson Tiberius and recognised Tiberius as his heir. In AD13, a law was passed which made Tiberius' legal powers equivalent to and independent from those of Augustus.|$|E

25|$|The small air {{arm of the}} Argentine Navy (Armada Republica Argentina; ARA) was in {{the middle}} of the {{transition}} from the A-4Q Skyhawk to the new Super Etendard. Only five of the Etendard's anti-ship Exocet missiles had been delivered at the time of the conflict, at which point an arms embargo prevented the delivery of further shipments. Additionally, the required programming for the missiles to interact with the Etendard's computers had not been completed by French engineers when the conflict broke out. France, being an ally of the United Kingdom, recalled all technicians, which left Argentine scientists and electronic engineers to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> way to make the missiles take input from the plane's computers. Navy pilots, particularly those of the 3rd Naval Fighters Squadron flying A-4Qs were the only ones trained in bombing warships. Air Force pilots trained during April against the two Argentine Type 42 destroyers, similar to those of the British Fleet, and according to the Naval officers all the sorties were shot down, causing great concern to the High Command until the successful May 1 strikes which proved that aircraft could survive.|$|E

25|$|Augustus' final {{goal was}} to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> method to ensure an orderly succession. Under Augustus' constitution, the Senate and the People of Rome held the supreme power, {{and all of his}} special powers were granted for either a fixed term, or for life. Therefore, Augustus could not {{transfer}} his powers to a successor upon his death. Any successor needed to have powers that were independent of Augustus' own powers. During his illness in 23 BC, he had chosen Agrippa to be his successor. He had considered the possibility of making his nephew Marcellus his successor, but had ultimately decided that Marcellus was too young. In 21 BC Marcellus died and Augustus married Agrippa to his daughter Julia, and in 18 BC Augustus enacted a law that granted Agrippa tribunician powers for a period of five years. Agrippa and Julia had two sons, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, and Augustus designated them as possible heirs by granting upon both tribunician powers. In 12 BC Agrippa died, and in 6 BC Augustus granted these tribunician powers to his stepson Tiberius. Gaius and Lucius Caesar soon died, and Augustus realized that {{he had no choice but}} to recognize Tiberius as his heir. In 13 AD, the point was settled beyond question. A law was passed (the lex consularis) which linked Augustus' powers over the provinces to those of Tiberius, so that now Tiberius' legal powers were equivalent to, and independent from, those of Augustus. Within a year, Augustus was dead.|$|E
