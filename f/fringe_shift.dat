25|$|Using {{a special}} optical {{arrangement}} involving a 1/20 wave step in one mirror, Roy J. Kennedy (1926) and K.K. Illingworth (1927) (Fig.8) converted {{the task of}} detecting fringe shifts from the relatively insensitive one of estimating their lateral displacements to the considerably more sensitive task of adjusting the light intensity {{on both sides of}} a sharp boundary for equal luminance. If they observed unequal illumination {{on either side of the}} step, such as in Fig.8e, they would add or remove calibrated weights from the interferometer until both sides of the step were once again evenly illuminated, as in Fig.8d. The number of weights added or removed provided a measure of the <b>fringe</b> <b>shift.</b> Different observers could detect changes as little as 1/300 to 1/1500 of a fringe. Kennedy also carried out an experiment at Mount Wilson, finding only about 1/10 the drift measured by Miller and no seasonal effects.|$|E
25|$|The device he designed, later {{known as}} a Michelson interferometer, sent yellow light from a sodium flame (for alignment), or white light (for the actual observations), through a half-silvered mirror {{that was used to}} split it into two beams {{traveling}} at right angles to one another. After leaving the splitter, the beams traveled out to the ends of long arms where they were reflected back into the middle by small mirrors. They then recombined {{on the far side of}} the splitter in an eyepiece, producing a pattern of constructive and destructive interference whose transverse displacement would depend on the relative time it takes light to transit the longitudinal vs. the transverse arms. If the Earth is traveling through an aether medium, a beam reflecting back and forth parallel to the flow of aether would take longer than a beam reflecting perpendicular to the aether because the time gained from traveling downwind is less than that lost traveling upwind. Michelson expected that the Earth's motion would produce a <b>fringe</b> <b>shift</b> equal to 0.04 fringes—that is, of the separation between areas of the same intensity. He did not observe the expected shift; the greatest average deviation that he measured (in the northwest direction) was only 0.018 fringes; most of his measurements were much less. His conclusion was that Fresnel's hypothesis of a stationary aether with partial aether dragging would have to be rejected, and thus he confirmed Stokes' hypothesis of complete aether dragging.|$|E

An aeroassist flight experiment model flown in a mixture of 50 percent air - 50 percent argon and a blunt slender cone flown in air were flown at Mach 14. 5 into freestream static pressures of 0. 04 and 0. 08 atm, respectively. The method of analysis can be separated into two main divisions. The first step is to identify fringes inside the wake in terms of the fringes in the freestream. This is important because refraction effects have obscured the region near the shock such that fringes cannot be followed into the wake region. The second step is to extrapolate the freestream fringes into the wake to determine the location of disturbance-related <b>fringe</b> <b>shifts.</b> Coupled with assumptions about the shape of the wake region, the locations of the disturbance-related <b>fringe</b> <b>shifts</b> can be related to the integrated density...|$|R

The working process of the new type of laser interferometer is: there are two identical tiny holes (to irradiate light) on the plating film layer of the partially reflective mirror of laser device, the resonant cavity of laser device only can outwardly irradiate the laser beam from the positions of these two tiny irradiation holes; two reflective mirrors are used to make two one-way laser beams (which are irradiated from the laser device) directly intersecting perpendicularly; then a half-transparent-half-reflective mirror is used to enable two laser beams propagating towards the direction of a screen, and to produce {{the interference}} fringes on the screen.

50|$|Sagnac and Michelson-Gale have {{measured}} fringe shifts by interfering two light beams, one {{of which}} traverses a clockwise path, the other of which traverses the same path in a counterclockwise manner.

50|$|The <b>fringe</b> <b>shift</b> in a Sagnac {{interferometer}} due to rotation has {{a magnitude}} {{proportional to the}} enclosed area of the light path, and this area must be specified {{in relation to the}} axis of rotation.

The result is an interferometer that exhibits the stability of the Sagnac topology while being insensitive to rotation.|$|E

40|$|Historically, the Michelson-Morley {{experiment}} {{has played}} a crucial role for abandoning the idea of a preferred reference frame, the ether, and for replacing Lorentzian Relativity with Einstein’s Special Relativity. However, our re-analysis of the Michelson-Morley original data, consistently with the point of view already expressed by other authors, shows that the experimental observations have been misinterpreted. Namely, the <b>fringe</b> <b>shifts</b> point to a non-zero observable Earth’s velocity vobs = 8. 4 ± 0. 5 km/s.

Interferometric data describing the flow in the test section are obtained using a long coherence length cw argon laser in a holographic system and a rotating drum camera recorder. The object beam, which passes through the test section, intersects the reference beam at a small angle (5 degrees) to form an interference pattern of about 170 lines per millimeter, and is recorded as a hologram. Before a test, this hologram is placed in its original position and rotated slightly so that an interference pattern is generated by {{the intersection of the}} reconstructed and real-time object beams. This interference pattern is adjusted to a series of bright, horizontal fringes having a spatial frequency of about 5 fringes per centimeter. During the few milliseconds it takes the test gas to pass through the test section, variations in the gas density across the 8. 4 -centimeter test section produce phase variations in the object beam and result in a varying interference pattern.
