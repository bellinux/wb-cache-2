25|$|GIULIANI: That's {{really an}} {{extraordinary}} statement. That's an extraordinary statement, {{as someone who}} lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "The Sensual World" [...] {{has been}} renamed [...] "Flower of the Mountain" [...] and {{contains}} a passage of Molly Bloom's famous soliloquy from James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Bush said, [...] "Originally when I wrote the song 'The Sensual World', I had used text {{from the end}} of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> for permission again and this time they said yes." ...|$|E

500|$|The Peregrine, by J. A. Baker, {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the best nature books in English written in the twentieth century. Admirers of the book include Robert Macfarlane, Mark Cocker, who regards the book as [...] "one of the most outstanding books on nature in the twentieth century" [...] and Werner Herzog, who called it [...] "the one book <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> you to read if you want to make films," [...] and said elsewhere [...] "... it has prose of the calibre that we have not seen since Joseph Conrad." [...] In the book, Baker recounts, in diary form, his detailed observations of peregrines (and their interaction with other birds) near his home in Chelmsford, Essex, over a single winter from October to April.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{really had}} {{no option but to}} agree to do it, despite my {{reservations}} about working in television. Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I always heard 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. All I had to do was look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E
