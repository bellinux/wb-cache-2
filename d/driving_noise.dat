50|$|Kléber-Colombes, {{a company}} specialising in {{elastomers}} and expansion joints, {{was established in}} 1910. Nearly 50 years later, in 1956, the automotive supplier Woco Industrietechnik GmbH (http://www.wocogroup.com) went into operation. In 1980, Woco entered the antivibration sector. Its work soon resulted in the first automotive parts that used a rubber-metal combination that could reduce vibration and <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> in cars. The basis of these parts was innovations {{in the area of}} natural-rubber, plastic and metal adhesion technology. Michelin acquired the Kléber Group in 1982, established CMP Kléber Industry and also worked in the area of rubber processing for vehicles. At the turn of the millennium, the knowledge acquired in this work flowed into a Joint Venture set up by Woco and Michelin. Under the name Woco Michelin AVS, the company made its products at its base in Bad Soden-Salmünster and locations around the world. In 2007, Olaf Hahn joined with the financial investor Arques Industries AG (Geschichte der Arques Industries) to acquire the joint venture and gave the company the name that it uses today, Anvis Group GmbH. Olaf Hahn became managing director, a position that he still holds today. With the complete takeover by the Japanese Sumitomo Riko Company Limited, a strategic investor from the relevant industry acquired the company in 2013.|$|E

The interference of other factors like varying speech spectra and temporal fluctuations of the <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> was minimized as far as possible. A very strong relationship of speech-to-noise ratio and the subjective speech quality was found. Consequentially, the speech signal level, due to the {{influence of}} different interior room acoustics, seems to play a more important role than the varied speech timbre or other parameters.

40|$|A {{pleasant}} interior {{sound field}} {{is an essential}} comfort criterion for vehicle occupants. The pleasantness is mainly influenced by a low overall sound pressure level. Further minimization of <b>driving</b> <b>noise,</b> however, is constricted on the lower end by physical limitations. Moreover, <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> conveys information about the current driving condition, the vehicle state and environmental aspects. Auditory feedback is therefore indispensable for a certain vehicle/driver interaction. The perception of vehicle noise is further dependent on contextual aspects. The experience and the expectation of vehicle occupants regarding the car and its acoustical characteristics in particular driving conditions are determining for an appreciation of these characteristics. The present thesis deals with various aspects of subjectively perceived acoustical comfort in vehicles. First of all, physical and notably acoustical parameters of in-vehicle <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> are taken into account, particularly as regards the composition of <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> based on the main noise contributors powertrain, wind and tires. In addition to the assessment of <b>driving</b> <b>noise,</b> room-acoustical properties of vehicle compartments are included in order to quantify the impact of room acoustics on communication between the vehicle occupants. On the other hand, contextual aspects such as the transfer of information via acoustical events are considered. The outcome of this work may be utilized by researchers and developers of vehicle sound fields for an improvement of customer-relevant acoustical target setting. Additionally, it outlines some basic concepts how to create pleasant in-vehicle sound fields based on sound quality approaches and speech communication aspects...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} {{a framework for}} doing statistical inference for discretely observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs) where the <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> has 'memory'. Classical SDE models for inference assume the <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> to be Brownian motion, or "white noise", thus implying a Markov assumption. We focus on the case when the <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> is a fractional Brownian motion, which is a common continuous-time modeling device for capturing long-range memory. Since the likelihood is intractable, we proceed via data augmentation, adapting a familiar discretization and missing data approach developed for the white noise case. In addition to the other SDE parameters, we take the Hurst index to be unknown and estimate it from the data. Posterior sampling is performed via a Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm on both the parameters and the missing data simultaneously so as to improve mixing. We point out that, due to the long-range correlations of the <b>driving</b> <b>noise,</b> careful discretization of the underlying SDE is necessary for valid inference. Our approach {{can be adapted to}} other types of rough-path driving processes such as Gaussian "colored" noise. The methodology is used to estimate the evolution of the memory parameter in US short-term interest rates. Comment: 31 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the influences of}} room acoustics and <b>driving</b> <b>noises</b> in vehicle interiors on the subjectively perceived acoustical quality of conversations between passengers. A listening test with 25 participants was performed inside a laboratory {{to assess the impact}} of different vehicle interior transfer functions on the speech quality assessment in four predetermined dimensions. Idealized <b>driving</b> <b>noises</b> at three different vehicle speeds were presented simultaneously with speech samples to quantify the interferences of these noise conditions with varied signal-to-noise ratios. To minimize the influence of different human speakers, four talkers (two male and two female) were selected from commercially available audio books. The respective speech samples were adjusted in level and long-term average speech spectrum to the common values of conversational speech. The automatic reflex of raising one’s voice in noisy environments, called “Lombard Effect” [1], was taken into account for an additional adjustment of speech levels while <b>driving</b> <b>noises</b> were present. A strong relationship between the speech-to-noise ratio and the test participants’ evaluations was found. Thus, one can assume that the speech signals’ attenuation or amplification caused by the different room acoustics of the tested vehicles play a more important role for a sufficient speech quality than the varied speech timbre or other parameters. Only at very high speech-to-noise ratios (≥ 20 dB with A-weighting), room-acoustical parameters such as IACC or the reverberation time are more determining for the speech quality appreciation than the speech’s sound pressure level...|$|R

Thereby, realistic conditions of a specific experimental environment including optical intra-cavity loss and strong classical <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> can be modeled for any KNLC. We show that even in the presence of optical loss and <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> considerable squeezing levels can be achieved. We find that the achievable squeezing levels are not limited by the <b>driving</b> <b>noise</b> but solely by the amount of optical loss. Amplitude quadrature squeezing of the reflected mean field is obtained if the KNLC's operating point is chosen properly. Consistently, a KNLC can provide a passive, purely optical reduction of laser power noise as experimentally demonstrated in [1].

The automatic reﬂex of raising one’s voice in noisy environments, known as the Lombard Eﬀect [1], is quantiﬁed both in the sound pressure level and in the long-term spectral distribution of read speech. For this purpose, a laboratory experiment with 30 participants was performed.

The eﬀects of these diﬀerent noises on the speech’s sound pressure level and spectral distribution were quantiﬁed. In conclusion, there is no signiﬁcant impact of the noise shape on the spectral content of the respective speech, while the noise-aﬀected speech is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to speech under the quiet condition.
