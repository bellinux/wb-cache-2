This work focuses on stress effects in n-type FinFETs with gate-first or gate-last stacks, and relies mainly on TCAD results.

Larger louver angles with a constant ratio of <b>fin</b> <b>pitch</b> to louver pitch resulted in higher average flow angles and shorter development lengths. As the Reynolds number increased, longer development lengths were required and higher average flow angles occurred as compared with a lower Reynolds number case.

Further rotation (from approximately 90 ˚ to approximately 180 ˚) adds the second component (component B) : a unilateral expansion of the chromatophores on the upper half of the ventral surface of the mantle, funnel, head and arms.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the mathematical modeling {{and analysis of}} helicopters towing submerged loads using long cables for sub-surface object detection when surface-based vessels cannot operate safely. A geometrically exact model of rotating beams is derived, and used to represent both the cable dynamics and rotor blade dynamics. Flight dynamics and trim conditions for an axially flexible straight cable and a curved cable are separately formulated for a general case of helical climbing turns, and used to cross-validate each other. In steady flight, the trim longitudinal dynamics of the submerged load produces down-forces from towed body fins, increasing the apparent weight of the tow system. Cable and towed body drag manifest as increases in the effective equivalent flat- plate area, necessitating excessive nose-down helicopter trim pitch attitudes (- 6 &# 9702;) and causing pilot discomfort. Excessive pitch attitudes can be avoided using aft offset of the helicopter tow point, or the deployment of longer cables in combination with <b>pitching</b> <b>fins</b> to regulate towed body depth. In steady level turning flight, cable and towed body drag result in the submerged load turning with a consistently smaller radius than the helicopter. Depth regulation in turning flight using <b>pitching</b> <b>fins</b> is less effective than in forward flight due to increased cable drag opposing larger down-forces. Analysis of linearized models showed that the helicopter frequency response to pilot inputs is unaffected {{by the addition of}} the cable and towed body above 1 rad/s. The low-frequency response magnitude reduces with increasing hydrodynamic drag on the cable and towed body, and is unaffected by cable structural properties due to over-damped stabilization from hydrodynamics. The swashplate inputs required to guide the towed body along a "tear-drop" shaped trajectory are obtained using a two-stage process. The motions of the tow point that guide the submerged load along the target path are obtained using an optimization process. The system target states are generated based on these tow point motions, and an LQR controller is used to guide the helicopter along its target path. Trim rotor inflows from the vortex wake model are obtained at the various equilibrium points used to construct helicopter target states, interpolated and applied as "delta" corrections to the dynamic inflow model.

Using these general guidelines, a new prototype evaporator was designed, keeping in mind the current packaging restrictions, tube and fin availabilities, and is an optimum coil for the given external load conditions. Further, the validated model was used to arrive at prototype coils with some of the current tube and fin spacing restrictions removed...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis of three-dimensional flow structures in a nominally two-dimensional fin geometry is presented. A sinusoidal louvred fin is considered. The heat transfer enhancement {{is achieved by}} combining boundary layer interruptions and vortical structures induced by the corrugation of the base fin. The <b>fin</b> shape and <b>pitch,</b> as well as flow conditions, are representative of typical automotive application. A wide ranging values of Reynolds number are investigated, spanning the steady laminar regime, the unsteady periodic laminar flow, and the chaotic transitional flow. Two- and three-dimensional numerical solutions are compared, looking for the onset of three-dimensional instabilities. At low values of the Reynolds number, up to the steady-unsteady flow transition, the flow is two-dimensional. As soon as unsteady oscillation appears, the simulation results show three-dimensional flow structures, even in a nominally two-dimensional geometry. The typical longitudinal vortex size is evaluated. In the periodic unsteady regime, fully three-dimensional computations yield time-averaged Nusselt number and friction factor significantly higher than those predicted by two-dimensional models. Furthermore, these flow structures induce an early transition from the periodic regime to the chaotic regime. In the chaotic regime, however, the heat transfer enhancement due to the three-dimensional flow structures is much lower...|$|R
50|$|Two X-31s were built, {{with the}} first flying on October 11, 1990. Over 500 test flights were carried out between 1990 and 1995. The X-31 is a canard delta, a delta wing {{aircraft}} which uses canard foreplanes for primary pitch control, with secondary thrust-vectoring control. The canard delta had earlier been used on the Saab Viggen strike fighter, and has since become common on fighters such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale and Gripen which were all designed and flew several years before the X-31. The X-31 featured a cranked-delta wing (similar to the Saab J35 Draken and the F-16XL prototype), and fixed strakes along the aft fuselage, {{as well as a}} pair of movable computer-controlled canards to increase stability and maneuverability. There are no moveable horizontal tail surfaces, only the vertical <b>fin</b> with rudder. <b>Pitch</b> and yaw are controlled by the canard with the aid of the three paddles directing the exhaust (thrust vectoring). Eventually, simulation tests on one of the X-31s showed that flight would have been stable had the plane been designed without the vertical fin, because the thrust-vectoring nozzle provided sufficient yaw and pitch control.|$|R
