40|$|Human {{myeloid leukemia}} HL- 60 cells were grown either in {{suspension}} culture or in nude mice. The {{two types of}} myeloperoxidase, the small and the large type, in crude extracts of these cells were analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifuga-tion. The proportions of the small and the large myeloperoxidase varied mark-edly depending on the growth conditions of cells. In cells in culture, the small myeloperoxidase amounted to 80 % of the total myeloperoxidase, whereas in the solid tumors it amounted to only about 30 % of the total.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to describe the serological prevalence of maedi-visna in a sample of Ontario sheep flocks, and to identify management and demographic variables that were associated with seroprevalence for maedi-visna. A sample of 103 sheep flocks in Ontario was randomly selected from those flocks participating in the Red Meat Plan. The owners of these flocks were surveyed regarding management procedures on their farms, and blood samples were taken from a random sample of ewes in each flock. At least one ewe tested serologically positive, based on the agar gel <b>immuno-diffusion</b> <b>test,</b> in 69. 9 % of the farms. Positive serological reactions occurred in 20. 9 % of the 3880 sheep tested. Flock demographics and farm management variables were considered in a multiple regression model, and several factors were positively associated with higher maedi-visna seroprevalence rates.

40|$|SYNOPSIS The gastric {{juice of}} a patient showing {{symptoms}} of staphylococcal food poisoning was examined by a radioimmunoassay {{for the presence of}} enterotoxins. Assays gave markedly higher results at 350 than at 5 °. The source for this discrepancy was attributed to interference due to trypsin activity on the basis of (1) the demonstration of hydrolysis of p-toluenesulfonyl-L-arginine methyl ester by the specimen, (2) inhibition of this activity by trypsin inhibitor from lima bean, and (3) lowered values produced for enterotoxins in gastric juice when the inhibitor was included in the assay system. In episodes of staphylococcal food poisoning, where the suspected food is not available for analysis, tests for the presence of staphylococcal enterotoxin in gastric juice of patients may serve as a useful alter-native. Rapid radioimmunoassays have been de-scribed for detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin types A, B, and C (Johnson et al., 1971; Collins et al, 1972; Collins et al, 1973; Dickie et al, 1973). How-ever, our previous efforts to measure staphylococcal enterotoxin in stomach aspirate by radioimmuno-assay (RIA) were unsuccessful since positive results were not corroborated by the microslide <b>immuno-diffusion</b> <b>test</b> (Casman et al, 1969). These attempts were expanded in the present study. Material and methods STAPHYLOCOCCAL ENTEROTOXINS Purified enterotoxin A and rabbit antiserum were prepared in this laboratory (Robern et al, 1975).

40|$|Haemophilus parasuis is {{classified}} mainly through serotyping, but traditional serotyping always yields non-typable (NT) strains and unreliable results via cross-reactions. Here, we surveyed the serotype prevalence of Chinese H. parasuis isolates using traditional serotyping (gel <b>immuno-diffusion</b> <b>test,</b> GID) and molecular serotyping (multiplex PCR, mPCR). We also investigated why discrepant results between these methods were obtained, and investigated mPCR failure through whole-genome sequencing. Of the 100 isolate tested, 73 (73 %) and 93 (93 %) were serotyped by the GID test and mPCR, respectively, with a concordance rate of 66 % (66 / 100). Additionally, mPCR {{reduced the number}} of NT isolates from 27 (27 %) for the GID testing, to seven (7 %). Eleven isolates were sequenced, including nine serotype-discrepant isolates from mPCR and GID typing (excluding strains that were NT by GID only) and two NT isolates from both methods, and their in silico serotypes were obtained from genome sequencing based on their capsule loci. The mPCR results were supported by the in silico serotyping of the seven serotype-discrepant isolates. The discrepant results and NT isolates determined by mPCR were attributed to deletions and unknown sequences in the serotype-specific region of each capsule locus. Compared with previous investigations, this study found a similar predominant serotype profile, but a different prevalence frequency for H. parasuis, and the five most prevalent serotypes or strain groups were serotypes 5, 4, NT, 7 and 13 for mPCR, and serotypes 5, NT, 4, 7 and 13 / 10 / 14 for GID.

To {{get the full}} text please contact the other at abumalaz 2002 @gmail. comSheeppox (SP) {{is known to be}} enzootic in the eastern states of Sudan. The present study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of this health problem in Kassala State during the period. To determine the prevalence of SP in this area of Sudan, both participatory epidemiological approaches and serological survey among sheep populations in the various localities of the state were employed. Questionnaire survey among sheep herders and veterinary records consultations in the state were carried out. Serologically, Agar Gel <b>Immuno-diffusion</b> <b>Test</b> (AGIDT) was used to detect antibody (Ab) levels in sera of non-vaccinated sheep. The questionnaire survey outcome showed that most of sheep owners have a good knowledge about SP as an enzootic disease in the state, with 80 % of the owners confirming the presence of the disease in their sheep herds. Fifteen outbreaks of SP were reported in the state for the last five years. Out of the 502 serum samples tested, 63. 55 % were positive for Abs against SP virus (SPV). High prevalence was recorded from Algash locality (69. 57 %, n= 115), followed by Kassala locality (66. 89 %, n= 151), Nahr Atbara locality (63. 79 %, n= 116) and Setiet locality (53. 33 %, n= 120). Risk factors analysis with respect to age groups and sex of sampled animals showed no statistical significance between disease prevalence and age or sex (χ²= 2. 3751, P-value= 0. 498 and χ²= 0. 2039, P-value= 0. 652, respectively. However, the high prevalence was observed in female animals (64. 05 %, n= 253) and the age group of less than one- year- old (65. 63 %, n= 233). In conclusion, our findings elucidated the prevalence of the disease in that endemic area, using participatory epidemiological approaches. It is recommended that strategic control programs should be designed and applied to address the health problem imposed by sheeppox among the sheep population in the Eastern states of Sudan...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{isolation}} and identification of bacteria associated with bovine mastitis and detection of their specific antibodies in milk and sera. A total of 50 samples of milk and sera was collected from cows with clinical and subclinical mastitis in two different farms in Khartoum State (Alsalama, Khartoum and Shambat, Khartoum North). The samples were collected between December 2009 and June 2010. The bacteria were isolated from 38 (76 %) of the milk samples, and the total number of isolates was 45 with 3 yeasts. Sixteen (36 %) bacterial isolates were obtained from cows with clinical mastitis, whereas 29 (64 %) bacterial isolates were obtained from cows with sub-clinical mastitis. Mixed infection was detected in 10 (20 %) of the milk samples. Both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria were isolatedand identified to the species level, using cultural characteristics and biochemical tests. Most isolates (27) were Staphylococcus species all of them were coagulase positive (10 were Staph. aureus, 9 Staph. hyicusand 8 Staph. intermedius), other gram positive bacteria isolates were one isoloates of Streptococcus agalactiae, two of Enterococcus species (one was avium, two mundtiiand one was faecium), Listeria Ivanoviiwere two, Bacillus species three (two Bacillus licheniformisand one B. mycoides), and three strains of Corynebactrium psedotuberculosis. The gram negative bacterial isolates were three Enterobacteriaspecies (two Citrobacter freundiand one Klebsiella pneumoniae). And Pseudomonas aeruginosaconsistedof two strains. Agar double diffusion test was performed to detect antibodies specific to the causative agents of mastitis in milkimmunoglobulin fraction and serum collected from each cow against the whole-cell lysate (WCL) of the isolates. Only Bacillus mycoidesgave clear precipitation lines with both milk immunoglobulin fraction and serum. Other bacteria gave precipitation lines with serum antibodies alone. The resultsrevealed that the Gram positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcusspecies, were the common causative agent of bovine mastitis; the number ofcows with subclinical mastitis was higher than cows with clinical mastitis.

40|$|Fueron estudiadas en forma comparativa 6 cepas de P. brasiliensis con el propósito de determinar su patogenicidad para la rata y su antigenicidad. Las mismas fueron aisladas de : 1) biopsia de cuello uterino en 1989 (U), 2) biopsia de mucosa bucal en 1988 (V), 3) aspiración ósea en 1991 (63265), 4) testículo de cobayo 1984 (C 24), 5) punción-aspiración ganglionaren 1986 (G) y 6) cepa proveniente de la Escola Paulista de Medicina (339). Se prepararon antigenos citoplasmáticos liofilizados de cada una de ellas, en la concentración final de 100 mg/ml y se realizaron pruebas de inmunodifusión frente a 6 sueros patrones positivos de ratas. En este ensayo todos los antígenos presentaron dos ó tres bandas de precipitación. Para estudiar el poder patógeno se inocularon, en total, 120 ratas Wistar, de ambos sexos de 200 g de peso, por via intracardíaca con suspensiones de la fase levaduriforme del P. brasiliensis, en concentraciones de 3 x 10 (7) y 5 x 10 (7) células/ml de cada cepa. Los animales que no murieron espontáneamente fueron sacrificados a los 14, 28, 42, 56 y 70 dias post-infección y se evaluaron los siguientes parámetros: A) exámenes macro y microscópicos de pulmones, hígado, bazo y riñones; B) cultivos de un pulmón y C) prueba de inmunodifusión con antígeno homólogo. Se consideró además, el porcentaje de muertes espontáneas por cada cepa. Los resultados de estos estudios fueron los siguientes:No se observó relación entre la patogenicidad y la antigenicidad. La cepa más virulenta correspondió a un aislamiento reciente a partir de una forma juvenil grave y la más antigénica fue una cepa, morfológicamente atípica, que no provocó lesiones macroscópicas ni microscópicas en los órganos de las ratas. A {{comparative}} study of antigenicity and patho-genicity for rats of six Paracoccidioides brasiliensis strains was carried out. The antigenic capacity "in vitro" of cytoplasmic extract from each strain was determined by <b>immuno-diffusion</b> <b>test</b> against 6 serum samples obtained from rats experimentally infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, that had presented positive reactions with a metabolic control antigen. The cytoplasmic extracts were used at final concentration of 100 mg/ml. All of them showed 2 or 3 precipitation bands in this assay. One hundred twenty Wistar rats both sexes weighing approximately 200 g, were inoculated intracardiacally with suspensions of the yeast phase of different P. brasiliensis strains. Two concentrations containing 3 x 10 (7) and 5 x 10 (7) cells/ml of each isolate were prepared. The inoculated animals were divided in two groups, one was left to its spontaneous outcome and the percentages of deaths were registered and the other rats were sacrificed at 14, 28, 56 and 70 days post-infection. The following parameters were taken into account for evaluation: A) presence of macroscopic granulomas in lung, liver, spleen and kidney; B) presence of P. brasiliensis in microscopic exams of the same organs, in wet preparations and in hystologic sections stained by H&E; C) culture of lung and D) immunodiffusion test using pre-mortem serum samples and the homologous antigen. The correlation between the most important parameters studied in each strain are summarized as follow:As {{no significant differences between}} the two inocula employed for each strain was observed, the before-mention results are the average of those obtained with each inoculation doses. The most virulent strain was a recent isolate from an acute disseminated form of the juvenil type. A morphological atypic isolate, which produced a very mild experimental infection with viable P. brasiliensis determined 100 % of positive immunodifussion tests. The strain 339 did not produce infection in the rats, and the animals inoculated did not presented antibodies. Nevertheless this strain is useful to prepare antigens for Serologic reactions. No correlation between antigenicity or pathogenicity and the time during which these strains were mantained "in vitro" could be established...|$|E

Serum samples were collected from 233 goats and 119 sheep, belonging to twelve different owners from November 2014 to June 2015. Diagnosis of Leptospira spp. infection was established using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT); for B. ovis infection, the agar gel <b>immuno-diffusion</b> (AGID) <b>test</b> was conducted. A total of 16 / 233 (6. 87 %; 95 % CI = 4. 27 % – 10. 83 %) goats and 16 / 119 (13. 45 %; 95 % CI = 8. 67 % – 21. 24 %) sheep were identified as seropositive for Leptospira spp. The most frequent serotype was Icterohaemorrhagiae. In goats, intensive management system (odds ratio = 15. 8; p < 0. 001) and consorted rearing of equines and goats (odds ratio = 7. 3; p = 0. 005) were identified as risk factors.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the situation of sheeppox (SP) in Kassala State, Sudan. Three methods were adopted to achieve the fore-mentioned goal. These methods were questionnaire survey, collection of available data from veterinary services records and detection of antibodies against sheeppox virus (SPV) in the serum samples collected from different localities of the state using agar gel <b>immuno-diffusion</b> (AGID) <b>test.</b> The questionnaire survey outcomes showed that most of the sheep owners have a good knowledge about SP as an epizootic disease in the state. Moreover, 80 % of the owners confirmed the presence of the disease in their sheep flocks. Thus, the disease represents a real problem for the sheep owners in the state. From the previously reported outbreaks of SP, which obtained from the veterinary services records, the control of the disease can be achieved easily by means of vaccination which is possible in the state. In addition, the good infrastructure of the veterinary services in Kassala state may help and push the control program of the disease towards sunlight. Out of the 502 serum samples, collected from both sexes of sheep, four age groups (1 - 12, 13 - 24, 25 - 36, 37 - 48 months) and two production system settled and nomad, were tested using AGID test, 319 (63. 55 %) of them were positive by the test, whereas 183 (36. 45 %) were negative. High prevalence of antibodies against SPV was in samples from Algash locality (69. 57 %, n= 115) followed by Kassala locality (66. 89 %, n= 151), Nahr Atbara locality (63. 79 %, n= 116) and Setiet locality (53. 33 %, n= 120). Results of risk factors analysis with respect to age groups and sex of sampled animals revealed no statistical significance between disease prevalence and age and sex (χ²= 2. 3751, P-value= 0. 498) and (χ²= 0. 2039, P-value= 0. 652), respectively. However, the highest level of the prevalence was observed in females (64. 05 %, n= 253) and the age less than one year (65. 63 %, n= 233).
