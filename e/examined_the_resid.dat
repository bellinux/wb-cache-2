40|$|The role of <b>the</b> <b>resid</b> in coprocessing coal with {{petroleum}} resid {{has been}} investigated using model systems. The primary question being investigated is whether resid is participating in reactions with coal or if <b>the</b> <b>resid</b> is acting simply as a diluent. Since hydrogen transfer is an important mechanism by which solvent interacts with coal, hydrogen transfer between naphthenes, saturated alicyclic molecules, that represent resid and aromatic molecules that represent coal were examined in reactions with a high pressure H{sub 2 } atmosphere that is typical of actual coprocessing. The model naphthene, perhydropyrene, {{was chosen as the}} donor species and the models, anthracene, phenanthrene, and benzophenone, were chosen as the acceptor species.

40|$|Under {{subcontract}} from CONSOL Inc. (DOE Contract N o. DE- AC 22 - 94 PC 93054), the University of Delaware {{studied the}} mechanism and kinetics of coal liquefaction resid conversion.

INTRODUCTION Resid hydrocracking is a key reaction of modern (i. e., distillate- producing) coal liquefactio n processes. Coals are readily converted to resid a nd lighter products in the liquefaction process. <b>The</b> <b>resid</b> is combined with fr esh coal in a ratio often greater than 1 : 1, and some vacuum gas oil and is recycled to be further converted. Understanding <b>the</b> chemistry of <b>resids</b> and resi d reactivity is important to improve direct liquefaction process design and to achieve economi c objectives for direct coal liquefaction. Computational models that predict <b>resid</b> conversion from <b>the</b> chemical characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>resids</b> and reaction conditions would be a cost- efficient way to explore process variables.

Considering current conditions and expected future trends of the Saudi economy, the coprocessing of waste plastics with petroleum resid appears to be an attractive option for further studies. Our present ongoing study evaluated the effects of three different catalysts on the conversion and product distribution obtained from the coprocessing of heavy petroleum resid and waste plastics. The plastics used in this study were model polyethylenes (LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene, and polystyrene as well as post consumer waste plastics. The coprocessing of various plastics with petroleum resid was found to be affected by catalyst type. The presence of hydrocracking selectivities during reaction increased conversion and product distribution of hexane soluble materials. At reaction conditions of 60 min and 430 °C, catalysts with substantial hydrocracking activity yielded high levels of conversion to liquid fuel products.

40|$|The world`s {{supply of}} {{petroleum}} crudes is becoming heavier in nature {{so that the}} amount of vacuum bottoms has been steadily increasing. Coprocessing of coal with these resids (1, 000 F+) is an attractive way of obtaining useful distillates from these readily available cheap materials. The objective of this work is to pretreat the host oil in ways that would improve its performance in coprocessing with coal. The following are examples of some ways in which heavy oil could be made into a better host oil: converting aromatic structures to hydroaromatics capable of donating hydrogen to coal, cracking the heavy oil to lower molecular weight material that would be a better solvent, and removing metals, sulfur, and nitrogen. The work reported here used a Venezuelan oil obtained from the Corpus Christi refinery of Citgo. Two coals, Illinois No. 6 and Wyodak subbituminous, were coprocessed with host oils. The authors have found that mild pretreatment of a Citgo resid (1, 000 F) using either Mo naphthenate or Mo/Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }/SO{sub 4 }, as well as a pretreatment using the homogeneous catalyst Co{sub 2 }(CO) {sub 8 } under synthesis gas can increase the available (donatable) hydrogen content of <b>the</b> <b>resid.</b> When these pretreated oils were thermally (no added catalyst) coprocessed with an Illinois No. 6 coal, about 90 wt% of the coal (maf) was converted to soluble products.
