40|$|This {{paper is}} timely because it {{critically}} examines {{the influence of}} African-Americans on U. S. trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid</b> toward the Sub-Saharan African Countries in the late 1970 s, a dimension that has been largely overlooked in foreign policy analysis, despite its critical significance. In fact, African-American influence in U. S. trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid</b> policy toward Africa is an aspect that has so far received scanty attention regarding their ancestral homeland. For much of early 1960 s, African-American community identified with African countries in their decolonization struggles, economic sanction against former apartheid South Africa and a complete withdrawal of U. S. military aid to the Tshombe administration in the Congo. The low priority given to African countries in the U. S. foreign policy raises question(s) on the place of African Americans in the U. S. foreign policy, especially {{in the realm of}} trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid</b> between the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. In this paper, we argue that there is significant relationship between the volume of trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid</b> enjoyed by African countries from the U. S. foreign policy regarding Sub-Saharan Africa, and the influence of African-Americans on the US-African foreign policy, especially in the late 1970 s. The paper examined the active role played by the Congressional Black Caucus, NAACP, Trans-Africa, Africare, African-American political and religious leaders holding important positions in the U. S government. The methodology for this paper is mainly descriptive and relies on Government Documents, Journals, Newspapers, Reports from the United States Department of Trade and Commerce (USDTC), books and the internet, among others. The paper concludes that the activities undertaken by African-Americans have positive impact on the U. S. foreign policy toward their ancestral homeland like other ethnic groups, such as Jewish- Americans; Irish-Americans, Polish-Americans and Armenian- Americans. The conclusion is derived from the volume of trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid.</b> The policy challenge for this paper is how to maximize the influence of African-American Community on U.

The way the scheme was implemented, exemplifies the subventionist logic of income assistance, and underlines some standing characteristics in Greek agricultural policy.

In the European Union these measures are typically financed through national or regional rural development programmes (RDPs) that are co-funded by the EU and Member State administrations. These payments are an important foundation for the financial performance of organic farms, since they compensate them for additional costs or income foregone due to their organic commitments. Besides payments, a wide range of other public policy instruments exist, such as financial support for processing and marketing organic products, <b>investment</b> <b>aids,</b> a range of training, advice and information policies, as well as research support for projects related to organic farming (Sanders et al., 2011). ...|$|R
