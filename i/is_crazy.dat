According to Talalay, some were skeptical of the open casting, thinking that it was a publicity stunt. This was true to an extent, as she had been asking the studio to cast a well-known English actress, Emily Lloyd, who was replaced after she refused to cut her hair for the role. Talalay cast Lori Petty, an American, because [...] "she <b>is</b> <b>crazy</b> in her own life and [...] needed somebody like that." [...] MGM faxed Deadline asking them for an [...] "ideal cast" [...] list; they selected Malcolm McDowell for Kesslee, but never believed MGM would actually contact him.

Two cameos were settled on â€“ Iggy Pop was given the role of Rat Face, and BjÃ¶rk was offered Sub Girl. She later dropped out, her character's scenes were re-written, and the role was then given to Ann Cusack.|$|E
