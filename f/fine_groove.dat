50|$|Inventor Thomas Edison, {{who always}} favored the {{cylinder}} {{for all its}} advantages, also cut his discs with vertically modulated grooves from their introduction in 1912 until {{a year or two}} before his company's demise in 1929 (Edison Disc Records). Edison pioneered <b>fine</b> <b>groove</b> discs that played for up to five minutes per 10-inch side; they were very thick to remain perfectly flat and played back with a precision-ground diamond stylus. A commercially unsuccessful extension of the system introduced grooves nearly twice as fine as those of microgroove LPs, yielding playing times of up to 20 minutes per side at 80 RPM and again requiring a special diamond stylus. Even more than with Pathé discs, Edison's vertical-cut records called for specially designed equipment for playback.|$|E
50|$|Majestic {{was part}} of the {{miniature}} record fad of this era that was started by Little Wonder Records in 1914. They initially produced 7 inch 78rpm vertical cut records and would later also produce 9.25 inch vertical cut records. Both records had an etched label design. They marketed heavily to the trade looking for distributors for their records throughout the country. The 7 inch record sold for 25 cents while the 9.25 inch record sold for 50 cents. The selling point for Majestic was both the selling price and that they had 165 threads to the inch (or grooves to the inch) which was a very <b>fine</b> <b>groove.</b> This meant they played as long as their competitors' standard 10 inch records for a fraction of the price. The 9.25 inch records claimed four and half minutes of music. Since these records were vertical cut they also sold the Majestic Adaptor so that the records could be played on any phonograph.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an extremely light tracking force, the stylus arm is surrounded by coils which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to finely adjust tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in Compact Disc players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the optical pickup in steps for coarse tracking {{and a set of}} coils tilts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device which is the analogue of CED stylus deflection sensing coils. For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph tonearm in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the stylus side force varies with the tone arm angle, which in turn depends on the radial position on the record of the stylus. Whereas for a phonograph, where the stylus has a pinpoint tip, linear tracking is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability, for a CED player linear tracking is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a <b>fine</b> <b>groove</b> pitch (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.|$|E
50|$|Blue Amberols have {{a maximum}} playing time of about 4 minutes and 45 seconds and {{play at the}} {{standard}} post-1902 cylinder speed of 160 rpm. Like the preceding black wax Amberols, they provide twice the playing time of 2-minute cylinders by using a <b>finer</b> <b>groove</b> with a pitch of 200 lines per inch instead of 100. They cannot be played on older machines set up to play only the earlier standard 2 minute cylinders, as both wax and celluloid Amberols require a smaller stylus tip to fit the <b>finer</b> <b>groove</b> and the worm-gear which moves the stylus {{over the surface of}} the cylinder must turn at a different rate. Thomas A. Edison, Inc. sold kits with gear assemblies and reproducers that could be installed by the owner of an older Edison machine so that both standard and 4-minute records could be played. The Edison company also marketed new models capable of playing both. With these combination machines the operator needed to adjust a knob or lever that shifted gears and make sure the correct reproducing stylus was in position when switching from one record type to the other.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} super <b>fine</b> <b>groove</b> pattern with {{the width of}} 0. 1 mm and spacing of 0. 2 mm formed on Al alloy surface by fine {{machining}} on adhesion peel strength was investigated. The results indicate that such groove pattern can enhance adhesion strength in T-Peel test by 51. 4 %. A fracture model containing three stages such as fracture on Al alloy surface, inside the adhesive and along the vertical surface of the groove, is proposed and proved credible through studying the fracture morphology by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The fracture modes for the three stages in T- Peel test are peel (interfacial + cohesive), peel (cohesive) and shear (interfacial + cohesive) respectively, which reasonably explains the enhancement mechanism of groove pattern on adhesion strength in T-Peel test...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Micro-channel chips used in micro total {{analysis}} {{systems are}} attracting attention in medicine. In generally the photolithography technology used in semiconductor manufacturing {{is used to}} manufacture micro-channel chip Si-dies. However, this technology requires many processes, such as mask fabrication {{and the application of}} photoresist to a substrate as well as expensive clean room facilities. A micro-channel chip has a micro-groove 30 – 100 µm wide. This study examined how to form a <b>fine</b> <b>groove</b> by cutting with a micro-endmill, with the aim of shortening the window time and reducing the cost. This steel die requires high accuracy, for example, a burr area ratio of not more than 5 % of the groove bottom area, a surface roughness of the side and bottom faces of less than 1 µmRz, and a change in the sectional area of less than 1 %. So, this study examines micro-endmill’s cutting conditions, for example cutting speed, feed per tooth, and axial depth of cut. In MQL (minimum quantity of lubricant) cutting, the early fracture occurs when cutting was began. The cause has bad removing of the chips in MQL cutting, it is considered that the chips of hardened work have been re-cut as the result. Therefore, this study applied ultrasonic cavitation to milling, in order to solve this subject. This report experimentally examined the cutting performance of ultrasonic cavitation-assisted milling. We obtained the following results. In cutting distance of 20 m, the burr of MQL cutting is generated more than 5 %, on the other hand, the burr of ultrasonic cavitation-assisted milling is less than that. In ultrasonic cavitation-assisted milling, a tool wear and fracture can be decreased by improvement of removing chips and lubrication...|$|E

At higher Reynolds numbers, however, the drag coefficient for grooved tubes becomes larger than that for smooth tubes. No significant differences in the velocity profiles between grooved tubes and smooth tubes are found...|$|R
