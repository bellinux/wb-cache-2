25|$|One of the {{perceived}} main attractions of a <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> bicycle is low weight. Without the added parts required for a fully geared drive train—derailleurs, shifters, cables, cable carriers, multiple chain rings, freewheel hub, brazed-on mounting lugs—a <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> bicycle weighs less than its geared equivalent. The chain itself is subject to less sideways force and will not wear out as fast as on a derailleur system. Also, a <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> drivetrain is more mechanically efficient than any other bicycle drivetrain, with the most direct power transfer from rider to the wheels. Thus, a <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> requires less energy in any given gear to move than a geared bike in the same gear.|$|E

25|$|California’s <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> {{community}} stretches {{throughout the}} state with groups {{in all of the}} major urban areas that come together for riding and racing. Beginning in the north, Sacramento has a rising fixed-gear community as popular bicycle shops such as The Bicycle Business are beginning to carry <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> bikes and groups of riders are forming.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, a few activists started {{assembling}} {{and riding}} <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> bikes in Moscow. There had been people riding <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> bikes {{on the street}} in Moscow prior that time, but it had never developed into any feasible subculture. Appearances of the design in foreign media began increasing around that time, attracting more people to the concept.|$|E

For example, the San Jose Bike Party, {{held on the}} third Friday of every month, is dedicated to “building community through bicycling” and contains a majority of <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> riders, although all bikes are welcome. Moreover, companies such as Chrome Industries, who make bags and apparel catered toward bike messengers and urban cyclists, {{have been able to}} rise to worldwide prominence thanks to San Francisco and California’s biking community. Also, stores such as MASH SF based in San Francisco, and IMINUSD based in San Jose accommodate fixed-gear cyclist specifically with riding gear, parts, and a center for the fixed-gear riding community in their respective cities. MASH SF collaborates with the Italian bicycle manufacturing company, Cinelli, to make several <b>fixed</b> <b>gear</b> bike framesets, including {{what is known as the}} Cinelli MASH Histogram.

Designed to serve both as a fighter and an attack aircraft, it was a low-wing monoplane with a <b>fixed</b> landing <b>gear</b> of mixed construction, having trouser-covered legs. Although it was a monoplane {{at a time when}} many of the air forces of the world were flying biplanes, the Caproni was still an anachronism with <b>fixed</b> landing <b>gear</b> (at that time, most aircraft also had <b>fixed</b> landing <b>gear).</b>|$|R
