5|$|The best-known {{version of}} the Bricker Amendment, {{considered}} by the Senate in 1953–54, declared that no treaty could {{be made by the}} United States that conflicted with the Constitution; treaties could not be self-executing without the passage of separate <b>enabling</b> <b>legislation</b> through Congress; treaties could not give Congress legislative powers beyond those specified in the Constitution. It also limited the president's power to enter into executive agreements with foreign powers.|$|E
5|$|Six of {{the bills}} {{that had been the}} subject of the double {{dissolution}} were introduced in Parliament a third time and, as expected, were again rejected by the Senate. Section 57 of the Constitution provides that, after a double dissolution election, if bills that had been rejected twice by the Senate in the previous parliament were again passed by the House and again rejected by the Senate, they could then be put to a joint sitting of both houses. On 30 July, Whitlam gained Kerr's agreement for a joint sitting, which was set for 6–7 August 1974. The joint sitting, the only one in Australia's history under Section 57, passed all six bills, including the <b>enabling</b> <b>legislation</b> for Medibank.|$|E
5|$|From May until August 1910, {{the forest}} reserve supervisor, Fremont Nathan Haines, managed the park's {{resources}} {{as the first}} acting superintendent. In August 1910, William Logan was appointed the park's first superintendent. While the designation of the forest reserve confirmed the traditional usage rights of the Blackfeet, the <b>enabling</b> <b>legislation</b> of the national park does not mention the guarantees to the Native Americans. It is {{the position of the}} United States government that with the special designation as a National Park the mountains ceded their multi-purpose public land status and the former rights ceased to exist as it was confirmed by the Court of Claims in 1935. Some Blackfeet held that their traditional usage rights still exist de jure. In the 1890s, armed standoffs were avoided narrowly several times.|$|E

It <b>enables</b> <b>legislation</b> to be adopted on mergers between firms (the current regulation is the Regulation 139/2004/EC).

25|$|Depending on its <b>enabling</b> <b>legislation,</b> a tribunal's {{decisions}} may {{be reviewed}} {{by a court}} through an appeal or a process called judicial review. The reviewing court {{may be required to}} show some deference to the tribunal if the tribunal possesses some highly specialized expertise or knowledge that the court does not have. The degree of deference will also depend on such factors as the specific wording of the legislation creating the tribunal. Tribunals whose <b>enabling</b> <b>legislation</b> contains a privative clause are entitled to a high degree of deference, although a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9) has arguably lowered that degree of deference.|$|E

40|$|In Law and Disagreement, Jeremy Waldron, {{born and}} educated in New Zealand and trained in England, mounts a {{powerful}} {{argument in favor}} of legislation as a legitimate source of authority and correspondingly denigrates the American faith in judicial review. Waldron claims among other things that a legislature 2 ̆ 7 s inability to achieve consensus <b>enables</b> <b>legislation</b> to resolve disputes in a way that preserves the dignity and self-respect of losers in the policy struggle. In this Book Review Essay, Judge Posner commends Waldron for his impressive criticisms of the theoretical basis for the American faith in judicial review. At the same time, he criticizes Waldron 2 ̆ 7 s view of legislation as starryeyed and insufficiently attuned to the realities of the American judicial system. Although Waldron shows that the philosophical arguments supporting judicial review are weak, he does not show that judicial review itself is, on balance, a practice we would do best without...|$|R
