However, many tournaments had included assists, steals and blocks in their official boxscores {{prior to that}} time, so unofficially this has occurred sixteen times.

A truck driver's log book is a legally defined form containing a grid outlining the 24-hour day into 15-minute increments. The driver must specify where and when he/she stopped between driving shifts, what duties were performed (if any), along with the driver's name, truck number, company info, and other information. The driver must also present his or her log book to authorities upon request, for inspection. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on-board recorder to record the driver's hours.|$|E

Affine arithmetic is not only used for <b>keeping</b> <b>tracks</b> of variations and correlations, but also helps to determine the sub-gradient at each iteration of the ellipsoid method. An example of designing a CMOS operational amplifier is given to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method. Finally numerical results are verified by SPICE simulation. I...|$|R

5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in <b>keeping</b> <b>track</b> of {{the movements of the}} bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for <b>keeping</b> <b>track</b> of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E
5|$|<b>Keeping</b> <b>track</b> of the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E

40|$|Persistent {{bear market}} {{conditions}} {{have led to}} a shift of focus in the tracking error literature. Until recently the portfolio allocation literature focused on tracking error minimization as a consequence of passive benckmark management under portfolio weights, transaction costs and short selling constraints. Abysmal benchmark performance shifted the literature's focus towards active portfolio strategies that aim at beating the benchmark while <b>keeping</b> <b>tracking</b> error within acceptable bounds. We investigate an active (dynamic) portfolio allocation strategy that exploits the predictability in the conditional variance-covariance matrix of asset returns. To illustrate our procedure we use Jorion's (2002) tracking error frontier methodology. We apply our model to a representative portfolio of Australian stocks over the period January 1999 through November 2002. ...|$|R
5|$|During the Cold War {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, huge {{stockpiles}} of uranium were amassed {{and tens of}} thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600short tons (540metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US $550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been <b>keeping</b> <b>track</b> of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.|$|E
