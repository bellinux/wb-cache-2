5|$|Alice McDermott {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on June 27, 1953. In 1975, McDermott {{received}} her B.A. from the State University of New York and her M.A from the University of New Hampshire in 1978. She began writing {{at an early stage}} in her life, although <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> A Bigamists' Daughter, was not published until 1982. In 1987, McDermott was a recipient of the Whiting Writers Award for her novels, several of which had been finalists for the Pulitzer Prize or winners of the National Book Award.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{her success}} in the United Kingdom, Heyer's novels were very popular in the United States and Germany and {{achieved}} respectable sales in Czechoslovakia. A first printing {{of one of her}} novels in the Commonwealth often consisted of 65,000–75,000 copies, and her novels collectively sold over 100,000copies in hardback each year. Her paperbacks usually sold over 500,000copies each. At the time of her death 48 of her books were still in print, including <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> The Black Moth.|$|E
5|$|For eight years, {{she worked}} in {{publishing}} at Quarto and Gordon Fraser. She spent two years teaching English as a foreign language in Turin, Italy and Bilbao, Spain. She returned to England in 1992 and {{spent the rest of}} that year in County Durham, in a house that looked out over the North Sea. There she began working on <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. In 1993, she was hired by Simon & Schuster in Cambridge to edit cookbooks, a job she kept for the next ten years.|$|E
50|$|She {{published}} <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> in 1990.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> were {{historical}} romances published {{under the}} nom de plume Ann Hulme. After {{her return to}} England, <b>her</b> <b>first</b> crime <b>novel,</b> Say It With Poison, was published in 1991.|$|R
50|$|She {{published}} <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> as Hilda Nickson at Herbert Jenkins in the 1950s, {{before being}} taken on at Mills & Boon under her married name and as Hilda Pressley. Most of her novels were republished under the Harlequin imprint, sometimes with different titles. <b>Her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> were popular doctor-nurse romances; love triangles frequently feature in her plots, {{and she also}} set her novels in Italy or Spain.|$|R
5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel</b> {{set in the}} Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. The books were set almost entirely {{in the world of}} the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E
5|$|Rand began The Fountainhead (originally titled Second-Hand Lives) {{following}} {{the completion of}} <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> We the Living, in 1934. That earlier novel was {{based in part on}} people and events familiar to Rand; the new novel, on the other hand, focused on the less-familiar world of architecture. She therefore conducted extensive research that included reading many biographies and other books about architecture. She also worked as an unpaid typist in the office of architect Ely Jacques Kahn. Rand began her notes for the new novel in December 1935.|$|E
5|$|The Earl and Countess of Munster {{lived at}} Palmeira Square in Brighton. Later in life, Lady Munster became a novelist and short story writer. In 1889, she {{released}} <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> Dorinda; a second, A Scotch Earl, followed two years later. The year 1896 saw {{the publication of}} Ghostly Tales, a collection of tales on the supernatural which have largely been forgotten today. Lady Munster also produced an autobiography entitled My Memories and Miscellanies, which was released in 1904. She died two years later.|$|E
50|$|Hayley {{began writing}} {{while living in}} Wales and had <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> {{published}} by Welsh publishers Parthian and Accent Press.|$|R
50|$|Valerie {{published}} <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> in 1982. She is recognised as a media {{spokesperson for}} all things romantic in Australia.|$|R
50|$|She {{worked as}} {{programmer}} until her marriage, {{they had three}} daughters. In 1990, she published <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> in Mills & Boon.|$|R
5|$|The Word for World is Forest {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Hainish universe, which Le Guin {{introduced}} in <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel</b> Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In this alternative history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel</b> cast {{a standard for}} Affinity to follow, which Waters consciously made darker, set in a women's prison with a character who connects with spirits of the dead. Waters found it daunting to follow the success of Tipping the Velvet and reviewers marked {{the differences in the}} main characters: where Nan adventurously seeks out and states her desires, Margaret in Affinity is compelled by desire, but internally struggles with it.|$|E
5|$|While at the University of Iowa, Godwin's {{dissertation}} became <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> The Perfectionists. By 1976 she {{had become}} a successful writer and author of three books. In particular, two books written by her in the 1980s, A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) and A Southern Family (1987), resulted in further acclaim and expanded the readership of her books. Following The Finishing School (1984), readership of her books dramatically declined until 2006, when Queen of the Underworld was published. Flora (2013) became one of her more commercially successful novels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> were {{published}} by St. Martin's Press. With A Summer Affair, published in 2008, {{she moved to}} Little, Brown and Company.|$|R
50|$|Janette {{published}} <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> though LDS publishing companies; however, after submitting {{her book}} {{to a national}} book company, her career took off.|$|R
50|$|As Emma Darcy, {{they sold}} <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> in 1983. Darcy sold 60 million books from 1983 to 2001, and {{averaged}} six new books per year.|$|R
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> Maluku, Kobaran Cintaku (Maluku, Flame of My Love).|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in his life Beebe was {{developing}} a close friendship with the American romance novelist Elswyth Thane, who had met Beebe in 1925. Very little of their early correspondence survives, but Elswyth had idolized Beebe for years, and <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel</b> Riders of the Wind was devoted to him. The novel was an account of a young woman who falls in love with, and eventually marries, a much older adventurer who strongly resembled Beebe. Beebe and Elswyth were married on September 22, 1927, when Beebe was 50. Due to Elswyth's tendency to misrepresent her age, conflicting accounts exist of how old she was when she and Beebe were married, ranging from 23 to 28. Elswyth and Beebe had an open marriage, in which neither expected sexual exclusivity from the other so long as their life together was not damaged.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{served as}} the book review editor of The Miami Herald from 1942 to 1949, and as editor for the University of Miami Press from 1960 to 1963. She {{released}} <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> entitled Road to the Sun, in 1952. She wrote four novels, and several non-fiction books on regional topics including Florida birdwatching and David Fairchild, the entomologist turned biologist who imagined a botanical park in Miami. Her autobiography entitled Marjory Stoneman Douglas: Voice of the River was written with John Rothchild in 1987. She {{had been working on}} a book about W. H. Hudson for years, traveling to Argentina and England several times. It was incomplete when she died in 1998.|$|E
50|$|Sophie von Knorring {{debuted in}} 1834. As <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> {{depicted}} several private people, such {{as her own}} former love objects, she initially wished to remain anonymous.|$|R
50|$|During this time, Catherine {{also wrote}} <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel(s)</b> Walter's Purple Heart, <b>her</b> <b>first</b> {{published}} <b>Novel</b> Funeral for Horses, and {{an anthology of}} 18 short stories, Earthquake Weather. A self-described literary writer, her breakthrough novel Pay It Forward (novel) was released in 1999 (Pocket Books) and quickly became a national bestseller, and was later adapted into the film Pay It Forward (Warner Brothers), which was released in 2000.|$|R
50|$|She {{has written}} {{advertising}} copy extolling {{the wonders of}} everything from household appliances to diamonds to tires {{and for a few}} years, she wrote for a large metropolitan newspaper. She finally published <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> in 1983.|$|R
5|$|During her {{childhood}} in Jakarta, Ng enjoyed reading and read at an advanced rate. After finishing her {{primary and secondary}} education in Indonesia, during which time she took up writing, Ng went to the United States to study at Ohio State University. After her graduation in 1997, she worked in the US for a year before returning to Indonesia {{to work at a}} shipping company. After three years working there, in which time she married and had two miscarriages, Ng quit to become a professional writer. <b>Her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> Tujuh Musim Setahun (Seven Seasons in a Year; 2002), sold poorly, but her subsequent trilogy Indiana Chronicle was better received. Since then, she has released several novels, as well as numerous short stories (including one anthology) and twenty-one children's books, and some collections of fairytales.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel</b> while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Rand wrote Night of January 16th in 1933. She was 28 and {{had been}} in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the Soviet Union, where her strong anti-Communist {{opinions}} had put her at risk. Rand had never written a stage play, but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille, and later in RKO Studios' wardrobe department. In September 1932, Rand sold an original screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios and quit RKO to finish <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> We the Living. She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while finishing her novel. By 1934 her agent was trying to sell the play and the novel, but both were repeatedly rejected. Red Pawn was shelved and Rand's contract for rewrites on it expired. Rand's husband, actor Frank O'Connor, was getting only minor roles with little pay, leaving the couple in financial difficulties. With the last of her money from Red Pawn exhausted, Rand got an offer for her new play from Al Woods, who had produced The Trial of Mary Dugan for Broadway. The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script. Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama, Rand turned Woods down.|$|E
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>first</b> three <b>novels</b> {{centered}} on her character Jill Jackson.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> {{were for}} adults. Spilling Clarence, 2003, {{was about a}} small town {{suddenly}} afflicted with a flood of memory. The Disapparition of James, 2004, concerned the effect on his family of the disappearance of a small boy during a stage magic trick.|$|R
