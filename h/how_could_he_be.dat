2500|$|Pope Cornelius gave a {{detailed}} {{accounting of the}} structure of the Church at the time he was pope, and enquired in a seemingly rhetorical way, [...] ", then, did not know that there must be one bishop in the Catholic Church. Yet he was not unaware [...] <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be?</b> [...] that in it there are ..." [...] and thence follows the accounting. This came about because Novatian had allegedly made himself antipope; Cornelius was emphasizing the perceived need for recognition of one bishop, one head of the Church.|$|E
6000|$|How {{should she}} bear herself; what should she say; how should she look when George Bertram came {{there as a}} guest to her house? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> so cruel, so heartless, so inhuman as to come there? Her path was {{difficult}} enough for her poor weary feet. He must know that--should, at any rate, have known it. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> so cruel as to add this great stumbling-block to her other perils? ...|$|E
6000|$|Edgar {{gazed at}} him with stupefaction. It was Rupert's voice; but how could this wild figure be Rupert? <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> here? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An iron will is an {{integral}} part of such a temperament. <b>How</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> a leader? And I think that you are mistaken in--" ...|$|R
6000|$|The mother apologized. [...] "He doesn't know you, Dick. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he?</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{only nine}} months old {{when you went}} away. He'll go to you by and by." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was only}} argument[1]. I swear {{it was only}} argument. I never lifted a hand. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I? <b>He</b> <b>was</b> my brother, my elder brother, Jim.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, Tuppence, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be?</b> This door's open {{into the}} hall. No {{one could have}} come in {{by the front door}} without our seeing and hearing him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh,' cried Dolores, 'I {{thought he}} was dead! He told me so! Uncle Alfred, I mean! And it was only to get the money! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> so wicked?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Dodd {{had been}} looking all round--had taken in, with the rest, the brightness, the {{distinguished}} elegance, as he supposed it, of the tea-service with which she was dealing and the variously tinted appeal of certain savoury edibles on plates. [...] "Oh but he hadn't had his tea!" [...] he heard himself the next moment earnestly reply; which speech had at once betrayed, he was then quickly aware, the candour of his interest, the unsophisticated state that had survived so many troubles. If he was so interested <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> proud, {{and if he was}} proud <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> so interested? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{accepted}} his assurance, though I {{did not really}} see <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> so positive about the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor," [...] said Lord John, [...] "is there much {{doubt as}} to how he met his death. He has fallen or been chucked from the top, and so <b>been</b> impaled. <b>How</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> come by his broken bones, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have <b>been</b> stuck through by these canes with their points so high above our heads?" ...|$|R
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE [calmly {{sitting down}} and {{replacing}} the case on the table]. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he?</b> There would <b>be</b> no clergyman to marry us. It {{would have to be}} quite morganatic.|$|R
60|$|CORNELIUS. Arra <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> Larry, woman alive? Larry's in {{no hurry}} home, it seems. I haven't set eyes on him. This is his friend, Mr Broadbent. Mr Broadbent, me sister Judy.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{long time}} Conger said nothing. He {{stared down at the}} bones, dimly visible in the recess of the wall. How could a man dead centuries be killed? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> stalked, brought down? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be so, or <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> so {{familiar}} {{with a history}} that is little known beyond my own family," [...] at length the youth observed, not ashamed to acknowledge how much he had been affected, by unequivocally drying his own eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "The gun {{was made}} to conceal. That's why the barrels were sawed. It would fit into any box. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> swear there <b>was</b> no such gun in the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|This was an {{arrangement}} that suited Montalvo well enough, for in his heart <b>he</b> <b>was</b> terrified of this woman, whose beautiful face had frozen into a perpetual mask of watchful hatred. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not forget that frightful curse which had taken deep root in his superstitious mind, and already seemed to flourish there, for {{it was true that}} since she spoke it he had never known a quiet hour. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> haunted night and day by the fear lest his wife should murder him? ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{promised that}} he would, {{and then went}} his way, proud in his heart at this solicitude. And <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> not <b>be</b> proud? was she not high in rank, proud in character, {{beautiful}} withal, {{and the mother of}} Clara Desmond? What sweeter friend could a man have; what counsellor more potent to avert those dangers which now hovered round his head? ...|$|R
6000|$|The Turks, {{with whom}} Colonel Langley {{was out of}} favour now that his friend Achmet was dead, were furious. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> an Englishman, they said, when it was {{well-known}} that the French would not have permitted one of their chief enemies to remain at Naples? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The receipt? Yes, Leonard {{always said}} the receipt would clear him! But oh, how dreadful! He {{must have had}} it all the time. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> so cruel! Oh! I never felt before that such wickedness could be;' and she lay, looking appalled and overpowered.|$|E
60|$|The {{feeling that}} they had {{exchanged}} recognition possessed him like a madness, like a torment. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> sure, what confirmation had he? The doubt was like a sense of infinite space, a nothingness, annihilating. He kept within his breast the will to surety. They had exchanged recognition.|$|E
60|$|Wessex loved {{with his}} soul, {{but not yet}} with his reason. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he?</b> Reason <b>is</b> always the last to fall into line with the other slaves of passion. At present he worshipped in her that which he had {{conceived}} her to be, and the very sublimity of this whole-hearted love was a bar {{to the existence of}} perfect trust and faith.|$|R
60|$|Wolfenden sprang {{suddenly}} {{from his}} chair with startled face. An idea, slow of coming, but absolutely convincing from its first conception, had suddenly flashed home to him. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have <b>been</b> so blind? <b>He</b> stood looking at his mother in fixed suspense. The light of his knowledge was in his face, and she saw it. She had been dreading this all the while.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> brave enough. There is {{no denying}} it, for <b>how</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> an Iroquois war-chief? But <b>he</b> <b>is</b> clever and cunning, and cruel-- Ah, my God, if all the stories told are true, his cruelty is past believing. I should fear that my tongue would wither if I did but name the things which this man has done. Ah, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> there again." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{felt very}} anxious {{as he did}} this. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> sure that Harvey was there? What {{a long time for}} that poor fellow to wait, without having any {{assurance}} that Harry would get across the creek at all, much less reach his post, and go to work.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no go," [...] said Mr. Henchy, {{shaking his}} head. [...] "I asked the little shoeboy, but he said: 'Oh, now, Mr. Henchy, when I see work going on {{properly}} I won't forget you, {{you may be}} sure.' Mean little tinker! 'Usha, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> anything else?" ...|$|E
60|$|Dead, {{he went on}} from {{lunch to}} tea. His face was all the time fixed and stiff and colourless, his life was a dry, {{mechanical}} movement. Yet even he wondered slightly at the awful misery that had overcome him. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> so ashlike and extinct? He wrote her a letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, come!" [...] said Summerhaye, {{opening his}} lips {{for the first}} time. [...] "Surely {{the whole thing is}} clear as daylight. The man's caught red-handed. <b>How</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> such a fool beats me!" ...|$|R
60|$|Richard Baxter was too {{thoroughly}} {{good for}} any experience {{to make him}} worldly wise; else, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have <b>been</b> simple enough to suppose, that Mazarine would leave such a question to be voted 'pro' and 'con', and decided by thirty emissaries in London! And, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have reconciled Mazarine's having any share in Charles's death with his own masterly account, pp. 98, 99, 100? Even Cromwell, though he might have prevented, could not have effected, the sentence. The regicidal judges were not his creatures. Consult the Life of Colonel Hutchinson upon this.|$|R
6000|$|But Wilding seemed {{intent upon}} showing <b>how</b> long-suffering <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be.</b> <b>He</b> gently shook his head. [...] "Nay, now," [...] said he. [...] "You thought, Mr. Westmacott, that in {{mentioning}} your sister, I did so lightly. Is it not so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{long time}} there was nothing at all. Nothing beyond the crystal mesh of the cage. Thoughts rushed through Conger's mind, helter-skelter. How would he know the man? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> certain, in advance? What had he looked like? What was his name? How had he acted, before he spoke? Would he be an {{ordinary}} person, or some strange outlandish crank? ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Luker didn't {{profess to}} know how. If Mr. Godfrey had {{accepted}} his terms, Mr. Godfrey {{would have made}} him an accomplice, and might have counted on his silence as on a certainty. As things were, Mr. Luker must be guided by his own interests. If awkward inquiries were made, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> expected to compromise himself, {{for the sake of}} a man who had declined to deal with him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you take}} the vagabond, remember, Monsieur Philip, that it is {{altogether}} against my advice. I would never have spoken to you about him, if I had imagined {{for a moment that}} you would think of taking him. A fellow who has never kept any employment for two months, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> fit for a post of confidence, and be able to mix as your body servant with the households of honourable families?" ...|$|E
50|$|Brazilian {{newspaper}} Folha de S.Paulo acquired {{copies of}} letters Moqbel {{had written to}} his lawyers.They quoted his confusion as to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> cleared for release over five years ago, yet still remain in detention.|$|R
6000|$|His folly came to {{him with}} {{increased}} poignancy after he had parted from Noel. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have <b>been</b> such a base fool, as to have committed himself to Leila on an evening when <b>he</b> had actually <b>been</b> {{in the company of}} that child? Was it the vague, unseizable likeness between them which had pushed him over the edge? 'I've <b>been</b> an ass,' <b>he</b> thought; 'a horrible ass.' I would always have given every hour I've ever spent with Leila, for one real smile from that girl.' ...|$|R
25|$|Luckily for Giles, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{fortunate}} enough to not be overshadowed by his younger (slightly less funny) brother Nigel Reynolds. Nigel is full of tall tales of how talented a cricketer <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> and <b>how</b> successful <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been.</b>|$|R
