5|$|There {{is another}} {{opportunity}} for tennessine to complete its octet—by forming a covalent bond. Like the halogens, when two tennessine atoms meet {{they are expected}} to form a Ts–Ts bond to give a diatomic molecule. Such molecules are commonly bound via single sigma bonds between the atoms; these are different from pi bonds, which are divided into two parts, each shifted in a direction perpendicular to the line between the atoms, and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind. Sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great antibonding character in the At2 molecule and is not as favorable energetically. Tennessine <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>to</b> continue the trend; a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Ts2. The molecule tennessine chloride (TsCl) <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>to</b> go further, being bonded with a single pi bond.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} group 17 elements, tennessine may not exhibit the chemical behavior {{common to the}} halogens. For example, the extant {{members of the group}} routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable electronic configuration of a noble gas, one having eight electrons (octet) in its valence shell. This ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group; tennessine would be the least willing to accept an electron. Of the oxidation states it <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>to</b> form, −1 {{is expected to be the}} least common. The standard reduction potential of the Ts/Ts− couple <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>to</b> be −0.25V; this value is negative and thus tennessine should not be reduced to the −1 oxidation state under standard conditions, unlike all {{the previous}} halogens.|$|E

Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose.

5|$|Although {{francium}} is {{the heaviest}} alkali metal {{that has been}} discovered, {{there has been some}} theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>to</b> be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>to</b> be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>to</b> continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of unbinilium <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>to</b> {{be similar to}} that of the alkaline earth metals, but it would probably behave more like calcium or strontium than barium or radium. Like strontium, unbinilium should react vigorously with air to form an oxide (UbnO) and with water to form the hydroxide (Ubn(OH)2), which would be a strong base, and releasing hydrogen gas. It should also react with the halogens to form salts such as UbnCl2. While these reactions would be expected from periodic trends, their lowered intensity is somewhat unusual, as ignoring relativistic effects, periodic trends would predict unbinilium to be even more reactive than barium or radium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of unbinilium's valence electron, increasing unbinilium's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for radium. the {{chemistry of}} unbinilium in the +2 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of strontium than to that of radium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>to</b> be larger than that of Sr2+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Unbinilium may also show the +4 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkaline earth metal, in addition to the +2 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkaline earth metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkaline earth metals: this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected. The +1 state may also be stable in isolation. Many unbinilium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding: this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in radium, which shows some 6s and 6p3/2 contribution to the bonding in radium fluoride (RaF2) and astatide (RaAt2), resulting in these compounds having more covalent character.
