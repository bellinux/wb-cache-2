The thermal conductivity (<b>k-value)</b> {{is the ability of}} a material to conduct heat hence, the lower the <b>k-value,</b> the better the material is for insulation. Expanded polystyrene (EPS), has a <b>k-value</b> of around 0.033 W/mK. For comparison, phenolic foam insulation has a <b>k-value</b> of around 0.018 W/mK, while wood varies anywhere from 0.15 to 0.75 W/mK, and steel has a <b>k-value</b> of approximately 50.0 W/mK. These figures vary from product to product, so the UK & EU have established a 90/90 standard which means that 90% of the product will conform to the stated <b>k-value</b> with a 90% confidence level so long as the figure quoted is stated as the 90/90 lambda-value.|$|E

40|$|Any {{weighted}} automaton (WA) {{defines a}} relation from finite words to values: given an input word, its {{set of values}} is obtained as the set of values computed by each accepting run on that word. A WA is <b>k-valued</b> if the relation it defines has degree at most k, i. e. every set of values associated with an input word has cardinality at most k. We investigate the class of quantitative languages defined by <b>k-valued</b> automata, for all parameters k. We consider several measures to associate values with runs: sum, discounted-sum, and more generally values in groups. We define a general procedure which decides, given a bound k and a WA over a group, whether this automaton is <b>k-valued.</b> We also show that any <b>k-valued</b> WA over a group, under some general conditions, can be decomposed as a union of k unambiguous WA. While inclusion and equivalence are undecidable problems for arbitrary sum-automata, we show, based on this decomposition, that they are decidable for <b>k-valued</b> sum-automata, and <b>k-valued</b> discounted sumautomata over inverted integer discount factors. We finally show that the quantitative Church problem is undecidable for <b>k-valued</b> sum-automata, even given as finite unions of deterministic sum-automata.

They are important in predicting compositional changes under varying temperatures and pressures in the reservoirs, surface separators, and production and transportation facilities. In particular, they are critical for reliable and successful compositional reservoir simulation. Several techniques are available in the literature to estimate the <b>K-values.</b> This paper presents a new model for predicting K values with genetic programming (GP). The new model is applied to multicomponent mixtures. In this paper, 732 high-pressure <b>K-values</b> obtained from PVT analysis of 17 crude oil and gas samples from a number of petroleum reservoirs in Arabian Gulf are used. Constant Volume Depletion (CVD) and Differential Liberation (DL) were conducted for these samples.

We show that (i) rigid and <b>k-valued</b> non-associative Lambek (NL without product) grammars are learnable from generalized functor-argument structured sentences. We also define subclasses of <b>k-valued</b> grammars in terms of arity.
