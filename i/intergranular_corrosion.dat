2500|$|Some {{austenitic}} stainless steels and nickel-based alloys are prone to <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion.</b> When subjected to temperatures around [...] for too long a time, chromium reacts with carbon in the material, forming chromium carbide and depleting the crystal edges of chromium, impairing their corrosion resistance in a process called sensitization. Such sensitized steel undergoes corrosion in the areas near the welds where the temperature-time was favorable for forming the carbide. This kind of corrosion is often termed weld decay.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intergranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> is {{generally}} considered to be caused by the segregation of impurities at the grain boundaries or by enrichment or depletion of one of the alloying elements in the grain boundary areas. Thus in certain aluminium alloys, small amounts of iron have been shown to segregate in the grain boundaries and cause <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Also, {{it has been shown that}} the zinc content of a brass is higher at the grain boundaries and subject to such corrosion. High-strength aluminium alloys such as the Duralumin-type alloys (Al-Cu) which depend upon precipitated phases for strengthening are susceptible to <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> following sensitization at temperatures of about 120 °C. Nickel-rich alloys such as Inconel 600 and Incoloy 800 show similar susceptibility. Die-cast zinc alloys containing aluminum exhibit <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> by steam in a marine atmosphere. Cr-Mn and Cr-Mn-Ni steels are also susceptible to <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> following sensitization in the temperature range of 420°-850 °C. In the case of the austenitic stainless steels, when these steels are sensitized by being heated in the temperature range of about 520° to 800 °C, depletion of chromium in the grain boundary region occurs, resulting in susceptibility to <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Such sensitization of austenitic stainless steels can readily occur because of temperature service requirements, as in steam generators, or as a result of subsequent welding of the formed structure.|$|E

50|$|Several {{methods have}} been used to control or {{minimize}} the <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> of susceptible alloys, particularly of the austenitic stainless steels. For example, a high-temperature solution heat treatment, commonly termed solution-annealing, quench-annealing or solution-quenching, has been used. The alloy is heated to a temperature of about 1,060° to 1,120 °C and then water quenched. This method is generally unsuitable for treating large assemblies, and also ineffective where welding is subsequently used for making repairs or for attaching other structures.|$|E
40|$|<b>Intergranular</b> stress <b>corrosion</b> {{cracking}} (IGSCC) is {{a fracture}} mechanism in sensitised {{austenitic stainless steels}} exposed to critical environments where the intergranular cracks extends along the network of connected susceptible grain boundaries. A constitutive model is presented to estimate the maximum intergranular crack growth by taking into consideration the materials mechanical properties and microstructure characters distribution. This constitutive model is constructed {{based on the assumption}} that each grain is a two phase material comprising of grain interior and grain boundary zone. The inherent micro-mechanisms active in the grain interior during IGSCC is based on crystal plasticity theory, while the grain boundary zone has been modelled by proposing a phenomenological constitutive model motivated from cohesive zone modelling approach. Overall, response of the representative volume is calculated by volume averaging of individual grain behaviour. Model is assessed by performing rigorous parametric studies, followed by validation and verification of the proposed constitutive model using representative volume element based FE simulations reported in the literature.

40|$|The {{development}} and validation of predictive models for <b>intergranular</b> stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking requires knowledge of short crack growth kinetics {{in response to}} mechanical driving forces. A new experimental method for in-situ observation of {{the early stages of}} crack growth during stress corrosion cracking, via full field Digital Image Correlation, is described and data for crack growth development are presented. <b>Intergranular</b> stress <b>corrosion</b> cracks were nucleated in sensitised 304 stainless steel under static uniaxial flexural deflection, within a potassium tetrathionate environment. High resolution optical images of a 2 mm by 2 mm area are recorded through the test solution during the experiment. The raw images show no observable cracking. However, the high sensitivity of digital image correlation allows small crack opening displacements to be detected. The derived strain map of the sample surface thereby enables imaging of the cracks. Surface cracks with lengths exceeding approximately 30 μm can be observed. Post processing of the strain maps is then used to track the development of the cracks. Copyright © 2008 by ASME...|$|R

50|$|Aluminium alloy {{surfaces}} {{will develop}} a white, protective layer of aluminium oxide if left unprotected by anodizing and/or correct painting procedures. In a wet environment, galvanic corrosion can occur when an aluminium alloy is placed in electrical contact with other metals with more positive corrosion potentials than aluminium, and an electrolyte is present that allows ion exchange. Referred to as dissimilar-metal corrosion, this process can occur as exfoliation or as <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Aluminium alloys can be improperly heat treated.

40|$|Microstructural {{analyses}} {{by several}} advanced metallographic techniques {{were conducted on}} austenitic stainless steel mockup and core shroud welds that had cracked in boiling water reactors. Contrary to previous beliefs, heat-affected zones of the cracked Type 304 L, as well as 304 SS core shroud welds and mockup shielded-metal-arc welds, were free of grain-boundary carbides, which shows that core shroud failure cannot be explained by classical <b>intergranular</b> stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking. Neither martensite nor delta-ferrite films were present on the grain boundaries. However, {{as a result of}} exposure to welding fumes, the heat-affected zones of the core shroud welds were significantly contaminated by oxygen and fluorine, which migrate to grain boundaries. Significant oxygen contamination seems to promote fluorine contamination and suppress thermal sensitization. Results of slow-strain-rate tensile tests also indicate that fluorine exacerbates the susceptibility of irradiated steels to <b>intergranular</b> stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking. These observations, combined with previous reports on the strong influence of weld flux, indicate that oxygen and fluorine contamination and fluorine-catalyzed stress corrosion {{play a major role in}} cracking of core shroud welds...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the promise}} of {{substantially}} higher efficiency and lower capital costs, the use of s presents material selection and design issues. Materials in power generation components must display high-temperature resistance, oxidation resistance and creep resistance. Candidate materials that meet these property and performance goals include incumbent alloys in power generation, such as nickel-based superalloys for turbomachinery components and austenitic stainless steels for piping. Components within s Brayton loops suffer from corrosion and erosion, specifically erosion in turbomachinery and recuperative heat exchanger components and <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> and pitting in the piping.|$|E
50|$|Another control {{technique}} for preventing <b>intergranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> involves incorporating strong carbide formers or stabilizing {{elements such as}} niobium or titanium in the stainless steels. Such elements have a much greater affinity for carbon than does chromium; carbide formation with these elements reduces the carbon available in the alloy for formation of chromium carbides. Such a stabilized titanium-bearing austenitic chromium-nickel-copper stainless steel is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,562,781. Or the stainless steel may initially be reduced in carbon content below 0.03 percent so that insufficient carbon is provided for carbide formation. These techniques are expensive and only partially effective since sensitization may occur with time. The low-carbon steels also frequently exhibit lower strengths at high temperatures.|$|E
