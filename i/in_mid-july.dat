5|$|A bill {{setting out}} {{arrangements}} for funding and building the fleet was finalized <b>in</b> <b>mid-July</b> 1914.

The outbreak of the First World War led to the bill being withdrawn due to the uncertain international circumstances and the impossibility of buying battleships from foreign shipbuilders in wartime.
