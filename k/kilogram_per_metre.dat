The new section was built to mainline 1XC standards, with 60 <b>kilogram</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> rails and concrete sleepers.

5000|$|Fifteen <b>kilogram</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> iron rails were used, with {{a minimum}} of wood and gravel on the rail bed. Though the Temiya factory and railyard were {{established}} by now, the stations in Otaru (now Minami-Otaru Station) and Sapporo were still temporary constructs; Asari, Asakawa, and Kotoni Stations were made [...] "flag stops", in the American style. Two steam locomotives were imported from H. K. Porter, Inc along with eight passenger cars from Harlan and Hollingsworth, both American firms. These locomotives, dubbed Benkei and Yoshitsune, were the first of what would later be termed the 7100 series of locomotives. Each locomotive in the series would be named after a figure from Japanese history. The following year, Emperor Meiji made his way to Hokkaidō on his national tour, rode the line from Otaru to Sapporo, and gave his approval.|$|E

50|$|Contemporary {{cast nets}} have a radius which ranges from 4 to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.6 metres). Only strong people can lift the larger nets {{once they are}} filled with fish. Standard nets for {{recreational}} fishing have a four-foot hoop. Weights are usually distributed around the edge at about one pound <b>per</b> foot (1.5 <b>kilograms</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre).</b> Attached to the net is a handline, one end of which is held in the hand as the net is thrown.

The net is lifted into a bucket and the clamp is released, dumping the caught fish into the bucket.|$|R

50|$|The {{water flow}} rate in a raceway system needs to be {{sufficiently}} high to meet the respiratory (dissolved oxygen) requirements for the species concerned and to flush out metabolic wastes, especially ammonia. In a well designed system, the existing water in the raceway is largely replaced by new water when the same volume of new water enters the raceway. Self-cleaning can sometimes be achieved if the fish stocks density is sufficiently high and the water level is sufficiently low. For example, if trout are stocked at 20 <b>kilograms</b> <b>per</b> cubic <b>metre,</b> they can keep the raceway unit clean by their swimming movements, preventing waste solids from settling to the raceway floor.|$|R
50|$|Pouteria species yield hard, heavy, {{resilient}} woods used as firewood, timber, {{but particularly}} in outdoor and naval construction, such as dock pilings, deckings, etc. Some species like abiu (P. caimito), {{are considered to}} be shipworm resistant; however, this depends on the silica content which may vary from 0-0.9%. The weight by volume (at 12% moisture content) of Pouteria wood can be in excess of 1140 <b>kilograms</b> <b>per</b> cubic <b>metre</b> (71 pounds <b>per</b> cubic feet); thus, the wood sinks in water.

50|$|From the {{equation}} for density (ρ = m / V), mass density has units of mass divided by volume.
