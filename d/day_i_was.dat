He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E

It's a— I don't know, {{about the size of the}} first Narwhal that we built. And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it's just tearing their nets to ribbons— they've even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there— and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I'd care to count.|$|E

Cocteau, {{in an interview with}} The Paris Review stated that Radiguet had told him three days before his death that, [...] "In three <b>days,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to be shot by the soldiers of God."

[...] However, in 1965 he married Jean Ferguson, a hairdresser, and the couple brought up two sons Alan and Steven. His marriage to Jean broke down in 1981 and the two divorced. Jean married golfer William McCondichie three years later. In 1983 Baxter formed a relationship with Norma Morton, and the couple remained together {{until his death in}} 2001.|$|E

Martin told Rolling Stone magazine that lyrics from the song about [...] "a carnival of idiots on show" [...] and how a [...] "fox became God" [...] were a commentary on Fox News. [...] "One <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> watching Bill O'Reilly, and I was like, 'I know how to finish that song. My best friend, Tim... was having trouble with his boss, {{and it made me}} think that so many people spend their lives being told what to do by people that they just don't like.

Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.|$|E

500|$|Eckhart first gained wide {{exposure}} in 2000 as George, a ponytailed, goateed biker, in Steven Soderbergh's drama Erin Brockovich.

His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like I sort of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation.

500|$|Bundy {{underwent}} multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and {{an authority}} on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but later changed her impression more than once. She also suggested {{the possibility of a}} multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy [...] "seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person... suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger." [...] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: [...] "He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality... that was the <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid of him.|$|E

And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E

He decided to officially become a Catholic when he saw Pope Benedict XVI, during the Pope's visit to the United States in 2008: [...] "Catching a glimpse of Pope Benedict that <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> struck by the happiness and peacefulness he exuded. The joyful and radiating presence of the Holy Father was a moment of confirmation about the many things I had been thinking and experiencing for several years."

When Da'Rel Scott was eight years old, his parents had a falling out, which prompted his father to leave the family.

500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking of what I was going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to say that I was hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on.

In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job".

Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled [...] "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American R group TLC; however, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and {{knew it was going}} to be a hit. [...] "We at Jive said, 'This is a fuckin' smash'," [...] revealed the label's A executive, Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line [...] "Hit Me" [...] would condone domestic violence, and later revised it to [...] "...Baby One More Time".
