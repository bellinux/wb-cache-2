25|$|The Last <b>Great</b> <b>Time</b> War pitted the Time Lords of Gallifrey {{against the}} Daleks of Skaro. The {{specific}} incident that sparked the conflict remains unclear, {{but according to}} executive producer Russell T Davies, the origins dated back to conflicts between the Doctor and the Daleks. In Genesis of the Daleks (1975), the Time Lords—having foreseen {{the possibility of the}} Daleks conquering the universe—send the Fourth Doctor into the past in an attempt to avert the Daleks' creation, affect their development to make them less aggressive or discover an inherent weakness they could exploit.|$|E
25|$|A new Latina group, called Soluna, {{had just}} lost a member and {{was looking for a}} replacement. T Lopez quickly auditioned, and was whisked away on tour. T Lopez {{explained}} that touring with Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias was a crazy roller coaster ride for her because everything happened so fast. But she had a <b>great</b> <b>time,</b> T Lopez said. Latina group Soluna released their 2002 debut album, For All Time, under the Dreamworks Records label. Paramount and UPN quickly took interest in the group and developed a TV pilot based on their lives, co-starring Mario Lopez & Tony Plana. After filming the pilot, Soluna reconvened for a second album but realized they had grown apart musically. The group said that they wanted it to work so bad that they were forcing it and they finally just gave up and wished each other well in their individual journeys.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a <b>great</b> <b>time</b> but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
