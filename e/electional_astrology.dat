25|$|<b>Electional</b> <b>astrology,</b> {{also known}} as event astrology, is a branch found in most traditions of astrology in which a {{practitioner}} decides the most appropriate time for an event based on the astrological auspiciousness of that time. It is distinct from horary astrology because, while horary astrologers seek to find {{the answer to a}} question based on the time the question was asked, electional astrologers seek to find a period of time which will result in the most preferable outcome for the event being planned.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{most famous}} for his work as an astrologer, {{towards the end of}} his life Morin {{completed}} Astrologia Gallica ("French Astrology"), a treatise which he did not live to see in print. The 26 books of intricate, complex, Latin text were published at the Hague in 1661 as one thick folio 850 pages long. The work covers natal, judicial, mundane, <b>electional</b> and meteorological <b>astrology,</b> and parts that are most concerned with astrological techniques (as compared to theological discussion on which they are based) have been translated or paraphrased into French, Spanish, German, and English.|$|R
50|$|Recently, in {{the late}} 20th century, some astrologers began to extend {{the use of the}} word katarche to interrogations or horary astrology, where a chart is cast for the moment that a {{question}} is posed to an astrologer. According to this modern interpretation there is a fluid connection between the notions of <b>electional</b> and horary <b>astrology.</b> This view, which is primarily advocated by Geoffrey Cornelius, is that the origins of the concept and core meaning of the term katarche lie in the ritual, sacrificial and divinitory connotations of the term, and that the later application of the term in the Hellenistic and Roman periods strictly to elections and inceptions were a result of some sort of decay in the understanding of the term.|$|R
25|$|There is {{scattered}} {{evidence to}} suggest that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made during this period, particularly in Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia). Two, from the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa (compiled in Babylon round 1700 BC) are reported to have been made during the reign of king Sargon of Akkad (2334-2279 BC). Another, showing an early use of <b>electional</b> <b>astrology,</b> is ascribed to the reign of the Sumerian ruler Gudea of Lagash (c. 2144 - 2124 BC). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple. However, controversy attends the question of whether they were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records that emerge from the first dynasty of Mesopotamia (1950-1651 BC).|$|E
500|$|Scattered {{evidence}} suggests that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made in the ancient world. The Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa thought to be compiled in Babylon around 1700 BCE. [...] A scroll documenting an early use of <b>electional</b> <b>astrology</b> is doubtfully ascribed to the reign of the Sumerian ruler Gudea of Lagash (c. 2144 – 2124 BCE). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple. However, there is controversy about whether these were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records of the first dynasty of Mesopotamia (1950–1651 BCE). This astrology had some parallels with Hellenistic Greek (western) astrology, including the zodiac, a norming point near 9 degrees in Aries, the trine aspect, planetary exaltations, and the dodekatemoria (the twelve divisions of 30 degrees each). The Babylonians viewed celestial events as possible signs rather than as causes of physical events.|$|E

50|$|Under {{the beliefs}} of <b>electional</b> <b>astrology,</b> Uttara Bhādrapadā is a Fixed constellation, meaning that while it is prominent, {{it is a good}} time to build houses, found {{communities}} or engage in other activities related to permance, stabiltiy and structure.|$|E

50|$|Pūrva Bhādrapadā (Devanagari: पूर्वभाद्र)(பூரட்டாதி)(పూర్వ భాద్రపద) is the twenty-fifth nakshatra in Hindu astrology, {{corresponding}} to α and β Pegasi.It is {{placed under the}} domain of Bṛhaspati, the deity represented by the planet Jupiter.

50|$|The {{houses in}} horary astrology charts {{mean the same}} as in the natal chart.

50|$|A planet {{can gain}} {{accidental}} dignity {{through a number}} of ways, but most often it is gained when the planet is found on an angle (Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, IC), being direct, swift in motion, free from combustion or being Cazimi, in a beneficial aspect to a fortunate planet or conjunct a fixed star of a fortunate nature. Essential and accidental dignity have particular importance in some branches of astrology, such as horary and <b>electional</b> <b>astrology.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The main {{application}} of the term [...] "katarche" [...] in the Hellenistic and Roman period was to the branch of astrology now called <b>electional</b> <b>astrology,</b> or the art of choosing an auspicious time to begin a venture or an enterprise. Also included in this practice were techniques for analyzing an astrological chart drawn up for the beginning moment of an event that had already taken place, in order to foretell the likely success of a venture, or the timing of its development.|$|E

50|$|Ashvini is {{ruled by}} Ketu, the {{descending}} lunar node. In <b>electional</b> <b>astrology,</b> Asvini {{is classified as}} a small constellation, meaning that it {{is believed to be}} advantageous to begin works of a precise or delicate nature while the moon is in Ashvini. Asvini is ruled by the Ashvins, the heavenly twins who served as physicians to the gods. Personified, Asvini is considered to be the wife of the Asvini Kumaras. Ashvini is represented either by the head of a horse, or by honey and the bee hive.|$|E

5000|$|In Hindu amanta {{calendar}} ( [...] {{ending with}} amavasya [...] ), {{second half of}} the month Bhadrapada is called Pitru Paksha: Pitripaksha or Shraddha paksha and its amavasya ( [...] new moon [...] ) is called sarvapitri amavasya. This part is considered inauspicious in muhurtshashtra (<b>electional</b> <b>astrology).</b> At this time (generally September) crops in India and Nepal are ready and the produce is offered as a mark of respect and gratitude (by way of pinda) first to the ancestors be they parents or forefathers before other festivals like Navaratri begin.|$|E
50|$|A Chart Ruler {{refers to}} the astrological {{planetary}} body that rules the zoidion (zodiac sign) of the ascendant in a given horoscope. For example, if a horoscope has Cancer rising on the ascendant, the Moon is the chart ruler. In Natal astrology, astrologers consider the house and sign placement of this planet to be of special importance in the shaping of a persons identity. In Mundane, Horary and <b>Electional</b> <b>astrology</b> the ruler of the ascendant {{might not be as}} important as the ruler of the house most involved with the question asked if it is different from things related to the ascendant.|$|E
