30|$|Stylometric <b>features,</b> {{or writing}} style <b>features,</b> are {{characteristics}} that help in comparing and distinguishing between two documents or bodies of text. Depending on the domain that authorship analysis is applied to, <b>features</b> are categorized in different ways. In {{the context of}} web content, text style <b>features,</b> HTML <b>features,</b> and content-specific <b>features</b> are often used [9],[13],[14]. Text style <b>features</b> generally include structural <b>features,</b> syntactic <b>features,</b> and lexical <b>features.</b> Structural <b>features</b> generally include <b>features</b> that describe the overall organization of a document or text. When referring to web content, structural <b>features</b> include the usage of HTML-encoded text, which includes the ability to format text with word bolding, italics, font coloring, font size, etc. [15]. Syntactic <b>features</b> refer to the sentence-level of a document, including patterns used for formulating sentences. This category often includes <b>features</b> such as punctuation usage, function and stop word usage, etc. Syntactic <b>features</b> {{have been found to}} be quite useful in many different studies analyzing web content [3],[4]. Lastly, lexical <b>features</b> are associated with word-level characteristics such as word frequency, vocabulary richness, frequency, word length distribution, etc. [13]. Lexical <b>features</b> are particularly important as they help establish content-specific differences among authors when conducting authorship analysis. Keywords relevant to different topics can be mapped to different authors when conducting analysis utilizing lexical <b>features.</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} {{assumed that the}} spatial meaning of between is only based on spatial <b>features</b> (geometrically definable {{cognitive}} representations; see, e. g. Johnston and Slobin, 1979). This chapter first considers how spatial <b>features</b> represent the meaning of between. It then considers a possible impact of visual functional <b>features</b> (visually perceived spatial <b>features,</b> like cartoon-like eyes, that invite a particular object categorization, such as ‘this is an animal’), linguistic functional <b>features</b> (lexical concepts inviting a particular categorization, as derived from ‘this is a thumb’), general functional <b>features</b> (<b>features</b> contributed by cognitive processes found across cognitive systems, like cognitive effort), and dynamic–kinematic <b>features</b> (<b>features</b> specifying actual or potential interactions between physical entities).

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{the use of}} Geometric Activity (GA) <b>features</b> for {{detecting}} man-made objects in urban areas using VHR satellite imagery. These <b>features</b> describe the geometric context of a pixel without the necessity of segmentation and can be integrated as extra bands in a per-pixel classification. Two main types of GA <b>features</b> were investigated: ridge <b>features</b> based on the well-known facet model and morphological <b>features</b> obtained by applying closing transforms with structuring elements of different size and shape. Our findings show {{a substantial increase in}} classification accuracy for the man-made object classes "roads and buildings with dark roof" after inclusion of GA <b>features.</b> Next to GA <b>features,</b> the use of object-based <b>features</b> derived from eCognition(R), containing both geometric and textural information, was also investigated for per-pixel classification. Accuracies obtained with object-based <b>features</b> are comparable to the accuracies obtained with GA <b>features.</b> The inclusion of both GA <b>features</b> and object-based <b>features</b> further improves the overall accuracy. GA <b>features</b> and object-based <b>features</b> thus contain complementary information...|$|R

Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the <b>feature)</b> joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} <b>feature</b> film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the <b>feature.</b> Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the <b>feature</b> had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E
