40|$|Sarcoidosis is a {{multisystemic}} granulomatous {{disease of}} unknown etiology that usually presents with bilateral hiliar adenopathies, pulmonary infiltrations, and ocular and cutaneous lesions.

40|$|Introduction: A {{contracted}} {{eye socket}} is a functional and cosmetic misfortune {{to the patient}}. It makes impossible to the patient to wear an eye prosthesis, but also becomes a source of chronic infection, discharge and irritation. There are several surgical techniques {{to deal with the}} postenucleation socket syndrome. Methods: Six consecutive patients with postenucleation socket syndrome underwent reconstruction of the anophthalmic socket. The cause for enucleation in 5 cases was related to trauma and a retinoblastoma in 1 case, all the cases presented to us several years after the enucleation and all the patients had difficulty or impossibility to wear the prosthesis. Results: All patients underwent surgery, which entailed scar tissue release, <b>oral</b> <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane</b> grafting and socket reconstruction. All patients who had surgery experienced significant improvement of socket contracture that enabled patients to wear a prosthesis again, improving significantly the quality of life. Conclusions: Surgical repair of the contracted socket using <b>oral</b> <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane</b> grafting can allow resumption of prosthesis wear.

40|$|While {{chronic wasting disease}} (CWD) prion transmission, entry, and {{trafficking}} remain incompletely elucidated, natural {{exposure of}} the <b>oral</b> and/or nasal <b>mucous</b> <b>membranes</b> seems certain. Cervids commonly sustain minor lesions on <b>oral</b> <b>mucous</b> <b>membranes</b> that could {{have an impact on}} susceptibility to prion infection. To explore this potential cofactor, we studied cohorts of cervid PrP transgenic mice with or without superficial abrasions on the lingual mucosa to determine whether minor oral mucosa lesions may enhance susceptibility to CWD infections.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative prion disease affecting deer, elk, and moose. The efficiency by which CWD spreads suggests that transmission occurs primar-ily by horizontal means (22 – 25).

40|$|Pemphigus vulgaris is a vesiculobullous {{disorder}} that predominantly involves the <b>oral</b> <b>mucous</b> <b>membrane</b> of the canine and human patients.

2500|$|Erosions, {{which involve}} the {{epithelial}} layer, are red in appearance since the underlying lamina propria shows through. When the full {{thickness of the}} epithelium is penetrated (ulceration), the lesion becomes covered with a fibrinous exudate and takes on a yellow-grey color. Because an ulcer is a breach of the normal lining, when seen in cross section, the lesion is a crater. A [...] "halo" [...] may be present, which is a reddening of the surrounding mucosa and is caused by inflammation. There may also be edema (swelling) around the ulcer. Chronic trauma may produce an ulcer with a keratotic (white, thickened mucosa) margin. Malignant lesions may ulcerate either because the tumor infiltrates the mucosa from adjacent tissues, or because the lesion originates within the mucosa itself, and the disorganized growth leads to {{a break in the}} normal architecture of the lining tissues. Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can be indicative of an immunodeficiency, signaling low levels of immunoglobulin in the <b>oral</b> <b>mucous</b> <b>membranes.</b> Chemotherapy, HIV, and mononucleosis are all causes of immunodeficiency/immunosuppression with which oral ulcers may become a common manifestation.
