25|$|Yapıcıoğlu {{committed}} {{his crimes}} apparently with little cause. In 1994, he stabbed three people to death {{after one of}} them wished <b>him</b> <b>good</b> morning. The 20-year-old Sait Korkmaz died at the scene. Yapıcıoğlu then tried to escape, hijacking a car and killing the driver, Rasim Aydın. Yapıcıoğlu was apprehended in Avcılar. He was placed in Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital, where he assaulted his roommates and the nurses, and set his ward on fire. He was released due a medical report attesting diminished responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Beatty had {{returned}} from leave after the Sudan campaign, but finding life in Ireland at the family home not to his taste, stayed instead with his brother at Newmarket, Suffolk. The location allowed <b>him</b> <b>good</b> hunting, and access to aristocratic houses where his recent heroic reputation from the campaign made him an honoured guest. Out hunting one day he chanced to meet Ethel Tree, daughter of Chicago department store founder Marshall Field. Beatty was immediately taken with her, for her good looks and her ability to hunt. The immediate difficulty with the match was that Ethel was married already to Arthur Tree, with a son, Ronald Tree.|$|E

They visit the record store, but Summer is distracted, appears to have lost {{interest}} in Tom, and kisses <b>him</b> <b>good</b> night. Tom tempts her with an offer of pancakes at a diner, where Summer casually announces that the relationship hasn't been working and breaks up with Tom while they are waiting for the food to arrive. Summer wants them to remain friends, but Tom is devastated.|$|E
25|$|King James IV rewarded clerics {{who gave}} <b>him</b> <b>good</b> service by {{providing}} them with commendatorships. The first commendator of Dryburgh Abbey was Andrew Forman, the Bishop of Moray in 1509. Forman’s primary role was {{in the service of}} James IV as a diplomat and was employed by the king extensively in Europe but accumulated much wealth from his religious and other appointments. He received the commendatorships of the abbey of Culross in 1492 although he stepped down the following year after being provided with a large pension from the abbey. In June 1497 he was prior of Pittenweem, received the rectory of Cottingham from King Henry VII of England in May 1501, was commendator of Kelso (although he was unable to firmly establish his provision), as well as the Keeper of Darnaway Castle, Chamberlain of Moray and Custumar North of the Spey in 1511.|$|E

This brings <b>him</b> <b>good</b> prospects of a space advantage that {{may serve as a}} basis for a future attack on the kingside. However, the extended pawn centre has its drawbacks, as Lalic explains: [...] "White must invest some valuable tempi in protecting his pawn structure, which allows Black to seize the best squares for his minor pieces with excellent prospects for counterplay against the white centre." ...|$|E

In late 1913, Olga {{fell in love with}} Pavel Voronov, a junior officer on the imperial yacht Standart, but such a relationship would have been impossible due to their differing ranks. Voronov was engaged a few months later to one of the ladies in waiting. [...] "God grant <b>him</b> <b>good</b> fortune, my beloved", a saddened Olga wrote on his wedding day, [...] "It's sad, distressing."

[...] Subsequently, the Vanaland folk suspected they had been cheated in the exchange by the Asaland folk, so they seized Mímir and beheaded him and sent the head to Asaland. Óðinn took the head of Mímir, embalmed it with herbs {{so that it would}} not rot, and spoke charms over it, which gave it the power to speak to him and reveal to him secrets.|$|E

His mildly corrupt tenure there gave <b>him</b> <b>good</b> contacts with the police. These would soon come in handy for smoothing over certain problems of a young and unlicensed theater troupe when Rosenberg and Spivakofsky returned from Romania, penniless because {{the end of the war}} had meant the collapse of Yiddish theater in the provinces, and ready to start a troupe in Odessa.|$|E
500|$|The {{engagement}} was {{not without}} controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who {{had served in the}} Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links. Marion Crawford wrote, [...] "Some of the King's advisors did not think <b>him</b> <b>good</b> enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin." [...] Later biographies reported that Elizabeth's mother initially opposed the union, dubbing Philip [...] "The Hun". In later life, however, the Queen Mother told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was [...] "an English gentleman".|$|E
500|$|According to Anonymus, Gelou [...] "was not steadfast and did {{not have}} around <b>him</b> <b>good</b> warriors". The Vlachs and Slavs of Transylvania were [...] "the basest of the whole world" [...] because [...] "they had nothing else for arms than bows and arrows"; Transylvanian {{weakness}} was the result of frequent raids by [...] "the Cumans and Pechenegs". According to Ioan Aurel Pop, Anonymus' description of Gelou's subjects indicates a sedentary people called to arms. Carlile Aylmer Macartney writes that the Blasii and Picenati words for Vlachs and Pechenegs and the reference to their [...] "bows and arrows" [...] suggest that Anonymus borrowed the text from a work describing the route of the Third or Fourth Crusade across the Balkans; the late-12th-century Historia de expeditione Friderici imperatoris refers to Vlachs and Cumanians and their bows and arrows. Based on Anonymus's narrative, Sălăgean says that Gelou's polity was small compared with the other five mentioned in the Gesta Hungarorum.|$|E

She lashes out by having the glee club's flight to Nationals in New York City rerouted so it has a layover in war-ravaged Tripoli [...] and kicks Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) off the Cheerios. Sue allows Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) and Kurt to plan Jean's funeral and help her sort through Jean's {{personal}} belongings, and agrees to have the glee club to perform at the funeral, as she believes no one will attend otherwise. While going through Jean's belongings, Finn and Kurt discover that her favorite movie was Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, and arrange a funeral inspired by the film. At the funeral, an emotional Sue is unable to continue reading her eulogy after a few sentences, and Will reads the remainder for her. The glee club then sings [...] "Pure Imagination", the theme song of the film. Touched by Will's support, Sue later tells him that he is a good friend and he has what Jean had and she does not: a pure heart. She says that she will no longer attempt to destroy the glee club, and announces that she is planning to run for the United States House of Representatives. For the first time, she wishes <b>him</b> <b>good</b> luck. Sue also apologizes to Becky, reinstates her {{as a member of the}} Cheerios, and tells her she will be captain of the squad in the fall. Sue asks for and receives a hug from Becky.|$|E
