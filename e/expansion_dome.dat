40|$|To lower NO(x) {{emissions}} from gas-turbine engines {{the effect of}} dome design and operational changes on the mixing quality in the fuel-rich region is studied. A statistical analysis is employed to establish the parametric sensitivity in this complex flow. A mixing-effectiveness index is defined and used to optimize the gas-species uniformity {{and the extent of}} reaction at the exit plane of the dome. Mixing effectiveness is tied to the fuel and air injection locations, the macroscale structure of the dome aerodynamics, and the level of turbulence. Increases in nozzle/air to fuel ratio, reference velocities, and the <b>dome</b> <b>expansion</b> angle increased the level of turbulence. The optimum configuration featured counter-swirling fuel and air streams and produced a strong torroidal recirculation zone, an effective spray angle of 45 degrees, and azimuthal velocities that decayed to zero inside of two duct diameters.

40|$|A model {{laboratory}} reactor is presented and characterized {{for the study}} of spray-fired combustion in a swirl-stabilized, complex, three-dimensional flow representative of a gas turbine combustor. The reactor features optical access for non-intrusive diagnostics, and clean boundary conditions for modeling. The aerodynamic and thermal fields are characterized using laser anemometry and a thermocouple probe respectively. The droplet size and droplet velocity fields are resolved using phase Doppler interferometry. The performance of the reactor is found to be representative of a practical combustor with a well defined dome region primary zone, a secondary zone between the two rows of wall jets in which reaction persists, and a relatively well-mixed and cool dilution zone. A parametric study of the dome geometry indicates that the structure of the dome region recirculation is relatively insensitive to a change from a step to a 45 ° divergent <b>dome</b> <b>expansion.</b> A parametric study of the dome swirl, primary jet, and dilution jet flows shows that the primary air provides closure to the dome recirculation and enhances the turbulent mixing. The reactor is attractive for studies of turbulent mixing, fuel effects, and spray dynamics in this class of flows. © 1997 Combustion Institute...|$|R
40|$|We present first {{observations}} of a dome-shaped large-scale EUV coronal wave, {{recorded by the}} EUVI instrument onboard STEREO-B on January 17, 2010. The main arguments that the observed structure is the wave dome (and not the CME) are: a) the spherical form and sharpness of the dome's outer edge and the erupting CME loops observed inside the dome; b) the low-coronal wave signatures above the limb perfectly connecting to the on-disk signatures of the wave; c) the lateral extent of the expanding dome which is much larger {{than that of the}} coronal dimming; d) the associated high-frequency type II burst indicating shock formation low in the corona. The velocity of the upward expansion of the wave dome (v ∼ 650 km s^- 1) is larger than that of the lateral expansion of the wave (v ∼ 280 km s^- 1), indicating that the upward <b>dome</b> <b>expansion</b> is driven all the time, and thus depends on the CME speed, whereas in the lateral direction it is freely propagating after the CME lateral expansion stops. We also examine the evolution of the perturbation characteristics: First the perturbation profile steepens and the amplitude increases. Thereafter, the amplitude decreases with r^- 2. 5 ± 0. 3, the width broadens, and the integral below the perturbation remains constant. Our findings are consistent with the spherical expansion and decay of a weakly shocked fast-mode MHD wave. Comment: Astrophysical Journal Letters, in pres...|$|R
40|$|Tonnages {{and grades}} of volcanogenic massive {{sulphide}} deposits of the Kuroko Province {{are low in}} comparison to Tasmanian ores. The deposits are richer in copper and contain {{a greater proportion of}} stockwork/stringer ores. Mineralisation is related to back-arc rifting in a mature island-arc setting. Footwall rocks are dominantly felsic and calc-alkaline in contrast to bimodal high-alumina hangingwall volcanics. Bimodal volcanism is a product of rifting and graben fill. Pelagic mudstones and foraminifera indicate a water depth in excess of 2000 m post-rifting and syn-mineralisation. Massive sulphide deposits are believed related to caldera collapse in well defined basins or Districts. Linear arrangement of ore bodies indicate a structural control during deposition. Mineralisation is spatially related to domal dacite intrusives. Post-mineralisation <b>dome</b> <b>expansion</b> produced penecontemporaneous deformation of the Kuroko ores. Individual ore deposits are small but tend to form clusters of average 1. 5 x 3. 0 km size. Ores show a marked zonation from ferruginous cherts (Tetsusekiei), baryte ore, black ore (Kuroko), yellow ore (Oko), gypsum ore (Sekkoko) and siliceous ore (Keiko). The proportion of the various ore types differs from deposit to deposit, between Districts and with hydrothermal fluid temperature. Bottom current reworking of stratabound massive sulphide produced clastic textures. Syn-sedimentary folding and irregular ore clast compaction structures indicate the ore was plastic during deposit formation. Hydrothermal breccias and dykes cross-cut massive sulphide. Both pipe-like and blanket stringer zones underlie the stratabound ores...|$|R
40|$|Many {{modifications}} to the combustion process are being proposed and evaluated to lower NOr emissions from gas turbine engines in both stationary and propulsion applications. A promising technique is staged combustion, wherein the fuel is mixed into a fuel-rich region and the final air is injected downstream to an overall lean mixture. This article examines the effect of dome design and operational changes on the mixing quality in the fuel-rich region. A statistical analysis is employed to establish the parametric sensitivity in this complex flow. A mixing effectiveness index is defined and used to optimize the gas species uniformity {{and the extent of}} reaction at the exit plane of the dome. The results reveal that mixing effectiveness is intimately tied to the fuel and air injection locations, the macroscale structure of the dome aerodynamics, and the level of turbulence. Increases in nozzle/air to fuel ratio, reference velocities, and the <b>dome</b> <b>expansion</b> angle increased the level of turbulence. The optimum configuration featured counterswirling fuel and airstreams and produced a strong torroidal recirculation zone, an effective spray angle of 45 deg, and azimuthal velocities that decayed to zero inside of two duct diameters. Due to the intimate relationship between variables, the response of mixing to changes in any single variable cannot be considered independently of the other variables. The results underscore the system specific nature of mixing optimization. © 1993 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Luton, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The transport and emplacement mechanisms of the highly energetic pyroclastic density current (PDC) generated in the blast style eruption of Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, on 26 December 1997 are examined through detailed lithological mapping and sedimentological analysis of the deposits. The PDC formed deposits which range in grain size from coarse breccias to fine ash, with distinctive bipartite layering and well-developed grading and stratification. On a large scale the PDC was highly erosive, sculpting large bedforms and depositing relatively thin deposits. However, locally, centimetre scale topographic protuberances were responsible for significant variations in deposit thickness, grain size, {{and the development of}} dune bedforms. The strong lateral and vertical lithofacies variations are attributed to well-developed density stratification, which formed during explosive <b>expansion</b> of the <b>dome</b> prior to PDC formation. Experimental modelling of stratified inertial gravity currents was carried out to investigate the effects of density stratification prior to release of the current. The degree of stratification governs the rate of mixing in the current, which in turn influences the velocity. Well·stratified currents initially move faster than homogenous currents but are slower in the latter stages of current propagation. The results have important implications for deposition from particle-laden flows, which may become stratified with coarser material concentrated {{at the base of the}} current. The role of PDCs jn the formation of unit US 2 -B, emplaced during the Upper Scoriae 2 eruption (79 ± 8 ka) on Santorini, Greece, was investigated through sedimentological analysis and mapping. Proximally, the unit exhibits features characteristic of emplacement from a flow, such as thickening into palaeochannels and erosive basal contacts. Distally, the unit is of uniform thickness and grain size parameters suggest the deposit is more characteristic of exnplacement from a fallout mechanism. Discrete lenses of fine-grained material within US 2 -B, and a gradational upper contact with PDC deposits suggest that there may have been contemporaneous deposition resulting the development of a hybrid deposit...|$|R
40|$|New {{mathematical}} {{approaches for}} the relaxation and emplacement of viscous lava domes are presented {{and applied to}} steep-sided domes on Venus. A similarity solution approach {{is applied to the}} governing equation for fluid flow in a cylindrical geometry for two distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, dome relaxation is explored assuming a constant volume of fluid (i. e. lava) has been rapidly emplaced onto the surface. Cooling of lava is represented by a time-variable viscosity and singularities inherent in previous models for dome relaxation have been eliminated. At the onset of relaxation, bulk dynamic viscosities lie in the range between 10 (exp 10) - 10 (exp 16) Pa s, consistent with basaltic-andesite to rhyolitic compositions. Plausible relaxation times range from 5 to 5000 years, depending on initial lava viscosity. The first scenario, however, is only valid during the final stages of dome relaxation and does not consider the time taken for lava to be extruded onto the surface. In the second scenario, emplacement and growth of a steep-sided dome is considered when the volume of lava on the surface increases over time (i. e. time-variable volume approach). The volumetric flow rate may depend on an arbitrary power of the dome thickness, thus embracing Newtonian as well as other rheologies for describing terrestrial and planetary mass flows. The approach can be used to distinguish between basic flow rate models for fluid emplacement. The formalism results in radial <b>expansion</b> of a <b>dome</b> proportional to t(sup 1 / 2), consistent with the diffusive nature of the governing equation. The flow at the front is shown to thicken as the front advances for a constant rate of lava supply. Emplacement times are intimately correlated with the bulk rheology. Comparison of the theoretical profiles with the shape of a typical dome on Venus indicates that a Newtonian bulk rheology is most appropriate, consistent with prior studies. However, results here suggest a bulk dynamic viscosity of 10 (exp 12) - 10 (exp 13) Pa s and emplacement times of approximately 2 - 16 years. Both scenarios investigated give emplacement times significantly less than prior estimates and compositions consistent with basaltic andesite...|$|R
40|$|Subduction zone {{volcanism}} occurs due to partial melting from subducting slabs, {{which generally}} results in high-viscosity magma containing {{a large amount}} of volatiles. Such volcanic eruptions can form a lava dome, from which collapse events are a common and important part of their evolution. Collapse events can have devastating consequences; in the form of block and ash avalanche deposits, pyroclastic ﬂows, surges and the generation of tsunamis if they enter the sea. In addition to this, once a mass of lava dome has been removed during a collapse event, this results in a drop in pressure in the remaining volatile-rich magma, which may then erupt explosively. The internal structure of a lava dome and the extent of the surrounding carapace/talus is unknown, but likely to be critical for hazard assessment, and is the motivation for this research. Presented is a computational model for the growth and evolution of an endogenous lava dome, including an independently deformable talus, using the Finite Element Method. Dome growth is modelled to occur under two time-scales: continuous <b>dome</b> <b>expansion</b> via the addition of new magma into the molten core interior, and relatively instantaneous talus readjustments due to rockfalls and the disintegration of the solid surface. The continuous deformation of the dome is modelled as a ﬂuid with a yield strength in the talus region. While talus deformation is modelled as a granular material that rests at angles below its angle of repose. Both surfaces, dome and core/talus interface, are displaced using the level-set method. The model is axi-symmetric and assumes that solidiﬁcation, and therefore talus growth, occurs due to gas exsolution which promotes crystallisation, rather than from surface cooling, appropriate for intermediate composition lava ﬂows. For {{the purpose of this paper}} we consider and apply the model to the Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, but the techniques used are generic, allowing the model to be applied to other dome forming eruptions. The model provides information on the shape of the dome, with the growth and extent of the talus and core found to be predominantly governed by the lava extrusion rate, degree of solidiﬁcation (i. e. a solidus pressure), the friction angle associated with the talus, and lava dome viscosity...|$|R
