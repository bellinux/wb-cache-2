5|$|Among Beshear's other {{activities}} as lieutenant governor was his participation <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>investigation</b> of Kentucky Utilities' coal-buying practices. At issue was {{whether it was}} legal and ethical for the company's coal buyer to accept gifts and other perks from coal suppliers. Beshear had clashed with the company over similar issues during his term as attorney general. The company attempted to block Beshear's participation in the investigation, but the Kentucky Public Service Commission rejected the attempt. Due {{to the length of}} the investigation and the number of appeals filed, the matter was not fully adjudicated until 1992, well past the end of Beshear's term. The Kentucky Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kentucky Utilities.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by a friend, {{she went}} to Paris to become a writer but had little success. While in Paris Eberhardt met the widow of Marquis de Morès. Although deMorès was {{reportedly}} murdered by Tuareg tribesmen in the Sahara, {{no one had been}} arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt was familiar with the area where deMorès died, she hired her to investigate his murder. The job benefited Eberhardt, who was destitute and longed to return to the Sahara. She returned to Algeria in July 1900, settling in El Oued. According to Sahara expert R. V. C. Bodley, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate deMorès' death; Bodley considered this due to a combination of the unwillingness of the French to co-operate <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>investigation</b> and Eberhardt's fatalism rather than deliberate dishonesty. Word eventually got back to the deMorès widow about Eberhardt's lackluster investigation, and she subsequently cut off her funding.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Brady {{allegedly}} {{confessed to}} Fred Harrison, a journalist working for The Sunday People, {{that he had}} also {{been responsible for the}} murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, something that the police already suspected, as both children lived in the same area as Brady and Hindley and had disappeared {{at about the same time}} as their other victims.

5|$|In mid-1946, McAloney was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>investigation</b> {{into a series}} of engine failures experienced by RAAF aircraft.

He returned to his duties at the Directorate of Technical Services on the investigation's conclusion. Made squadron leader in March 1950, he attended a land/air warfare course the following year. McAloney was posted to Singapore in June 1952 as the technical officer to the Changi-based No.90 (Composite) Wing, formed specifically for service in the Malayan Emergency. The attachment proved short lived with the disbandment of No.90 Wing in December, at which point McAloney transferred to No.1 Squadron, then operating out of Tengah.|$|E
