5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the number two position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State <b>Department</b> <b>as</b> a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|As {{few other}} {{persons in the}} Confederate {{government}} were interested in naval matters, Mallory had almost free rein to shape the <b>department,</b> <b>as</b> well as the navy it controlled, according to his own views. The result was very much the product of his prior experience. The Department of the Navy was organized into separate offices, equivalent to the bureau system of the United States Navy; whereas the U.S. Navy had five bureaus, the Confederate Navy had only four: Orders and Detail (dealing with personnel), Provisions and Clothing, Medicine and Surgery, and Ordnance and Hydrography. Although there was no Office of Construction and Repair, its function was met by John L. Porter. Porter served as Chief Naval Constructor, without title from the start until the position was officially established in 1863, and thereafter with title {{until the end of}} the war. A few other functions lay outside the bureau system: a small Marine Corps, a few men who were sent to Europe to acquire vessels there and who reported directly to Mallory, and a Torpedo Bureau.|$|E
