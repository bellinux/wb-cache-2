500|$|The black comedy-drama Birdman, from {{director}} Alejandro González Iñárritu, was Stone's final film {{release in}} 2014. Co-starring Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, the film features {{her in the}} role of Sam Thomson, the recovering-addict daughter of actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton), who becomes his assistant. Iñárritu created the character based on his experience with his daughter. Birdman was critically acclaimed, and was the most successful film at the 87th Academy Awards; it was nominated for nine awards, winning four, including Best Picture. The Movie Network considered it one of Stone's best performances to date and Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph was impressed with a monologue she delivers, which he thought was [...] "like a <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> to the gut". She received numerous accolades for her portrayal, including nominations for an Academy, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild, and a Critics' Choice Movie award for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E

NGC3003, a SBbc barred spiral galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 12.3 and an angular size of 5.8arcminutes, is seen almost edge-on. NGC 3344, 25million light-years distant, is face-on towards Earth. Measuring 7.1 by 6.5arcminutes in size, it has an apparent magnitude of 10.45. [...] NGC3504 is a starburst barred spiral galaxy of apparent magnitude11.67 and measuring 2.1by 2.7arcminutes. It has hosted supernovae in 1998 and 2001. It and the spiral galaxy NGC3486 are also almost face-on towards Earth; the latter is of magnitude11.05 and measures 7.1by 5.2arcminutes. NGC2859 is an SB0-type lenticular galaxy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} on-needle row counters seem to {{have appeared}} in the UK between 1920 and 1939, when complicated printed patterns increased in popularity among the working population. [...] In the 1920s a [...] grey-brown enamelled unit was manufactured with two rotary dials on the front showing tens and units, and slots on the back for sliding onto a <b>knitting</b> <b>needle.</b> [...] The front was flat and shaped like a figure-8, but was heavier than the back so that the unit hung downward from the needle, making the numbered face difficult to read. A similar bakelite unit was manufactured by Abel Morrell for sale in the US in the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{knitting}} needles (also called [...] "knitting pins"). [...] The {{first and most}} common type consists of two slender, straight sticks tapered to a point at one end, and with a knob {{at the other end}} to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are usually [...] long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. [...] The most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25mm (roughly 1inch). The diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge/tension of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric. [...] Thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting. [...] Although the diameter of the <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan; a conversion table is given at <b>knitting</b> <b>needle.</b> [...] Such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic. [...] Different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches. [...] The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends. [...] Needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>{{knitting}}</b> <b>needle</b> or knitting pin {{is a tool}} in hand-knitting {{to produce}} knitted fabrics. [...] They generally have a long shaft and taper at their end, {{but they are not}} nearly as sharp as sewing needles. [...] Their purpose is two-fold. [...] The long shaft holds the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, to prevent them from unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to form new stitches. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place. [...] In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously.|$|E

2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale. To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> or frame in hand-knitting.|$|E
2500|$|The size of {{a needle}} is {{described}} first by its diameter and secondly by its length. [...] The size of the new stitch is determined {{in large part by}} the diameter of the <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> used to form it, because that affects the length of the yarn-loop drawn through the previous stitch. [...] Thus, large stitches can be made with large needles, whereas fine knitting requires fine needles. In most cases, the knitting needles being used in hand-knitting are of the same diameter; however, in uneven knitting, needles of different sizes may be used. Larger stitches may also be made by wrapping the yarn more than once around the needles with every stitch. The length of a needle determines how many stitches it can hold at once; for example, very large projects such as a shawl with hundreds of stitches might require a longer needle than a small project such as a scarf or bootie. [...] Various sizing systems for needles are in common use.|$|E
2500|$|In Britain in the 1950s {{when the}} baby boom years {{following}} World War II caused an increased requirement for hand-knitting, I.X. Products produced a brightly coloured and marketable plastic row counter with patent number 424432. This was a barrel-shaped counter which sat in stable fashion on the <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> by {{the aid of a}} central metal spring. The assemblage consisted of a double rotating inner barrel and an outer fixed and slotted skin which was pinned to the central spring. [...] The two separately rotating halves of the inner barrel were printed with numbers, and the outer slotted skin rotated over the barrels, revealing a single ten and a single unit at one time. Precise engineering ensured that there was just enough ease of movement for the turning of the barrels, but just enough friction to prevent movement of the barrels while vigorous knitting continued. However the introduction in the late 1950s of double knitting yarn and the consequent popular use of thicker needles tended to damage the springs which were intended for needles of a maximum thickness of 3.25mm. [...] This design and most of the barrel-shaped on-needle counters which followed it had a white or cream central barrel and a decoratively coloured outer skin.|$|E

2500|$|The American Society for Psychical Research wanted further investigation. In 1926, a {{committee}} of three professors (Knight Dunlap, Henry C. McComas and Robert Williams Wood) was sent to Boston. Crandon had a luminous star attached to her forehead, identifying the location of {{her face in the}} dark. After a few minutes, a narrow dark rod appeared over a luminous checkerboard which had been placed on the table opposite Crandon. It moved from side to side and picked up an object. As it passed in front of Wood he lightly touched it with the tip of his finger and followed it back to a point very near Crandon's mouth. Wood thought it probable she was holding the rod by her teeth. He took hold of the tip and very quietly pinched it. It felt like a <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> covered with one or two layers of soft leather. Though the committee had been warned that touching the ectoplasm could result in the illness or death of the medium, neither Crandon nor the [...] "ectoplasm" [...] rod showed any reaction to Wood's actions.
