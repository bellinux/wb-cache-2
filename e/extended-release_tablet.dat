40|$|Abstract: In this study, we {{examined}} a possible {{use of a}} surface-deacetylated chitin nano-fiber (SDCH-NF) and hyaluronic acid (HA) interpolymer complex (IPC) tablet as a potential antioxidative compound in extended-release matrix tablets. The antioxidant properties of untreated chitin (UCH), SDCH-NF, and HA were examined using N-centered radicals derived from 1, 1 ′-diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 ′-azinobis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS). SDCH-NF and HA had acceptable scavenging abilities and were relatively efficient radical scavengers, but UCH was much less effective.

Hydromorphone is an opioid analgesic that is routinely {{used instead of}} morphine for cancer pain; however, {{it is not yet}} available in Japan. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy and safety of hydromorphone (DS- 7113 b) <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablets</b> in opioid-naïve patients with cancer pain not relieved by non-opioid analgesics. Subjects and methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. A double-dummy method was used for blinding. Each randomized subject received either hydromorphone <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablets</b> plus placebo oxycodone hydrochloride <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablets</b> 4 mg/day (n= 88) or placebo hydromorphone <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablets</b> plus oxycodone hydrochloride <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablets</b> 10 mg/day (n= 93) orally for 7 days (once-daily dosing for hydromorphone and twice-daily dosing for oxycodone). The doses were adjusted as necessary. Efficacy was evaluated by change in visual analog scale (VAS) score from baseline to completion of treatment. Results: The between-group difference in least squares mean changes in VAS score from baseline to completion or discontinuation of treatment was − 0. 4 mm (95 % CI − 5. 9 to 5 mm) by analysis of covariance where the baseline VAS score was used as a covariate. The upper limit of the 95 % CI was below 10 mm, which was predefined as the noninferiority limit. This verified the noninferiority of hydromorphone tablets relative to oxycodone tablets. The incidence of adverse events was 80. 7 % (71 of 88) in the hydromorphone group and 83. 7 % (77 of 93) in the oxycodone group. The most common adverse events were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, and constipation, most of which are commonly observed with opioid analgesics.

40|$|Paliperidone <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablet</b> (paliperidone ER; INVEGA™) is an oral {{antipsychotic}} for {{the treatment}} of schizophrenia. The recommended dose range is 3 – 12 mg per day. Paliperidone ER utilizes the OROS® delivery system, which allows for once-daily dosing. Its pharmacokinetic profile results in a more stable serum concentration. Paliperidone is 9 -hydroxyrisperidone, the chief active metabolite of risperidone. It undergoes limited hepatic metabolism, thereby minimizing the risks of hepatic drug–drug and drug–disease interactions. Three 6 -week trials in patients with acute schizophrenia reported that paliperidone ER was effective, well tolerated, and produced clinically meaningful improvements in personal and social functioning compared with placebo. Post-hoc analysis of these trials in various populations, including recently diagnosed, elderly and more severely ill patients, those with sleep disturbances and those with predominant negative symptoms demonstrated improvement as well. Paliperidone ER was also significantly better than placebo in the prevention of symptom recurrence in a 6 -month maintenance study.

40|$|Background: Paliperidone <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablet</b> (paliperidone ER) is an oral psychotropic agent {{developed}} for schizophrenia treatment. Paliperidone (9 -OH-risperidone, metabolite of risperidone), when used with OROS technology {{has a unique}} pharmacokinetic profile undergoing limited hepatic metabolism. Methods: The efficacy and safety of once-daily paliperidone ER (3  mg, 9  mg and 15  mg) were compared with placebo in 618 patients with acute schizophrenia in a 6 -week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. An assay sensitivity group with known efficacy was included to confirm trial validity (olanzapine 10  mg). Results: All doses of paliperidone ER demonstrated significant improvements in PANSS total and PANSS factors scores (p < 0. 05) and in personal and social functioning (p < 0. 001) compared with placebo. Symptom improvement has been observed at the first observation assessment (Day 4) (p < 0. 001) compared with placebo, suggesting a rapid onset of action for paliperidone ER. Paliperidone ER {{was associated with a}} low incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. The incidence of movement disorder-related adverse events and rating scale scores were similar in the paliperidone ER 3  mg and placebo groups and increased with dose. Increases in prolactin plasma levels and dose-related increases in body weight (< 2  kg) were observed; there were no significant changes in serum lipid or glucose levels. Conclusion: In this study, all doses of paliperidone ER were effective in significantly improving the symptoms of schizophrenia and personal and social functioning and were generally well tolerated. As such, paliperidone ER may provide a valuable new treatment option for patients with schizophrenia. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|E

Penetration into {{the central nervous system}} is relatively modest, with cerebrospinal fluid levels normally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. The serum half-life of ciprofloxacin is about 4-6 hours, with 50-70% of an administered dose being excreted in the urine as unmetabolized drug. An additional 10% is excreted in urine as metabolites. Urinary excretion is virtually complete 24 hours after administration. Dose adjustment is required in the elderly and in those with renal impairment.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present the two one-sided test (TOST) as an {{alternative}} approach to compare dissolution profiles of extended-release dosage forms. The dissolution profiles of oxycodone <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablets</b> containing 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg (reference and generic) were evaluated {{according to the requirements}} described in United States Pharmacopeia. These dissolution profiles were compared using the conventional similarity factor (f 2) and the proposed TOST as an equivalence test. TOST is a simple and alternative approach to compare dissolution profiles of extended-release dosage forms. It allows us to identify the time-point (or time-points) that did not show similarity. We concluded that the two one-sided test performed at a significance level of 5 % and defined as D = 10 showed results comparable to those obtained by the conventional similarity factor (f 2) ...|$|R
40|$|Norio Yasui-Furukori, Kojiro Hashimoto, Kazutoshi Kubo, Tetsu Tomita Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan Abstract: Until {{now there}} has been no {{information}} available on drug interaction between paliperidone and TS- 1 &reg;, an oral anticancer drug containing a 5 -fluorouracil derivative. The patient in the case presented here was a 39 -year-old man with a 15 -year history of schizophrenia. The patient&# 39;s usual treatment of 2 mg/day of risperidone was changed to 3 mg/day of paliperidone extended release. He experienced worsening psychotic symptoms after switching from risperidone to paliperidone while he was also receiving TS- 1. Retrospective analyses showed plasma concentration of paliperidone was consistently lower during the treatment with TS- 1 than without TS- 1. This case suggests there is drug interaction between paliperidone <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablets</b> and TS- 1.

2500|$|MS Contin tablets {{are known}} as misties, and the 100mg <b>extended-release</b> <b>tablets</b> as greys and blockbusters. The [...] "speedball" [...] can use {{morphine}} as the opioid component, which is combined with cocaine, amphetamines, methylphenidate, or similar drugs. [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] {{is a combination of}} morphine with the antihistamine tripelennamine (Pyrabenzamine, PBZ, Pelamine) taken by injection, or less commonly the mixture when swallowed or used as a retention enema; the name is also known to refer to a combination of tripelennamine and dihydrocodeine or codeine tablets or syrups taken by mouth. [...] "Morphia" [...] is an older official term for morphine also used as a slang term. [...] "Driving Miss Emma" [...] is intravenous administration of morphine. Multi-purpose tablets (readily soluble hypodermic tablets that can also be swallowed or dissolved under the tongue or betwixt the cheek and jaw) are known, as are some brands of hydromorphone, as Shake & Bake or Shake & Shoot.|$|R
