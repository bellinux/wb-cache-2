5|$|On August 25, 2016, {{a similar}} {{phenomenon}} was reported for another stellar object: EPIC 204278916, a young M-type pre-main-sequence star with a resolved disk. Dimmings {{of up to}} 65% for 25 consecutive days (out of 79 total observation) were observed. The variability is highly periodic and attributed to stellar rotation. The researchers <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> the irregular dimmings are caused by either a warped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular or eccentric orbits.|$|E

30|$|We <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that,</b> in ARDS patients, LUS {{could detect}} changes in {{regional}} inflation during prone position compared to supine position and over time. We also <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> such changes correlate with commonly monitored parameters of aeration, oxygenation and ventilation, {{as measured by}} arterial blood gas analysis and respiratory mechanics. Finally, we <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> specific LUS aeration patterns, identified immediately before and after prone position initiation, are predictive of clinical response to this adjunctive treatment.|$|R
30|$|We <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> {{critical}} illness elevates FGF 21 serum concentrations, possibly {{induced by}} mitochondrial damage and {{brought about by}} ISR mediators. We also <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> targeting normoglycemia during critical illness suppresses FGF 21 serum concentrations and fgf 21 liver expression, possibly by diminishing mitochondrial damage in vital organs.|$|R
5|$|Part of the Kingston Peak resembles {{glacial till}} by being poorly sorted {{and other parts}} have large boulder-sized dropstones resting in a {{fine-grained}} matrix of sandstone and siltstone. Similar deposits are found over North America during the same period, some 700 to 800 mya. Geologists therefore <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> the world {{at that time was}} affected by a very severe glaciation, perhaps the most severe in geologic history (see Snowball Earth). The youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are from basaltic lava flows.|$|E
5|$|Researchers <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> {{using an}} AAC device {{relieves}} {{the pressure of}} having to speak, allowing the individual to focus on communication, and that the reduction in psychological stress makes speech production easier.

5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very quickly in the lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E

5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory <b>hypothesizes</b> <b>that</b> {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which <b>hypothesizes</b> <b>that</b> autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others, or hyper-systemizing, which <b>hypothesizes</b> <b>that</b> autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|R
30|$|Intuitively, {{there should}} be a {{relationship}} between spirometric PIFR and Diskus™ PIFR. This relationship has not been explored in the prior research. In this study, we <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> there is a linear relationship between spirometric PIFR and Diskus™ PIFR. We also <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> the mean spirometric and Diskus™ PIFR from a group of patients with COPD or Neuromuscular disease would be significantly lower than healthy volunteers or patients with asthma. Finally, we <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> the mean spirometric and Diskus™ IVC from patients with Asthma, COPD and Neuromuscular Disease would be lower than healthy subjects or patients with non-respiratory disorders.|$|R
5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} bird-like {{anatomy and}} close relationship to other dromaeosaurids, paleontologists <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> Deinonychus was probably covered in feathers. Clear fossil evidence of modern avian-style feathers exists for several related dromaeosaurids, including Velociraptor and Microraptor, though no direct evidence is yet known for Deinonychus itself. When conducting studies of {{such areas as}} the range of motion in the forelimbs, paleontologists like Phil Senter have taken the likely presence of wing feathers (as present in all known dromaeosaurs with skin impressions) into consideration.|$|E
5|$|Durio {{is often}} {{included}} in Bombacaceae {{because of the}} presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should actually be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).|$|E
5|$|From {{its origins}} to {{approximately}} {{the area of}} Sanford, the St. Johns flows north. It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles—which {{is referred to as}} the St. Johns River offset, but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset. Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by Pangaean rifting.|$|E

It was <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> greater understanding, feelings of being understood, and realization of understanding {{would be associated with}} greater self-disclosure, use of more direct person control strategies, and use of less attention control strategies. It was further <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> measuring feelings of being understood and realization of understanding, in addition to measuring understanding, would improve prediction of behavior. Finally, it was <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> the contextual measure of understanding would better predict self-disclosure and interpersonal control than would global measures of understanding...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to antigenic stimuli, with cross-reactivity of the resulting cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> {{another alternative}} growth strategy will evolve in the P. rebeli, {{in which the}} P. rebeli will parasitize the M. schencki ants for an even {{longer period of time}} than the slow developing larvae. Most researchers, however, find this hypothesis highly unlikely because it is not an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the rate the P. rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable food source {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer polymorph of P. rebeli). Once the host colony reaches its lifespan of two years and dies, the P. rebeli loses its food source and dies as well.|$|E
5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite {{marks on the}} face that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, indicating that the animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{was the son}} of Bogdan, who was a son of Alexander the Good, Prince of Moldavia. Stephen's mother, Maria Oltea, {{was most}} {{probably}} related to the princes of Wallachia, according to historian Radu Florescu. The date of Stephen's birth is unknown, though historians estimate that he was born between 1433 and 1440. One church diptych records that he had five siblings: brothers Ioachim, Ioan, Christea; and sisters Sorea and Maria. Some of Stephen's biographers <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> Cârstea Arbore, father of the statesman Luca Arbore, was the prince's fourth brother, or that Cârstea was the same as Ioachim. These links with the high-ranking Moldavian boyars are known to have been preserved through matrimonial connections: Maria, who died in 1486, was the wife of Șendrea, gatekeeper of Suceava; Stephen's other brother-in-law, Isaia, also held high office at his court.|$|E

25|$|The {{most widely}} held current {{theory is that}} while several forces might be {{involved}} in eruption, the periodontal ligaments provide the main impetus for the process.
