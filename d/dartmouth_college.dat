5|$|The Seal of <b>Dartmouth</b> <b>College</b> is the {{official}} insignia of <b>Dartmouth</b> <b>College,</b> an Ivy League university located in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Anglo-American law generally requires a corporate body to seek official government sanction, usually {{in the form of}} a charter, in order to operate. Such chartered bodies normally authenticate their official acts by marking them with a distinctive seal. The seal's design is usually complicated to avoid counterfeiting, but it can also express something about the institution's history or mission. <b>Dartmouth</b> <b>College</b> is one such chartered body, and it obtained its official seal in 1773.|$|E
