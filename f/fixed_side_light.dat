5000|$|Usually, one <b>side</b> has a <b>fixed</b> type stepped threading, and {{the other}} side is {{threaded}} for a standard freewheel. Occasionally you may find double <b>sided</b> <b>fixed</b> hubs with stepped threading on both sides, but these are rare and only a few companies offer them. The <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> has a stepped down diameter thread to accept a lockring. The larger diameter thread on the <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> accepts a standard threaded cog, and uses the same size threads as the freewheel side of the hub. The most common standard I.S.O. thread size is 1.375" [...] x 24 tpi (threads per inch), but there are other less common older sizes (British 1.370" [...] x 24 tpi, French 34.7 x 1 mm, Italian 35 mm x 24 tpi).|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} finding {{hotspots}} of polygonal two-dimensional trajectories, i. e. regions in which a moving entity has spent {{a significant amount of}} time. The fastest optimal algorithm, due to Gudmundsson, van Kreveld, and Staals (2013), finds an axis-parallel square hotspot of <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> length in O(n^ 2). We present an approximation algorithm with the time complexity O(n n) and approximation factor 1 / 4 for orthogonal trajectories, in which the entity moves in a direction parallel either to the x or to the y-axis. We also present a 1 / 4 -approximation algorithm for finding axis-parallel cube hotspots of <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> length for orthogonal three-dimensional trajectories.

40|$|In this paper, we {{prove that}} in the system of bending flows on the moduli space of polygons with <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> lengths {{introduced}} by Kapovich and Millson, the singular fibers are isotropic homogeneous submanifolds. The proof covers the case where the system is defined by any maximal family of disjoint diagonals. We also take in account the case where the <b>fixed</b> <b>side</b> lengths are not generic. In this case, the phase space is an orbispace, and our result holds {{in the sense that}} singular fibers are isotropic orbispaces. In a last part we provide leads in favor of a similar study of the integrable systems defined by Nohara and Ueda on the Grassmannian of 2 -planes in C^n.

40|$|Both low-beam {{headlights}} and <b>side</b> <b>lights</b> {{have certain}} drawbacks.

This can, for example, be achieved with a light of an intensity between the present low-beam headlights and <b>side</b> <b>lights</b> quarantining adequate conspicuousness with an acceptable degree of glare. The use of such "new style side lights", however, implies that the public lighting {{must also be taken}} into account. On the other hand, alternatives should be investigated as well.
