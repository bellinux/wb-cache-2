40|$|The Hydroformylation {{reaction}} {{is one of}} the most important homogeneous catalysed reaction in industrial chemistry. For the technical application of homogeneous catalysis with an expensive metal complex it is essential to minimise the catalyst loss. One attractive possibility is to carry out the reaction in a liquid-liquid biphasic reaction system. Ionic liquids are suggested as novel catalyst solvents for the biphasic hydroformylation reaction. Ionic liquids are low temperature molten salts (< 80 °C) with a non-molecular, ionic character. The application of ionic liquids in biphasic catalysis requires usually ionic catalyst/ligand systems to prevent catalyst leaching into the organic layer. In this thesis cationic ligands are presented and tested in hydroformylation reaction, which combine high activity, regioselectivity and the possibility for catalyst recycling. However, the advantage of product separation by using an ionic liquid medium is not limited to a biphasic reaction mode.

When there are ∼ 9 e- 19 amounts of excess H 3 + or H- within cold diffuse clouds of H 2, residual repulsive Coulomb forces between these few unbalanced charges are comparable to the gravitational attractions between the many nucleons. Thus, trace-charged dark matter is inert with respect to static electrogravitional self-attractions, but responds to electromagnetic fields and gravitational attractions with uncharged matter. Trace charge is also the <b>ionic</b> <b>catalyst</b> that keeps dark matter in the state of unseen clouds of cold molecular hydrogen plus trace H 3 +. Once warm enough to partially ionize, bright matter preferentially expels its net charge to become nearly charge-neutral.

In contrast, around trace-charged AGNs, black holes, and pulsars,newly ionized protons along with a significant fraction of entrained dark matter are Coulomb-expelled to relativistic velocities in polar jets.

40|$|Treatment of {{fuel cell}} feed H 2 {{for the removal}} of CO is {{important}} owing to the poisoning of the catalysts, thereby affecting the performance of the fuel cell. Strong and preferential adsorption of CO over the catalyst takes place resulting in a reduction of the power output of the cell. Therefore, it is important to treat the fuel cell feed H 2 to reduce its CO content below the tolerable limit. Development of efficient catalysts for the treatment of synthesis gas {{for the removal of}} CO and and H 2 enrichment of the gas to make it suitable for fuel cells is one of the two goals of this thesis. One of the various possible strategies for the removal of CO from the synthesis gas can be the use of the water-gas shift reaction. We have developed noble metal substituted ionic catalysts for catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction and have studied in detail the kinetics of the reactions by proposing the relevant reaction mechanisms. Solution combustion, a novel technique for synthesizing nanocrystalline materials, was used for the synthesis of all the catalysts. All the compounds synthesized were solid solutions of the noble metal ion and transition or rare earth metal oxide support. Three different supports were used, viz., CeO 2, ZrO 2 and TiO 2. Substitution of Zr and Ti in CeO 2 up to 15 at% was also carried out to obtain the compounds with enhanced oxygen storage capacity. All the compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In some cases, where it was required, the use of FT-Raman spectroscopy was made for structural analysis. The compounds were nanocrystalline with metals substituted in ionic form in the support. The water-gas shift reaction was carried out over the synthesized catalysts with a reactant gas mixture that simulated the actual refinery gas composition. The variation of CO concentration with temperature was traced. The changes in the oxidation state of the metal showed the involvement of the various redox pairs over the reducible oxide like substituted CeO 2 and TiO 2. The mechanism of the reaction over ZrO 2 -based compounds was found to take place utilizing the surface hydroxyl groups. Rate expressions for the reactions over all the catalysts following different mechanisms were derived from the proposed elementary processes. Nonlinear regression was used for the estimation of various parameters describing the rate of reaction. Having established the high activity of Pt-ion substituted TiO 2 for the reactions, steam reforming of wood gas obtained from the gasification of Casuarina wood chips was carried out. The enrichment of the gas stream, which initially consisted of nearly 10 % H 2 was carried out by steam reforming and H 2 -rich stream was obtained with H 2 as high as 40 % by volume in the treated gas. The second motive behind this thesis was to test the activity of the noble-metal substituted ionic catalysts for the treatment of the exhaust gas coming out of a fuel cell. In the fuel cell utilizing H 2, the exhaust gases contain certain amount of unreacted H 2, which can not be recovered or utilized economically. However, the gases are combustible and H 2 has to be removed {{in order to make the}} gas clean. We have shown high activity of the combustion-synthesized ionic compounds for catalytic combustion of H 2. All the compounds showed high activity for H 2 combustion and complete removal of H 2 was possible. The rates were found to increase with an decrease in H 2 :O 2 ratio and complete conversion of H 2 was possible within 100 oC with air. A mathematical model was developed for the kinetics of catalytic H 2 combustion based on the elementary processes that were proposed using the spectroscopic evidences. CO tolerant capacity of the catalysts was also tested. It was found that the temperature requirement for most of the catalysts increased with the introduction of CO. However, it was still possible to obtain complete conversions within 200 oC. To summarize, fuel cell processing systems utilizing H 2 remained central to the study.

40|$|Ceria (CeO 2) {{containing}} {{materials are}} the subject of numerous investigations recently owing to their broad range of applications in various fields. Ceria {{is one of the most}} important components of three-way catalysts (TWC). Two unique features are responsible for making CeO 2 a promising material for use either as a support or as an active catalyst: (a) the Ce 3 +/Ce 4 + redox couple, and (b) its ability to shift between CeO 2 and CeO 2 –δ under oxidizing and reducing conditions retaining fluorite structure. Despite widespread applications, pure CeO 2 has a serious problem of degradation in performance with time at elevated temperatures. CeO 2 undergoes rapid sintering under high operating temperatures, which leads to loss of oxygen buffer capacity and deactivation of the catalyst. In addition, the amount of lattice oxygen taking part in the redox reactions is small (δ ~ 0. 05), and therefore unsatisfactory for practical applications. Therefore further improvement of OSC of CeO 2 has led to development of new CeO 2 -based oxygen storage materials. Modifications of CeO 2 with isovalent or aliovalent ion (noble metal, rare-earth or transition metal) confer new properties to the catalysts, such as better resistance to sintering and high catalytic activity. The demand for ceria-based oxygen storage materials were accelerated in the 1970 s with the introduction of strict automotives exhaust treatment worldwide to combat the obnoxious gases released in the atmosphere causing deterioration of air quality. Significant developments have occurred in this field leading to better understanding of the catalysts synthesis, structure and improved catalytic activity. The introductory chapter 1 is a compendium to provide an overview of the topic, examine the critical lacunae in the field and the proposal for future developments. In chapter 2 we present the studies on synthesis and catalytic properties of Ce 1 – xSnxO 2 (x= 0. 1 – 0. 5) solid solution and its Pd substituted analogue. A brief description of the single step solution combustion synthesis, catalysts characterization techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are given. Design and fabrication of temperature programmed reduction by hydrogen (H 2 -TPR) system in this laboratory is given in details. The home-made temperature programmed catalytic reaction system with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and an on-line gas-chromatograph for gas analysis is described. For the synthesis of Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 solid solution by a single-step solution combustion method we have used tin oxalate as precursor for Sn. The compounds were characterized by XRD, XPS and TEM. Oxygen storage capacity of the Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 solid solution was measured by H 2 -TPR. The cubic fluorite structure remained intact up to 50 % of Sn substitution in CeO 2, and the compounds were stable up to 700 °C. Oxygen storage capacity of Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 was found to be much higher than that of Ce 1 –xZrxO 2 due to accessible Ce 4 +/Ce 3 + and Sn 4 +/Sn 2 + redox couples at temperatures between 200 to 400 °C. Pd 2 + ions in Ce 0. 78 Sn 0. 2 Pd 0. 02 O 2 -δare highly ionic, and the lattice oxygen of this catalyst is highly labile, leading to low temperature CO to CO 2 conversion. The rate of CO oxidation was 2 μmolg– 1 s– 1 at 50 °C. NO reduction by CO with 70 % N 2 selectivity was observed at ~ 200 °C and 100 % N 2 selectivity below 260 °C with 1000 - 5000 ppm NO. Pd 2 + ion substituted Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 catalyst can be used for low temperature exhaust applications due to the involvement of the Sn 2 +/Sn 4 + redox couple along with Pd 2 +/Pd 0 and Ce 4 +/Ce 3 + couples. With the goal to understand the improved OSC for Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 solid solution, we have investigated the structure and its relative stability based on first-principles density functional calculations. In chapter 3, we present our studies on the relative stability of Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 solid solution in fluorite in comparison to rutile structure of the other end-member SnO 2. Analysis of relative energies of fluorite and rutile phases of CeO 2, SnO 2, and Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 indicates that fluorite structure is most stable for Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 solid solution. An analysis of local structural distortions reflected in phonon dispersion show that SnO 2 in fluorite structure is highly unstable while CeO 2 in rutile structure is only weakly unstable. Thus, Sn in Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 -fluorite structure is associated with high local structural distortion whereas Ce in Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 -rutile structure, if formed, will show only marginal local distortion. Determination of M–O (M = Ce or Sn) bond lengths and analysis of Born effective charges for the optimized structure of Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 show that local coordination of these cations changes from ideal eight-fold coordination expected of Ce 4 + ion in fluorite lattice, leading to generation of long and short Ce–O and Sn–O bonds in the doped structure. Bond valence analyses for all ions show the presence of oxygen with bond valence ~ 1. 84. These weakly bonded oxygen ions are relevant for enhanced oxygen storage/release properties observed in Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 solid solution. In chapter 4, we present detailed structural analysis of Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 and Ce 1 –x– ySnxPdyO 2 –δsolid solutions based on our DFT calculations supported with EXAFS studies. Both EXAFS analysis and DFT calculation reveal that in the solid solution Ce exhibits 4 + 4 coordination, Sn exhibits 4 + 2 + 2 coordination and Pd has 4 + 3 coordination. While the oxygen in the first four coordination with short M—O bonds are strongly held in the lattice, the oxygens in the second and higher coordinations with long M—O bonds are weakly bound, and they are the activated oxygen in the lattice. Bond valence analysis shows that oxygen with valencies as low as 1. 65 are created by the Sn and Pd ion substitution. Another interesting observation is that H 2 -TPR experiment of Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 shows a broad peak starting from 200 to 500 oC, while the same reduction is achieved in a single step at ~ 110 oC in presence Pd 2 + ion. Substitution of Pd 2 + ion thus facilitates synergistic reduction of the catalyst at lower temperature. We have shown that simultaneous reduction of the Ce 4 + and Sn 4 + ions by Pd 0 is the synergistic interaction leading to high oxygen storage capacity at low temperature. In chapter 5, we present the effect of substituting aliovalent Fe 3 + ion on OSC and catalytic activity of ceria. Ce 0. 9 Fe 0. 1 O 2 –δ and Ce 0. 89 Fe 0. 1 Pd 0. 01 O 2 –δ solid solutions have been synthesized by solution combustion method, which show higher oxygen storage/release property compared to CeO 2 and Ce 0. 8 Zr 0. 2 O 2. Temperature programmed reduction and XPS study reveal that the presence of Pd ion in Ce 0. 9 Fe 0. 1 O 2 –δ facilitates complete reduction of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + state and partial reduction of Ce 4 + to Ce 3 + state at temperatures as low as 105 oC compared to 400 oC for monometal-ionic Ce 0. 9 Fe 0. 1 O 2 –δ. Fe 3 + ion is reduced to Fe 2 and not to Fe 0 due to favorable redox potential for Ce 4 + Fe 2 ൅ → Ce 3 + Fe 3 reaction. Using first-principles density functional theory calculation we determine M—O (M = Pd, Fe, Ce) bond lengths, and find that bond lengths vary from shorter (2. 16 Å) to longer (2. 9 Å) bond distances compared to mean Ce—O bond distance of 2. 34 Åfor CeO 2. Using these results in bond valence analysis, we show that oxygen with bond valences as low as – 1. 55 are created, leading to activation of lattice oxygen in the bimetal <b>ionic</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Temperatures of CO oxidation and NO reduction by CO/H 2 are lower with the bimetal ionic Ce 0. 89 Fe 0. 1 Pd 0. 01 O 2 –δ catalyst compared to monometal-ionic Ce 0. 9 Fe 0. 1 O 2 –δ and Ce 0. 99 Pd 0. 01 O 2 –δ catalysts. From XPS studies of Pd impregnated on CeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 oxides, we show that the synergism leading to low temperature activation of lattice oxygen in bimetal-ionic catalyst Ce 0. 89 Fe 0. 1 Pd 0. 01 O 2 –δ is due to low-temperature reduction of Pd 2 to Pd 0, followed by Pd 0 + 2 Fe 3 ൅ → Pd 2 + 2 Fe 2, Pd 0 + 2 Ce 4 ൅ → Pd 2 + 2 Ce 3 redox reaction. In chapter 6, we simulate the structure of Ce 1 –xMxO 2 –δ (M = transition metal, noble metal and rare–earth ions) for theoretical understanding of origin of OSC in these oxides and to draw a general criteria required to increase the OSC in ceria. The relationship between the OSC and structural changes induced by the dopant ion was investigated by H 2 -TPR and first-principles based density functional calculations. Transition metal and noble metal ions substitution in ceria greatly enhances the reducibility of Ce 1 –xMxO 2 –δ (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd, Pt, Ru), whereas rare–earth ions substituted Ce 1 –xAxO 2 –δ (A = La, Y) have very little effect in improving the OSC. Our simulated optimized structure shows deviation in cation–oxygen bond length from ideal bond length of 2. 34 Å (for CeO 2). For example, our calculation for Ce 28 Mn 4 O 62 structure shows that Mn—O bonds are in 4 + 2 coordination with average bond lengths of 2. 0 and 3. 06 Å respectively. While the four short Mn–O bond lengths for the calculated structure spans the bond distance region of Mn 2 O 3, and the other two Mn–O bonds are moved to longer distances. The dopant transition and noble metal ions also affects Ce coordination shell and results in the formation of longer Ce—O bonds as well. Thus longer cation-oxygen bond lengths for both dopant and host ions results in enhanced synergistic reduction of the solid solution. With Pd ion substitution in Ce 1 –xMxO 2 –δ (M = Mn Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) further enhancement in OSC is observed in H 2 –TPR. This effect is reflected in our calculations by the presence of still longer bonds compared to the model without Pd ion doping. Synergistic effect is, therefore, due to enhanced reducibility of both dopant and host ion induced due to structural distortion of fluorite lattice in presence of dopant ion. For RE ions (RE = Y, La) our calculations show very little deviation of bonds lengths from ideal fluorite structure. The absence of longer Y— O/La—O and Ce–O bonds make the structure very less susceptible to reduction [8]. Since Pd substituted Ce 1 –xSnxO 2 showed high OSC and catalytic activity towards CO oxidation and NO reduction, we tested this catalyst for water-gas shift (WGS) reaction and the results are presented in chapter 7. Over 99. 5 % CO conversion to H 2 is observed at 300 ± 25 oC. Based on different characterization techniques we found that the present catalyst is resistant to deactivation due to carbonate formation and sintering of Pt on the surface when subjected to longer duration of reaction conditions. The catalyst does not require any pre-treatment or activation between start-up/shut-down reaction operations. Formation of side products such as methane, methanol, formaldehyde, coke etc. was not observed under the WGS reaction conditions indicating the high selectivity of the catalyst for H 2. Temperature programmed reduction of the catalyst in hydrogen (H 2 –TPR) shows reversible reduction of Ce 4 + to Ce 3 +, Sn 4 + to Sn 2 + and Pt 4 + to Pt 0 oxidation state with oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of 3500 μmol g– 1 at 80 oC. Such high value of OSC indicates the presence of highly activated lattice oxygen. CO oxidation in presence of stoichiometric O 2 shows 100 % conversion to CO 2 at room temperature. The catalyst also exhibits 100 % selectivity for CO 2 at room temperature towards preferential oxidation (PROX) of residual CO in presence of excess hydrogen in the feed. To further validate our DFT results presented in the thesis, DFT calculations on Ce 2 Zr 2 O 8 –Ce 2 Zr 2 O 7 system were performed and the results are given in the last chapter 8. Ce 2 Zr 2 O 7 does not show any oxygen storage/release property unlike Ce 2 Zr 2 O 8 (=Ce 0. 5 Zr 0. 5 O 2). Bond lengths obtained from DFT simulation on Ce 2 Zr 2 O 7 structure showed well-defined Ce—O and Zr—O bonds expected of the pyrochlore structure, unlike distribution of bond lengths as has been observed for Ce 1 –xMxO 2 –δ case. Absence of bonds distribution indicates that the oxygen sublattice is not distorted in Ce 2 Zr 2 O 7 in agreement with its closed packed structure. Filling of the 1 / 8 of the tetrahedral oxide ion vacancies will result in Ce 2 Zr 2 O 8 structure, and DFT calculation for this structure show wide distribution of bond lengths. Long Ce—O and Zr—O bonds appear in the bond-distribution plot, suggesting substantial distortion of the oxygen sublattice. Thus absence of longer cation-oxygen bond in pyrochlore structure validates the structural calculations presented in this thesis. Based on the results derived in all the chapters, a critical review of the work is presented and major conclusions are given in the last chapte...|$|E
40|$|Noble metal {{substituted}} <b>ionic</b> <b>catalysts</b> were synthesized by solution combustion technique. The compounds {{were characterized}} by X-ray diffraction, FT-Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Zirconia supported compounds crystallized in tetragonal phase. The solid solutions of ceria with zirconia crystallized in fluorite structure. The noble metals were substituted in ionic form. The water-gas shift reaction was carried out over the catalysts. Negligible conversions were observed with unsubstituted compounds. The substitution of a noble metal ion was found to enhance the reaction rate. Equilibrium conversion was obtained below 250 degrees C {{in the presence of}} Pt ion substituted compounds. The formation of Bronsted acid-Bronsted base pairs was proposed to explain the activity of zirconia catalysts. The effect of oxide ion vacancies on the reactions over substituted ceria-zirconia solid solutions was established. (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The physicalchemical properties of the emulsion reactor and lignin were intensively studied using optical photo, dynamic light scattering, surface tension measurement, and hydrophilelipophile balance value determination.

Another advantage of this water/oil emulsion reactor is that both the organic solvent (n-butanol) and the <b>ionic</b> liquid <b>catalyst</b> can be recycled easily, as the depletion of lignin surfactant at the end of depolymerization can result in the phase partition and the enrichment of final products in the oil phase automatically...|$|R

Suitable Brønsted acidic ionic liquids can be formed by combining lactams with sulphonic acids. This work weighs up the relative benefits and disadvantages of applying these Brønsted acidic <b>ionic</b> liquid <b>catalysts</b> in esterifications through a series of comparisons using green chemistry metrics. Results A new bio-based ionic liquid was synthesised from N-methyl pyrrolidinone and p-cymenesulphonic acid, and tested as a catalyst in three Fischer esterifications under different conditions. An evaluation of the performance of this Brønsted acidic ionic liquid was made through the comparison to other <b>ionic</b> liquid <b>catalysts</b> as well as conventional homogeneous Brønsted acids. Conclusion Extending the argument to feedstock security as well as mass utilisation, ultimately in most instances traditional mineral acids appear to be the most sensible option for Brønsted acid esterification catalysts. Ester yields obtained from Brønsted acidic ionic liquid catalysed procedures were modest. This calls into question the diversity of research exploring esterification catalysis and the role of ionic liquids in esterifications...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{catalytic}} ozonation {{membrane reactor}} (COMR) coupling homogeneous catalytic ozonation and direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) {{was developed for}} refractory saline organic pollutant treatment from wastewater. An ozonation process {{took place in the}} reactor to degrade organic pollutants, whilst the DCMD process was used to recover <b>ionic</b> <b>catalysts</b> and produce clean water. It was found that 98. 6 % total organic carbon (TOC) and almost 100 % salt were removed and almost 100 % metal ion catalyst was recovered. TOC in the permeate water was less than 16 mg/L after 5 h operation, which was considered satisfactory as the TOC in the potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) feed water was as high as 1000 mg/L. Meanwhile, the membrane distillation flux in the COMR process was 49. 8 % higher than that in DCMD process alone after 60 h operation. Further, scanning electron microscope images showed less amount and smaller size of contaminants on the membrane surface, which indicated the mitigation of membrane fouling. The tensile strength and FT-IR spectra tests did not reveal obvious changes for the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane after 60 h operation, which indicated the good durability. This novel COMR hybrid process exhibited promising application prospects for saline organic wastewater treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
