25|$|Maintenance for {{the older}} {{concrete}} pavements that develop faults includes the technique called <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofit. This involves cutting slots in the pavement at each joint, placing dowel bars in the slots, then filling them with concrete patching material. This method can {{extend the life of}} the concrete pavement for another 15 years.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of concrete pavements is they are typically stronger and more durable than asphalt roadways. They also can be grooved to provide a durable skid-resistant surface. A notable disadvantage is that they typically can have a higher initial cost, and can be more time-consuming to construct. This cost can typically be offset through the long life cycle of the pavement. Concrete pavement can be maintained over time utilizing a series of methods known as concrete pavement restoration which include diamond grinding, <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofits, joint and crack sealing, cross-stitching, etc. Diamond grinding is also useful in reducing noise and restoring skid resistance in older concrete pavement.|$|E
2500|$|Also called {{joint and}} crack repair, this method's {{purpose is to}} {{minimize}} infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.|$|E
50|$|In {{contemporary}} highway construction {{since the}} mid-1990s, <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> {{are once again}} placed across joints and at intervals along the pavement. Today, <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> are coated with epoxy to prevent the corrosion problems seen in earlier installations.|$|R
50|$|Many {{states are}} {{retrofitting}} older highways with epoxy-coated <b>dowel</b> <b>bars.</b> The retrofit begins with cutting of six slots (three in each wheel path) across all transverse joints or cracks. The slots are cut with ganged diamond saws that make six cuts in each wheel path. The concrete between the saw cuts is then removed with lightweight jackhammers (heavy-weight jackhammers tend {{to damage the}} concrete around the cuts). The epoxy-coated <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> are placed in the slots, then the slots are filled with grout and the joints or cracks are filled with waterproof caulk. The final step is to diamond-grind the joint to remove both excess grout and any displacement of the panels.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{discontinued}} {{because the}} <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> tended to corrode and required frequent replacement. Stainless steel <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> are {{more resistant to}} corrosion, but stainless steel is relatively expensive compared to other materials. Instead, for several decades, the cohesion between the panels {{and the strength of}} the roadbed was relied upon to collectively distribute the load from one panel to the next, a concept known as aggregate interlock. Over time the joints and roadbed tended to break down under stress, resulting in cracks and displacement of the panels. Most highways in the United States built as part of the Interstate Highway System from the 1950s to the 1980s relied solely upon aggregate interlock and began to show problems in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|For <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofit, dowels, bond breaker, {{expansion}} caps, <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> support chairs, {{foam core}} insert, caulking filler, non-shrink concrete backfill material and submittals are needed. The dowels {{need to be}} smooth, round, epoxy and made of bond breaker coated steel conforming to requirements. The bond breaker {{is to be applied}} on all surfaces of the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar.</b> The expansion caps belong {{at each end of the}} <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> and the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> support chairs are used to firmly hold the dowels centered in the slots during backfill operations. The foam core insert is used to re-establish the joint or crack, which allows the bar within each side of the slot to expand and contract. The caulking filler is used to prevent backfill material from flowing into the joint or crack. Non-shrink concrete backfill material that is tested as rapid set concrete patching materials is recommended for use on DBR projects.|$|E

40|$|A laboratory-based linear loading {{pavement}} test stand, the Minnesota Accelerated Loading Facility (Minne-ALF) simulates {{the passage}} of heavy traffic loads moving at speeds up to 65 kph (40 mph) over small, full-scale pavement test slabs. Hydraulic actuators control a rocker beam, which simulates loads. Researchers simulated {{the passage of}} 40 -kN (9 -kip) single-wheel loads {{at a rate of}} 172, 000 per day, although wheel loads up to 100 kN (22 kips) can be simulated at varying speeds. Full-axle simulations are possible with frame modifications. Concrete slabs were cast and dowels were installed in slots across cracks/joints. Test variables included joint fact texture, repair backfill material, and dowel material and length. Test outputs included measurements of load transfer efficiency and differential deflection across the joint/crack. The effect of joint/crack face texture was great when the joint/crack remained tight.

40|$|In this study, a small-scaled {{accelerated}} {{loading test}} based on similarity theory and Accelerated Pavement Analyzer {{was developed to}} evaluate <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> with different materials and cross-sections. Jointed concrete specimen consisting of one dowel was designed as scaled model for the test, and each specimen was subjected to 864 thousand loading cycles. Deflections between jointed slabs were measured with dial indicators, and strains of the <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> were monitored with strain gauges. The load transfer efficiency, differential deflection, and dowel-concrete bearing stress for each case were calculated from these measurements.

50|$|Traffic {{loadings}} {{are transferred}} between sections when larger aggregates in the PCC mix inter-lock together, or through load transfer devices in the transverse joints of the surface. <b>Dowel</b> <b>bars</b> {{are used as}} load-transferring devices to efficiently transfer loads across transverse joints while maintaining the joint's horizontal and vertical alignment. Tie-bars are deformed steel bars that are placed along longitudinal joints to hold adjacent pavement sections in place.|$|R
50|$|Remove {{existing}} concrete {{from the}} slots {{followed by the}} cleaning out of all debris. Use maximum weight 30 pound jackhammers to remove the concrete remaining between the saw cuts. If the concrete removal operations cause damage to the pavement that is to remain, discontinue concrete removal operations and only resume after taking corrective measures. During concrete removal operations, use a small bush hammer as necessary to produce a flat, level surface within the slot so the backfill flows and consolidates under the <b>dowel</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofits, if done badly, {{can cause}} serious {{problems}}. These problems are usually due to poor workmanship {{and can be}} avoided by careful following of specifications and close supervision of workers. Use of heavy jackhammers (heavier than 14 kg class) tends to cause cracking of the concrete all around the slots. Lack of caulk or voids in the caulk put in the joints or cracks leads to cracks around the joints. Voids in the grout (especially below the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar)</b> can cause failure of the grout.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{the result}} of roadwork may leave visible marks on the pavements. An example is the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> {{retrofit}} process to reinforce concrete slabs in order to {{extend the life of}} older concrete pavements. The completion of the process leaves a symmetrical pattern of dash marks on the roadway, as if there were an associated meaning to the pattern. When there are many of them along the roadway, motorists may interpret the marks as an unknown form of mechanical markers or strange road surface markings. When roads are under construction and the lanes are shifted laterally, those marks may interfere with temporary lane markings. As the marks from the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofit are not intended to be any form of road surface markings, the responsible agencies try to make these marks less visible to the motorists.|$|E
5000|$|First, {{make two}} saw {{cuts in the}} {{pavement}} to outline the longitudinal sides of each <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> slot. Saw to a depth and length that allows {{the center of the}} dowel to be placed at mid-depth in the pavement slab. Saw slots parallel {{to each other and to}} the centerline of the roadway with a maximum tolerance of 1⁄4-inch per 12 inches of <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> length. Employ saws equipped with gang mounted diamond blades capable of cutting a minimum of three or four slots simultaneously in each wheel path. Skewed joints or cracks may require slots longer than the length specified in the plans. Pick up and remove water and paste residue from the pavement surface immediately by means of a vacuum attachment on the sawing machine. For smaller projects, a slot sawing machine might not be feasible. Consider allowing the use of walk-behind saws for slot cutting when the project contains less than 100 retrofit bars.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{non-metallic}} {{load transfer}} and reinforcement devices for concrete highway pavements {{is a possible}} alternative to avoid corrosion problems related to the current practice of steel materials. Laboratory and field testing of highway pavement <b>dowel</b> <b>bars,</b> made of both steel and fiber composite materials, and fiber composite tie rods were carried out in this research investigation. Fatigue, static, and dynamic testing was performed on full-scale concrete pavement slabs which were supported by a simulated subgrade and which included a single transverse joint. The bahavior of the full-scale specimens with both steel and fiber composite dowels placed in the test joints was monitored during several million load cycles which simulated truck traffic at a transverse joint. Static bond tests were conducted on fiber composite tie rods to determine the required embedment length. These tests {{took the form of}} bending tests which included curvature and shear in the embedment zone and pullout tests which subjected the test specimen to axial tension only. Fiber composite <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> were placed at two transverse joints during construction of a new concrete highway pavement in order to evaluate their performance under actual field conditions.

5000|$|As {{a vehicle}} travels on jointed {{concrete}} roads {{the weight of}} the vehicle passes from one concrete panel to the next. As the vehicle traverses the joints its weight is placed {{on the edge of the}} panel, where the panel is least able to withstand the deflection force. This can cause cracks as pavement shears off the edge of the panel. On older highways built in the early-to-mid 20th century, <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> (steel rods) were placed across the joints to help transfer the load from one panel to the next.|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} {{concrete}} pavements {{are commonly used}} (1) : • Jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) has transverse joints spaced less than about 5 m apart and no reinforcing steel in the slab. JPCP may, however, contain steel <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> across transverse joints and steel tiebars across longitudinal joints. • Jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP) has transverse joints spaced about 9 to 12 m apart and contains steel reinforcement in the slab. The steel reinforcement is designed to hold tightly together any transverse cracks that develop in the slab. <b>Dowel</b> <b>bars</b> and tiebars are also used at all transverse and longitudinal joints, respectively. • Continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) has no regularly spaced transverse joints and contains more steel reinforcement than JRCP. The high steel content influences the development of transverse cracks within an acceptable spacing and serves to hold these transverse cracks tightly together. Transverse reinforcing steel is often used. According to a 1999 survey, at least 70 {{percent of the state}} highway agencies in the United States use JPCP. About 20 percent of the states build JRCP, and about six or seven state highway agencies build CRCP, most notably on high-volume, urban roadways. A few states report that they do not build concrete pavements (2). CONCRETE PAVEMENT DESIGN METHODS The most widely used procedure for design of concrete pavements is specified in the Guid...|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} {{to modify the}} roto-milling head to create slots in {{concrete}} slabs for the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofit process. The typical process is to saw cut and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement, the slots are then typically backfilled with a non-shrink concrete mixture, and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness. This special milling process shortens the time to create slots from the traditional method which is labor-intensive.|$|E
50|$|A <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> {{retrofit}} (DBR) is {{a method}} of reinforcing cracks in highway pavement by inserting steel dowel bars in slots cut across the cracks. It is a technique several states have successfully used to address faulting in older jointed plain concrete pavements. The typical approach is to saw cut and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement the slots are then typically backfilled with a non-shrink concrete mixture (grout) and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness.|$|E
50|$|The {{completion}} of the <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofit process usually leaves marks on the concrete pavements which consist of short parallel lines in two groups, left and right, 18 in inward the traveling lane from the lane markings. Each group has 3 or 4 slots that are parallel to the traffic flows. Each rectangular slot has the width of about 2.5 in {{and the length of}} about 2 ft or more. The backfilled slots may sometime give an impression that the highway pavements have been milled into grooves especially after the wear of patching material caused by studded tires.|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of <b>dowel</b> <b>bars</b> is {{the transfer of}} a load across the transverse joint from one pavement slab to the adjoining slab. In the past, these transfer mechanisms have been made of steel. However, pavement damage such as loss of bonding, deterioration, hollowing, cracking and spalling start to occur when the dowels begin to corrode. A significant amount of {{research has been done}} to evaluate alternative types of materials for use in the reinforcement of concrete pavements. Initial findings have indicated that stainless steel and fiber composite materials possess properties, such as flexural strength and corrosion resistance, that are equivalent to the Department of Transportation specifications for standard steel, 1 1 / 2 inch diameter <b>dowel</b> <b>bars.</b> Several factors affect the load transfer of dowels; these include diameter, alignment, grouting, bonding, spacing, corrosion resistance, joint spacing, slab thickness and dowel embedment length. This research is directed at the analysis of load transfer based on material type and dowel spacing. Specifically, this research is directed at analyzing the load transfer characteristics of: (a) 8 -inch verses 12 -inch spacing, and (b) alternative dowel material compared to epoxy coated steel dowels, will also be analyzed.

50|$|CPP and CPR {{techniques}} include slab stabilization, full- and partial-depth repair, <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofit, cross stitching longitudinal cracks or joints, diamond grinding {{and joint}} and crack resealing. CPP and CPR methods, {{developed over the}} last 40 years, are used in lieu of asphalt overlays and bituminous patches to repair roads when longer lasting solutions are desired. When installing pavers over top of an existing asphalt of concrete pad, there are three installation options: sand set, bituminous set, and mortar set. Due to rising oil prices, these methods are often less expensive than an asphalt overlay and last three times longer {{in addition to providing}} a greener, more sustainable solution.|$|E

50|$|Diamond {{grinding}} is a pavement preservation {{technique that}} corrects {{a variety of}} surface imperfections on both concrete and asphalt pavements. Most often utilized on concrete pavement, diamond grinding is typically performed {{in conjunction with other}} concrete pavement preservation (CPP) techniques such as road slab stabilization, full- and partial-depth repair, <b>dowel</b> <b>bar</b> retrofit, cross stitching longitudinal cracks or joints and joint and crack resealing. Diamond grinding restores rideability by removing surface irregularities caused during construction or through repeated traffic loading over time. The immediate effect of diamond grinding is a significant improvement in the smoothness of a pavement. Another important effect of diamond grinding is the considerable increase in surface macrotexture and consequent improvement in skid resistance, noise reduction and safety.|$|E

40|$|Slab curvature, which {{represents}} the response of concrete pavement to environmental loads, influences the location and magnitude of critical slab stresses and affects long-term pavement performance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the changes in temperature and moisture profiles in a newly constructed concrete pavement, to determine the deformed shape of the slabs and the resulting stress and identify the relative contributions of built-in and transient environmental effects over time. To do this, an instrumented jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) was monitored over a two-year period. The built-in construction gradient is a major factor contributing to slab curvature and stress. Therefore, first, static strain and pressure gage data used to establish the built-in gradient and zero stress temperature. Slab curvature was predicted using measurements of temperature and moisture conditions in the slab and computed using static strain and pavement surface profile measurements. It was found that the additional restraint provided by the <b>dowel</b> and tie <b>bars</b> does not appear to significantly reduce slab curvature resulting from daily temperature fluctuations or from reversible drying shrinkage. It does have a substantial effect on reducing slab curvature due to long-term drying shrinkage. It was also found that the slab curvature is predominantly curled upward (99 percent of the time), resulting in top-down fatigue cracking, while it is traditionally assumed that fatigue cracking in concrete pavements initiates at the bottom. Finite element models were developed to study the effect of various environmental conditions and slab restraints on the development of stress in the slabs. The models were validated based on measured strain data. It was found that the effect of moisture has the most significant effect on stress in the slabs. The measured curvature in the restrained slab (tie and <b>dowel</b> <b>bars)</b> is over 50 percent lower when compared to the unrestrained (no tie or <b>dowel</b> <b>bars)</b> slab. This reduction in deformation resulted in a critical stress that was 20 to 22 percent larger for the restrained slab compared to the unrestrained slab...|$|R
