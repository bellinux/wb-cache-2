Jordan contemplated that [...] "soap snobs" [...] {{may hold the}} series in disdain for using the Holby brand, but concluded: [...] "After much thought, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> who I was as a writer, the joy I take from surprising an audience, by subverting expectation – and HolbyBlue was born."

A two-part crossover episode with Holby City was developed for the beginning of the show's second series, broadcast in 2008. The episodes were written by McHale and Jordan, and saw Holby City registrar Jac Naylor accused of murder. Yorke compared the crossover to the American CSI franchise, in that: [...] "You really believe it's a world." [...] While the second series attracted 5.6million viewers with its opening episode, by the end of May 2008 viewership had fallen to 2.5million. In August 2008, the BBC announced that due to declining ratings, Holby Blue would not be recommissioned for a third series.|$|E
500|$|Continuing the band's {{policy of}} using names that would repulse {{potential}} listeners, the band named the album by using {{part of the}} phrase [...] "queer as a three dollar bill" [...] and adding the word [...] "Y'all" [...] for Florida flavor, naming the album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall. The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music. After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and Helmet in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating [...] "The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's rap/thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile." [...] That same year, they also notably served as an opening act for Faith No More, a band often credited as {{paving the way for}} Limp Bizkit and the nu metal genre. The group's keyboardist Roddy Bottum later recalled [...] "That guy Fred Durst had a really bad attitude. He was kind of a jerk. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> he called the audience faggots at one show when they booed him. Not a good scene." ...|$|E
500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album.

I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E

[...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean. We put so much value on clothing. .... It's like so much else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed.

500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|E
