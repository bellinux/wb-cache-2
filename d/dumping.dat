They {{were supposed to be}} <b>dumping</b> the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found <b>dumping</b> it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} was, through action research, to map out <b>dump</b> pickers’ hopes and needs {{as a part of}} a process of empowerment in Hulene B. garbage <b>dump,</b> Maputo, Mozambique. The research identified what kinds of interventions rising from empowerment can be applied to ”Bocaria” <b>dump,</b> starting from the hopes and dreams of the <b>dump</b> pickers. The research also investigated how <b>dump</b> pickers perceive the forthcoming closure of the <b>dump</b> and what kinds of plans they have for after the closure. The action research was carried out in July 2014 and {{the research}} included theme interviews, observations, picture analysis and problem analysis in the <b>dump.</b> The research included 23 short interviews with the <b>dump</b> pickers and one interview with a waste buyer. The theme interviews were analyzed using content and theme analysis. Empowerment and Freirean thinking were used as a theoretical framework and related to poverty reduction. In the research it was observed that <b>dump</b> pickers have dreams and hopes for the future. Even decades in the garbage <b>dump</b> have not kept them from dreaming of a better future for themselves and their families. The focal observation of the research was that the <b>dump</b> pickers mainly dream of a life outside of the <b>dump</b> and they are motivated to do any kind of work or studies to make a living outside waste picking. Many <b>dump</b> pickers dream of specific things like starting their own business. According to the principles of empowerment, <b>dump</b> pickers’ hopes and dreams were used to form suggestions for future projects and design plans for a project starting in the summer of 2015. The research shows that <b>dump</b> pickers are a diverse group of people and they hope and need different things. Different groups of people require different interventions. Mostly they live in extreme poverty and work and live in dangerous and inhumane conditions. The <b>dump</b> pickers perceived that life after the closure of the <b>dump</b> will provide only misery and hunger and lead them into questionable measures to find an income, like prostitution and theft. The central conclusion is that <b>dump</b> pickers have a critical need for social and material support and targeted interventions, so that they can be supported to find alternative sources of income after the <b>dump</b> is closed in the near future. Without support, their opportunities to find alternative incomes are minimal. acceptedVersio...|$|R
