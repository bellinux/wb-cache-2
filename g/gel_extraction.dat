25|$|In {{analytical}} methods, {{the protein}} migrate as bands based on size. Each band {{can be detected}} using stains such as Coomassie blue dye or silver stain. Preparative methods to purify large amounts of protein, require the extraction of the protein from the electrophoretic <b>gel.</b> This <b>extraction</b> may involve excision of the gel containing a band, or eluting the band directly off the gel as it runs {{off the end of}} the gel.|$|R
50|$|Staff A, B and C: These {{are three}} young codenamed {{scientists}} {{who work on}} Ajo's secret projects for both Ajo Heavy Industries and Production Minos. They are usually seen doing PPOR testing and <b>Gel</b> <b>extraction.</b> Though they are highly paid, Ajo is not above using violence to ensure they obey his orders and maintain secrecy.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, <b>gel</b> <b>extraction</b> or gel {{isolation is}} a technique used to isolate a desired fragment of intact DNA from an agarose gel following agarose gel electrophoresis. After extraction, fragments of interest can be mixed, precipitated, and enzymatically ligated together in several simple steps. This process, usually performed on plasmids, {{is the basis for}} rudimentary genetic engineering.|$|E
50|$|Gel is a pink {{gelatinous}} {{substance that}} contains a person's will and life force. In its natural form, it is colder than dry ice, and must be kept contained or it will dissipate. Gel can be forcibly extracted from a person {{through the use of}} the proper kind of machine. However, this process weakens the person significantly, as <b>gel</b> <b>extraction</b> is literally the process of pumping away a person's life. If too much gel is extracted, the person becomes comatose and may even die. On the other hand, gel is a powerful medicine that can heal anything. If a healthy person is injected with Gel they become stronger than a normal human, {{as is the case with}} Sergei. Dr. Mima discovered that Gel may be used as power source and control mechanism for robots, but once he learned the truth about the <b>gel</b> <b>extraction</b> process he halted his research on moral grounds, something which Ajo was not happy about. Ajo Heavy Industries collects gel from human sources, such as homeless people or enemies of the company, in order to fuel PPORs.|$|E

40|$|A polysaccharide-fatty acid complex was {{isolated}} from the cell surface of Candida tropicalis growing on alkanes. This complex was solubilized by Pronase treatment of whole cells. A decrease in alkane-binding affinity was observed after Pronase treatment, resulting in 10 to 12 % of the yeast dry cell weight being released as polysaccharide. The isolated polysaccharide contained 2. 5 % fatty acids. C. tropicalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown with glucose contained only traces of fatty acids in the corresponding polysaccharide fraction. The fatty acids were not removed from the polysaccharide moiety by <b>gel</b> filtration. <b>Extraction</b> of the polysaccharide with chloroform-methanol showed that fatty acids were covalently bound to the polysaccharide. The amphipathic nature of the isolated polysaccharide and the hydrocarbon-induced formation suggest a possible role in alkane metabolism...|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} <b>gel</b> <b>extraction</b> involves creating a folded pocket of Parafilm wax paper and placing the agarose fragment inside. The agarose is physically compressed {{with a finger}} into {{a corner of the}} pocket, partially liquifying the gel and its contents. The liquid droplets can then be directed out of the pocket onto an exterior piece of Parafilm, where they are pipetted into a small tube. A butanol extraction removes the ethidium bromide stain, followed by a phenol/chloroform extraction of the cleaned DNA fragment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gel</b> <b>extraction</b> kits are {{available}} from several major biotech manufacturers for a final cost of approximately 1-2 US$ per sample. Protocols included in these kits generally call for {{the dissolution of the}} gel-slice in 3 volumes of chaotropic agent at 50 °C, followed by application of the solution to a spin-column (the DNA remains in the column), a 70% ethanol wash (the DNA remains in the column, salt and impurities are washed out), and elution of the DNA in a small volume (30 µL) of water or buffer.|$|E
50|$|Cells are lysed and DNA is {{extracted}} from the cell lysate. The high-molecular-weight DNA, often several megabase pairs long, is sonicated to break the DNA double-strands at random intervals. Bioinformatic mapping of the sequencing reads is most efficient when the sample DNA contains a narrow length range. Therefore, selecting the ideal fragment lengths of the DNA for sequencing the fragments are size separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The DNA of the suitable size range is purified by <b>gel</b> <b>extraction,</b> resulting in DNA with lengths within a narrow range (typically 400 - 500 base pairs).|$|E
40|$|The fate of transplastomic (chloroplast genome {{contains}} the transgene) tobacco plant DNA in planta was studied when the plant leaves {{were subjected to}} decay conditions simulating those encountered naturally, including grinding, incubation with cellulase or enzymes produced by Erwinia chrysanthemi, and attack by the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum. Direct visualization of DNA on agarose <b>gels,</b> gene <b>extraction</b> yield (the number of amplifiable aadA sequences in extracted plant DNA), and the frequency that recipient bacteria can be transformed by plant DNA were {{used to evaluate the}} quality and quantity of plant DNA and the transgene. These measurements were used to monitor the physical and biological degradation of DNA inside decaying plant tissues. Our results indicate that while most of the DNA will be degraded inside plant cells, sufficient DNA persists to be released into the soil...|$|R
40|$|The {{studies of}} the {{synthesis}} of uranium carbide from uranyl-ascorbate gels using the complex sol-gel process (CSGP) have been carried out. The synthesis of uranyl-ascorbate mixture as liquid sol from uranium trioxide and ascorbic acid and solid <b>gel</b> by <b>extraction</b> of water from sol were carefully examined. Ascorbic acid {{was used as a}} complexing agent in complex sol-gel process and as a carbon source. The crucial step to obtain final uranium carbides from the aforementioned substrates is the carbonization process. The thermal behavior of ascorbic acid and uranyl-ascorbate gels in a nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range of 25 - 900 °C were investigated using TG-DTG. Furthermore, the products of the carbonization of uranyl-ascorbate gels in nitrogen, argon and vacuum atmosphere were identified by X-ray diffraction. TG-DTG was used also as a method for determining of carbon residues in the samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of plasmid DNA {{is an important}} and often used method in microbiology. The isolation itself is preceded by preparation of bacterial competent cells and by amplification of the plasmids. In this stage, plasmids CHR 2, ASAP 1, ASAP- 3, ASAP- 5 and Kir 2. 1. are first amplified in E. Coli bacteria of the DH 5 strain and then isolated through the method of phenol-chloroform <b>extraction.</b> <b>Gel</b> electrophoresis and transfection to cellular line HEK 293 are used for determining the correctness of the isolation...|$|R
5000|$|SYBR Safe is a safer {{alternative}} to the known mutagen ethidium bromide. Although {{it is still a}} carcinogen, as it binds DNA just like ethidium bromide. However the dilution of SYBR safe in the solvent DMSO allows for its passage into living cells which ethidium bromide is unable to do thus making SYBR Safe in fact more dangerous to use than ethidium bromide. However, as the molecule itself is quite a bit larger than ethidium bromide, it does not bind to the column of a <b>gel</b> <b>extraction</b> as easily, making it less efficient when trying to clone a DNA fragment into a plasmid.Interestingly, SYBR Safe has a very similar structure to thiazole orange, which has a methyl group attached to the charged nitrogen, whereas SYBR Safe has an N-propyl group. Thiazole Orange {{has been shown to be}} three to four times less mutagenic than ethidium bromide whereas SYBR Safe is four to five less mutagenic. [...] Additionally, according to the Life Technologies website, SYBR Safe is not lethal in rats at doses as high as 5 g/kg, and rats don't show symptoms of acute toxicity. Thiazole orange does show toxicity at this dose.|$|E

40|$|Kappa {{carrageenan}} {{extraction process}} {{was developed for}} Eucheuma cottonii by investigating the effects of water and KOH solution (concentration 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0, 3 N) as the solvent on carrageenan yield and <b>gel</b> properties. <b>Extraction</b> process was carried out with a constant ratio of seaweed weight to solvent volume (1 : 30; g/mL) at 100 oC in water bath equipped by shaker and at different time until the equilibrium was attained (60 minutes).

Based on experimental data, pure water was the most efficient solvent with regard to yield but certainly not gel strength. Alkali significantly influenced carrageenan yield and properties. Increasing the KOH concentration leads to carrageenan containing less sulfate content. The gel strength was improved as the increasing KOH concentration.
