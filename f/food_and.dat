40|$|Background: Although {{traditional}} fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> beverages play {{an important}} role in contributing to the livelihoods of Namibians through enhanced <b>food</b> security <b>and</b> income generation, there is a scarcity of information regarding their traditional production methods, microbiological and biochemical characteristics, nutritional value, and safety. Research into the processing technologies of these <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> beverages is still in its infancy; thus, there is a need to document their traditional production methods, microbiology, and biochemistry in order to evaluate their nutritional value and safety, standardize and industrialize them, where possible, and preserve them for future generations. Methods: The socioeconomic importance, traditional production methods and, where available, microbiological, biochemical, and nutritional properties and safety evaluation of commonly consumed fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> beverages in Namibia are documented. Recommendations are made for potential research areas. Results: Commonly produced fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> beverages in Namibia include milk-based products (omashikwa, mashini ghakushika, mabisi, and âudaï), cereal-based beverages (oshikundu, omalodu, otombo, epwaka, okatokele, oshafuluka, maxau, and /Ho ≠Goas), vegetable-based fermented <b>food,</b> mudhika, <b>and</b> fruit-based beverages (ombike, omagongo, and omalunga). Conclusion: Fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> beverages play a major role in the diet, socioeconomic, and cultural activities of the Namibian population. Most are spontaneously fermented. Research is scarce and should be conducted on the microbiology, biochemistry, nutritional value, and safety of the fermented <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> beverages to ensure the health of the population...|$|R
