5|$|Bedford Castle was {{probably}} built after 1100 by Henry I {{in the town}} of Bedford, overlooking the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, and many of the older Anglo-Saxon streets had to be destroyed and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent mark in the formal <b>grid</b> <b>system.</b> The castle was built in a motte and bailey design and {{was probably}} much smaller than the later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.|$|E
5|$|As {{each piece}} of {{wreckage}} was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with fresh water, sorted, and weighed. The item was then placed in a specific area of a hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a <b>grid</b> <b>system</b> representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar. Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a <b>grid</b> <b>system.</b> Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{interoperability}} {{among different}} science <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> is indispensable to worldwide {{use of a}} large-scale experimental facility {{as well as a}} large-scale supercomputer. One of the simplest ways to achieve the interoperability is to convert message among different science <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> without modifying themselves. Under such consideration, the interoperability between UNICORE and ITBL (IT-Based Laboratory) has been achieved without modifying these <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> by adopting a connection server which works as a mediator. Until international standardization is established, the method of message conversion among different science <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> is promising as a way to establish the interoperability. ...|$|R

Recently, for large-scale computation re-quirement, the collaboration of different <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> {{is one of}} the hot research topics. In this paper, we propose a meta-grid framework, called G 2 G frame-work, to harmonize autonomic grids for realizing the federation of different grids. The G 2 G framework is a decentralized management framework on top of existing autonomic <b>grid</b> <b>systems.</b> It adopts a super-peer network to coordinate distributed <b>grid</b> <b>systems.</b> A super-peer overlay network is constructed for the communication among super-peers in different <b>grid</b> <b>systems.</b> The contribution {{of this study is to}} propose a G 2 G framework for the Grid-to-Grid federation and to implement a preliminary system. Experimental results show that the pro-posed meta-grid framework could improve the system performance in the G 2 G system...|$|R
5|$|Following {{the quake}} {{a program of}} {{rebuilding}} was rapidly put into action, but before it began in earnest some important decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in town planning, decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer piazze and wider main streets, often on a rational <b>grid</b> <b>system.</b> The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning. The city of Grammichele represents an example of these new cities rebuilted with a hexagonal plan.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted {{was hired}} to survey the Bronx and map out streets based on the local geography. Olmsted noted {{the natural beauty of}} the Van Cortlandt estate, {{comparing}} it to Central Park which he designed, and recommended the city purchase the property. The land was part of a proposed greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a <b>grid</b> <b>system</b> similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.|$|E
5|$|In Manhattan, uptown means north (more {{precisely}} north-northeast, {{which is}} the direction the island and its street <b>grid</b> <b>system</b> are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage {{differs from that of}} most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} computer program, called GRID 2 D/ 3 D, {{was developed}} to generate single and composite <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> within geometrically complex two- and three-dimensional (2 - and 3 -D) spatial domains that can deform with time. GRID 2 D/ 3 D generates single <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> by using algebraic grid generation methods based on transfinite interpolation in which the distribution of grid points within the spatial domain is controlled by stretching functions. All single <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> generated by <b>GRID</b> 2 D/ 3 D can have grid lines that are continuous and differentiable everywhere up to the second-order. Also, grid lines can intersect boundaries of the spatial domain orthogonally. GRID 2 D/ 3 D generates composite <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> by patching together two or more single <b>grid</b> <b>systems.</b> The patching can be discontinuous or continuous. For continuous composite <b>grid</b> <b>systems,</b> the <b>grid</b> lines are continuous and differentiable everywhere up to the second-order except at interfaces where different single <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> meet. At interfaces where different single <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> meet, the <b>grid</b> lines are only differentiable up to the first-order. For 2 -D spatial domains, the boundary curves are described by using either cubic or tension spline interpolation. For 3 -D spatial domains, the boundary surfaces are described by using either linear Coon's interpolation, bi-hyperbolic spline interpolation, or a new technique referred to as 3 -D bi-directional Hermite interpolation. Since <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> generated by algebraic methods can have grid lines that overlap one another, GRID 2 D/ 3 D contains a graphics package for evaluating the <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> generated. With the graphics package, the user can generate <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> in an interactive manner with the grid generation part of GRID 2 D/ 3 D. GRID 2 D/ 3 D is written in FORTRAN 77 and can be run on any IBM PC, XT, or AT compatible computer. In order to use GRID 2 D/ 3 D on workstations or mainframe computers, some minor modifications must {{be made in the}} graphics part of the program; no modifications are needed in the grid generation part of the program. The theory and method used in GRID 2 D/ 3 D is described...|$|R

5|$|There is also {{an older}} {{downtown}} <b>grid</b> <b>system</b> {{that was designed to}} be parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel. There is now a plaque {{across the street from the}} Brown Palace Hotel which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old <b>grid</b> <b>system</b> in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after William Larimer, Jr., the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of LoDo, is the oldest street in Denver.|$|E

These highways, while signed from connecting trunklines and shown on the official MDOT map, are maintained by the various counties. They were started in 1970 {{as a supplement to}} the main trunkline system and carry a letter-number combination on the national standard pentagon-shaped marker in blue and yellow. The letter component of the name corresponds to a zone of the state; zones A–F are in the Lower Peninsula while G and H are in the Upper Peninsula. The numbers correspond to a numbered grid within each lettered zone. Other county systems are designated and maintained in each of the 83counties, and signage and numbering practices vary. The state's 533incorporated cities and villages also maintain their own street networks, but townships in the state have no jurisdiction over roads.|$|E
40|$|Complex {{problems}} {{consisting of}} interdependent subtasks {{are represented by}} a direct acyclic graph (DAG). Subtasks of this DAG are scheduled by the scheduler on various grid resources. Scheduling algorithms for grid strive to optimize the schedule.

Combining P 2 P model and <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> we get P 2 P <b>grid</b> <b>systems.</b> P 2 P <b>grid</b> <b>systems</b> require fully decentralized scheduling algorithm, which can schedule interreliant subtasks among nonuniform computational resources. Absence of central scheduler caused the need for decentralized scheduling algorithm. In this paper we have proposed scheduling algorithm which not only is fruitful in optimizing schedule but also does so in fully decentralized fashion. Hence, this unconventional approach suits well for P 2 P <b>grid</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, this algorithm takes accurate scheduling decisions depending on both computation cost and communication cost associated with DAG’s subtasks...|$|R
