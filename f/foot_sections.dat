40|$|An {{autonomous}} subsurface {{drilling device}} has spaced-apart forward and rearward <b>feet</b> <b>sections</b> coupled to an axial thruster mechanism between them to operate using an inchworm method of mobility. In one embodiment, forward and rearward drill sections are carried on forward and rearward <b>feet</b> <b>sections</b> for drilling into {{material in the}} borehole in both forward and rearward directions, to allow the device to maneuver in any direction underground. In another embodiment, a front drill section has a drill head for cutting into the borehole and conveying cuttings through a center spine tube to an on-board depository for the cuttings. The <b>feet</b> <b>sections</b> of the device employ a foot scroll drive unit to provide radial thrust and synchronous motion to the feet for gripping the borehole wall. The axial thrust mechanism has a tandem set of thrusters in which the second thruster is used to provide the thrust needed for drilling, but not walking. A steering mechanism composed of concentric inner and outer eccentric rings provided with the rearward <b>feet</b> <b>section</b> allow small corrections in both direction and magnitude to the drilling direction as drilling commences...|$|R
50|$|In the {{traditional}} front-entry boot design, forward flex is resisted by the friction {{of the lower}} section of the leg cuff moving over the vertically extended top of the <b>foot</b> <b>section,</b> which rises above the ankle. This sliding movement can occur until the upper cuff reaches the flat part of the foot area, where further flex requires the plastic to press down on the skier's foot. Shaping the two parts offers some control over the flex pattern. Some designs have a lip moulded into the <b>foot</b> <b>section</b> that controls this stopping point.|$|R

For this safety reason, the NYPD required that the Scroll be cut up into fifty (50) <b>foot</b> <b>sections,</b> and carried across the Brooklyn Bridge on cardboard poles. Most of the sections were numbered as they were cut, so that the Scroll could be re-assembled in the original order later.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{important}} influences that Macdonald {{has had on}} libraries have been his architectural designs advocating open stacks in the 1930s, and his company’s modular architecture in the 1950s. The Snead Company's production of public and academic libraries {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century provided the framework for open stack libraries. The company's focus on providing book stacks that could also be modified to accommodate card catalogues or reading spaces helped the expanding use of public libraries following World War II. The concept of modular libraries not only signaled the financial demise of Snead and Company, but also the birth of the modern library form. Composed of nine by nine by eight <b>foot</b> <b>sections</b> or [...] "modules", this concept, combined with the production of light-weight, adjustable shelving, revolutionized library planning. Macdonald and the company he headed were integral in the move of the American library system from one of closed, structural stacks, to open stacks that emphasize adjustability which are still in use today.|$|E
5000|$|Tree heights can be {{directly}} measured using a pole for shorter trees, or by climbing a larger tree and measuring the height via a long measuring tape. Pole measurements work well for small trees {{eliminating the need for}} trigonometry involving multiple triangles, and for trees shorter than the minimal range for laser rangefinders. Colby Rucker writes: [...] "For the smallest trees, a carpenter’s six-foot folding ruler works well. Above the ruler’s reach, a pole is needed. An aluminum painter’s pole telescopes to nearly twelve feet (3.65 m), and works quite nicely. It can be adjusted to the height of a small tree, and the pole measured with a steel tape hooked to one end. It can be raised {{to the top of a}} slightly taller tree, and the distance to the ground measured with the carpenters’ rule. For additional reach, two aluminum extensions can be made that fit inside one another, and both fit inside the pole. I used a sturdy aluminum ski pole for the top piece. That extends the pole to about twenty feet (6 m), which is convenient for most work. Occasionally, additional height is needed and additional lengths can be added, but the pole becomes unwieldy at these greater heights. Standard ten <b>foot</b> <b>sections</b> of PVC pipe can be used for the poles, but they tend to become floppier with increasing length." ...|$|E

40|$|For long installations, vacuum {{jacketed}} piping {{often comes}} in 40 <b>foot</b> <b>sections</b> that are butt welded {{together in the}} field. A short can is then welded over the bare pipe connection to allow for insulation {{to be protected from}} the environment. Traditionally, the field joint is insulated with multilayer insulation and a vacuum is pulled on the can to minimize heat leak through the bare section and prevent frost from forming on the pipe section. The vacuum jacketed lines for the Ares I mobile launch platform were to be a combined 2000 feet long, with 60 + pipe sections and field joint cans. Historically, Kennedy Space Center has drilled a hole in the long sections to create a common vacuum with the field joint can to minimize maintenance on the vacuum jacketed piping. However, this effort looked at ways to use a passive system that didn't require a vacuum, but may cryopump to create its own vacuum. Various forms of aerogel, multilayer insulations, and combinations thereof were tested to determine the best method of insulating the field joint while minimizing maintenance and thermal losses...|$|E

The most recent approach is to use arrays of MEMS pressure sensors on the top and bottom surfaces of the wings. By knowing the difference in pressure between {{the top and bottom of}} the wings the structural loads on the wings can be calculated. It was decided that in order to build an array of 1100 sensors it would be necessary to condition the sensors and convert the analog output to a digital form at the site of the pressure measurement. This process was taken one step further by converting the output of the A/D converter into engineering units within the sensor module as well. The array is built using a flex circuit card in one <b>foot</b> <b>sections</b> that can be interconnected to form an array of up to 125 sensors.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} asphalt pavement cracking data on the network level in Connecticut. Pavement performance indicators including longitudinal and transverse cracking as well as roughness are investigated with respect to numerous distinct factors that can be grouped into three categories, i. e. climatic-, pavement structure-, and traffic-related. High-quality climatic data {{was obtained from the}} national weather stations in Connecticut. Maintenance and construction data was used to determine the pavement age and structure amongst several other factors. Traffic data was acquired from the state records and accumulated traffic loading was estimated for all segments based on their age. High definition pavement images collected by the Automatic Road Analyzer (ARAN) van in 2010 were used to quantify the longitudinal and transverse cracking with respect to their location within the pavement surface. The data was analysed in three different methods. First, a Monte Carlo approach in which all segments are sampled one hundred times for randomized 500 <b>foot</b> <b>sections</b> was done. From this, qualitative and quantitative trends were observed to determine the significance each factor had on the three different types of pavement performance indicators. Second, an artificial neural network was constructed for each of the different performance indicators to see how well the different factors predicted the outcome. Lastly, pavement management analysis was done to understand the budget implications of this dataset under four different management scenarios...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of CAD/CAM technology and information technology, {{it is becoming}} possible to satisfy the quality, fit and comfort requirements of footwear design and manufacturing. In the footwear industry, although there are availability of design and manufacture technologies to fulfill the desired requirements, the current methods are very expensive. Cheap and accurate scanners are needed at the retail shop to acquire 3 D foot shape information. This paper proposes a prediction method to model foot shapes through scaling a standard foot by using limited parameters. The accuracy of different number of parameters have been evaluated. Given that commercial expensive scanner accuracy range from 0. 5 to 1 mm, in order to predict 3 D foot shape to an accuracy of around 0. 75 mm, foot outline, foot profile, two <b>foot</b> <b>sections</b> and standard foot model were required. The mean modeling errors were 0. 76 mm and 0. 75 mm of the right foot and left foot respectively. Results indicate that if more sections are used the modeling error decreases but this will increase {{the cost of the}} scanner and the computational complexity. This method provides a cost effective method to substitute expensive 3 D foot scanners that usually use laser-based technology. Relevance to industry: : This method provides the core algorithm for the development of low cost 3 D foot scanners for footwear mass-customization. CCD cameras can be used to capture foot profile and outline, while fixed line laser can be used to obtain two key sections. This method reduces the need for expensive linear gears and optical systems. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 800 ft. of {{continuous}} core was recovered from borehole SB- 15 D (on unit 15, {{near the site}} of the abandoned Geysers Resort) during a recently completed drilling operation funded by the USDOE. Sections of this core were collected at 50 ft intervals for subsequent examination as drilling proceeded. Five <b>foot</b> <b>sections</b> were not removed at the drill site, but were sealed in the innermost sleeve of a triple tube coring system to minimize drying and disturbance of the core. All cores remained sealed and were radiographed within 72 hours of drilling: the five foot core from near 1400 ft. was scanned within 18 hours of drilling. A third generation x-ray scanner, which uses high energy radiation to penetrate the aluminum sleeve and 3. 5 inch cores, was used to make preliminary radiographs and to collect multiple views of the sample as the core is rotated in front of the beam. True three dimensional tomographs are then reconstructed from the data. At present, the images have a spatial resolution of approximately 140 micrometers and can resolve contrast differences of 0. 2 %. The tomographs clearly show differences in lithology with depth in the reservoir. Partially filled fractures, vein selvage and vuggy porosity are all evident in parts of the core. A principle goal of the imaging effort is to help determine the fluid content of the reservoir. Important questions to investigate include water loss during core recovery, infiltration of drilling fluid, and the heterogeneous distribution of pore fluid. Images show that radial gradients in x-ray attenuation commonly occur in jacketed cores. Regions of excess attenuation extend about halfway into the 3. 5 in. core, and are probably caused by mud invasion induced by capillarity of the small scale porosity of the graywacke matrix. X-ray measurements will be coordinated with other independent measurements of fluid content underway in separate studies, particularly NMR spectroscopy of frozen ''pressure core'', and compressional velocity and electrical resistivity measurements...|$|E

40|$|A medical {{examination}} couch {{is a primary}} piece of equipment {{in the health care}} delivery system. Unfortunately, the current design of examination couches used by Australian general and nursing practitioners is inadequate. Incompatibility of the couches with physical (anthropometric) dimensions and a majority of medical procedures contribute to risks of Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs) or musculoskeletal problems among practitioner-users. The inappropriate height, width and gynaecological attachments of the existing couches also cause patient discomfort. This research aimed to develop a new examination couch design in order to improve practitioners' effectiveness, efficiency, health and safety while enhancing patient comfort. Ergonomics and user inclusivity were implemented in the vital stages of the couch development process. Practitioner and patient surveys, reviews of patient positions, medical procedures and equipment, Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and an ergonomic analysis of couches in the Australian market were conducted to develop design criteria. The design criteria development demonstrated that adjustable height, head, body and <b>foot</b> <b>sections</b> were the major features, and adjustable gynaecological footpads and instrument placement (drawers) were the most important attachments. A wide variety of anthropometric data was applied to the development of design specifications and adjustments. To produce a prototype for a new examination couch design developed from the ergonomic research and initial user surveys, the researcher collaborated with a medical couch manufacturer, Metron Medical Australia Pty Ltd. Through this collaboration, the developed criteria and specifications were applied to actual production processes. User trials (a focus group, practitioner and patient surveys and personal communication) were conducted to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the couch prototype in a real clinical environment. From the trials, modifications to particular couch features were identified if they were considered difficult to operate, unnecessary or uncomfortable for patients. For example, the mechanism of the gynaecological footpads, which comprised three different adjustment controls, had to be simplified in order to avoid confusion and time consumption. The footpads had also to be equipped with straps or half a shoe to increase patient comfort and security. The collaborating manufacturer will need to adapt the design modifications from the user trials and conduct more extensive engineering research and value analysis for a final production couch model. Nevertheless, this research succesfully demonstrated the significance of ergonomics and user-centred design in developing design criteria more effectively, detecting usability problems before the couch is brought to the market, and in saving the manufacturer's overall product development costs...|$|E
