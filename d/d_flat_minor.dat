50|$|The {{first two}} {{movements}} of the work are coupled together and scored in C major in 2/4 and 3/4 time marked Allegro non troppo. They open with a glissando ranging over two octaves in the treble voice which culminates in the statement of the main theme centered on two percussive chord structures. This leads {{to a series of}} rhythmatic arpeggios in the key of <b>D</b> <b>flat</b> <b>minor</b> followed by a series of descending sixteenth note groupings echoing the main theme. The theme is subsequently restated in the key of D sharp and eventually progresses into the key of F flat. The thematic motif soon descends into the bass voice where it heralds an arpeggio in the treble voice.|$|E

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 46 : 26 in lengthThis program encompasses {{a wide variety}} of styles from the Baroque period to the contemporary period including some pieces from the musical theater genre. The texts describe various human emotions and are set in different styles, moods and colors. Two "da capo arias" by Handel begin the program. The first one, "V'adoro pupille" from the opera Giulio Cesare, is Cleopatra's well-loved aria used to seduce Caesar. The second aria, "Tornamia a vagheggiar" is from the opera Alcina. "Tornami a vagheggiar" is written with a number of florid passages, making it stylistically unnecessary to add too much ornamentation. In contrast, "V'adoro pupille" is more simple and melodic, so the liberal use of ornamentation is appropriate. Three German Lieder of Johannes Brahms (1833 - 1897) comprise the next group. Brahm's songs balance both conservative and expressive elements. The first one, "O, komme holde Sommernacht," has a triplet accompaniment which creates a dreamlike atmosphere. The accompaniment supports the melodic lines, bringing out the text. "lmmer Ieiser wird mein Schlummer," begins without an introduction. The text is a dark, declamation of death, which contrasts with the desire for a lover to return. It expresses a feeling of grief, fear, and emptiness by using dotted rhythms and short phrases, and lies vocally in a in a low register. The short intense text "Komm, o komme bald!" is repeated with an enharmonic key change from c sharp minor to <b>d</b> <b>flat</b> <b>minor,</b> which gives a sense of resignation. The last piece of this group, "Meine Liebe ist grtin" is a strophic setting of two stanzas. The text compares a young man's passionate, youthful love to a green lilac bush and sunshine. The piano accompaniment helps to represent the unremitting love and passionate energy through a fast tempo, and overlapping and doubling of the vocal line. Giulietta's aria, "Oh, quante volte, oh quante" from the opera I Capu/eti et I Montecchi by Vincenzo Bellini (180 1 - 1835) closes the program. This aria displays Giulietta's deep concern and longing for Romeo during her preparation for the marriage to Tebaldo. "Oh, quante volte, oh quante" begins with a long accompanied recitative that reflects on her desperate situation. The aria that follows expresses her sad hopeless emotion. (See more in text. ...|$|E
