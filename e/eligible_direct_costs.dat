40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 69 - 70) The {{objective of}} this research has been to examine the nature and usefulness of <b>direct</b> <b>costing.</b> After a chapter that presented the historical background {{and the development of}} the <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> concept and which was included in the research to lend perspective and understanding, the study considered cost classifications and analyzed the usefulness of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> for management decision purposes and for external financial reporting. The study also presented a profit sensitivity model so that attention could be focused on the variance in results obtained under <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> as compared to the results obtained using absorption costing. This model was included in the study for completeness {{on the assumption that the}} evaluation of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> should not be limited to a consideration of its differences in theory and application, but also its impact on profits as compared to other costing methods. The central conclusions of this study are listed below. 1. The nature of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> is found in the association of fixed or time costs of production with time periods rather than with units of product. 2. <b>Direct</b> <b>cost</b> statements help make management aware of patterns of cost behavior and relevant cost classifications and thus aid in solving decision problems. 3. <b>Direct</b> <b>costing</b> presents income statements where the fluctuation in income is related to the fluctuations in sales, rather than to the fluctuation in both sales and production, and can aid in evaluating efficiency. 4. <b>Direct</b> <b>costing</b> has not had general acceptance for published financial reports even though it may be used for planning and controlling purposes. Because the criteria applied in the case of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> differ from the criteria applied for absorption costing, the controversy over the use of <b>direct</b> or absorption <b>costing</b> for external reports will persist. 5. The impact of <b>direct</b> <b>costing</b> for profit determination as demonstrated by the sensitivity model developed for the study is significant even for reasonably low proportions of fixed overhead cost and relatively balanced production and sales volumes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to estimate the annual <b>direct</b> disease-related <b>cost</b> of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during the first 6 yr and to determine which socio-demographic and clinical characteristics relate to these costs. The study population consisted of 424 RA patients {{who had participated in}} a (population-based) trial on therapeutic strategies for early RA since 1990 and were not lost to follow-up in April 1996. A questionnaire on costs due to RA was sent to these patients; 363 (86 %) completed questionnaires were analysed. The total annual <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> per patient was estimated by adding up the costs of health care workers, days admitted to care facilities, medication, monitoring for side-effects, alternative medicine, adaptations in the home, devices, and other <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> such as travelling expenses.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of raising external equity capital for US real estate investment trust (REIT) initial public offerings (IPOs). Design/methodology/approach – The study provides recent evidence on total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> for a comprehensive dataset of 125 US REIT IPOs from 1996 until June 2010. A multivariate OLS regression is performed to determine significant factors influencing the level of total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> and also underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses. Findings – The study finds economies of scale in total <b>direct</b> <b>costs,</b> underwriting fees and non-underwriting expenses. The equally (value) weighted average total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> are 8. 33 percent (7. 52 percent), consisting of 6. 49 percent (6. 30 percent) underwriting fees and 1. 87 percent (1. 22 percent) non-underwriting direct expenses. The study finds a declining trend of total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> for post 2000 IPOs which is attributed to the declining trend in both underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses. Offer size is a critical determinant for both total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> and their individual components and inversely affects these <b>costs.</b> The total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> are found significantly higher for equity REITs than for mortgage REITs and are also significantly higher for offers listed in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Underwriting fees appear to be negatively influenced by the offer price, the number of representative underwriters involved in the issue, industry return volatility and the number of potential specific risk factors but positively influenced by prior quarter industry dividend yield and ownership limit identified in the prospectus. After controlling for time trend, the paper finds REIT IPOs incur higher non-underwriting direct expenses in response to higher industry return volatility prior to the offer. Originality/value – This paper adds to the international REIT IPO literature by exploring a number of new influencing factors behind total <b>direct</b> <b>costs,</b> underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses.

Methods: Results are reported from a study that matched 195 households who had suffered a maternal death to 384 households that experienced a childbirth without maternal death in rural areas of three provinces in China, using quantitative questionnaire to compare differences of <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>costs</b> between two groups. Findings: The <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of a maternal death {{were significantly higher than}} the costs of a childbirth without a maternal death (US$ 4, 119 vs. $ 370, p, 0. 001). More than 40 % of the <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> were attributed to funeral expenses. Hospitalization and emergency care expenses were the largest proportion of non-funeral <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> and were higher in households with maternal death than the comparison group (US$ 2, 248 vs. $ 305, p, 0. 001).

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is a prevalent condition {{associated with}} pain, joint destruction and morbidity. <b>Direct</b> healthcare <b>costs</b> are 2 to 3 {{times higher than}} average costs for individuals of similar age and gender. Furthermore, utilisation and costs rise with age and disease duration. Managed care has become an increasingly popular way to organise and finance the delivery of healthcare. Studies comparing {{the quality of care}} in health maintenance organisations and fee-for-service settings have found few differences in outcomes, although reduced costs have been attributed to lower hospitalisation rates in patients with RA. We reviewed 10 studies of the <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of RA. In 1996 dollars, <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> ranged from $US 2299 per person per year in Canada to $US 13 549 in a US study focusing on patients who have been hospitalised only. Surprisingly, the contributions to <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> - hospital care, medications and physician visits - remained relatively stable over time and the setting of care. Hospitalisation costs were the highest component of <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> accounting, generally, for 60 % or more of costs while only approximately 10 % of patients with RA were hospitalised. The only exception was a managed care setting where hospitalisation costs were 16 % of total <b>direct</b> <b>costs.</b> In managed care settings, costs of medications were proportionately higher than in fee-for-service settings. We conclude that in studies of the <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of RA the components of costs have remained relatively stable over time.

Methods The German Federal Statistical Office provided data on the <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> of treating hyperkinetic disorder, epilepsy and asthma in Germany for 2002, 2004, and 2006. The <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of treatment incurred by hyperkinetic disorder in these years were compared with those incurred by epilepsy and asthma. Results The total <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> of treatment for the hyperkinetic disorder was € 177 million in 2002, € 234 million in 2004, and € 341 million in 2006.
