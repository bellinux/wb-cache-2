25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in my district. He believed in {{what we were doing}} is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E

60|$|Yes, sir. She came a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> {{with her}} little boy. They are with Mrs. Starkweather.|$|E

I have been so lonely--and then you--you came, and the world grew bright and warm--a <b>few</b> short <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> you held me--in your arms--a <b>few</b> short <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> and it seemed my dream of {{happiness}} had come true--and now you dash it from me-- ...|$|R
50|$|His {{first goal}} in the Lebanese league came on 23 January 1993 when he scored the second goal for Homentmen against Tadamon Tyre in the 54th <b>minute.</b> <b>Few</b> years <b>ago,</b> he {{returned}} to his original country, Armenia, where he currently lives.|$|R
6000|$|... (11 o'clock.)--While I {{was putting}} up my <b>few</b> books, a <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> a little {{embroidered}} marker {{fell out of}} one of them, which I had not observed in the pages before; and which I recognised as having been worked for me by Clara. I have a memorial of my sister in my possession, after all! Trifling as it is, I shall preserve it about me, as a messenger of consolation in the time of adversity and peril.|$|R
6000|$|His cousin {{shook her}} head mournfully. [...] "And a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I was nearly observing that you had lost your sense of humour!" ...|$|E

60|$|Colonel Harris, sitting {{near his}} daughter, {{would have given}} worlds {{to know what she}} thought. He himself {{did not know what to}} think. His simple, unsophisticated mind was in a maze. The {{question}} of Luke's possible guilt had suddenly loomed up before him, dissipating the former blind impulse of partisanship and loyalty. Mr. Dobson too looked puzzled, the old family solicitor who had seen Luke and his brothers and sister grow up, who a <b>few</b> hours, nay <b>minutes,</b> <b>ago</b> would have sworn to his client's innocence before the entire world, he too now was face to face with a hideous feeling of doubt.|$|R
6000|$|... "With the Servian Minister's wife. I shall excuse myself early. It {{is a vital}} {{necessity}} that we {{talk for}} a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before you leave here. Five <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I sent a note to your rooms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{does not}} matter," [...] was the grave reply. [...] "Ten <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I had an urgent {{telephone}} call from our mutual friend. His Excellency {{told me that he}} was sending a special messenger, and begged me to give you a <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> I have left a conference of some importance, and I am here." ...|$|R
6000|$|COLONEL, to Steve, who {{is indeed}} the more bewildered of the two, 'And a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I assure you she was weeping on my shoulder!' ...|$|E
60|$|All {{that had}} {{happened}} a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> in the blueberry patch seemed a far-off dream; the reality had died out of the looks and words.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity {{you were}} not here a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> I have just bought a picture. You might have put the thing through for me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Russell made an {{influential}} {{analysis of the}} omphalos hypothesis enunciated by Philip Henry Gosse—that any argument suggesting {{that the world was}} created as if it were already in motion could just as easily make it a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> old as a few thousand years: [...] There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> exactly as it then was, with a population that [...] "remembered" [...] a wholly unreal past. There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> Bertrand Russell ...|$|R

50|$|Rose's 2014 video Palisades in Palisades {{focused on}} the human {{relationship}} {{with the natural world}} and was shot in Palisades Interstate Park in New Jersey. Her video A <b>Minute</b> <b>Ago</b> focuses on Philip Johnson's Glass House and was shown in Rose's exhibition, Palisades, at Serpentine Gallery in London in 2015.

60|$|She {{smiled a}} little half-heartedly. It was curious that she found herself {{contrasting}} for a moment this very elegant young man with her roughly dressed companion of a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} in my garden a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> having a pipe before {{finishing}} {{the rest of my}} papers, and Wyatt dropped from the wall on to my herbaceous border." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said, [...] "I did {{not know}} you were here until a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> and I will not keep you now. I think the Señora is waiting for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're all right," [...] {{repeated}} Bill. [...] "One good turn deserves another, Tom. You {{saved my}} life a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> and now I've hauled you out o' the water, old boy." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{turned away}} with a little sigh. The tragedy which a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> she had seen looming up, eluded her. She had courted a dénouement in vain. He was too clever.|$|E
