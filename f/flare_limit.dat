40|$|A {{modified}} Doppler Global Velocimeter (DGV) {{was developed}} to measure the velocity within the boundary layer above a flat plate in a supersonic flow. Classic laser velocimetry (LV) approaches {{could not be used}} since the model surface was composed of a glass-ceramic insulator in support of heat-transfer measurements. Since surface <b>flare</b> <b>limited</b> the use of external LV techniques and windows placed in the model would change the heat transfer characteristics of the flat plate, a novel approach was developed. The input laser beam was divided into nine equal power beams and each transmitted through optical fibers to a small cavity within the model. The beams were then directed through 1. 6 -mm diameter orifices to form a series of orthogonal beams emitted from the model and aligned with the tunnel centerline to approximate a laser light sheet. Scattered light from 0. 1 -micron diameter water condensation ice crystals was collected by four 5 -mm diameter lenses and transmitted by their respective optical fiber bundles to terminate at the image plane of a standard two-camera DGV receiver. Flow measurements were made over a range from 0. 5 -mm above the surface to the freestream at Mach 3. 51 in steady state and heat pulse injected flows. This technique provides a unique option for measuring boundary layers in supersonic flows where seeding the flow is problematic or where the experimental apparatus does not provide the optical access required by other techniques...|$|R

Methods. The Rituximab in AAV trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the rate of remission induction among patients treated with RTX (n = 99) and patients treated with CYC followed by AZA (n = 98). Glucocorticoids were tapered {{over a period of}} 5 months. The primary outcome measure was lack of disease activity without glucocorticoid treatment at 6 months. To determine the most important reason for failure to achieve the primary outcome, 7 hierarchical categories of reasons were defined retrospectively (uncontrolled disease, adverse event leading to therapy discontinuation, severe <b>flare,</b> <b>limited</b> <b>flare,</b> Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's Granulomatosis > 0, prednisone treatment at any dosage, and other). Results. Although remission (lack of disease activity) was achieved in 170 of the 197 patients (86 %) in the first 6 months, the primary outcome measure was not achieved in 42 %. There were 3 deaths. Twenty-four percent of the patients failed to achieve the primary end point due to active disease: 10 (5 %) experienced uncontrolled disease in the first month and 37 (19 %) experienced flares after initial improvement. In the majority of such patients, treatment with blinded crossover or according to best medical judgment led to disease control. Ninety-one percent of patients who had uncontrolled disease or experienced a severe flare had proteinase 3 (PR 3) -ANCA. When patients with uncontrolled disease were excluded from analysis, those who were PR 3 -ANCA positive were found to experience fewer flares when treated with RTX compared to CYC/AZA (8 of 59 [14 %] versus 20 of 62 [32 %]; P = 0. 02). Neither ANCA titers nor B cell counts predicted disease flare. Conclusion. Current treatment regimens are largely successful in controlling AAV, but in approximately one-fourth of patients, active disease persists or recurs in the first 6 months despite treatment. PR 3 - ANCA positivity is a risk factor for recurrence or persistence of severe disease. ANCA titers and B cell detectability are poor predictors of both disease relapse and disease quiescence in the first 6 months. ...|$|R
40|$|PSR B 1259 - 63 is a gamma-ray {{binary system}} {{composed}} of a high spindown pulsar and a massive star. Non-thermal emission up to TeV energies is observed near periastron passage, attributed to emission from high energy e+e- pairs accelerated at the shock with the circumstellar material from the companion star, resulting in a small-scale pulsar wind nebula. Weak gamma-ray emission was detected by the Fermi/LAT at the last periastron passage, unexpectedly followed 30 days later by a strong <b>flare,</b> <b>limited</b> to the GeV band, during which the luminosity nearly reached the spindown power of the pulsar. The origin of this GeV flare remains mysterious. We investigate whether the flare could {{have been caused by}} pairs, located {{in the vicinity of the}} pulsar, up-scattering X-ray photons from the surrounding pulsar wind nebula rather than UV stellar photons, as usually assumed. Such a model is suggested by the geometry of the interaction region at the time of the flare. We compute the gamma-ray lightcurve for this scenario, based on a simplified description of the interaction region, and compare it to the observations. The GeV lightcurve peaks well after periastron with this geometry. The pairs are inferred to have a Lorentz factor ~ 500. They also produce an MeV flare with a luminosity ~ 1 e 34 erg/s prior to periastron passage. A significant drawback is the very high energy density of target photons required for efficient GeV emission. We propose to associate the GeV-emitting pairs with the Maxwellian expected at shock locations corresponding to high pulsar latitudes, while the rest of the non-thermal emission arises from pairs accelerated in the equatorial region of the pulsar wind termination shock.

40|$|We analyze three {{scenarios}} {{to address}} the challenge of ultrafast gamma-ray variability reported from active galactic nuclei. We focus on the energy requirements imposed by these scenarios: (i) external cloud in the jet, (ii) relativistic blob propagating through the jet material, and (iii) production of high-energy gamma rays in the magnetosphere gaps. We show that while the first two scenarios are not constrained by the flare luminosity, there is a robust upper limit on the luminosity of flares generated in the black hole magnetosphere. This limit depends weakly on {{the mass of the}} central black hole and is determined by the accretion disk magnetization, viewing angle, and the pair multiplicity. For the most favorable values of these parameters, the luminosity for 5 -minute <b>flares</b> is <b>limited</b> by 2 × 10 ^ 43 erg s^- 1, which excludes a black hole magnetosphere origin of the flare detected from IC 310. In the scopes of scenarios (i) and (ii), the jet power, which is required to explain the IC 310 flare, exceeds the jet power estimated based on the radio data. To resolve this discrepancy in the framework of the scenario (ii), it is sufficient to assume that the relativistic blobs are not distributed isotropically in the jet reference frame. A realization of scenario (i) demands that the jet power during the flare exceeds by a factor 10 ^ 2 the power of the radio jet relevant to a timescale of 10 ^ 8 years.

The aim of our study was to evaluate maternal/neonatal outcome and disease course before, during and after pregnancy. METHODS: Sixty-five pregnancies in 50 women with SV were followed by a multispecialistic team in 8 institutions between 1995 and 2014. Clinical data on pregnancy, 1 year before and 1 year after delivery was retrospectively collected. The rate of pregnancy complications was {{compared to that of}} a General Obstetric Population (GOP) of 3939 women. RESULTS: In 2 patients the diagnosis of SV was done during pregnancy; 59 out of the remaining 63 started when maternal disease was quiescent. We recorded 56 deliveries with 59 live births, 8 miscarriages and 1 fetal death. In SV, preterm, particularly early preterm (< 34 weeks) deliveries and cesarean sections appeared significantly more frequent than in GOP (11. 3 % vs 5. 0 %, p= 0. 049 and 48. 2 % vs 31. 0 %, p= 0. 009). Vasculitis-related complications occurred in 23 pregnancies (35. 4 %), with 5 severe events (7. 7 %) including 3 cases of transient ischemic attack (TIA). Data about the post-partum period were available for 56 pregnancies: 12 flares (21. 4 %) occurred, with 1 severe event (1. 8 %). CONCLUSION: SV patients can have successful pregnancies (especially during a disease remission phase) despite an increased rate of preterm delivery.

40|$|SUMMARY Five {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis and no previous hip joint disease developed an acute disabling arthritis in one hip joint. Roentgenograms were negative and synovial fluid {{from the hip}} joint was inflammatory, but no crystals were seen and cultures were negative. Four of the five patients responded rapidly to intra-articular corticosteroids, {{and none of the}} five has had further hip joint symptoms during a mean follow up period of two years. Key words: transient synovitis. Hip joint involvement in {{patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be defined clinically, but most published observations addressing the problem have focused on roentgenographic abnormalities; by this definition, hip joint involvement has been recog-nised in 30 - 75 % of patients with RA. 1 - 7 Acute flares of articular synovitis are a well recognised phenomenon in RA, though an acute <b>flare</b> of <b>limited</b> distribution should raise the question of a superim-posed infectious process. 8 Flares in the hip joint in patients with RA could be assumed to occur as often as flares in other joints, but no previously published report has specifically addressed this issue.

The observations will be performed within an extensive network of relatively small to medium-size telescopes with apertures of ~ 20 - 200 cm. The starting sample of the objects to be monitored contains (i) low-mass eclipsing binaries with M and K components, (ii) short-period binaries with sdB or sdO component, and (iii) post-common-envelope systems containing a WD, which enable to determine minima with high precision. Since the amplitude of the timing signal increases with the orbital period of an invisible third component, the timescale of project is long, at least 5 - 10 years.

40|$|International audienceThe 23 February 1956 {{ground level}} {{enhancement}} {{of the solar}} cosmic ray intensity (GLE 05) is the most famous among the proton events observed since 1942. But {{we do not have}} a great deal of information on this event due to the absence of solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field measurements at that time. Furthermore, there were no X-Ray or gamma observations and the information on the associated <b>flare</b> is <b>limited.</b> Cosmic ray data was obtained exclusively by ground level detectors of small size and in some cases of a non-standard design. In the present work all available data from neutron monitors operating in 1956 were analyzed, in order to develop a model of the solar cosmic ray behavior during the event. The time-dependent characteristics of the cosmic ray energy spectrum, cosmic ray anisotropy, and differential and integral fluxes have been evaluated utilizing different isotropic and anisotropic models. It is shown that the most outstanding features of this proton enhancement were a narrow and extremely intense beam of ultra-relativistic particles arriving at Earth just after the onset and the unusually high maximum solar particle energy. However, the contribution of this beam to the overall solar particle density and fluency was not significant because of its very short duration and small width. Our estimate of the integral flux for particles with energies over 100 MeV places this event above all subsequent. Perhaps the number of accelerated low energy particles was closer to a record value, but these particles passed mainly to the west of Earth. Many features of this GLE are apparently explained by the peculiarity of the particle interplanetary propagation from a remote (near the limb) source. The quality of the available neutron monitor data does not allow us to be certain of some details; these may be cleared up by the incorporation into the analysis of data from muonic telescopes and ionization chambers operating at that time.

We find that during the flare event X-ray flux varies with UV with no significant time lag, indicating a close correlation of flux variation for X-ray and UV <b>flares.</b> An upper <b>limit</b> of the lag {{is estimated to be}} ∼ 1 min. From a timing analysis for X-ray data, we find that both pulsed and unpulsed flux increase clearly as the flare advances in the entire energy band 0. 15 - 10 keV. The net increase of pulsed flux to the quiescence is, however, small and corresponds to about 3 − 4 % of the increase in unpulsed flux, confirming that a flux variation of flare in AE Aqr is dominated by unpulsed X-rays. A spectral analysis reveals that the energy spectrum {{is similar to that of}} the quiescence at the beginning of the flare, but the spectrum becomes harder as the flare advances.

40|$|Viewing the {{frequency}} {{history of the}} high-quality quartz crystal oscillator onboard Milstar FLT- 1 as a “space experiment, ” we examined {{the response of the}} crystal to various solar flares occurring over the past 4 years. One of the questions we address concerns the influence of enhanced space radiation on a crystal oscillator’s random frequency fluctuations, which, in addition to radiation-induced deterministic effects, could affect the oscillator’s timekeeping ability. Examining the response of the Milstar FLT- 1 crystal oscillator to the large solar flares of 14 July and 9 November 2000, we find clear evidence of a flare-induced deterministic change in oscillator frequency. However, examining the random fluctuations of the oscillator’s frequency about this deterministic variation, we find no evidence of a concomitant change {{in the nature of the}} oscillator’s stochastic behavior. Additionally, we examined the magnitude of the radiation-induced frequency excursion for a number of solar flares, obtaining a scaling relation between maximum frequency excursion and solar proton fluence as measured by GOES satellites.

40|$|In our {{previous}} paper, we have presented a theory {{to explain the}} observed universal correlation between the emission measure (EM=n^ 2 V) and temperature (T) for solar/stellar flares {{on the basis of}} the magnetic reconnection model with heat conduction and chromospheric evaporation. Here n is the electron density and V is the volume. By extending our theory to general situations, we examined the EM-T diagram in detail, and found the following properties: 1) The universal correlation sequence ("main sequence flares") with EM ∝ T^ 17 / 2 corresponds to the case of constant heating flux or equivalently the case of constant magnetic field strength in the reconnection model. 2) The EM-T diagram has a forbidden region, where gas pressure of flares exceeds magnetic pressure. 3) There is a coronal branch with EM ∝ T^ 15 / 2 for T 10 ^ 7 K. This branch is situated left side of the main sequence flares in the EM-T diagram. 4) There is another forbidden region determined by the length of flare loop; a lower <b>limit</b> of <b>flare</b> loop is 10 ^ 7 cm. Small <b>flares</b> near this <b>limit</b> correspond to nanoflares observed by SOHO/EIT. 5) We can plot flare evolution track on the EM-T diagram. A flare evolves from the coronal branch to main sequence flares, then returns to the coronal branch eventually. These properties of the EM-T diagram are similar to those of the HR diagram for stars, and thus we propose that the EM-T diagram is quite useful to estimate the physical quantities (loop length, heating flux, magnetic field strength, total energy and so on) of flares and corona when there is no spatially resolved imaging observations.

40|$|In {{our second}} paper on {{long-term}} quasar variability, we employ {{a much larger}} database of quasars than in de Vries, Becker & White. This expanded sample, containing 35165 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2, and 6413 additional quasars {{in the same area}} of the sky taken from the 2 dF QSO Redshift Survey, allows us to significantly improve on our earlier conclusions. As before, all the historic quasar photometry has been calibrated onto the SDSS scale by using large numbers of calibration stars around each quasar position. We find the following: (1) the outbursts have an asymmetric light-curve profile, with a fast-rise, slow-decline shape; this argues against a scenario in which micro-lensing events along the line-of-sight to the quasars are dominating the long-term variations in quasars; (2) there is no turnover in the Structure Function of the quasars up to time-scales of ~ 40 years, and the increase in variability with increasing time-lags is monotonic and constant; and consequently, (3) {{there is not a single}} preferred characteristic outburst time-scale for the quasars, but most likely a continuum of outburst time-scales, (4) the magnitude of the quasar variability is a function of wavelength: variability increases toward the blue part of the spectrum, (5) high-luminosity quasars vary less than low-luminosity quasars, consistent with a scenario in which variations have limited absolute magnitude. Based on this, we conclude that quasar variability is intrinsic to the Active Galactic Nucleus, is caused by chromatic outbursts / <b>flares</b> with a <b>limited</b> luminosity range and varying time-scales, and which have an overall asymmetric light-curve shape. Currently the model that has the most promise of fitting the observations is based on accretion disk instabilities. Comment: 23 pages, 18 figures.

40|$|We {{search for}} signs of ongoing planet-disk {{interaction}} and study the distribution of small grains at {{the surface of the}} transition disk around RXJ 1615. 3 - 3255 (RX J 1615). We observed RXJ 1615 with VLT/SPHERE. We image the disk {{for the first time in}} scattered light and detect two arcs, two rings, a gap and an inner disk with marginal evidence for an inner cavity. The shapes of the arcs suggest that they probably are segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting for the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination i = 47 ± 2 degrees and find semi-major axes of 1. 50 ± 0. 01 " (278 au), 1. 06 ± 0. 01 " (196 au) and 0. 30 ± 0. 01 " (56 au), respectively. We determine the scattering surface height above the midplane, based on the projected ring center offsets. Nine point sources are detected between 2. 1 " and 8. 0 " separation and considered as companion candidates. With NACO data we recover four of the nine point sources, which we determine not to be co-moving, and therefore unbound to the system. We present the first detection of the transition disk of RXJ 1615 in scattered light. The height of the rings indicate <b>limited</b> <b>flaring</b> of the disk surface, which enables partial self-shadowing in the disk. The outermost arc either traces the bottom of the disk or it is another ring with semi-major axis > 2. 35 " (435 au). We explore both scenarios, extrapolating the complete shape of the feature, which will allow to distinguish between the two in future observations. The most interesting scenario, where the arc traces the bottom of the outer ring, requires the disk truncated at r 360 au. The closest companion candidate, if indeed orbiting the disk at 540 au, would then be the most likely cause for such truncation.

40|$|International audienceContext. The {{effects of}} a planet {{sculpting}} the disk from which it formed {{are most likely to}} be found in disks that are in transition between being classical protoplanetary and debris disks. Recent direct imaging of transition disks has revealed structures such as dust rings, gaps, and spiral arms, but an unambiguous link between these structures and sculpting planets is yet to be found. Aims. We aim to find signs of ongoing planet-disk interaction and study the distribution of small grains at the surface of the transition disk around RXJ 1615. 3 - 3255 (RX J 1615). Methods. We observed RXJ 1615 with VLT/SPHERE. From these observations, we obtained polarimetric imaging with ZIMPOL (R'-band) and IRDIS (J), and IRDIS (H 2 H 3) dual-band imaging with simultaneous spatially resolved spectra with the IFS (YJ). Results. We image the disk for the first time in scattered light and detect two arcs, two rings, a gap and an inner disk with marginal evidence for an inner cavity. The shapes of the arcs suggest that they are probably segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting for the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination i = 47 +/- 2 degrees and find semi-major axes of 1. 50 +/- 0. 01 `' (278 au), 1. 06 +/- 0. 01 `' (196 au) and 0. 30 +/- 0. 01 `' (56 au), respectively. We determine the scattering surface height above the midplane, based on the projected ring center offsets. Nine point sources are detected between 2. 1 `' and 8. 0 `' separation and considered as companion candidates. With NACO data we recover four of the nine point sources, which we determine to be not co-moving, and therefore unbound to the system. Conclusions. We present the first detection of the transition disk of RXJ 1615 in scattered light. The height of the rings indicate <b>limited</b> <b>flaring</b> of the disk surface, which enables partial self-shadowing in the disk. The outermost arc either traces the bottom of the disk or it is another ring with semi-major axis greater than or similar to 2. 35 `' (435 au). We explore both scenarios, extrapolating the complete shape of the feature, which will allow us to distinguish between the two in future observations. The most attractive scenario, where the arc traces the bottom of the outer ring, requires the disk to be truncated at r approximate to 360 au. If the closest companion candidate is indeed orbiting the disk at 540 au, then it would be the most likely cause for such truncation.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Low back pain (LBP) {{is a lifelong}} problem for many. In acute episodes, or as a {{persistent}} condition, LBP is fluctuating in nature, with pain and other features of the condition varying in intensity and duration over time. Symptom flares (also known as flare ups) contribute to this variation and can have {{a great impact on}} the lives of those who have LBP. An important goal of treatments for, and research on, LBP is arguably to decrease symptom flare in both frequency and severity. However, this goal is problematic with little research, and no consensus, on how to define LBP flare. In particular, patients’ understandings of LBP <b>flare</b> have received <b>limited</b> attention in the literature. To appropriately address this issue, we sought to understand how flares are conceptualized by individuals with LBP. Methods We used an inductive, predominantly qualitative methodology, conducting an online survey with 130 individuals who self-reported experiencing LBP. The survey investigated participants’ views on LBP flare including its meaning, features and symptoms, and whether ‘flare’ and ‘pain increase’ were synonymous. Qualitative analysis of responses involved thematic and content analysis with descriptive statistics used for the quantitative component. Results Our data analysis found that participants identified many aspects of a flare to be important. Qualitative analyses highlighted a number of themes including that LBP flare was conceptualized as: (1) an increase in pain and other uncomfortable sensations such as paraesthesia or muscle tension, (2) an increase in the area, quality and/or duration of symptoms, (3) a reduction in physical, cognitive and/or social functioning, and (4) negative psychological and/or emotional factors. Flare was also discussed as a change that was difficult to settle. When participants considered whether ‘flare’ and ‘pain increase’ were synonymous, responses were evenly divided between ‘no’ (47 %) and ‘yes’ (46 %) with remaining participants ‘unsure’. Conclusions The key finding was that many people with LBP do not consider their condition to be flared simply {{on the basis of a}} pain increase. In general, other features were required to also change. Results highlighted that a narrow focus on pain is unlikely to differentiate minor pain events from a flare. These findings are important as they contrast with most commonly used definitions of a flare that focus predominantly on pain increase. Implications Our findings have implications for understanding the trajectory of LBP over time. Understandings derived from perspectives of individuals with LBP highlight that defining flare in LBP is complex. In order to provide person-centred care, individual context and experiences should be taken into account. Therefore, understandings of LBP flare require consideration of factors beyond simply an increase in pain. A comprehensive, person-centred understanding of flare that includes a number of features beyond simply an increase in pain intensity is likely to be useful to better identify flares in research settings, assisting endeavours to understand and reduce LBP. Similarly, in clinical settings a nuanced conceptualisation of flare is likely to help health professionals communicate understandings of flare when working with individuals to manage their LBP...|$|R
