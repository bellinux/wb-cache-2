5|$|Amin Hajee as Bagha (batsman), {{the mute}} drummer. Hajee earlier {{worked in a}} film with Ashutosh. The {{friendly}} association brought Ashutosh to him with the script, which he liked, and thereafter he successfully auditioned for his role. His knowledge of mute people and some assistance from a music band helped <b>him</b> <b>better</b> prepare for his role. Ashutosh, who believed that Amin was like Sylvester Stallone, would refer to him as Stallone during filming.|$|E
5|$|Chandru keeps {{following}} Rekha; one {{day when}} she goes to visit her friend, he makes her unconscious and takes her away to a bungalow in Ooty. When she regains consciousness, he tells {{her that he had}} purchased this house in Ooty only for her, and again asks her to marry him. When Rekha refuses and begs to be freed, he asks her to stay for at least a month so that she can understand <b>him</b> <b>better,</b> and then reduces it to a week. He makes all the arrangements to ensure that she cannot escape. Rekha later slams Chandru with a spade and runs away. However, he catches and imprisons her in the garage of his house, but is hospitalised for his injury.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by Dan Reeves, the successful former {{head coach of the}} Denver Broncos who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took the unusual step of lobbying heavily for the job. Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and Reeves was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at the time because he felt he knew <b>him</b> <b>better</b> from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5000|$|He {{has also}} studied {{the craft of}} acting for the last 10 years. This pursuit has made <b>him</b> a <b>better</b> actor, but more importantly, his studies have enabled <b>him</b> to <b>better</b> {{communicate}} as a director with his actors to get their best performances.|$|R

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and family ties would suggest. Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov {{is of the}} opinion that John was not seeking political refuge in Serbia. Instead, it is most likely that he moved to that country with the belief that Serbia's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure <b>him</b> <b>better</b> career opportunities. Presumably, John accompanied his sister Helena when she moved to Serbia to marry Stephen Dušan in 1332.|$|E
5|$|Limp Bizkit {{joined the}} Warped Tour, {{performing}} alongside the bands Pennywise, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sick of It All, Lagwagon and Blink-182. Preceding their first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal's contributions {{to collaborate with}} <b>him</b> <b>better</b> on stage. In addition to touring with Primus and Deftones, Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band's fanbase, which was largely male, by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band's female fanbase.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's new {{position}} left <b>him</b> <b>better</b> off financially. However, while he also {{became much more}} widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling {{to earn a living}} as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Kogan {{presented}} a symposium at the American Psychiatric Association on {{mental illness and}} musical creativity. The resulting experience was a revelation to him and launched him on a new career. It brought home to him that exploring the psyches of composers made <b>him</b> a <b>better</b> interpreter of their scores, and that understanding the role of music in people's lives made <b>him</b> a <b>better</b> psychiatrist.|$|R

5|$|Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Serbian realist painters of the late 19th century. During his early career, he came to be identified with Orientalist painting, depicting scenes from the Balkans, which were then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Between 1877 and 1882, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he came under the mentorship of painting instructors Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller. Griepenkerl taught the young Jovanović the underlying structural principles of Renaissance and Baroque art, thus helping <b>him</b> <b>better</b> understand spatial problems and the arrangement of large numbers of figures, both moving and static. Müller encouraged Jovanović to take a naturalist approach to painting, recording only what he could see and relying as little as possible on his imagination. It was in this context that Müller instructed Jovanović to make direct studies of Balkan life during his visits home, purposely steering him towards Orientalist painting.|$|E
5|$|Tavares {{was born}} on September 20, 1990 in Mississauga, Ontario, to Barbara and Joe Tavares, who are of Polish and Portuguese descent, respectively. His {{maternal}} grandparents Bolesław and Josephine Kowal immigrated from Poland to Sudbury, Ontario, and his paternal grandparents Manuel and Dorotea Tavares immigrated from Portugal to Toronto, Ontario. At a very young age, Tavares moved to Oakville, Ontario. This is where he was first exposed to minor hockey via the Minor Oaks Hockey Association. Tavares also played soccer and lacrosse, and his highly competitive nature often led him to fight with other players. Tavares excelled at lacrosse, {{following in the footsteps}} of his uncle John Tavares, the all-time scoring leader in the National Lacrosse League (NLL), and was a ball boy for his uncle's NLL team, the Buffalo Bandits. The younger Tavares credits his uncle with teaching him the importance of remaining unselfish, stating that what he learned by following his uncle with the Bandits has made <b>him</b> <b>better</b> both as a person and a hockey player. Many skills he learned in lacrosse—such as spinning off checks and battling in traffic—transferred to ice hockey and improved Tavares' abilities as a goal scorer.|$|E
5|$|Žigić {{was born}} in Bačka Topola, {{in what was then}} SFR Yugoslavia. He began playing {{football}} as a youngster with AIK Bačka Topola, and scored 68 goals from 76 first-team matches over a three-year period in the third tier of Yugoslav football. Military service took him to Bar in 2001, where he was able to continue his goalscoring career with the local second-level club Mornar. A brief spell back in the third tier with Kolubara preceded his turning professional with First League side Red Star Belgrade in 2002. He spent time on loan at third-tier Spartak Subotica before making his Red Star debut in 2003. Despite suggestions that his height, of , made <b>him</b> <b>better</b> suited to sports other than football, Žigić ended the season as First League top scorer, domestic player of the year, league champion and scorer of the winning goal in the cup final. He won a second league–cup double in 2005–06, a second player of the year award, and finished his three-year Red Star career with 70 goals from 109 appearances in all competitions.|$|E

25|$|With all {{his court}} cases against the Nigerian {{government}} {{thrown out of}} court, he delved into the law books, himself being only a mechanical engineer, claiming that he would earn his law degrees in record time, to enable <b>him</b> <b>better</b> argue with the opposition at the federal courts.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, {{he changed}} his first name to Christopher at the {{suggestion}} of Monique van Vooren, who had a nightclub act in which Walken was a dancer and who believed the name suited <b>him</b> <b>better</b> than Ronnie (a pet form of his given name, Ronald), which he was credited as until then. He prefers to be known informally as Chris instead of Christopher.|$|E

5000|$|Paynter {{began playing}} {{instruments}} {{from a young}} age, playing the piano {{at the age of}} seven, and learning guitar and drums {{by the time he was}} 15. At the age of 16, he began playing in touring bands across Australia. Regarding music, Paynter says that it [...] "was always something I was going to do, because it fires up my soul like nothing else". He studied law for a year, but returned to music. Although Paynter liked law school and intends to return, he says the choice was either [...] "tour the country and play guitar or study books", and the decision [...] "was a no-brainer". Paynter says that playing drums makes <b>him</b> a <b>better</b> guitarist, playing guitar makes <b>him</b> a <b>better</b> keyboardist, and playing all three makes <b>him</b> a <b>better</b> singer.|$|R
25|$|After {{the initial}} assault, the Ottoman Army fanned {{out along the}} main {{thoroughfare}} of the city, the Mese, past the great forums, and past the Church of the Holy Apostles, which Mehmed II wanted to provide a seat for his newly appointed patriarch which would help <b>him</b> <b>better</b> control his Christian subjects. Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the Church of the Holy Apostles.|$|E
25|$|As for Picasso... the {{tradition}} {{he came from}} had prepared <b>him</b> <b>better</b> than ours for a problem to do with structure. And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century we {{had no intention of}} prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going to move into a different field.|$|E
25|$|Born of actors, he had {{a passion}} for the theater and for an improvised, {{theatrical}} life. But with all his talents, he frequently succumbed to the quest for pleasure and sex, often avoiding sustained work and established plans, and got himself into trouble when prudent action would have served <b>him</b> <b>better.</b> His true occupation was living largely on his quick wits, steely nerves, luck, social charm, and the money given to him in gratitude and by trickery.|$|E

25|$|Gable's acting coach, Josephine Dillon — {{a theater}} manager in Portland – was 17 {{years older than}} him. She paid to have his teeth {{repaired}} and his hair styled. She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught <b>him</b> <b>better</b> body control and posture. She spent considerable time training his naturally high-pitched voice, which he slowly managed to lower, to gain better resonance and tone. As his speech habits improved, his facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After {{a long period of}} training, Dillon considered him ready to attempt a film career.|$|E
25|$|He {{finally came}} to be {{respected}} {{as one of the}} most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Raphaël Géminiani knew <b>him</b> <b>better</b> than anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques w{{as one of the most}} gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made Géminiani mad with rage on countless occasions but he was always so incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.|$|E
25|$|Janet briefly hands {{leadership}} of the team off to the Vision, though she quickly resumes the role. The new team line-up proves difficult, and Janet clashes with Hercules taking issue with a woman leading. It is during this time that she meets the Space Phantom {{for the second time}} and defeats the villain. During the Secret War, despite being the official leader of the Avengers gathered by the Beyonder, Janet nominates Captain America for {{leadership of}} the assembled heroes as the non-Avengers present know <b>him</b> <b>better.</b> As the conflict unfolds, Janet is briefly captured by Magneto, but she turns the situation to her advantage by pretending to be seduced; she learns Magneto's plans and then defeats him before leaving to alert the Avengers.|$|E
