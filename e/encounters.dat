40|$|The tourist-to-tourist <b>encounter</b> is an {{important}} topic in tourism business. When people travels abroad, they would have high opportunity to interact directly and indirectly with other tourists. This <b>encounter</b> {{could end up with}} <b>encounter</b> conflict negatively or decrease the social distance positively. Consequently, the objective of this research is to investigate the relationship among tourist-to-tourist interactions, role typology, nationality, and tourist’s reaction to <b>encounter.</b> This research concluded that Taiwanese have more experience on <b>encounter</b> conflict than Japanese; higher level of Tourist-to-Tourist <b>encounter</b> could shorten the social distance; and different perception of role play would affect the <b>encounter</b> reaction: conflict and mutual understanding. Finally, the tourist’s role typology moderates the relationship between <b>encounter</b> level and <b>encounter</b> conflict; and the nationality moderates the relationship between <b>encounter</b> level and social distance...|$|R

5|$|Males become {{extremely}} aggressive during musth. Size is {{the determining factor}} in agonistic <b>encounters</b> when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win {{the majority of the}} time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he <b>encounters</b> a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic <b>encounters</b> typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive <b>encounters</b> was highest when patch location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density had no effect on the number of aggressive <b>encounters</b> when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive <b>encounters.</b>|$|E

Time, not money, was the main issue; Trumbull had to deliver in nine months twice the effects as found in Star Wars or Close <b>Encounters,</b> which had taken years to complete. The Glencoe-based facilities the teams had used for Close <b>Encounters</b> were deemed insufficient, and a nearby facility was rented and outfitted with five more stages equipped with camera tracks and systems. Dykstra and his 60-person production house Apogee Company were subcontracted to Trumbull.|$|E

40|$|Models of {{particle}} <b>encounter</b> efficiency borrowed from aerosol fil-tration theory have revolutionised ideas about mechanisms of suspension-feeding (a form of hydrosol filtration), although {{they continue to}} be under-utilised in generating predictions concerning feeding ecology and morphological evolution and in guiding quantitative experimentation. As a complementary tool we model <b>encounter</b> rate, demonstrated with parameterisations of the same particle-encounter mechanisms. The rate models include specific <b>encounter</b> geometry, absent from the prevalent efficiency indices, which is used to refine estimates of the absolute and relative effectiveness of the various <b>encounter</b> mechanisms. Using rate (as opposed to effi-ciency and in accord with optimal foraging theory) as the dependent variable yields very different predictions for optimisation schemes. For example, a larger collector radius reduces <b>encounter</b> efficiency for most mechanisms, but it either increases or leaves unaffected <b>encounter</b> rate. Similarly, an increase in advection velocity often reduces <b>encounter</b> efficiency, but it increases <b>encounter</b> rate for most mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of protein complexes involves an <b>encounter</b> complex, in which proteins show few specific interactions and assume many orientations. Recent kinetic and structural studies have {{shed light on}} this elusive state. It is generally dominated by electrostatic interactions, although hydrophobic interactions can play a role. During the <b>encounter</b> phase the proteins remain largely solvated. In extreme cases, the proteins only form an <b>encounter</b> complex, and in many other complexes, the <b>encounter</b> state constitutes a significant amount (5 % or more), indicating that the energy difference between <b>encounter</b> and productive complexes is small. Thus, the <b>encounter</b> complex represents {{an essential part of}} protein complexes...|$|R

5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and <b>encounters</b> with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial <b>encounters</b> with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E

Nemesis is considerably more powerful than the player and has the ability to use a rocket launcher as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and pursue the player from one area to the next. During one of these <b>encounters,</b> the player can choose to either fight Nemesis or run until he is evaded. A variety of <b>encounters</b> are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on certain choices made by the player.

The study were conducted a qualitative research and a total of 11 respondents were interviewed. The results were as follows: Most online <b>encountered</b> information could satisfy the individual's present and future information needs. Most people acquire <b>encountered</b> information by themselves, and the <b>encountered</b> information came from various sources on the web. Frequent Internet users could be more sensitive to information than others. Moreover, people with higher intrinsic motivation, usually interested or curious about many things, are easy to acquire online IE experience. After having online IE experience, the individuals occasionally feel anxious because of time pressure, furthermore, they want to avoid <b>encountering</b> more information. However, most individuals feel novel and joyful while they <b>encountered</b> information. They even further process <b>encountering</b> information resources and expect to gain more experience about information <b>encountering.</b> In addition, the ideal environments of online information <b>encountering</b> include no commercial advertising, credibility, and a personalized database with the powerful searchable function. 本研究目的在瞭解個體的線上資訊偶遇經驗情形，以及個體所具備的個人特徵對其線上資訊偶遇經驗的影響。本研究分析 11 位受訪者的資訊偶遇經驗並整合研究發現後，得出以下結論並提出後續的實務建議：線上偶遇資訊多為滿足個體現在及未來的資訊需求，且多由自己獲得、資訊來源廣泛。較常接觸並使用網路者，對自己的資訊敏感度具相當信心。內在學習動機較高、對許多事物都感興趣、或好奇心重的個體均易產生線上資訊偶遇經驗。個體偶爾會因資訊的繁雜或時間壓力而對於線上資訊偶遇經驗感到焦慮不安，進而產生想要逃避資訊偶遇的念頭，然多數個體仍會對偶遇資訊感到新奇喜悅，並進一步處理獲取之資訊資源，以期促進更多的資訊偶遇經驗產生。理想的線上資訊偶遇環境是無商業廣告、具公信力、具強大檢索功能的個人化資料庫。頁次： 16 - 3...|$|R
