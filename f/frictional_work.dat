40|$|Rock-ice {{avalanches}} {{larger than}} 1 x 106 m 3 are high magnitude low frequency events {{that may occur}} in all ice-covered high mountain areas {{around the world and}} can cause extensive damage if they reach populated regions. The temporal and spatial evolution of the seismic signature from two events was analyzed and recordings at selected stations were compared to numerical model results of avalanche propagation. The first event is a rock-ice avalanche from Iliamna volcano in Alaska which serves as a 'natural laboratory' with simple geometric conditions. The second one originated on Aoraki/Mt. Cook, New Zealand Southern Alps, and is characterized by a much more complex topography. A dynamic numerical model was used to calculate total avalanche momentum, total kinetic energy, and total <b>frictional</b> <b>work</b> rate, amongst other parameters. These three parameters correlate with characteristics of the seismic signature such as duration and signal envelopes, while other parameters such as flow depths, flow path and deposition geometry are well in agreement with observations. The total <b>frictional</b> <b>work</b> rate shows the best correlation with the absolute seismic amplitude suggesting that it may be used as an independent model evaluation criterion and in certain cases as model calibration parameter. The good fit is likely because the total <b>frictional</b> <b>work</b> rate represents the avalanche’s energy loss rate, part of which is captured by the seismometer. Deviations between corresponding calculated and measured parameters result from site and path effects which affect the recorded seismic signal, or indicate deficiencies of the numerical model. The seismic recordings contain additional information about when an avalanche reaches changes in topography along the runout path and enable more accurate velocity calculations. The new concept of direct comparison of seismic and avalanche modelling data helps to constrain the numerical model input parameters and to improve the understanding of (rock-ice) avalanche dynamics...|$|E

Here we describe a method using thermal maturation of organic molecules in sedimentary rock {{to determine whether}} a fault has experienced differential heating compared to surrounding rocks. We demonstrate the utility of this method on an ancient, pseudotachylyte-hosting megathrust at Pasagshak Point, Alaska. Measurements of the ratio of thermally stable to thermally unstable compounds (diamondoids/n-alkanes) show that the melt-bearing rocks have higher thermal maturity than surrounding rocks. Furthermore, the mineralogy of the survivor grains and the presence of any organic molecules allow us to constrain the temperature rise during the ancient earthquakes to 840 – 1170 °C above ambient temperatures of ∼ 260 °C. From this temperature rise, we estimate that the <b>frictional</b> <b>work</b> of the earthquake was ∼ 105 – 228 MJ/m 2.

The shear experiment runs were performed under a sufficiently low slip rate of 56 μm/s to avoid the effect of frictional heating. Furthermore, to ensure the TL intensity increase due to a shear fracture (Hiraga et al. 2002) was effectively negligible, we used samples previously fine-grained to 1 - 8 μm diameter.

Linear friction welding (LFW) has been used successfully to bond non-axisymmetric components of a range of materials including titanium alloys, steels, aluminum alloys, nickel, copper, and also dissimilar material combinations. The technique is useful in the research of quality of the joints and in reducing costs of components and parts of the aeronautic and automotive industries.

Copyright © 2016 by the American Rock Mechanics Association. During comminution, several energy {{dissipation}} processes operate simultaneously, including plastic work due to internal friction, fracture energy release due to particle breakage, and plastic work {{due to the}} rearrangement of fragments. Recent {{studies show that the}} plastic work due to particle rearrangement amounts to an important part in the total dissipated energy, which is much larger than the fracture energy released to create new surfaces, especially at high stress. This evolution of energy distribution between breakage dissipation and plastic work during the comminution of granular material manifests as a transition from brittleness to ductility. However, there is still no micromechanical model that can capture this transition. Breakage mechanics is a continuum mechanics theory that allows to analyzing the behavior of granular materials based on statistical and thermodynamic principles. We use this theory to propose a model that couples the {{energy dissipation}} caused by breakage and <b>frictional</b> plastic <b>work.</b> A friction plasticity parameter is coupled to the breakage parameter. Physically, the relationship between plasticity and breakage translates: (1) the increase of the dissipation induced by breakage in front of that induced by plastic deformation when fragments produced by breakage have rougher surfaces with higher friction angles than the non broken particles; and reversely; (2) the increase of the dissipation induced by plastic deformation in front of that induced by breakage when the multiplication of fragments results in higher particle coordination numbers, shielding effects and higher particle strength. Our modeling hypothesis is supported by experimental observations reported in the literature, and simulations show that our coupled breakage-plasticity model better captures the brittle-ductile transition observed in granular materials. The proposed modeling approach is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of quasi-static confined comminution, which is a major issue in civil engineering, powder technology and the mineral industry...|$|R

Pin-on-disk testing was conducted through a range of applied normal loads and sliding velocities in an unlubricated condition. Average friction coefficient, friction work, and specific wear rates were calculated from the data and microscopy techniques were used to observe and characterize wear mechanisms. Experimental results show a dependence of average coefficient of friction {{as a function of}} <b>frictional</b> <b>work.</b> Also shown is the wear rate dependence on <b>frictional</b> <b>work,</b> predicated by a wear mechanism change.

The second area of research is in the in situ spatial study of friction, complemented by monitoring changes in electrical contact resistance (ECR). Pin-on-disk testing of samples was done under low normal loads and velocities. Friction and electrical contact resistance measurements were taken spatially in the wear track during each friction cycle, giving a spatial evolution of friction and resistance change, in situ. Results show a lowering in the ECR under increased friction cycles, which was closely related to a change in the friction coefficient of the material. Using surface profilometry and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, we determined that the lowering of resistance is a result of surface modification through wear and development of a friction induced conductive tribo-film.

Comparison of energy-power parameters provides opportunities to assert their changes, in particular the shift in rotary forging lower end surface of the contact area is reduced and cell deformation force is reduced, and identify the critical values decrease cell contact. Forced flow of material in the radial direction and, depending on the direction of increases or decreases the area uncontact strains in the peripheral part of the flange and forming a lateral curvature of the surface. There are general prerequisites for the emergence and positive action in the contact center of shear strains. Originality/value. Controlled formation in a given direction is the new rotary forging tool that allows you to significantly expand the technological capabilities of the process. ?????? ????????? ?????????????????? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????? ??????? ????? ? ????? ???????? ?? ????? ???????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????????. ????? ?? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ??? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ??????, ???????, ? ????????, ? ????????????? ???????????? ??????. ??????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ?????????? ???????? ??? ??????, ??? ???? ??????????? ????????????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ???????????. ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????????????? ?????? ??? ????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ?????? ??????, ? ??????: ????????????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ???????? ??????????? ? ??????????, ????????? ???????? ??????? ????????? ?? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????, ????????????? ??????? ????????? ?????? ?????????????? ?? ??????? ??????????? ? ????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ????? ???????????...|$|R
40|$|Scales {{engagement}} {{can contribute}} significantly to nonlinear bending behavior of elastic substrates with rigid biomimetic scales. In this letter, we investigate the role of friction in modulating the nonlinearity that arises due to self-contact of scales through an analytical investigation. We model the friction as dry Coulomb type friction between rigid links and the substrate is taken to be linear elastic. Our results reveal that frictional effects give rise to two possible locking mechanisms, namely static friction lock and kinetic friction lock. These locks arise due {{to a combination of}} interfacial behavior and geometry. In addition to these extremes, the frictional behavior is found to increase stiffness of the structure. This dual nature of friction which influences both system operation and its terminal limit results in the maximum relative <b>frictional</b> <b>work</b> to lie at intermediate friction coefficients and not at the extremes of frictional limits.

40|$|Abstract. Friction stir {{channelling}} (FSC) is {{a relatively}} new solid-state manufacturing technology able to produce conformal channels in a monolithic plate in a single step. During the FSC process the metal workpiece material is softened by the heat energy generated from dissipation during: plastic deformation, internal material flow and <b>frictional</b> <b>work</b> between the tool and the metal workpiece. The mechanical performance of a friction stirred channel aluminium alloy is affected by microstructure surrounding the channel. A new methodology that simulates a realistic 2 D microstructure from experimental metallographic characterization and tensile tests was developed using the commercial software ABAQUS to study the mechanical behaviour of the friction stirred channel 5083 -H 111 aluminium alloy. Four-point bending tests were simulated and compared with experimental results. The Ramberg-Osgood model was also adopted in the finite element analysis. It is seen from this investigation that microstructure can significantly affect the bending strength of friction stirred channel plates...|$|E
