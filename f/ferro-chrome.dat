40|$|Middleburg <b>Ferro-Chrome</b> (MFC), {{a company}} in Samancor Chrome, {{commissioned}} a new <b>Ferro-Chrome</b> smelter in March 2009. This is a 60 MW DC-arc furnace with a DC power supply for the smelting of Transvaal chromite ore fines. With the benefit of 12 years experience with this technology while operating a 44 MW DC-arc furnace, MFC mitigated all known challenges and considered up scaling risk in the new plant, which had a rapid ramp up to full power in Q 2 of 2009. Good operating practices, as made possible by robust equipment selection, including a thyristor rectifier set of proven technology, and operation with optimal slag chemistry, leads to a safe and effective plant operation. With the optimized furnace design and a correctly sized power conditioning system, using only standard (static) harmonic filters and a correctly sized smoothing reactor, the arc furnace is not a ‘dirty load ’ for the utility, staying well within IEC limits for power quality. A patented Arc Compensation system is installed and allows for full arc position control (to compensate for magnetic field induced arc deflection) so that a symmetrical crucible is maintained, significantly benefitting refractory life. The principle benefits gained from the MFC process {{is the fact that}} ore fines are processed, without metallurgical coke, and higher chrome recoveries are achieved compared to other smelting technologies when using a DC open arc for smelting. ...|$|E

Synthesis {{of second}} {{sequence}} austenite stainless steel named A 2 using extracted minerals from Indonesian mines {{has been carried}} out. The starting materials for austenite alloy consist of granular ferro-scrap, nickel, <b>ferro-chrome,</b> ferro-manganese, and ferro-silicon. The second sequence composition differs from the former first sequence. This A 2 sequence contained more nickel, meanwhile titanium element had not been added explicitly to it, and just been found from raw materials contents or impurities, as well as carbon content in the alloy. However before the actual alloying work started, the first important step was {{to carry out the}} determination of the fractional amount of each starting material necessary to form an austenite stainless steel alloy as specified. Once the componential fraction of each base alloy-element was determined, the raw materials are weighed on the mini-balance. After the fractional quantities of each constituent have been computed, an appropriate amount of these base materials are weighed separately on the micro scale.

40|$|The {{thermal state}} in {{submerged-arc}} furnaces (S. A. F.) producing ferro alloys {{is important for}} the conditions of both the grade of alloy produced as well as specific energy consumption. The temperature profile in the S. A. F. is affected by the endothermic chemical reactions and the rate of gas evolution. The gas evolution com-mences at about 900 C due to the reduction of iron in the ore. A first-principle-based 2 -D model has been developed to predict the temperature profile in the furnace. In this study, four ores of different grades have been considered in order to simulate the thermal profile in the S. A. F. The influence of the composition of the ore on the thermal profile and its significance in rationalisation of charge distribution to optimise the process are discussed. 1.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a concept to utilise Carbon-dioxide for Steel-Making {{and would like}} to name it after the first author as OSRAM-CO$_ 2 $-SM process. We found in our lab {{experiments}} that the carbon content in high-carbon <b>ferro-chrome</b> metallic powders has come down from 7 % to 1 % when pure CO$_ 2 $ gas with partial pressure of 1 atmosphere is passed through a horizontal retort furnace maintained at 1100 $^o$ C for 24 hours. Our results clearly demonstrated that decarburisation can be very effective, when CO$_ 2 $ is used at temperatures where it is unstable and the Boudouard reaction which is endothermic in nature is more favoured. Based on these findings, we propose the OSRAM-CO$_ 2 $-SM process in which CO$_ 2 $ shall be used as the decarburising agent. CO$_ 2 $ is to be passed into a specially designed converter provided with heating mechanism to maintain the contents from blast furnace in a molten state for decarburisation of the melt. The out coming hot gases consisting of CO has to be burnt in a combustion chamber with stochiometric proportions of pure O$_ 2 $ to produce CO$_ 2 $ at a partial pressure close to 1 atm. The process will be extremely useful as it involves reuse and recycle of CO$_ 2 $ and in turn would reduce the overall amount of CO$_ 2 $ discharged into the atmosphere.

40|$|This {{research}} is part of a project whose scope was to investigate the engineering properties of new non-commercial alloy formulations based on the Cu rich corner of the Cu-Fe-Cr ternary system with the primary aim of exploring {{the development of a new}} cost-effective high-strength, high-conductivity copper alloy. Promising properties have been measured for the following alloys: Cu- 0. 7 wt%Cr- 0. 3 wt%Fe and Cu- 0. 7 wt%Cr- 2. 0 wt%Fe. This paper reports on the microstructural characterisation of these alloys and discusses the mechanical and electrical properties of these alloys in terms of their microstructure, particularly the formation of precipitates. These alloys have evinced properties that warrant further investigation. Cost modelling has shown that Cu- 0. 7 wt%Cr- 0. 3 wt%Fe is approximately 25 % cheaper to produce than commercial Cu- 1 %Cr. It has also been shown to be more cost efficient on a yield stress and % IACS per dollar basis. The reason for the cost saving is that the Cu- 0. 7 %Cr- 0. 3 %Fe alloy can be made with low carbon <b>ferro-chrome</b> additions as the source of chromium rather than the more expensive Cu-Cr master-alloy. For applications in which cost is one of the primary materials selection criteria, it is envisaged that there would be numerous applications in both cast and wrought form, where the Cu- 0. 7 %Cr- 0. 3 %Fe alloy would be more suitable than Cu- 1 %Cr.

40|$|Austenitic {{steel is}} {{one type of}} {{stainless}} steel which is widely used in the industry. Many studies on  austenitic stainless  steel have been performed to determine the physicalproperties using various types of equipment and methods. In this  study, the neutron diffraction method is used to characterize the materials which have been made from  minerals extracted  from the mines in Indonesia. The materials consist of a granular ferro-scrap, nickel, <b>ferro-chrome,</b> ferro-manganese, and  ferro-silicon added with a little titanium. Characterization of the materials {{was carried out in}} threeprocesses, namely:  machining, annealing, and rolling. Experimental results obtained from the machining process generally produces a texture  in the 〈 100 〉direction. From the machining to annealing process, the texture index decreases from 3. 0164 to 2. 434. Texture  strength in the machining process (BA 2 N sample) is   8. 13 mrd and it then decreases to 6. 99 in the annealing process  (A 2 DO sample). In the annealing process the three-component texture appears, cube-on-edge type texture{ 110 }〈 001 〉,  cube-type texture { 001 }〈 100 〉, and brass-type { 110 }〈 112 〉. The texture is very strong leading to the direction of orientation  { 100 }〈 001 〉, while the { 011 }〈 100 〉is weaker than that of the { 001 }, and texture withorientation { 110 }〈 112 〉is weak. In  the annealing process stress release occurred, and this was shown by more randomly pole compared to stress release by  the machining process. In the rolling process a brass-type texture{ 110 }〈 112 〉with a spread towards the goss-type texture  { 110 }〈 001 〉 appeared,  and  the  brass  component  is markedly  reinforced  compared  to  the undeformed state (before  rolling). Moreover, the presence of an additional { 110 } component was observed {{at the center of the}} (110) pole figure.   The pole density of three components increases withthe increasing degree of thickness reduction.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of the environment has led to a need to develop innovative processes to remediate the contaminated sites. This research developed two processes for remediating soils contaminated with metal wastes. The four primary metal contaminants were chromium, nickel, cadmium and copper. Only chromium exceeded the EPA required action levels. Both processes utilized mineral processing techniques to make a size separation since the majority of the contamination existed within the fines or minus 20 micron material. This size separation reduced the amount of soil requiring further treatment. The first process was focused at recovering the metal contaminants from the soil for reuse in other industries. Chromium required recovery mainly because it exceeded the EPA action levels but it also had a potential reuse in the steel industry. Copper was evaluated for recovery strictly for its potential resale value. A mixed metals precipitate would also be recovered for potential use at a recycling facility. Sulfuric, oxalic, and hydrochloric acid were tested for their ability to leach the contaminants from the soil. The sulfuric acid leach was then optimized for pH and leach time. Consequently, a conceptual recovery process utilizing cementation to recover the copper, pH adjustment to precipitate a <b>ferro-chrome,</b> and further pH adjustment to precipitate a mixed metals precipitate was developed. Due to the amount of by-product produced from this process and the large quantity of reagents required, a second process was developed. The second process was focused at only removing and recovering the chromium since it was the only contaminant that exceeded EPA action levels. Following the size separation, the soil was subjected to a hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite leach. This leach was performed at slightly acidic conditions to use hypochlorous acid as the oxidizing agent. This leach oxidized the chromium from the trivalent to the hexavalent state thereby increasing its solubility. Once the chromium, as HCrO₄⁻, had gone into solution, the liquid was separated and sent to reduction processing. Using sulfur dioxide, the hexavalent chromium was reduced back to the trivalent state and with the addition of sodium hydroxide, the chromium precipitated...|$|E
