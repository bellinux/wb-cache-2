50|$|Changing the {{coordinates}} {{of a point}} set referring to one datum, so to make them refer to another datum, is called a datum transformation. In the case of vertical data, this consists of simply adding a constant shift to all height values.

In “Mathematical model and algorithm of <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformation</b> based on dual quaternion” section, firstly <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformation</b> and dual quaternion (and its preliminary, i.e., quaternion) are introduced in brief. Secondly, the mathematic model of <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformation</b> based on dual quaternion is established, and then a new dual quaternion algorithm of <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformation</b> is presented by Lagrangian extremum law and eigenvalue–eigenvector decomposition. Lastly, the solution of initial value of scale is introduced. In “Case study and discussion” section, an actual case, i.e., a small rotation angle case, and a simulative case, i.e., a big rotation angle case, are demonstrated to verify the presented algorithm.

5000|$|A {{geodetic}} transformation between OSGB 36 {{and other}} terrestrial reference systems (like ITRF2000, ETRS89, or WGS 84) can become quite tedious if attempted manually. The most common transformation {{is called the}} <b>Helmert</b> datum <b>transformation,</b> which results in a typical 7 m error from true. The definitive transformation from ETRS89 that is published by the OSGB is called the National Grid Transformation OSTN02.

We apply <b>Helmert's</b> <b>transformation</b> to the model, assume that error terms and nuisance parameters are homoskedastic and independent across observations and of one another, and utilize the GMM bias calculation of Newey & Smith (2001). This leads to a closed form expression for the GMM bias applied to AR(1) model. Chapter 2 : This chapter develops specification tests for quantile regression under various data types. We consider {{what happens to the}} quantile regression estimator under local and global misspecification and design specification tests that handle a wide range of data types. We consider how to carry out such tests in practice and present Monte Carlo results to show the effectiveness of such tests. Chapter 3 : Through a Taylor expansion, We compute the bias of a general GMM model where the weighting matrix A of the moment conditions g(z, β) is left unspecified, except for some general conditions. Our bias results are compared to those of Newey and West (2003). An important case of GMM estimation with a general weighting matrix A is when A is a function of a vector of parameters with fixed dimension.

30|$|The Procrustes {{method is}} a very {{effective}} method for determining the <b>Helmert’s</b> datum <b>transformation</b> parameters since it requires neither initial starting values nor iteration. Due to these attractive attributes, the ABC-Procrustes algorithm is extended to solve the 3 D affine transformation problem where scale factors are different in the 3 principal directions X, Y, Z. In this study, it is shown that such a direct extension is restricted to cases of mild anisotropy in scaling. For strong anisotropy, however, the procedure fails. The PZ-method is proposed {{as an extension of}} the ABC algorithm for this special case. The procedures are applied to determine transformation parameters for; (i) transforming the Australian Geodetic Datum (AGD 84) to the Geocentric Datum Australia (GDA 94), i.e., mild anisotropy and (ii) synthetic data for strong anisotropy. The results indicate that the PZ-algorithm leads to a local multivariate minimization as opposed to the ABC-algorithm, thus requiring slightly longer computational time. However, the ABC-method is found to be useful for computing proper initial values for the PZ-method, thereby increasing its efficiency.|$|R
40|$|The Empirical CODE Orbit Model (ECOM) of the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE), {{which was}} {{developed}} in the early 1990 s, is widely used in the International GNSS Service (IGS) community. For a rather long time, spurious spectral lines are known to exist in geophysical parameters, in particular in the Earth Rotation Parameters (ERPs) and in the estimated geocenter coordinates, which could recently be attributed to the ECOM. These effects grew creepingly with the increasing influence of the GLONASS system in recent years in the CODE analysis, which is based on a rigorous combination of GPS and GLONASS since May 2003. In a first step we show that the problems associated with the ECOM are to the largest extent caused by the GLONASS, which was reaching full deployment by the end of 2011. GPS-only, GLONASS-only, and combined GPS/GLONASS solutions using the observations in the years 2009 – 2011 of a global network of 92 combined GPS/GLONASS receivers were analyzed for this purpose. In a second step we review direct solar radiation pressure (SRP) models for GNSS satellites. We demonstrate that only even-order short-period harmonic perturbations acting along the direction Sun-satellite occur for GPS and GLONASS satellites, and only odd-order perturbations acting along the direction perpendicular to both, the vector Sun-satellite and the spacecraft’s solar panel axis. Based on this insight we assess in the third step the performance of four candidate orbit models for the future ECOM. The geocenter coordinates, the ERP differences w. r. t. the IERS 08 C 04 series of ERPs, the misclosures for the midnight epochs of the daily orbital arcs, and scale parameters of <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformations</b> for station coordinates serve as quality criteria. The old and updated ECOM are validated in addition with satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations and by comparing the orbits to those of the IGS and other analysis centers. Based on all tests, we present a new extended ECOM which substantially reduces the spurious signals in the geocenter coordinate z (by about a factor of 2 – 6), reduces the orbit misclosures at the day boundaries by about 10 %, slightly improves the consistency of the estimated ERPs with those of the IERS 08 C 04 Earth rotation series, and substantially reduces the systematics in the SLR validation of the GNSS orbits...|$|R

30|$|Jitka (2011) {{presents}} a dual quaternion algorithm for geodetic datum transformation; however, the algorithm adopts a nonlinear method {{to solve a}} minimization problem, i.e., Lagrange multipliers, which has eight variants with two constraints equations, so its solution is complex and the solution process of transformation is not explicit. The feasibility of this algorithm to big rotation angle transformation is not verified; moreover, the algorithm does not deal {{with the weight of}} observation. Walker et al. (1991) present a dual quaternion to estimate the 3 D location parameters including both position and direction information; however, it does not consider the scale factor of 3 D coordinate transformation, so it is not suitable for <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformation.</b> Motivated by these studies, this paper aims to construct the <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformation</b> based on quaternion and present a new dual quaternion algorithm for <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformation</b> which has explicit computation steps, no initial value problem of transformation parameters, fast computation and reliable result no matter how big the rotation angles are.

In the developed system, DSLR cameras are used to bridge the Kinects and provide a more accurate ray intersection condition, which {{takes advantage of the}} higher resolution and image quality of the DSLR cameras. Structure from Motion (SFM) reconstruction is used to link and merge multiple Kinect point clouds and dense point clouds (from DSLR color images) to generate initial integrated point clouds. Then, bundle adjustment is used to resolve the exterior orientation (EO) of all images. Those exterior orientations are used as the initial values to combine these point clouds at each frame into the same coordinate system using <b>Helmert</b> (seven-parameter) <b>transformation.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that the design of the data acquisition system and the data processing procedure can generate dense and fully colored point clouds of indoor environments successfully even in featureless areas. The accuracy of the generated point clouds were evaluated by comparing the widths and heights of identified objects as well as coordinates of pre-set independent check points against in situ measurements.

30|$|Unit dual {{quaternion}} can be elegantly {{employed to}} describe the rigid transformation including rotation and translation. Based on unit dual quaternion, a non-differential model of <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformation</b> (seven-parameter similarity transformation) is constructed and a rigid iterative algorithm of <b>Helmert</b> <b>transformation</b> using dual quaternion is presented. The case study shows the presented algorithm requires one iteration to recover the transformation parameter if accurate initial value of scale is provided like the solutions no. 2 and 3 of Závoti and Kalmár (2016) for the situation that the weights are identical; otherwise, exact two iterative computation converges to the correct solution of transformation parameters {{no matter how big}} the rotation angles are and how biased the initial value of scale is. Hence, the presented algorithm has an excellent or fast convergence, and it becomes an analytical algorithm when the accurate initial value of scale is offered. In addition, the presented algorithm is able to deal with point-wise weight transformation which is more rational than those algorithms which do not consider the weight difference among control points. And from the viewpoint of solution accuracy, the presented algorithm is comparable to the classic Procrustes algorithm and orthonormal matrix algorithm from Zeng (2015).|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a {{time-dependent}} 3 -parameter <b>Helmert</b> datum <b>transformation</b> model for Malaysia as a proposed solution to the current non-geocentric issue of the Geocentric Datum of Malaysia 2000 (GDM 2000). Methodologically, the datum transformation models is categorised into three parts; firstly, the time-dependent aspect of the datum transformation model is determined using the tectonic motion velocities computed from linear least squares regression of the long-term time series of MyRTKnet stations positions from year December 2004 to 2014; whereby the station positions are obtained from high-precision daily double-difference processing of MyRTKnet and IGS stations via Bernese 5. 0. Secondly, the 3 Helmert translation-only parameters, are derived between the original GDM 2000 and GDM 2000 @ 2013 – the new datum coordinates which refers to ITRF 2008 at epoch 3 / 7 / 2013 – via Bernese 5. 0 software. Thirdly, a distortion model is computed in order to minimise the coordinate residuals between the ‘processed’ and ‘transformed’ new datum. The datum transformation model is then validated to determine {{the reliability of the}} model. The validation results show that the datum transformation model is within centimetre-level accuracy, i. e., below 3 cm, over Malaysia for forward transformations to year 2014 and 2015.

40|$|Besides {{improving}} {{both the}} geometry {{and the visual}} quality of the model, the integration of close-range photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning techniques directs at filling gaps in laser scanner point clouds to avoid modeling errors, reconstructing more details in higher resolution and recovering simple structures with less geometric details. Thus, within this paper a flexible approach for the automatic combination of digital images and laser scanner data is presented. Our approach comprises two methods for data fusion. The first method starts by a marker-free registration of digital images based on a point-based environment model (PEM) of a scene which stores the 3 D laser scanner point clouds associated with intensity and RGB values. The PEM allows the extraction of accurate control information for the direct computation of absolute camera orientations with redundant information by means of accurate space resection methods. In order to use the computed relations between the digital images and the laser scanner data, an extended <b>Helmert</b> (seven-parameter) <b>transformation</b> is introduced and its parameters are estimated. Precedent to that, in the second method, the local relative orientation parameters of the camera images are calculated {{by means of an}} optimized Structure and Motion (SaM) reconstruction method. Then, using the determined transformation parameters results in having absolute oriented images in relation to the laser scanner data. With the resulting absolute orientations we have employed robust dense image reconstruction algorithms to create oriented dense image point clouds, which are automatically combined with the laser scanner data to form a complete detailed representation of a scene. Examples of different data sets are shown and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented procedures...|$|R
