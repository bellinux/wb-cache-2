500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of Eyeshield 21 received positive and mixed responses. Bobby Cooper from DVD Talk praised how {{the rules of}} American football are [...] "explained to a foreign audience that has no clue what it's all about", adding that instructions at the commercial breaks [...] "were informative and similar to the Go lessons of Hikaru No Go." [...] He also said the explanations was [...] "hilarious", but that [...] "Eyeshield 21 is an excellent introduction to football". The on-field action was also praised, with <b>he</b> <b>saying</b> the sports action is [...] "where Eyeshield 21 truly shines", although he criticized the scenes away from the football field, [...] "the pacing slows to a crawl and the storyline gets a little boring". In her review, Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network stated, [...] "he pace of Eyeshield 21 is its saving grace. It's way less boring than all the time outs and commercial breaks in a regular NFL game. Football is hard to understand, but Eyeshield 21 explains the Byzantine rules...in an entertaining way. We're never left waiting for the ref's decision for long minutes like in real life. A lot of dramatic tension carries the action between plays." [...] Finnegan also criticized the artwork, saying, [...] "any episode [...] without a game is clearly farmed out to an inferior animation studio". Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment wrote that Eyeshield 21 [...] "has a good solid story idea, showing a young man finding his way through sports by finding friends and realizing he has potential, {{but it is so}} sidelined so often that it's frustrating to see it deal with situations as it does." ...|$|E

2500|$|Murray's Joe Murray Productions and Games Animation rented {{office space}} on Ventura Boulevard in the Studio City {{neighborhood}} of the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. The production {{moved to a}} different office building on Vineland Avenue in Studio City. Executives did not share space with the creative team. Murray rented a floor in the Writers Guild of America, West building, although the team of Rocko was {{not a part of}} the union, which the staff found ironic. Sunwoo Entertainment, and later Rough Draft Studios, assembled the animation. According to Murray, as Rocko's Modern Life was his first television series, he did not know about the atmosphere of typical animation studios. Murray said that he opted to operate his studio in a similar manner to the operation of his Saratoga, California studio, which he describes as [...] "very relaxed". His cadre included many veterans who, according to him, described the experience as [...] "the most fun they had ever had!" [...] <b>He,</b> <b>saying</b> that the atmosphere was [...] "not my doing", credited his team members for collectively contributing. Murray described the daily atmosphere at the studio as [...] "very loose", adding that the rules permitted all staff members to use the paging system to make announcements. He stated that one visitor compared the environment of the production studio to [...] "preschool without supervision". Murray stated that 70 people in the United States and over 200 people in South Korea and Japan animated the series.|$|E
