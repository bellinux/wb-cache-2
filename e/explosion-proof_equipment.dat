50|$|Sumitomo {{developed}} a battery using a salt that is molten at 61 C, far lower than sodium based batteries, and operational at 90 C. It offers energy densities {{as high as}} 290 Wh/L and 224 Wh/kg and charge/discharge rates of 1C with a lifetime of 100 - 1000 charge cycles. The battery employs only nonflammable materials and neither ignites on contact with air nor risks thermal runaway. This eliminates waste-heat storage or fire- and <b>explosion-proof</b> <b>equipment,</b> and allows closer cell packing. The company claimed that the battery required half the volume of lithium-ion batteries and one quarter that of sodium-sulfur batteries. The cell used a nickel cathode and a glassy carbon anode.|$|E

40|$|The design, {{construction}} and exploitation of electrical equipment {{intended to be}} used in potentially explosive atmospheres presents a series of difficulties. Therefore, the approach of these phases requires special attention concerning technical, financial and occupational health and safety aspects. In order for them not to generate an ignition source for the explosive atmosphere, such equipment have to be subjected to a series of type tests aiming to decrease the explosion risk in technological installations which operate in potentially explosive atmospheres. Explosion protection being a concern of researchers and authorities worldwide, testing and certification of <b>explosion-proof</b> electrical <b>equipment,</b> required for their conformity assessment, are extremely important, taking into account the unexpected explosion hazard due to potentially explosive atmospheres, risk which has to be minimized in order to ensure the occupational health and safety of workers, for preventing material losses and for decreasing the environmental pollution. Besides others, one of the type tests, which shall be applied, for <b>explosion-proof</b> electrical <b>equipment</b> is the impact resistance test, described in detail in EN 60079 which specifies the general requirements for construction, testing and marking of electrical equipment and Ex components intended for use in explosive atmospheres. This paper presents an analysis on the requirements of the impact resistance test for <b>explosion-proof</b> electrical <b>equipment</b> and on the possibilities to improve this type of test, by making use of modern computer simulation tools based on finite element analysis, techniques which are widely used nowadays in the industry and for research purposes...|$|R
50|$|The {{returning}} mud {{can contain}} natural gases or other flammable materials which will collect {{in and around}} the shale shaker / conveyor area or in other work areas. Because of the risk of a fire or an explosion if they ignite, special monitoring sensors and <b>explosion-proof</b> certified <b>equipment</b> is commonly installed, and workers are advised to take safety precautions. The mud is then pumped back down the hole and further re-circulated. After testing, the mud is treated periodically in the mud pits to ensure properties which optimize and improve drilling efficiency, borehole stability, and other requirements listed below.|$|R
40|$|For the {{petroleum}} industry, {{to reduce the}} risk of a gas explosion in dangerous working areas, the use of <b>explosion-proof</b> <b>equipment</b> such as air-driven devices which are free from explosions becomes essential. Moreover, for the purpose of saving manpower, a remote operation using a robot via a visual monitoring system and a network is used. However, to overcome the drawback of costly manpower and to improve safety in explosion-prone zones, a three-axis robot using a remote network control system is proposed. In this paper, the three-axis robot can be monitored online via the USB protocol. Furthermore, it also can be remotely manipulated via the TCP/IP protocol by clicking the command of the VB interface on the client pc. Consequently, the remote-control three-axis robot can not only work for people in severe and dangerous circumstances but also can reduce the cost of manpower...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{industries}} which {{form the basis of}} Russian Economical structure is oil and gas. This industry is also playing a significant role for CIS countries. Oil and gas industry is developing intensively attracting foreign investments. This situation is providing sustainable development of machinery production for hazardous areas. Operating in oil and gas areas is always related with occurrence of explosion gas atmospheres. Machines for hazardous areas must be furnished with additional protection of different types. Explosion protection is regulated with standards according to which equipment must be manufactured. In Russia and CIS countries <b>explosion-proof</b> <b>equipment</b> must be constructed in compliance with GOST standards. To confirm that equipment is manufactured according to standardsâ€™ requirements and is safe and reliable it must undergo the approval procedure.

40|$|AbstractWhile {{flammable}} {{materials are}} operated in process industries, the electric <b>equipments</b> should be <b>explosion-proof</b> {{to reduce the}} possibility of a fire or an explosion. Auto-ignition temperature (AIT) of a flammable material is the primary characteristic in determining the specifications of these <b>explosion-proof</b> <b>equipments.</b> However, due to limitations on experiments, the AIT of a compound reported in different data compilations is very diverse, and the difference between different compilations was found to be higher than 300 K in many cases. Thus, an effective method to predict the AIT of flammable materials is indispensible in this regard. In this study, a model to predict the AIT of organic compounds is built by using the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) approach. This model is built from a set of 820 organic compounds, which are collected from the DIPPR database supported by American Institute of Chemical Engineer. This model is of four molecular descriptors: mean electrotopological state, the aromatic ratio, rotatable bond fraction, and atom-centered fragments. It is found that the R value of the proposed model is 0. 900, the average error in percentage is of 6. 0 %, and the average absolute error is about 36. 0 K. While comparing with other works in the literature, this model is built from the largest data set and gives satisfactory performance. As compared with the known experimental errors in measuring the AIT, the proposed model also offers a reasonable estimate of the AIT. Thus, the proposed model can estimate the AIT of a compound for which its AIT is as yet not readily available within a reasonable accuracy...|$|R
