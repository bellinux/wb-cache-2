5000|$|The {{glass beads}} of Sub-Saharan Africa {{that were not}} melted from {{pre-existing}} glass material were instead formed by <b>grinding</b> <b>glass</b> into a fine powder to be worked further. Sources for such glass included scraps from broken glass bottles, cullets (recycled glass) or pre-existing glass beads which were no longer wanted. The grinding process generally caused colouring to be lost; therefore, various pigments were often added at this stage (see the colouring section below). After the desired colour was achieved, powdered glass was either worked in its dry form or was wetted with water or saliva to create a paste. This paste was next formed by hand into various bead shapes. Powder Glass Beads were then heated, allowed to cool and finally, polished.8 Garden Roller beads, such as the Bodom beads of Ghana.8 were the earliest form of powder glass beads found, made by threading glass in a mould with a mandrel. This process was extremely labour-intensive and expensive as the mould used was unable to be reused.8 More common were the Kiffa beads, typically associated with Mauritania. These beads were produced from the wet-form of powder glass production, and have been found since the 8th century. The paste produced in wet-form production was shaped into a bead using frames typically made of leaves of grass and then were decorated and coloured using a needle.8 ...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{designers}} can {{realize the}} required optical functions {{with a large}} variety of different designs. In order to obtain the needed functionality at the lowest possible cost, different design and assembly options {{will need to be}} taken into account. Additionally, the complexity of the decision situation is increased by the different production technologies which are available. The EC-sponsored project Production 4 is developing solutions that help optics designers to simplify and speed up this decision process. In this article, two different tools for calculating optics production costs are presented. The first one is a simplistic tool made for calculating the production costs of plastic optical parts. The second is a more complex tool that is able to do a detailed cost analysis for a complete process chain. This versatile tool can be used to calculate the costs associated to three main optical production methods: glass <b>grinding,</b> <b>glass</b> moulding and plastic injection mou lding. Design For Manufacturability (DFM) issues are emphasized by drawing conclusions on which design characteristics have the largest influence on piece part cost. Practical applications of cost models are presented by relating optical design choices and expected performance to production cost with case studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} of ELID-grinding was developed as an in-process dressing of the grinding wheel and {{the advantages are}} well known. This technique allows the continuous use of tools with the smallest grain sizes under stable grinding conditions. Yet {{little is known about}} the polishing principle that occurs during the employment of electro-chemical process of metal bonded grinding wheels. At the same time especially the use of grinding wheels with ferrous binding shows an additional aspect when <b>grinding</b> <b>glass.</b> The electrolytic reaction produces metal oxides, particularly iron oxides. These materials have a long history in the manufacturing process of glass lenses. Since early days glass was polished with metal oxides. However, while today CeO 2 is meant to be state-of-the-art ferrous oxides known as rouge were used until few decades ago. Indeed, the iron oxides produced in the electrolytic process of ELID can have a special polishing effect on the components made of glass. For this reason Fraunhofer IPT is developing an Electrolytic Generated Polishing-Grinding (EGPG). As the polishing process of surfaces up to optical quality takes the biggest amount of time of the entire production chain, EGPG permits a considerable reduction of time and cost in producing of glass products with ultra precise optical surfaces. Especially in the manufacturing procedures of aspheric glass lenses production the conventional polishing steps contain enormous technological challenges and take up to 70 % of production time. At this point Polishing-Grinding offers the opportunity to integrate the polishing step into a grinding process. This will reduce the following polishing time or even make it redundant. In this paper the author presents and discusses different approaches of material removal mechanism which occur during Polishing-Grinding...|$|E
30|$|In Van Gogh’s time, mass-produced machine-ground paints {{were already}} available, like {{those from the}} firm of LeFranc&cie [55]. On the other hand, paints were still hand-ground and {{prepared}} in small colorman shops that received their powdered pigments from manufacturers [30]. Among these merchants were Julien Tanguy and probably Tasset et L’Hôte who were Van Goghs main suppliers from his Arles period onwards [12]. The way of grinding has both {{an impact on the}} consistency and thus handling properties, {{as well as on the}} brightness of the paint [55, 56]. Machine-ground paints were considered too fine, which would result in a loss of substantial consistency and reduced brilliance [57]. This latest effect is due to the fact that with decreasing pigment size the reflection (scattering) of light increases, which might result in a less saturated paint color. In addition, since finely ground pigments need more binding medium, the color of the paint is more affected by the yellowing of the oil as well. Also Van Gogh was aware of the effects of pigment particle sizes and ordered coarser ground paints in order to have paints that were “both fresher and longer-lasting”. 12 In our project we had access to a small mechanical <b>grinding</b> <b>glass</b> mill as well as several glass slabs and mullers for grinding by hand. Both methods were explored and it was decided to use the glass slabs and the glass mullers on muscle power because this was probably the method mainly used by Van Gogh’s suppliers. Furthermore, this method had the advantage that larger amounts of paint could be made at once than in the mechanical mill that was to our disposal. Above that the grinding process could be better monitored and adjusted if needed when ground by hand. We did not have the possibility to compare the particle sizes of the reconstruction pigments with those used by Van Gogh, but it might be expected that nowadays pigment particle sizes are somewhat smaller than in the late 19 th century. The extent to which this affects the color of the reconstruction paints is unclear; a recent study by Gueli et al. revealed that grinding of pigments, including cobalt blue and viridian green, to sizes ranging from 0 to 75  µm, does not induce changes detectable by the human eye neither in terms of hue nor in terms of color saturation [58].|$|E
40|$|Tooth cooling during {{grinding}} process for cavity or crown preparation is very essential for keeping tooth vitality. In vivo experiments done by Zach and Cohen in 1965 show that 15 % of the teeth failed to recover when heated by 5. 50 C {{and if the}} interpulpal temperature was increased by 11. 10 C then in about 60 % of the cases the teeth didn't recover. Since then many in vitro experiments were carried out {{in order to determine}} the water flow needed to maintain the temperature rise below 5. 50 C. The widespread cooling method is based on a number of water jets or water spray directed to the center of the dental bur. With this method excessive amount of water has to be applied in order to guarantee that enough coolant will be introduced into the grinding area. This leads to an unpleasant feeling of the patient and formation of mist obstructing the dentists working area visibility. A new concept of inner cooling method where the cooling water is entered to a hollow bur and comes out at the tip of the bur close to the grinding area was tested by the modification of an air turbine driven handpiece allowing water supply through the air turbine into a hollow bur. Special hollow burs were designed and manufactured for those experiments. Two kinds of experiments were conducted comparing the common outer cooling method and the internal cooling method; in the first experimental series the comparison was done by <b>grinding</b> <b>glass</b> ceramic material while in the second series the two cooling methods were applied while grinding extracted teeth. The results show significant improvement when using the internal cooling system. There was a reduction of about 20 C while using the internal cooling system with the same water flow. The grinding of the extracted tooth was carried out by a dentistry student reporting improved visibility while using the internal cooling method. Further research and experiments will focus on developing a miniature system for entering the water into the high speed rotating bur, optimizing the cooling water flow rate with the internal cooling system, optimizing the position of the outlet holes at the tip of the bur, and developing a method for diamond coating of the hollow bur while keeping the holes in the tip of the bur open...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{carry out}} the edge <b>grinding</b> for <b>glass</b> plates of flat panel displays, {{a large amount of}} coolant is {{supplied}} to prevent burning and melting on the ground surface. However, due to the repulsion of the winding air along the surface of the wheel rotating at high speed, a large amount of coolant is wasted without reaching the grinding point. This research aims to improve the <b>grinding</b> performance for <b>glass</b> edge <b>grinding</b> using a small amount of coolant supplied through a floating nozzle instead of a conventional nozzle. A special floating nozzle with its end covering the narrow groove formed on the wheel was made. The edge of a glass plate with a thickness of 0. 7 mm was ground under the conditions of grinding speed Vs= 1570 m/min, depth of cut a= 0. 5 mm, and feed rate Vw= 5 m/min. With a conventional nozzle, the amount of coolant needed was 3 l/min. With a floating nozzle, the amount was drastically reduced to only 0. 1 l/min. No damage occurred on the ground surface. The ground surface was also improved with the floating nozzle. The grinding force was measured. It was found that the fluctuation of grinding force in the case of floating nozzle was smaller than the one in the case of conventional nozzle...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{grindability}} of glass-inlaid zirconia structure for fibre-optic connectors using metal-bonded diamond wheels with different grit sizes. The surface roughnesses of the glass fibre and zirconia ferrule were investigated as functions of diamond grit, grinding speed and feed rate. The results showed a distinct difference in responses for the two materials with respect to surface roughness and material removal. The combined structure was directly ground to obtain surface roughnesses R-a of the fibre and ferrule smaller than 30 and 90 nm respectively. The surface roughness values for the two materials both decreased with a decrease in diamond grit size, but the reduction in surface roughness for the fibre was not significant when the grit size was smaller than 15 pm. A higher grinding speed did not always give a better surface finish for the two materials.

In this paper I will discuss the methodology of my practice-led research as it relates to the concept of sensation (Deleuze) in relation to the body and to painting. In addition to this I will outline ways in which Spinoza’s monist concept of ‘one substance’ has illuminated and influenced my thinking and work. Central to this concept is the notion that mind and matter are not two separate things but one thing. Spinoza (1632 - 77) was a philosopher who was exiled from his Jewish society at the young age of 24 and was forced to <b>grind</b> <b>glass</b> lenses in order to make a living. I am interested in how the lens may be seen to be a powerful metaphor for perception. Spinoza wanted his philosophy to enable others to ‘see clearly’. Living in Holland, in the time of Vermeer (1632 - 75), sharing the company of artists and having an active interest himself in the mechanics of drawing, he no doubt was aware of how his accurately ground lenses could be put to good use to create cameras obscura. Although the knowledge of this simple optical device is ancient, it still has the power to bring wonder back to our distracted, fractured lives.

60|$|But because Metal is more {{difficult}} to polish than Glass, and is afterwards very apt to be spoiled by tarnishing, and reflects not so much Light as Glass quick-silver'd over does: I would propound to use instead of the Metal, a Glass ground concave on the foreside, and as much convex on the backside, and quick-silver'd over on the convex side. The Glass must be every where of the same thickness exactly. Otherwise it will make Objects look colour'd and indistinct. By such a Glass I tried about five or six Years ago to make a reflecting Telescope of four Feet in length to magnify about 150 times, and I satisfied my self that there wants nothing but a good Artist to bring the Design to perfection. For the Glass being wrought by one of our London Artists after such a manner as they <b>grind</b> <b>Glasses</b> for Telescopes, though it seemed as well wrought as the Object-glasses use to be, yet when it was quick-silver'd, the Reflexion discovered innumerable Inequalities all over the Glass. And by reason of these Inequalities, Objects appeared indistinct in this Instrument. For the Errors of reflected Rays caused by any Inequality of the Glass, are about six times greater than the Errors of refracted Rays caused by the like Inequalities. Yet by this Experiment I satisfied my self that the Reflexion on the concave side of the Glass, which I feared would disturb the Vision, did no sensible prejudice to it, and by consequence that nothing is wanting to perfect these Telescopes, but good Workmen who can <b>grind</b> and polish <b>Glasses</b> truly spherical. An Object-glass of a fourteen Foot Telescope, made by an Artificer at London, I once mended considerably, by grinding it on Pitch with Putty, and leaning very easily on it in the grinding, lest the Putty should scratch it.
