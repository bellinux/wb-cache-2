Urfa commodity market during the summer of 2004. A randomized complete block design with three factors and four replications (grain buyers) was employed. Factor A`, three widely grown durum wheat varieties (Urfa- 2005, Firat- 93 and Aydin- 93), Factor B, the five various <b>grading</b> <b>factors</b> [yellow berry (YB), red bread wheat content (RBW), dark red bread wheat content (DRBW), sunn pest damaged kernel content (SP) and combinations of all above factors (combined effect) ] and Factor C, content ratios (2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 %) were utilized. The results, obtained from variance analysis, indicated that all sources of variation turned out to be statistically significant. The grain buyers had different purchasing criteria depending on their needs. Some durum wheat varieties were offered higher prices due to good semolina or bulgur color reputation in macaroni and bulgur industry. <b>Grading</b> <b>factors</b> under study had different effects on marketing price of durum wheat. Marketing price reduced as content ratios of all <b>grading</b> <b>factors</b> in durum wheat increased. It was found that combined effect could reduce the marketing price as much as $ 41 ton - 1, SP damage; $ 36 ton - 1, DRBW; $ 23 ton - 1, RBW; $ 13 ton - 1 and YB; $ 9 ton - 1. The regressions between marketing prices vs. all <b>grading</b> <b>factors</b> were found to be statistically significant and the regression equations with high coefficients of determination (R 2 %) described the variations in marketing price and can be used for marketing price estimations adequately. It was concluded that durum wheat purchasing criteria in the South East of Anatolia was somewhat different from those of Turkish Grain Board and some international markets. Some of down <b>grading</b> <b>factors</b> such as sunn pest damage and the presence of dark red or red bread wheat kernels must be added into national standards of Turkey and similar Middle East countries.

40|$|We {{analytically}} {{evaluate the}} moments of the spectral density of the $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and obtain order $ 1 /N^ 2 $ corrections for all moments, where $N$ is {{the total number of}} Majorana fermions. To order $ 1 /N$, moments are given by those of the weight function of the Q-Hermite polynomials. Representing Wick contractions by rooted chord diagrams, we show that the $ 1 /N^ 2 $ correction for each chord diagram is proportional to the number of triangular loops of the corresponding intersection graph, with an extra <b>grading</b> <b>factor</b> when $q$ is odd. Therefore the problem of finding $ 1 /N^ 2 $ corrections is mapped to a triangle counting problem. Since the total number of triangles is a purely graph-theoretic property, we can compute them for the $q= 1 $ and $q= 2 $ SYK models, where the exact moments can be obtained analytically using other methods, and therefore we have solved the moment problem for any $q$ to $ 1 /N^ 2 $ accuracy. The moments are then used to obtain the spectral density of the SYK model to order $ 1 /N^ 2 $. We also obtain an exact analytical result for all contraction diagrams contributing to the moments, which can be evaluated up to eighth order. This shows that the Q-Hermite approximation is accurate even for small values of $N$. Comment: 49 pages, 16 figure...|$|E

Microbial community profiling of seed washes containing DNA extracts prepared from field-grown cereal grain detected sequences from a fungus identified only to Class Sordariomycetes. To identify the fungal sequence {{and to improve}} the reference database, we determined cpn 60 sequences from field-collected and reference strains of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. These data allowed us to identify this fungal sequence as deriving from C. purpurea, and suggested that C. purpurea DNA is readily detectable on agricultural commodities, including those for which ergot was not identified as a <b>grading</b> <b>factor.</b> To {{get a sense of}} the prevalence and level of C. purpurea DNA in cereal grains, we developed a quantitative PCR assay based on the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and applied it to 137 samples from the 2014 crop year. The amount of Claviceps DNA quantified correlated strongly with the proportion of ergot sclerotia identified in each grain lot, although there was evidence that non-target organisms were responsible for some false positives with the ITS-based assay. We therefore developed a cpn 60 -targeted loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay and applied it to the same grain wash samples. The time to positive displayed a significant, inverse correlation to ergot levels determined by visual ratings. These results indicate that both laboratory-based and field-adaptable molecular diagnostic assays can be used to detect and quantify pathogen load in bulk commodities using cereal grain washes.

40|$|Background: Comprehensive health {{promotion}} in Western Australia {{has been conducted}} {{from the point of}} views of policy development, promotion, education and service delivery. Much of this recent work has been focused on supporting workplaces – but there has yet to be any real focus on the design of the actual physical workplace environment from a {{health promotion}} perspective. Aims: This paper is aimed at highlighting the gap in health promotion knowledge by addressing how the disciplines of architecture and health promotion can work together to challenge the regulations that dictate design practice and ultimately bridge that gap for long-term change. The overarching aim is to undertake further evidenced-based research that will inform best practice in the planning and design of workplaces to reduce sedentary behaviour and increase opportunities for physical activity. Method: Within this wide objective this paper focuses in particular on the idea of stairs-versus-lift movement strategies within office buildings. By examining building design guidelines from a health promotion perspective we expose a central dichotomy, where health promotion posters say “Take the stairs instead” whereas the language of building design suggests that the lift is best. Results: From a design point of view, the National Codes of Construction (NCC), formally known as the Building Codes of Australia (BCA), the essential technical regulation for all building design and construction, primarily addresses the concepts of ‘egress’ and ‘travel distance’ for escape in the event of fire, and building access in terms of universal access. Additionally, The Property Council of Australia’s Guide to Office Building Quality prioritises lift performance criteria along with the quality and experience of lift use as a major <b>grading</b> <b>factor.</b> There is no provision in either set of standards for staircase quality and experience. Conclusion: The stairs, despite being promoted as better life choice for better health, is not promoted through these building codes nor, consequently, through the building design in actuality. It is proposed that health promotion strategies could be coupled with design-led movement strategies in workplace design so that the promotional language, such as “take the stairs instead”, is balanced by the design language of the building...|$|E
40|$|Lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) is {{an annual}} cool-season legume {{with a variety}} of seed coat colours. Seed coat colour is an {{important}} <b>grading</b> <b>factor</b> that affects the market value of lentils. In lentil, two independent loci gray ground colour (Ggc) and tan ground colour (Tgc) determine the four basic seed coat background colours; brown (Ggc Tgc), gray (Ggc tgc), tan (ggc Tgc) and green (ggc tgc). The zero tannin locus (tan) is epistatic to the tgc locus, producing clear seed coats. Lentil is a good source of protein, carbohydrates, dietary fiber components, minerals, vitamins, and secondary metabolites that include phenolic compounds. Phenolic compounds produce different pigments in plants and bring health benefits to humans. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationship between seed coat colour and phenolic compounds in lentil. In the first study, comparison of the phenolic profiles of four seed coat background colours in lentil (i. e., brown, gray, tan, and green) was performed using an optimized liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method. The results showed that for the levels of various phenolic compounds in lentil seeds varied with the seed coat colour. Specifically, seed coats of lentil genotypes carrying the homozygous recessive tgc allele (green and gray seed coats) had higher amounts of flavan- 3 -ols, proanthocyanidins, and some flavonols. In the second study, a comparison was made between the phenolic profiles of lentil seed coats that do not express the Tgc phenotype (genotype Tgc tan) and those that express Tgc (genotype Tgc Tan). The LC-MS analysis detected several compounds that were not influenced by tan, notably the phenolic acids, flavones, some flavonols, and some of dihydroflavonols. In contrast, myricetin, dihydromyricetin, and flavan- 3 -ols, and proanthocyanidin oligomers were detected only in Ggc Tgc Tan lines and therefore appear to be controlled by tan. The molecular analysis showed that tan is a basic-helixloop- helix (bHLH) transcription factor that could interact with the regulatory genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway for the enzymes flavonoid- 3 ’, 5 ’-hydroxylase (F 3 ’ 5 ’H) and dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR). The third study measured the effect of long term storage on specific changes in phenolic compounds in lentil seeds. Increases in phenolic acids and flavones occur in green lentil seeds during storage, possibly because of the breakdown of more complex species into smaller subunits. More interestingly, a significant decrease in 27 flavan- 3 - ols and proanthocyanidins also occurs. Polymerization of flavan- 3 -ols and proanthocyanidins and their conjugation to cellular constituents could reduce their extractability and produce dark pigments in long stored lentil seeds. In conclusion, these studies determined that there is a relationship between phenolic compounds, specifically flavan- 3 -ols and proanthocyanidins, and seed coat colour genes tgc and tan in lentil. The findings of this study will help to develop future breeding strategies for lentil cultivars with aesthetic properties and nutritional benefits that appeal to consumers...|$|E

Middle school language arts teachers from one mid-sized suburban school district in Virginia participated in qualitative interviews. The interviews addressed the following topics: (1) the purposes of grades, (2) the <b>grading</b> <b>factors</b> teachers consider when they grade, (3) the teachers’ influences in determining their practices, and (4) how teachers’ grading practices relate to measurement theory.
