50|$|In a {{commercial}} <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> or three-party <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap,</b> a non-governmental organization (NGO) {{acts as the}} funder/donor and purchases debt titles from commercial banks on the secondary market. Since the late 1980s, organizations such as Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, and the World Wildlife Fund have participated in international debt-for-nature swaps. The NGO transfers the debt title to the debtor country, and in exchange the country agrees to either enact certain environmental policies or endow a government bond {{in the name of}} a conservation organization, with the aim of funding conservation programs.In total, recorded third-party debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$140 million in conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).|$|E
5000|$|Critics of the 'debt-for-nature' schemes, such as National Center for Public Policy Research, which {{distributes}} a {{wide variety}} of materials consistently justifying corporate freedom and environmental deregulation, aver that plans deprive developing nations of the extractable raw resources that are currently essential to further economic development. Economic stagnation and local resentment of [...] "Yankee imperialism" [...] can result, they warn. In reality, no <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> occurs without the approval of the country in question.|$|E
50|$|Critics of <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> {{argue that}} they do not {{generate}} funds where the needs are greatest. Early in the history of <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps,</b> nearly three-quarters of the total funds generated went to Costa Rica, while other countries with needs equal to or exceeding those of Costa Rica did not receive any. Brazil, for example, has had limited involvement in <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> though it has experienced rapid deforestation.|$|R
50|$|If {{the country}} is {{interested}} in funding conservation, <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> provide an additional source of funds for that purpose. In contrast to debt-for-equity <b>swaps,</b> <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> do not compromise national sovereignty since no property exchange takes place.|$|R
50|$|Bilateral <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> {{take place}} between two governments. In a {{bilateral}} swap, a creditor country forgives {{a portion of}} the public bilateral debt of a debtor nation in exchange for environmental commitments from that country. An example of a bilateral swap occurred when the U.S. Government, under the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, forgave a portion of Jamaica's official debt obligations and allowed the payments on the balance to go into national funds that finance environmental conservation. These funds established the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica in 1993. Multilateral <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> are similar to bilateral swaps but involve international transactions of more than two national governments. Recorded bilateral and multilateral <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> have generated nearly US$900 million in total conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).|$|R
50|$|Through a <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap,</b> a {{debtor country}} reduces its total {{outstanding}} external debt. The debtor country {{is able to}} buy back part of its debt in more favorable terms and pay for conservation initiatives rather than debt service. This leads to higher international purchasing power for the debtor country. Also, some argue that converting outstanding debts in USD to local currency debts lowers the long-term debt burden on developing countries. Additionally, debt-for-nature terms enable long-term planning and funding.|$|E
5000|$|Governments finance {{various forms}} of {{conservation}} finance. One such method involves establishing debt-for-nature swaps that aid environmental sustainability efforts in developing nations. Originated in the 1980s, this concept allows for public and private interests to purchase debt from a developing country. Consequently, that nation's purchased debt is discharged in part or in full. [...] The government then spends the money on domestic conservation projects. While developed nations participate in these transactions, private institutions purchase this debt as well. For example, commercial banks buy this debt and sell the portfolio at discounted prices to other investors or financial firms. Third-party organizations, particularly NGOs, participate in these swaps to secure currency or help develop governmental programs using the newly acquired funds. [...] In 1987, Bolivia successfully implemented the first <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap.</b> [...] The Bolivian government sold $650,000 of its debt for $100,000. [...] In exchange, Bolivia agreed to provide funding for sustainability efforts in Beni's wildlife reserve. [...] Since the world's most indebted nations also contain diverse ecosystems, debt-for-nature swaps draw significant attention towards conservation efforts in the most fragile parts of the biosphere.|$|E
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} the new Brazilian <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> legislation, if passed in its current form, will make debt-for-nature swaps in Brazil more financially {{attractive}} to international and Brazilian non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”). Part I provides {{a description of a}} typical <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap,</b> the purposes of a <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap,</b> and the interests of the U. S. government and U. S. NGOs in debt-for-nature swaps. Part I also discusses the grounds for the initially adamant Brazilian opposition to debt-for-nature swaps and the recent moderation of this opposition. Part II reviews the changes in the policies of the Brazilian government toward debt-for-nature swaps, from the pragmatic but modest measures taken by the Collor administration (1990 to 1992) to the outright approval of debt-for-nature swaps by the Franco administration (1992 to present). Part III analyzes the differences between the current Brazilian <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> regulations and the proposed legislation, highlighting the benefits of the latter. Part III also sets forth several policy recommendations directed at the U. S. government and U. S. NGOs. Finally, this Note concludes that, if complemented by the policy recommendations presented in Part III, the proposed Brazilian legislation will weaken the lingering Brazilian opposition to debt-for-nature swaps and ensure that the interests of the U. S. government and U. S. NGOs in these transactions are preserved...|$|E
50|$|The {{decline in}} the number of <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> in recent years likely results in part from the higher prices of {{commercial}} debt in secondary markets. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, conservation organizations could purchase relatively large debt obligations on the secondary market at highly discounted rates. During this period, conservation organizations and national governments negotiated swaps at a rate of approximately five agreements per year. Since 2000, the number of swap agreements has dropped to about two per year.Additionally, other agreements for debt restructuring and cancellation, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, lower a developing country’s debt obligation by much more than the relatively small contribution <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> make.Also, <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> have undergone thorough critique by skeptics; these criticisms may have contributed to the decline of the debt-for-nature financing mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> was first {{conceived}} by Thomas Lovejoy of the World Wildlife Fund in 1984 {{as an opportunity}} to deal with the problems of developing-nation indebtedness and its consequent deleterious effect on the environment. In the wake of the Latin American debt crisis that resulted in steep reductions to the environmental conservation ability of highly indebted nations, Lovejoy suggested that ameliorating debt and promoting conservation could be done at the same time. Since the first swap occurred between Conservation International and Bolivia in 1987, many national governments and conservation organizations have engaged in <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps.</b> Most swaps occur in tropical countries, which contain many diverse species of flora and fauna. Also, countries that have engaged in <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> typically have several threatened or endangered species, experience rapid deforestation, and have relatively stable, often democratic, political systems. Since 1987, debt-for-nature agreements have generated over US$1 billion for conservation in developing countries.|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} new concept of <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> {{is intended to}} take account of the connection between the indebtedness of developing countries and the destruction of the environment taking place there, the consequences of which are increasingly also perceived as a threat in the industrial countries. The idea has now been put to the test in practive in a number of cases. Against that background, the authors of this article point out the areas of potential and the limitations of <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Debt-for-nature swaps are a {{major source}} of global funding for nature {{conservation}} and have been touted as a win-win {{solution to the problem of}} how to finance conservation. This paper examines how the United States' debt-for-nature-swap program, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, works in the field. We provide an introduction to the technical aspects of the <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> mechanism, then describe how the program operates on the ground, using the United States-Peru swap as an example. We focus on two case studies that are largely representative of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act's work in Peru: 1) ProNaturaleza's project in the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, and 2) five distinct projects centered around reducing illegal logging in and around Alto Purús National Park. We explore the range of programs financed through swaps, as well as whether <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> projects meet their goals of strengthening civil society and increasing local capacity. We also discuss the efficacy of <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> monitoring, which tends to privilege fiscal evaluations of area protected over direct conservation outcomes. Although Tropical Forest Conservation Act projects may well have conservation effects, the current methods of measuring success do not reflect the types of conservation impacts of Tropical Forest Conservation Act projects...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} and occurrence of <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> are examined empirically. Contracts executing <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> are studied {{to assess the}} role of transaction costs in determining how these agreements are structured. The emerging contract form {{is a product of}} weak enforcement of legal claims to environmental resources in developing countries, high costs for delineating and monitoring environmental outcomes, and nominal government ownership of the resources involved. The occurrence of swaps in individual countries is significantly related to host country attributes, including the presence of tropical land and threatened species, democratic political institutions, and large debt burdens. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{financing}} mechanism for <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> is an {{agreement among the}} funder(s), the national government of the debtor country, and the conservation organization(s) using the funds. The national government of the indebted country agrees to a payment schedule {{on the amount of}} the debt forgiven, usually paid through the nation’s central bank, in local currency or bonds. The process is shown in Figure 1.Participation in <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> has been restricted primarily to countries where the risk of default on debt payments is high. In these circumstances, the funder can purchase the debt at well below its face value.|$|R
40|$|Debt-for-nature swaps {{have emerged}} as one method for debt {{burdened}} nations to retire their foreign debt through international markets. In a typical <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap,</b> conservation groups buy some portion of a nation's debt, usually in secondary markets at discounted prices, in return for long-term commitments from the country to preserve domestic ecological zones. The first <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> occurred in Bolivia in 1987. Since then these programs {{have been used by}} a variety of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as a means of reducing debt loads. While an extensive literature exists on the practical workings of these programs and on the level of their usage, there exists a dearth of theoretical explanations for the development of debt-for-nature swaps. The premise of this paper is that debt-for-nature swaps can be interpreted as an application of the Coase Theorem to the problem of environmental degradation. In 1960, Ronald Coase published "The Problem of Social Cost". This work has had tremendous influence on the way that the legal system and many economists view the problem of externalities or third-party costs. As Coase stated in his 1991 Nobel prize acceptance speech: "I explained in ‘The Problem of Social Cost ’ that what are traded on the market are not, as is often supposed by economists, physical entities, but the rights to perform certain actions [...] . " The Coase Theorem, in simple terms, posits that in the presence of low transaction costs and competitive markets, solutions aimed at maximizing societal welfare will present themselves. Coase presented an alternative to the widely accepted Pigouvian solution fo...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} environmental {{lending and}} transfers in a two country general equilibrium framework. The lender country chooses specific environmental investments which it finances in the neighbour {{country on the}} basis of the returns they generate for the lender. The gains from this kind of international environmental financing are illustrated with a numerical calibration of the model showing that the gains to the lender country may be fairly sizable in relation to the expenditure directed currently towards environmental protection. These gains, however, essentially depend on the terms of the environmental financing. We also find that debt-for-nature swaps do not in general produce efficient environmental protection if applied uniformly in international environmental financing.

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims {{to provide}} policy {{recommendations}} to improve both environmental quality and {{growth in the}} context of debt consolidation. For that purpose, we develop an overlapping generation model in which we include public debt, and we modelize the two-way causality between life expectancy and the environment. We use a phase diagram to demonstrate the possibility of an environmental poverty trap. Using comparative statics around steady states, we find that a voluntary environmental policy may allow a country to escape the environmental poverty trap, or may help a country to reach a higher level of development. This paper also argues in favor of <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> mechanisms. Finally, by means of a welfare analysis, we find that public debt is a useful instrument to simultaneously solve the capital over-accumulation problem and reach environmental objectives, but it must be used with cautio...|$|E
50|$|<b>Debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> produce {{only minor}} debt {{reductions}} and generate far less funding than the face {{value of the}} debt purchased in the secondary market. The amount of public debt relieved by <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps,</b> even in the countries that participate in swaps regularly, accounts for less than 1% of total external debt.Also, if the indebted country does not engage in conservation {{in the absence of}} a <b>debt-for-nature</b> agreement, the <b>swap</b> may not provide the indebted country a social welfare improvement or any fiscal space in the national budget. The government of the indebted country is still responsible for payment of the debt, albeit to a conservation organization rather than to the creditor. Also, the funds produced through the agreement may replace other forms of aid, debt assistance, or conservation funding.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, the {{responsibility}} of conservation lies with the local non-governmental organization implementing the protection measures. <b>Debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> are only effective when the conservation organizations are respected by local residents, have a good financial management capacity, {{and have a good}} relationship with government and other non-governmental organizations.|$|R
50|$|Creditors see <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> as {{a method}} to rid {{themselves}} of high-risk claims.

40|$|The {{vital role}} of forests in {{limiting}} {{the likelihood of}} dangerous climate change has precipitated renewed interest in debt-for-nature swaps. This article uses evidence on past debt-for-nature swaps and similar debt mechanisms to assess the recent second wave of debt swaps. It outlines five typical shortcomings of this form of financial transaction: that they often fail to deliver additional resources to the debtor country; often fail to deliver more resources for conservation/climate purposes; often have a negligible effect on overall debt burdens, and, as such, do not generate more ‘indirect’ benefits; and are often {{in conflict with the}} new aid delivery paradigm’s emphasis on alignment with government policy and systems. Our analysis is applied to a recent <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swap</b> initiative between the United States and Indonesia. We show that this case, which we consider as a litmus test for current swap practice, performs unevenly across the five shortcomings identified. On the one hand, the swap does not create additional resources for the Government of Indonesia, is too insignificant to create indirect (positive) economic effects, and appears at odds with the new aid delivery paradigm’s insistence on system alignment. On the other hand, the swap does not reduce Government of Indonesia resources, and is very much in line with current national policy. The extent to which the resources provided by the swap are additional to other donor support and reserved domestic budget lines for conservation goals is unclear. Whilst a second generation of debt-for-nature swaps should clearly be avoided, {{there is a need to}} debate broader ways of linking debt service repayments to forest conservation. ...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge about {{cetaceans}} in the Red Sea {{is limited}} {{with only a}} handful of sporadic or spatially-limited studies carried out to date. Funded by the Italian Cooperation through a <b>Debt-for-Nature</b> <b>Swap</b> programme and carried out in collaboration with the Egyptian NGO HEPCA, this thesis presents the results from the first ever systematic vessel-based surveys conducted in the southern Egyptian Red Sea from 2010 to 2013 using linetransect methodology. The main aims of the thesis were (a) to estimate cetacean abundance, (b) to determine distribution patterns and habitat use of the cetacean species, (c) to investigate movement patterns for species for which individual recognition techniques were suitable and (d) to identify areas of conservation concern for cetaceans with a particular focus on existing protected areas. Eight species were identified, of which five were commonly encountered (Stenella longirostris, S. attenuata, Tursiops truncatus, T. aduncus, and Grampus griseus) and three were rare (Pseudorca crassidens, Sousa plumbea, Balaenoptera edeni). Estimates of abundance using design-based line transect sampling techniques were obtained for five species: S. attenuata 10, 268 (CV= 0. 26); S. longirostris 6, 961 (CV= 0. 26); T. aduncus 659 (CV= 0. 69); T. truncatus 509 (CV= 0. 33), and G. griseus 367 (CV= 0. 37). Habitat modelling revealed that the two Stenella species were widely distributed across the study area. In contrast, T. truncatus was concentrated in waters around Ras Banas peninsula (in particular Satayah offshore reef), and T. aduncus was mainly found along the coast with possibly separate sub-populations in the northern and southern study area. G. griseus was only encountered in the southern part.

40|$|In this article, Professor O’Neill and Professor Sunstein first {{explore and}} suggest {{improvements}} in current <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps,</b> {{with the ultimate}} aim of defending the use of economic incentives and Paretian principles {{in the context of}} international environmental policy. Second, they examine some of the limitations of the exchange of debt for nature, and thus suggest an alternative exchange that overcomes those limitations. The exchange they envision is quite simple. Developed nations would transfer to developing nations environmentally advanced technologies, particularly technologies designed to increase efficient energy use or to replace non-renewable sources with renewable sources of energy. In return, developing nations would agree to provide a measure of environmental protection. In Part II of this article, they outline the concerns, both ecological and economic, that lead to the creation of <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps.</b> In Part III, after detailing the mechanics of such swaps, they discuss various objections to these exchanges and examine potential limitations on their usefulness. In Part IV, they discuss the current possibilities for the implementation of technologies for the efficient use of energy and for the development of renewable sources of energy. Then they propose an exchange of such technologies for nature and note several considerations that will bear upon the structuring of such trades. Professors O’Neill and Sunstein conclude that trades of energy technology for nature have significant advantages over <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps.</b> Trades that involve technology hold out the best long-term promise for helping both developing and industrialized nations to promote economic development, to protect the environment, and to bring about an equitable international sharing of the burdens imposed by both of these imperatives...|$|R

5000|$|Debt {{for nature}} swaps are usually {{actioned}} by an indebted nation's elite, not the peasantry who may traditionally have owned {{or at least}} used the land in question. Land rights are often expressed in different ways and ownership takes many forms.

Subsequent swaps have sought to include local residents, especially indigenous peoples, in the decision making process and the management of lands.

40|$|The {{next great}} {{issue on the}} Russian {{landscape}} will be management of its foreign debt. In the near future the United States will {{be called upon to}} lead an international program of debt restructuring to assist Russia in overcoming the burden of its debt trap. With debt service obligations equal to 50 {percent} of 1999 revenues, Russia has virtually no chance of sustaining a program of economic recovery without debt relief (Hardt, 1999). With some form of debt restructuring a foregone conclusion, Russia, the United States, and world community have a vital stake in searching for creative ways to transform the inevitability of debt restructuring into something of value and constructive to Russia and the problems it faces. This was the rationale behind <b>debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> which emerged in the early 1980 s in Latin American and Eastern Europe as a means of relieving developing nations of their crippling foreign debt. <b>Debt-for-nature</b> <b>swaps</b> served both domestic and international needs by converting a portion of foreign debt, often at steep discounts, into local currency that was then used to fund programs to preserve the environment. The debt swap mechanism provides the prospect of getting something of real value where nothing is expected. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has proposed to use the same model to synergistically capitalize defense threat reduction activities and environmental remediation within Russia's closed nuclear cities. Preventing the emigration of nuclear technology, expertise, and hardware from these cities to subnational groups and countries of proliferation concern is one of the world's foremost pressing problems. It is in the best national security interest of the United states to assist Russia in overcoming the legacy of the Cold War by helping to address the catastrophic environmental and public health effects of nuclear production that negatively impact economic stabilization...|$|R
