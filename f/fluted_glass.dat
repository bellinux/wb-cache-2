50|$|In 1964, {{during the}} Venice Biennale, he {{presented}} the so-called “Biennale déchirée” (“Torn Biennial”) {{and four years}} later the “Biennale éclatée” (“Shattered Biennial”): for which he deformed the catalogue covers of each National Pavilion thanks to a prism of <b>fluted</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 1946 onwards, {{he started}} {{creating}} his first photograms and solarizations on paper in his Parisian apartment. He then met André Breton {{to whom he}} showed his work. His first abstract photographs were taken {{by means of a}} circular reflector equipped with small mirrors, which multiplied and fragmented the subject matter. For his first attempt, he used a copy of an Etruscan object and photographed it through the fragments of <b>fluted</b> <b>glass.</b> He entitled it “Trésor de Golcondo” (“Treasures of Golcondo”). One day, in the family’s glazing workshop, he noticed some rejects of <b>fluted</b> <b>glass</b> splashed with paint - an accidental prism - and decided to use those latter for his photographs. He had effectively developed a new kind of camera, the Hypnagogoscope (expression made of three Greek words : hypnos : “sleep”; agogos “one who leads” and skopein “to observe”). The adjective “hypnagogic” signifying “which immediately precedes sleep”, a state of drawsiness. Hains’ use of hypnagogy enabled him to tear himself away from the usual tendency of photography to mimic : it deconstructed the light and transformed the image into abstract lines. He made use of procedures adapted from pre-war Dada and Surrealism with hypnagogic abstract photographs, often produced with the help of distorting mirrors. In 1948, he opened his first exhibition, “hypnagogical photographs“, at the Gallery Colette Allendy in Paris.|$|E

50|$|The core {{instruments}} of rebetiko, from the mid-1930s onwards, {{have been the}} bouzouki, the baglamas and the guitar. Instruments characteristic of the Ottoman café style included accordion, politiki (Constantinopolitan) lyra, clarinet, kanonaki, oud, santur, tsimbalo, or cimbalom, violin, violoncello and finger-cymbals.Several of these instruments were also used in rebetiko songs of other than Ottoman character. Other instruments heard on rebetiko recordings include: double bass, laouto, mandola, mandolin and piano. In some recordings, the sound of clinking glass may be heard. This sound is produced by drawing worry beads (komboloi) against a <b>fluted</b> drinking <b>glass,</b> originally an ad hoc and supremely effective rhythmic instrument, probably characteristic of teké and taverna milieux, and subsequently adopted in the recording studios.|$|R
30|$|While the {{identification}} of secondary production centres has not been possible so far, circumstantial evidence suggested that fluted bowls were a product of Greece or the Aegean, and the similarity in the chemical composition of the <b>fluted</b> and petal-decorated <b>glasses</b> {{with those of the}} glasses excavated from Greek sites, including Rhodes, might support the suggestion that these were imports from the Greek Aegean region into the Near East. This is further supported by the findings of Reade et al. [45] who made similar observations with regard to the compositions of monochrome Hellenistic glassware found at Gordion in Anatolia.|$|R
50|$|Born in Paris 1816, Chappuis {{moved to}} London where {{he ran a}} {{photographic}} studio at 69 Fleet Street between 1859 and 1871.He also patented different types of light reflector, that would allow natural light into buildings that would otherwise require gaslights during daytime. He set up a company to manufacture reflectors in 1856 {{on the basis of}} his 1853 and 1855 patents for different types of reflector: myriastratic or diamond-shaped, silver <b>fluted</b> <b>glass,</b> argento-crystal, and luminarium reflector. He was declared bankrupt in 1859, and briefly imprisoned for debt.However his business recovered, and was reformed as a limited company in 1868.|$|E
5000|$|The {{monument}} {{stands on}} a white ashlar base. It consists of a shaft about 18.3 m high surmounted by a lighting bowl. The core of the shaft is reinforced concrete, which is overlaid with fluted and polished black granite. The lighting bowl is in gilded bronze and glass. [...] The shaft tapers, and is also slightly curved [...] "to correct the optical illusion of being less in diameter in the centre than {{at the top of}} the shaft". [...] There are two bands around the shaft decorated with chevrons and acanthus. At the top of the shaft is a <b>fluted</b> <b>glass</b> bowl. Arising from this is a ribbed cap bearing a spherical-shaped lamp. [...] On the base of the shaft is an inscription reading as follows. :QUEENSWAY:OPENED BY:HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE V:18TH JULY 1934:ACCOMPANIED BY:HER MAJESTY QUEEN MARY:THE WORK ON THIS TUNNEL:WAS COMMENCED ON:16TH DECEMBER:BY:HER ROYAL HIGHNESS:PRINCESS MARY VISCOUNTESS LASCELLES:who started the pneumatic boring drills:at St George's Dock Liverpool:MCMXXXIV ...|$|E
50|$|Hains {{attended}} “Lettrist” performances, particularly {{appreciating the}} work of François Dufrêne, Isidore Isou and Daniel Pomerand. In 1950, he devoted himself to creating a representation in plastic of the written outputs {{at the heart of}} the Lettrist movement, shredding the Letters with the <b>fluted</b> <b>glass</b> lens, in this way inventing the “Ultra-letter” concept. Mesmerized by the design and the sound of letters, he played with names such as Camille Bryen or Jacques Villeglé and experienced the meaninglessness of the word once exploded, letters contending, extending, exploding to the point where language lost all coherence. This photographic process of deformation fell within a modern issue initiated by Stéphane Mallarmé, further pursued by Guillaume Apollinaire and later by the “lettrists”. In 1953, Raymond Hains published “Hépérile éclaté” in collaboration with Villeglé. The phonetic poem “Hyperile” written by Camille Bryen, pioneer of lyrical abstraction was exploded into an “ultra-letter”, thus creating the first of its kind : a poem not intended to be read. According to Hains, it was a question of exploding the word into ultra-words that no human could express.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the rest}} of Victorian Flatbush, the Beverley Squares have been revitalized since the 1970s by an influx of new {{residents}} who value the relatively cheap houses {{in a variety of}} architectural styles with details such as <b>fluted</b> columns, stained <b>glass,</b> large porches, and turrets. Beverley Square West has an active residents' association that celebrated the centenary of the neighborhood in 2002 and is trying to achieve designation by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, but without success [...] Together with Ditmas Park West, the Beverley Squares are now often thought of as part of Ditmas Park.|$|R
500|$|Reading {{moved to}} within {{one point of}} {{promotion}} on 19 April 1976 with a 1–0 home victory over Brentford. Friday set up the game's only goal, beating three players before hitting the post with his shot; Ray Hiron scored from the rebound. Friday scored a powerful left-footed volley {{during the first half}} of a 2–2 draw away against Cambridge United two days later. The result secured Third Division football for Reading. At the celebratory dinner after the game, the Reading captain Gordon Cumming saw some <b>fluted</b> wine <b>glasses,</b> and voiced his admiration: [...] "I wouldn't mind a few of them for home", he said. [...] "Give us a few minutes and I'll get them for you", replied Friday. Going around the dining room and picking them off the tables, he stole a whole boxful of the glasses, which he managed to sneak out of the hotel and onto the team coach, but much to Cumming's annoyance he then decided to keep them for himself. With 22 goals for the year, 21 in the league, Friday was once more Reading's top goalscorer and for the second consecutive season the team's player of the year.|$|R
30|$|The current {{analyses}} {{have also}} shown that the natron base-glass compositions of the Jebel Khalid <b>fluted</b> and petal-decorated <b>glasses</b> {{are the same as}} those of the undecorated bowls, and by this association we can contemplate the possibility that all the Jebel Khalid glass bowls were manufactured in Greece or the Aegean. At Rhodes, the so-called sagged bowls lack the internal grooves found on many Jebel Khalid glass bowls [42 : p. 147]. Although this could suggest a different source of bowls from those found in the Levant, the similarity at least of the basic glass composition between Greek/Rhodian examples and those from Jebel Khalid, Tel Anafa (Israel), and Gordion (Anatolia) to the east might indicate another possibility: that the glass was made in the same place, but was formed elsewhere from imported raw glass chunks, or, alternatively, that the blank bowls were made in one place, whereas the cutting was done at a later stage somewhere along the route of distribution.|$|R
50|$|Encompassing {{an entire}} city block, the {{rectangular}} building rises six stories (the fifth floor is concealed on the exterior behind the limestone entablature). The facade (south elevation) facing Broadway Street features a row of 18 engaged Corinthian columns with fluted shafts poised upon a rusticated base of arched windows aligned with the fenestration above. The colonnade is framed at each end by projecting pavilions, each with four columns and crowning pediments. The secondary east and west elevations are composed of 12 colossal Corinthian columns to match those of the facade. A continuous limestone entablature, composed of an architrave, frieze, dentil molding, and cornice, and a balustraded parapet cap the south, east, and west elevations. Above this, the unadorned smooth stone walls of the sixth story are subordinate to the articulated rhythm of the lower stories. The two primary entrances are recessed within the tripartite arches {{at the ends of}} the facade, and are accessed by stairs flanked by original bronze and glass light standards with claw feet and <b>fluted</b> columns. The <b>glass</b> and bronze doors are original, and retain their decorative surrounds and elliptical transoms containing bronze grilles.|$|R
50|$|Chair car Star Dust (Pullman plan number 7555) seated 72 passengers. It {{provided}} seating {{on three}} levels, including in its Astra-Dome and three semiprivate rooms beneath the dome {{in addition to}} on its main level. Its two main level sections, the forward coach section and the rear coach section, seated 16 and 12 passengers each, respectively. The dome sat 24 people, while {{two of the three}} semiprivate rooms could accommodate 7 while the third could seat 6. The seats in the car could rotate, allowing them to face the direction of travel or allow two pairs of seats to face each other, allowing families to interact with each other during a trip. The semiprivate rooms were separated from the passageway by shoulder-high partitions, while these three rooms were divided from each other by <b>fluted</b> (or ribbed) <b>glass</b> called Securit Linex Glass that, while it transmitted light, provided some privacy by impairing the ability to see through it. The first and third semiprivate rooms each had two pairs of chairs and a couch that could accommodate three people, while the second contained two of the three-person couches instead. Under the stairway of the dome, the car contained various supplies and necessities, including a water cooler, a coat locker, and a jump seat for the porter. The car had a set of men's and women's lavatories at either end, with the pair at the vestibule end being complemented by men's and women's dressing rooms. Also at the vestibule end, the car had luggage compartments {{on both sides of the}} aisle that could be accessed from either inside or outside the train.|$|R
