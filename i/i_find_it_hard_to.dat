So dealing with rejection {{became a part of}} life.... All that has taken a toll, I guess. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> deal with praise. Today, when people say that I have made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere... It scares me." ...|$|E

Blair observed, [...] "with {{all due respect to}} the Inspector General, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> understand how I could be criticized for violating conflict of interest standards when I didn't have any influence on the study".|$|E
2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially {{if you are going to}} be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E

2500|$|Church's {{personal}} life {{has often been}} portrayed in UK tabloid newspapers, inspiring the song [...] "Let's Be Alone" [...] on her album Tissues and Issues. At age 15 she was criticised for remarks she made about the behaviour {{of people in the}} aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks. At the Leveson Inquiry she stated that her comments were taken vastly out of context. In a 2006 interview with Davina McCall, she agreed being diplomatic was [...] "not in her nature". In November 2011, Church testified before the Leveson Inquiry about the media intrusion into her {{personal life}} stating [...] "I've been made a caricature for so long, and this person portrayed in the tabloids really isn't me. It's not the person I am, and it's had a massive impact on my career. As an artist, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> be taken seriously because my credibility has been blown to bits." [...] On 27 February 2012 Church accepted £600,000 in damages and costs in settlement of a lawsuit arising out of the News International phone hacking scandal. She had claimed that 33 stories about her that appeared in the News of the World were the product of illegal hacking into her family's voicemail. After the settlement was announced in open court she made a lengthy statement in which she said, [...] "I have also discovered that despite the apology which the newspaper has just given in court, these people were prepared to go to any lengths to prevent me exposing their behaviour. They are not truly sorry. They are just sorry they got caught." ...|$|E

However, time may help me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You ask me so many questions," [...] he murmured, [...] "and I {{tell you}} that I know nothing. I have asked you to come here with me because I had just this to say.

60|$|And yet <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> do {{even this}} measure of justice to my friend.
