40|$|<b>Illicit</b> <b>Financial</b> Outflow is a {{stumbling}} {{stone in}} achieving fast {{and sustainable development}} in Ethiopia. Capital is the most scares resource and also the most needed resources in Ethiopia. Capital is the main resources that Ethiopia needs to transform its economy from an agrarian economy that depends on few agricultural products to an advanced economy with a broad and diversified base that creates jobs for its citizens. The Ethiopian economy is opening more and more {{from time to time}} to attract both demotic and foreign investors. For this purpose, many new laws are enacted and the existing laws amended to the advantage of investors. Repealing, amending and simplifying strict legal requirements on transfer of funds out of Ethiopia are the main reformations that have been introduced to attract foreign investors. The move to encourage and attract the participation of private investors is by any standard recommendable. However, this has to be done consciously as it may drain the resources of the country without achieving the intended objectives of the incentives munificently granted by the laws to foreign investors. The research shows that the existing legal framework is ineffective to control <b>illicit</b> <b>financial</b> outflows. The investment laws focus on attracting foreign direct investment with very little practical relevance to control <b>illicit</b> <b>financial</b> outflows. The investment laws provide foreign investors unlimited and very broad opportunity to transfer funds out of Ethiopia without putting the required administrative and legal framework to regulate unintended negative results of the laws and manipulation of the laws to illicitly transfer funds out of Ethiopia. The trade regulation regime needs to focus on creating a predictable and stable business environment rather than enacting laws to regulate the inherently unregulated business situations. Laws cannot solve all problems and to attempt to solve all market problems by enacting laws will create more problems. Especially the foreign trade regime shall be regulated with full awareness of the impact of the laws on <b>illicit</b> <b>financial</b> outflow. Most of the existing trade laws do not take controlling <b>illicit</b> <b>financial</b> outflow as a central issue. For this reason, it is difficult to say that in Ethiopia there are laws that regulate mispricing with an aim of controlling <b>illicit</b> <b>financial</b> outflow. Most of the laws try to control and verify miss pricing for customs duties, for tax or/ and for controlling inflation in the demotic market. The authorities investigate and scrutinize suspicious misprice only when they consider some of the objectives of the law are compromised and unfortunately fighting <b>illicit</b> <b>financial</b> outflow is not one of the objectives. The foreign exchange regime is highly regulated. However, it is unpredictable and overtaken by temporary problems that it constantly struggles to solve. The newly enacted antimoney laundering and financing terrorism proclamation paradoxically focus on controlling illicit inflows rather than illicit outflows. Generally the attempt to control foreign exchange helps very little to control <b>illicit</b> <b>financial</b> outflows in Ethiopia. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the emergence}} of current account imbalances {{as a result of}} the co-existence of trade <b>flows</b> and <b>financial</b> <b>flows.</b> The literature has tended to view these factors in isolation: Many post-Kaleckian models, as well as Net-saving approaches assume that <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> will adjust to trade flows. Models focusing on financial crises feature a strong role for <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> but ignore drivers of trade flows. Similarly, empirical analyses either ignore drivers of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> or insufficiently capture determinants of trade flows. The paper, first, proposes a simple macroeconomic framework of the current account which gives equal emphasis to trade flows, determined by price competitiveness, and <b>financial</b> <b>flows,</b> determined by asset prices. Second, we test a reduced form of the model for 28 OECD countries for the period 1971 - 2014. Our results indicate that cost competitiveness as well as asset prices play a role in the determination of current accounts, but asset prices have dominated in the last two decades...|$|R

This paper aims to measure the volatility of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> in Brazil and to apply different measures of capital flight, in order to analyze the external vulnerability of the Brazilian economy. The main goal is to compare the volatility indicators and measures of capital flight in order to evaluate which indicator best reveals the potential for reversion of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> to Brazil and best captures external vulnerability in the economy.

While volatility of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> may capture moments when Brazil is facing a period of inflows of international resources and the transition to sharp reversals and large negative transfers, capital flight may indicate the sensitivity of capital flows toward Brazil due to unstable factors and external shocks. In this sense, the capital flight as the one which occurred in 2008 may be explained by high volatility of capital flows.
