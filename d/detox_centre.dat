5000|$|... 54. The Rehab Diaries - Narrated by Renton. Renton <b>detox’s</b> at the <b>centre</b> {{and joins}} the group. This lengthy, crucial chapter, stylistically {{different}} from the rest of the novel, though foreshadowed in the opening chapter, is written as his rehab diary and journal. The group politics are explored, as are the power struggles in his individual sessions with ‘superstar counselor’ Tom Curzon. Meanwhile, Sick Boy is shagging confused hooker Molly, Swanney is winding everybody up, suggesting the absent Matty is a grass, Seeker declaring he’s staying clean to make proper money dealing, Renton realizing that ‘the rehab game’ is not about quitting, but detoxing to get the habit under control. For kicks he sends a spoof letter to his racist neighbours, the Curran’s, informing them they will share their flat with a Pakistani family. He plays the game, despite his conflicts with Tom, but following his release is thinking of his next fix even as he’s being driven home by his parents. White Lines on radio.

5000|$|He was {{generally}} {{unhappy with the}} United Kingdom's government-run healthcare system known as the National Health Service. When he saw an advertisement for doctors in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, Savage decided to pack up his family and move across the ocean to continue his medical practice in 1967. He {{made a name for}} himself as the [...] "hippie doctor" [...] in the 1970s, due to his beard and progressive health stances. By setting up a <b>detox</b> <b>centre</b> — and a free clinic in the economically disadvantaged and mostly black community of North Preston — he assured his reputation as a left-winger.|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that patients who present in the UK to detoxification services differ from patients who present with severe alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD) with respect to severity of dependence on alcohol and other features of their drinking history. Methods: Levels of alcohol dependence were assessed in 34 patients with severe ALD, {{all of whom were}} cirrhotic, and 34 subjects from a residential alcohol <b>detox</b> <b>centre</b> in Southampton using the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ). During interview, various aspects of participants' alcohol consumption were recorded, including total monthly consumption, whom they usually drank with and where, and, if applicable, what caused them to start drinking heavily. Social circumstances were also noted, including participants' employment and marital status. Results: Among ALD patients, 58 % scored none/mild on the SADQ, 32 % moderate and 9 % severe. In contrast, 76 % of the detox group were graded severe and 34 % moderate (P < 0. 001). ALD patients were also significantly older, had lower scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, tended to drink less alcohol, {{were more likely to be}} in a stable relationship, were less likely to be unemployed and gave different reasons for starting to drink heavily. The ALD group were most likely to have started drinking heavily for social reasons, whereas subjects in the detox group were most likely to have started drinking heavily as a result of relationship or money problems. Conclusion: Patients attending a liver unit and patients admitted to a detoxification unit were separate but overlapping populations of alcohol misusers. Perhaps these two populations of alcohol misusers are likely to require different approaches for effective detection, intervention and treatment...|$|E
