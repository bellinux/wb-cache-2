The militia got the rioters out of the public house and assembled them in the street, surrounded by the troopers. Thomas Sindall attempted to take a musket from trooper William Porter but was not successful. Sindall ran away and when he did not stop after being called on to do so by Porter, he was shot through the back of the head. Thomas Sindall was killed; he was the only person known to be at both Downham Market and Littleport. The result of this shooting was to subdue the rest of the rioters.

40|$|Hemp seed {{yields of}} the variety Fedora- 19 in an on-farm {{scientific}} field experiment on small plots and in an on-farm evaluation in 11 <b>hemp</b> <b>fields</b> under practical organic growing conditions in Lower Austria were compared to give a realistic view of the variability of yields. Dry matter seed yields from the on-farm field experiment ranged from 127 to 143 g/m 2. Under practical growing conditions, yields ranged from 34 to 151 g/m 2 in the sample plots. The reported hemp seed yield after combine harvesting, drying, and cleaning was between 324 kg/ha and 717 kg/ha. The results of the experiment show that harvesting by hand considerably influences yields. Yields of the manual harvest in sample plots indicate a high correlation with yields harvested by the combine harvester (R 2 = 0. 91). The commercial yield is 71 % of the yields recorded in sample plots in the fields. Our data questions the transfer of results and conclusions drawn from the data of scientific field experiments that employ manual harvest to that of practical circumstances, and support the notion of on-farm research...|$|R

6000|$|Moy (pronounce Moÿ) was a {{pleasant}} little village, gathered round a château in a moat.

After every dish was sent in, she would come and look on at the dinner for a while, with puckered, blinking eyes. [...] "C'est bon, n'est-ce pas?" [...] she would say; and when she had received a proper answer, she disappeared into the kitchen. That common French dish, partridge and cabbages, became a new thing in my eyes at the Golden Sheep; and many subsequent dinners have bitterly disappointed me in consequence.

40|$|The optimal {{combination}} of yield {{and quality of}} <b>hemp</b> fibres from <b>field</b> grown crops is around flowering. Therefore prediction of flowering time would support in planning production and optimization of the cultivar choice for different agro-ecological zones. In the current paper the validation of a recently published model (Amaducci et al., 2008 a) is carried out for four varieties across {{a wide range of}} sites and thus of air temperature–photoperiod combinations. The model was evaluated by comparing its output to field observations of the duration between emergence and 50 % flowering. The model output and observed times from emergence to 50 % of flowering generally corresponded well, but some discrepancies were apparent. The biggest discrepancies between estimates and actual data were observed at extreme latitudes. The level of accuracy of the model predictions is satisfactory for strategic decision regarding sowing and harvesting time and cultivar choice, but tactical decisions (e. g. time of harvest based on flowering time) cannot be accurately supporte...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{systematic and}} improved methodologies {{to characterize the}} surface and fracture of elementary <b>hemp</b> fibres by <b>Field</b> Emission Scanning Microscope (FE-SEM), determine the Microfibril Angles (MFA) by an advanced microscopy technology and examine the crystallinity by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR). The results showed that 1) There existed various deformations/defects in elementary hemp fibres, showing four types of deformations, namely kink bands, dislocations, nodes and slip planes. The crack {{on the surface of}} elementary fibres was the initial breaking point under stress; 2) Under tension the primary wall and secondary wall of hemp fibres showed different deformation and breaking behaviour. The crack initiated in a weak point of primary wall and subsequently propagated along radial direction from S 1 to S 2 layers; 3) The average MFA for the broken regions of S 2 layer was 6. 16 ? compared to 2. 65 ? for the normal hemp fibres and the breaking of hemp fibres occurred at the points where had the biggest MFA; 4) The average MFA was 2. 65 ? for S 2 layer and 80. 35 ? for S 1 layer; 5) the Crystallinity Index (CI) determined by XRD and FTIR was very similar, showing the lattice parameters of the hemp fibres tested a = 6. 97 Å, b = 6. 26 Å, c = 11. 88 Å and γ = 97. 21 ?, and the ratio of 1423 to 896 cm- 1 was found more suitable for CI evaluation for hemp fibres...|$|R
40|$|Ramie and hemp fiber are {{two major}} fibers among the four {{traditional}} fibers (cotton, wool, hemp, and ramie) of Korea. They have a very long history going back to {{as early as the}} first century AD Ramie fabric, as summer clothing, was enjoyed by upper class/royal families and scholars. On the other hand, hemp fabric was worn by the lower class, such as people who worked in labor intensive <b>fields.</b> <b>Hemp</b> fabrics were also used for funerary costumes and shrouds; this tradition continues to the present time. After four years of on-site research, I presented two papers on two distinct types of Korean hemp fabrics (Andongpoh and Musam) at the TSA Biennial Symposia of 2006 and 2008. In the summer of 2009, I conducted another on-site research study on Korean ramie in Hansan County, which {{has a long history of}} ramie cultivation (dating to the 7 th century). For this research, I filmed and documented a ramie harvest and the complex steps of fabric production. As final products, there was little difference in quality between ramie and hemp fabric. However, different characteristics of these two fibers led to the development of different processing techniques in the two industries. The main focus of my presentation will be the morphological differences between ramie and hemp; the latter produced particularly in Andong County. I will explain how these fibers’ differences led weavers to develop the distinctive yarn-making processes as bast fibers...|$|R
