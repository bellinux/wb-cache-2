5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> even know if this message is going to get to you because <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|Fear of suffocation—something that I have or fear {{is never}} {{being able to}} enjoy myself,... 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really hard {{to go out and}} have a good time.... <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> go to nightclubs,... You don't see {{pictures}} of me falling out of a club drunk. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> go—and that's because I usually go and then, you know, a whiskey and a half into it, I {{got to get back to}} work.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> recognize the fans. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
5|$|Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> know. I mean, I mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I {{do the same things}} that I did before … I think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|E

5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> care about Hizbullah as a political organization. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> support burning. <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of me, because <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> want those buildings standing {{if they are going to}} hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E
