40|$|Introduction Photonics {{technology}} has been growing rapidly into microwave systems with the advancement of optical component technology. In addition to microwave transmission for subcarrier systems [1] and satellite communications [2], many new functions have been demonstrated, such as microwave generation, filtering, and mixing, which traditionally are performed by the microwave electronics. Additionally, emerging wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology finds its place {{not only in the}} increase of system capacity but also in microwave signal processing, such as true time-delay control for phased-array antenna systems [3]. A novel microwave fiber-optic link has been proposed where the information data are upconverted/downconverted by two <b>external</b> <b>modulators</b> [4].

40|$|Optoelectronic {{oscillators}} (OEOs) producing signal frequencies in {{the radio}} frequency (RF) regime with very low phase noise are crucial for applications such as microwave frequency standards, radars, RF photonics and optical signal processing [1]. Recently, Yao and Maleki demonstrated a novel OEO configuration using a CW laser, a high-speed <b>external</b> <b>modulator,</b> a fiber loop and high-speed photodetector. The CW laser is coupled into the <b>external</b> <b>modulator</b> and fiber loop, which is detected by the high-speed photodetector. The detected RF signal is amplified and fed back to the modulator. Provided with high enough RF amplification, this configuration results in an RF oscillator with a long, but low-loss cavity length, formed by the fiber loop [2]. The long fiber loop resulted in a high-Q cavity, leading to very low phase noise. However, in this configuration, a very high gain (60 dB) RF amplifier chain is necessary to reach the oscillation threshold. The RF amplifiers and <b>external</b> <b>modulator</b> present an upper limit of the RF signal frequency; {{it is challenging to}} achieve> 10 GHz oscillation. Optical injection-locked (OIL) VCSELs have been demonstrated to exhibit high speed frequency response (~ 50 GHz) and large tunability of the resonance peak under direct modulation [3]. In addition, the red-shifted OIL VCSEL cavity amplifies the modulation sideband, which enhances the modulation efficiency at the resonance frequency [4]. In this paper, we propose a novel OIL OEO leveraging the high frequency and high gain resonance peak of an OIL VCSEL, and we also demonstrate a pure RF signal at 20 GHz with phase noise performance 20 dB better than a commercial R...|$|R

The MQW based modulators enhance shifts of the absorption edge due to excitonic properties toward a longer wavelength (i. e red shift) as an external electric field is applied perpendicular to the quantum well layers, a phenomena called the quantum confined Stark effect 3 (QCSE).

In this paper, the latter perspective is tested for its adequacy in explaining robustness of language learning to environmental variation. A computational model of word learning from cross-situational, multimodal information was constructed and tested. Key to the model's robustness was the presence of multiple, individually unreliable information sources to support learning. This “degeneracy” in the language system has a detrimental effect on learning, compared to a noise-free environment, but has a critically important effect on acquisition of a canalized system that is resistant to environmental noise in communication...|$|E

An OPO output power as high as 11 W at an overall slope efficiency of 67 % was achieved, with nearly 2. 7 W and 8. 2 W of optical power obtained at 3. 5 µm and 1. 5 µm respectively.

Bulk modulators are made out of discrete pieces of nonlinear optical crystals and are typically used on a lab bench or an optical table. They feature very low insertion losses, and high power-handling capability.

40|$|International audienceThe {{tremendous}} {{traffic growth}} in intra/inter-datacenters requires low-cost high-speed integrated solutions. To enable a significantly reduced footprint directly modulated lasers (DMLs) {{have been proposed}} instead of large <b>external</b> <b>modulators.</b> However, {{it is challenging to}} use DMLs due to their low dispersion tolerance and limited achievable extinction ratio (ER). A promising solution to this problem is optical spectral reshaping (OSR) since it is possible to increase the dispersion tolerance as well as to enhance the achievable ER for both on-of-keying and 4 -pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals. However, moving to 4 -PAM, many of the impressive demonstrations reported so far rely heavily on off-line digital signal processing (DSP), which increases latency, power consumption and cost. In this talk, we report on (i) a detailed numerical analysis on the complex transfer function of the optical filter for optical spectral reshaping in case of pulse amplitude modulation and (ii) an experimental demonstration of real-time dispersion-uncompensated transmission of 10 -GBd and 14 -GBd 4 -PAM signals up to 10 - and 26 -km SSMF. This is achieved by combining a commercial 10 -Gb/s DML with optical spectral shaping, thus removing the need for any complex off-line DSP and improving dispersion tolerance. These achievements are enabled by OSR based on a passive microring resonator fabricated on the SOI platform [4].

Literature review is presented ongenerating millimeter/micro wave signals with 4 -, 6 -, and 8 -times frequency multiplication based on cascaded MZMs or dual-parallel MZMs (DPMZMs). A novel scheme to optically generate a microwave signal with 10 -times frequency multiplication is proposed. The proposed scheme is based on two DPMZMs and a polarizer.
