5|$|Soon {{after its}} establishment, OCX decided to limit {{construction}} costs to $70million, a figure {{which is in}} addition to approximately $50million of plans, permits, and right-of-way donated by Avatar, who will not be reimbursed. Because of the cost limit, {{the decision was made}} to build a two-lane highway initially, using a design that will easily permit the road to be widened to a four- or six-lane expressway in the future. In July 2013, a <b>design-build</b> contract for the highway was awarded to Jr. Davis Construction Company, based in Kissimmee. The total contract amount was $69,013,443.76, representing $68,788,000.00 for the original contract and $225,443.76 for changes to the project after bidding.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million <b>design–build</b> {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the current}} bridge, four other bridges have spanned the Indian River Inlet, opened in 1934, 1940, 1952, and 1965, the latter widened by an {{additional}} span added in 1976. All were known informally as the Indian River Inlet Bridge, and all but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge. The 1965 bridge, a steel girder bridge, was subject to scouring from the inlet, leading {{to the need to}} replace it. Initial plans for a tied-arch bridge over the inlet in 2004 were over budget, and 2006 plans for a 1,400-foot (427-meter) cable-stayed bridge were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems. Construction of the current, 2,600-foot (792-meter) bridge began in 2008 as part of a <b>design-build</b> project, with Skanska awarded the contract to build the bridge. The current Indian River Inlet Bridge opened partially in January 2012 and completely in May 2012 at a cost of $150 million.|$|E
25|$|The FTA {{approved}} the new $2.3 billion plan on April 4, 2017. <b>Design-build</b> construction contracts {{are expected to}} be awarded in the fall. The new line is expected to be completed at the end of 2021, with some stations possibly opening that summer.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} will be resubmitting the revised {{plan to the}} FTA for approval. If {{approved}} the remaining work will be reprocured using the <b>design-build</b> project delivery method, a process expected to take 18 months if done on an expedited basis. Construction would then take between 43 and 47 months.|$|E
25|$|The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is a {{cable-stayed}} {{bridge over the}} Cooper River in South Carolina, USA, connecting downtown Charleston to Mount Pleasant. The eight lane bridge satisfied the capacity of U.S. Route 17 {{when it opened in}} 2005 to replace two obsolete cantilever truss bridges. The bridge has a main span of 1,546 feet (471 m), the third longest among {{cable-stayed bridge}}s in the Western Hemisphere.

25|$|The Zerega Avenue Maintenance and Training Facility is a one-story {{structure}} {{located on}} the east side of Zerega Avenue between Lafayette and Seward Avenues in the Castle Hill section of the Bronx, sitting along the western coast of Westchester Creek. Plans for the facility were conceived around 1999, and it was constructed in 2000. The facility received an award from the American Society of Civil Engineers for <b>design-build</b> project of the year in 2002. Around 2002, the Zerega shops began overhauling NYCT buses to operate on ultra-low-sulfur diesel. The facility includes paint booths for MTA buses, and was designed to maintain compressed natural gas (CNG) equipment. It also features numerous classrooms and a driving simulator to train MTA bus operators.|$|E
25|$|Groundbreaking on {{the bridge}} {{occurred}} in 2001 in Mount Pleasant. The bridge was built as a <b>design-build</b> project, meaning that one contract was signed to both design and construct the bridge. This meant that construction could begin even while the design was not yet finalized. The bridge was built by a joint venture of two major construction firms operating under the name Palmetto Bridge Constructors. The joint venture partners were Tidewater Skanska of Norfolk, Virginia and Flatiron Constructors of Longmont, Colorado. The construction joint venture hired Parsons Brinckerhoff to complete the design. For the sake of simplifying labor and equipment resources, Palmetto Bridge Constructors actually managed {{the building of the}} bridge as five separate projects (the two highway interchanges {{at either end of the}} bridge, the two approach spans, and the cable-stayed span) going on simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{atmosphere}} remained optimistic {{over the years}} as proposals for the railway's revival were raised, and some Israeli railway maps even labeled the line as 'under construction', actual work did not commence on the valley railway (besides preliminary design work and right-of-way purchases). Then on February 24, 2010, the Israeli government voted to appropriate the sum of NIS 3.5 billion (later raised to 4.1 billion, equivalent to about US$1.15 billion in 2011 dollars) for the detailed design and construction of the railway between Haifa and Beit Shea'an beginning in 2011. On March 7, 2011, the National Roads Authority, which was in charge of managing the project, published a <b>design-build</b> tender for a 6.5km section of the line near Afula. This was the first of a dozen tenders that the authority published through mid-2012 for the railway and five stations with overall completion of construction expected in 2016. The railway was constructed as single-track but with significant provisioning for double-tracking and electrification in a future follow-up project. It terminates in Beit Shea'an, with the extension to the border crossing at the Sheikh Hussein bridge, which will require significant tunneling and bridging, being planned for a later stage.|$|E
500|$|The {{project was}} {{developed}} using a <b>design–build,</b> {{operate and maintain}} (DBOM) approach. [...] The Navy did pre-planning and conducted an environmental impact statement and studied various bridge alternatives and had already settled on a combination fixed and floating bridge. [...] The Navy then awarded contracts of $350,000 to three major contractors to solicit designs for the bridge. [...] On 19 August 1994 the Navy awarded a <b>design-build</b> contract to Dillingham-Manson, JV.|$|E
500|$|PCL Construction {{was awarded}} the $169 million <b>design-build</b> {{contract}} for the extension and the station in September 2012. The station was given a new name, [...] "Angle Lake" [...] after a nearby lake, in December as the extension and station were undergoing final design.|$|E

500|$|Route 92 was a [...] {{proposed}} {{branch of}} the New Jersey Turnpike that would have run from west to east, beginning at U.S. Route 1 just north of Ridge Road (old CR 522) in South Brunswick Township, east along Route 32, to Exit 8A in Monroe Township. Route 92 was also assigned in the 1953 renumbering and by the late 1950s it was named the Princeton–Hightstown Bypass, a freeway planned to connect the Somerset Freeway (an unbuilt section of Interstate 95) in Montgomery Township (near Skillman), with Route 33 in East Windsor Township (east of Hightstown). In 1987, the planned Route 92 was truncated to only run east from U.S. Route 1 near Kingston. New plans were announced in 1994, this time running to US 1 near Princeton. After public hearings found opposition was still strong, the planned route was truncated to a much shorter bypass of Hightstown only and numbered Route 133. Construction on the road, the first project awarded under New Jersey's modified <b>Design-build</b> program, began on September 20, 1996 and was opened November 30, 1999.|$|E
500|$|Start of {{construction}} was delayed as {{approval of the}} $900 million federal contribution to project costs awaited the conclusion of FTA's review of the proposal submitted by Virginia. Virginia government representatives, including Governor Tim Kaine and U.S. Senators John Warner and Jim Webb, arrived at the FTA on January 24, 2008 to address last minute concerns by FTA staff and administrators. FTA Administrator James Simpson presented Governor Kaine with a letter that contained stark criticisms of the project as presented. The project as presented was given a [...] "medium–low" [...] rating (projects must receive a [...] "medium" [...] or higher rating to be approved under the Federal New Starts Funds project) and determined ineligible to receive the $900 million in federal funding. FTA's concerns included the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority's inexperience in large <b>design-build</b> contracts, an exaggeration of funding numbers from the Dulles Toll Road and an inability for Metro to maintain the [...] line once it had been built. Virginian leaders vowed to address the concerns by January 28, 2008, as several fixed price contracts for building materials costs were due to expire on February 1. Governor Kaine requested {{an extension of the}} deadline to February 1, which was granted by the FTA.|$|E
500|$|The highway was {{proposed}} and received {{opposition from the}} communities of Princeton and Plainsboro, who cited destruction of open space and wetlands, which would reduce the quality of local life. In 1982, the Somerset Freeway was canceled as a project, and the $228 million (1982 USD) that came with it was given around by a partnership, with the New Jersey Department of Transportation suggesting the Route 92 Freeway {{become one of the}} six projects to receive funding. Final designs for the freeway were underway in 1986, amid controversy. As a result, the Department of Transportation dropped the section west of U.S. Route 1 in South Brunswick Township only a year later. After plans for Route 92 were realigned northward in 1988, the Princeton-Hightstown Bypass was revived in 1994 for construction of a new bypass of Hightstown. This new, [...] freeway was designed under the Department of Transportation's first modified <b>design-build</b> program and construction commenced in 1996. The contractors in hire for the project were the Schaivone Construction Group, who set a bid for $57 million (1996 USD). The new freeway, designated as Route 133 instead of Route 92, was opened in November 1999, ending the four-decade fight to construction freeway around Hightstown. The delay occurred due to substantial erosion caused by the weakening Hurricane Floyd in 1999.|$|E
500|$|DelDOT {{scrapped}} {{plans for}} the tied-arch bridge and put bids out in 2006 for a <b>design–build</b> project for a new bridge of a cable-stayed design, 1,400 feet (427 meters) long and without piers in the water. Construction of earthen approach ramps for the new bridge began {{on either side of}} the inlet in February 2006; the ramp on the north side of the inlet was completed in December 2006 and that on the south side was finished in February 2007. However, concerns over instability of these ramps arose in the autumn of 2006, and by March 2007 it had become clear that movement of the ramps was greater than expected. Legal problems also began to affect progress, when an unsuccessful bidder on the new construction contract questioned the process by which it had been awarded to another company that had made a bid of $124.9 million [...] $800,000 more than the lowest bid [...] but had nonetheless won the contract based on ambiguous pricing and technical criteria. Labor union leaders also complained that the winning bidder had not promised to use Delaware union labor, unlike the lower bidder. Faced with the possibility of a lawsuit, DelDOT in October 2007 decided to cancel construction of the bridge under the existing contract, have the unstable approach ramps removed, and rebid the contract for a longer, 2,600-foot (792-meter) cable-stayed bridge [...] again without piers in the water [...] of a new design that did not require the flawed approach ramps. During 2008, the approach ramps were removed, and the Delaware legislature passéd a new bond bill making it easier for state officials to award a bid under clearer pricing and technical criteria.|$|E

2500|$|The 2004 {{renovation}} of the infield, headed by design firm HNTB, {{was the first major}} {{renovation of}} the infield {{in the history of the}} track. In addition to the fanzone, a new vehicle and pedestrian tunnel was built under turn 1. [...] The tunnel posed a challenge to engineers because it was to be built under the water table. Another challenge came during construction when three named hurricanes passed by the track, flooding much of the excavation work. The infield renovation involved landscaping and hardscaping, such as a new walkway along the shore of Lake Lloyd, and the construction of 34 new buildings, including garages and fueling stations, offices and inspection facilities, and a club. The renovation project received a 2005 Award for Excellence from <b>Design-Build</b> Institute of America. Following the success of the UNOH Fanzone at Daytona, Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Kansas Speedway each built a similar infield fanzone.

50|$|Proponents of <b>design-build</b> {{counter that}} <b>design-build</b> saves {{time and money}} for the owner, while {{providing}} the opportunity to achieve innovation in the delivered facility. They note that value is added because <b>design-build</b> brings value engineering into the design process {{at the onset of}} a project. <b>Design-build</b> allows the contractor, engineers and specialty trade contractors (subcontractors) to propose best-value solutions for various construction elements before the design is complete. <b>Design-build</b> brings all members of a project team together early in the process to identify and address issues of cost, schedule and constructability. Proponents suggest that as a result, <b>design-build</b> alleviates conflict between architects and contractors and reduces owner risk for design errors. They argue that once design is finalized and construction begins, the greatest opportunity to achieve cost savings has already been lost, and the potential for design errors is greater, leading to change orders that create cost growth and schedule delays. Proponents note that <b>design-build</b> allows owners to avoid being placed directly between the architect/engineer and the contractor. Under design-bid-build, the owner takes on significant risks because of that position. <b>Design-build</b> places the responsibility for design errors and omissions on the design-builder, relieving the owner of major legal and managerial responsibilities. The burden for these costs and associated risks are transferred to the <b>design-build</b> team.|$|E
