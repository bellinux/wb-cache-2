500|$|Widney {{attributed}} his longevity {{to living}} simply and keeping busy. At age 94, Widney advocated [...] "no liquor, no tobacco, no drugs. I'm not a fanatic on liquor, {{but to me}} it is a medicine. <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> around and take it when I need it. But there is no excuse whatever for tobacco or drugs". He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day.|$|E
500|$|In 1845, a {{religious}} revival {{took place in}} Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers. Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: [...] "I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my savior." [...] She {{went on to say}} that it was her [...] "greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers." [...] The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years. After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: [...] "Some keep the Sabbath going to Churchâ€“ / <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it,</b> staying at Home".|$|E
2500|$|In late 2012, Mundine {{questioned}} former opponent WBA/IBF champion Daniel Geale's indigenous Tasmanian heritage {{saying he}} should not wear the Australian Aboriginal Flag on his shorts. [...] "I thought they wiped all the Aborigines from Tasmania out ... He's got a white woman, he's got white kids. <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> real, all day every day." [...] Mundine said. When asked whether Geale deserved to sport the Aboriginal flag on his trunks, Mundine responded: [...] "No." [...] Mundine later apologised to Tasmanian Aborigines, adding that he felt many people claimed indigenous heritage {{in order to receive}} government benefits but had no real connection with their Aboriginal roots. He also claimed that Australia was one of [...] "the most racist nations in the world" [...] before calling for the Australian anthem and Australian flag to be changed to be more inclusive of indigenous Australians.|$|E

2500|$|During a {{televised}} joint interview {{prior to their}} second bout in 1974, Ali continued to insult Frazier, who took exception to Ali calling him [...] "ignorant" [...] and challenged him to a fight, {{which resulted in the}} two of them brawling on the studio floor. Ali {{went on to win the}} 12 round non-title affair by a decision. Ali took things further in the build-up to their last fight, The Thrilla in Manila, and called Frazier [...] "the other type of negro" [...] and [...] "ugly", [...] "dumb" [...] and a [...] "gorilla" [...] At one point he sparred with a man in a gorilla suit and pounded on a rubber gorilla doll, saying [...] "This is Joe Frazier's conscience... <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> everywhere I go. This is the way he looks when you hit him." [...] According to the fight's promoter Don King, this enraged Frazier, who took it as a [...] "character assassination" [...] and [...] "personal invective". One night before the fight, Ali waved around a toy pistol outside Frazier's hotel room. When Frazier came to the balcony, he pointed the gun at Frazier and yelled [...] "I am going to shoot you." [...] After the fight, Ali summoned Frazier's son Marvis into his dressing room, and told him that he had not meant what he had said about his father. When informed of this by Marvis, Frazier responded: [...] "you ain't me, son. Why isn't he apologizing to me?" ...|$|E
