5|$|In 1922, Taft ruled for a {{unanimous}} court in Balzac v. Porto Rico. One of the Insular Cases, Balzac involved a Puerto Rico newspaper publisher who was prosecuted for libel but denied a <b>jury</b> <b>trial,</b> a Sixth Amendment {{protection under the}} constitution. Taft held that as Puerto Rico was not a territory designated for statehood, only such constitutional protections as Congress decreed would apply to its residents.|$|E

50|$|<b>Jury</b> <b>trials</b> {{are used}} in a {{significant}} share of serious criminal cases in almost all common law legal systems (Singapore, for example, is an exception), and juries or lay judges have been incorporated into the legal systems of many civil law countries for criminal cases. Only the United States makes routine use of <b>jury</b> <b>trials</b> {{in a wide variety}} of non-criminal cases. Other common law legal jurisdictions use <b>jury</b> <b>trials</b> only in a very select class of cases that make up a tiny share of the overall civil docket (like defamation suits in England and Wales), but true civil <b>jury</b> <b>trials</b> are almost entirely absent elsewhere in the world. Some civil law jurisdictions, however, have arbitration panels where non-legally trained members decide cases in select subject-matter areas relevant to the arbitration panel members' areas of expertise.|$|R

As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a <b>jury</b> <b>trial</b> in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them.

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the United States is primarily {{the responsibility of}} local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is {{the largest in the}} country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws. At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than <b>jury</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a <b>jury</b> <b>trial,</b> DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{initially}} {{came from}} Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted {{that not even}} the Pennsylvanian legislators {{had been able to}} enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state. Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that distillers were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant. Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day and file weekly reports in extensive detail. Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a <b>jury</b> <b>trial</b> with potential offenders. As soon as 1791 locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as they felt the inspection methods were intrusive. Inspectors were also tarred and feathered, blindfolded, and whipped. Hamilton had attempted to appease the opposition with lowered tax rates, but it did not suffice.|$|E

More broadly, this research is directed towards understanding the state-society relations in non-democratic regimes, dynamics of criminal justice reforms, conflict and cooperation within criminal justice system, interaction between law-enforcement officials and laypersons, legal consciousness of jurors. Generally, this study finds out that <b>jury</b> <b>trials</b> do reduce the accusation bias; however this impact is almost invisible due to limited jurisdiction of jury institution...|$|R
5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the <b>jury</b> <b>trial</b> he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The players {{ultimately}} prevailed after a <b>jury</b> <b>trial</b> {{on their}} claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases {{and the threat}} of a class action lawsuit filed by Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, on behalf of all NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a salary cap, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floorminimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 302 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.|$|E
