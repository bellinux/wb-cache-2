40|$|One of the {{problems}} when storing and computing an elevation data is {{that the amount of}} data can be enormous. A Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) is an altemative to represent an Qlevation by which a TIN can be extracted from a dense grid of data. We present an incremental Delaunay triangulation algorithm for constructing a TIN. The algorithm starts with an initial triangular network covering entire area of an <b>elevation</b> <b>grid.</b> More data points are inserted into a network sequentially by selecting a subset of the grid points; this subset is the most significant contribution to the terrain model. The Delaunay triangulation of this subset is the TIN that approximates the <b>elevation</b> at all <b>grid</b> points within a distant criterion. As a result, the conversion of spatial data structure from an <b>elevation</b> <b>grid</b> to a TIN significantly reduces the number ofdata points to represent the terrain surface. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the ability of}} well-known hydrological and geomorphological descriptors and statistics to differentiate between catchments with spatially varying geology, size and shape {{subject to the same}} climate in the Northern Territory, Australia. The effect of digital <b>elevation</b> model <b>grid</b> resolution on these statistics is also examined. Results demonstrate that catchment descriptors such as the area-slope relationship, cumulative area distribution and hypsometric curve can differentiate between catchments with different geology and resultant morphology, but catchment network statistics are insensitive to differences in geology. Examination of the effects of digital <b>elevation</b> model <b>grid</b> scale demonstrates that while considerable catchment information can be gained at digital <b>elevation</b> <b>grids</b> greater than 10 m by 10 m, hillslope and hydrological detail can be lost. Geomorphic descriptors such as the area-slope relationship, cumulative area distribution, width function and Strahler statistics were shown to be sensitive to digital <b>elevation</b> model <b>grid</b> scale, but the hypsometric curve was not. Consequently, caution is needed when deciding on an appropriate grid resolution as well as the interpretation and analysis of catchment properties at grid scales greater than hat for optimal hillslope and area aggregation definition.

40|$|A new Application Programming Interface (API) is {{presented}} which simplifies working with geospatial coverages {{as well as}} many other data structures of a multi-dimensional nature. The main idea extends the Common Data Model (CDM) developed at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The proposed function object model uses the mathematical definition of a vector-valued function. A geospatial coverage will be expressed as a vector-valued function whose dependent variables (the vector components) are fully defined by its independent variables (the coordinates). Our goal is to provide an API using a terminology and an object model that is both appealing to computer scientists and numerical modelers and is flexible enough to enable defining data structures {{for a wide range of}} applications. Examples of such data structures can be: wind velocity as a continuous variable defined along the channels in a river network. Precipitation data defined as a time-dependent variable on a set of sub-catchments of a drainage basin, preserving association with sub-catchment features. The new object model provides a basis for both continuous and discrete coverages including non-geospatial data structures such as time series. Different storage models for variables are implemented, based on the Network Common Data Format (NetCDF), the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and memory. The API is available as set of open source libraries developed in C# consisting of a multi-dimensional arrays library; a scientific data structures library defining variables, functions, units of measure; a geospatial extensions library built on top of GeoAPI.

An analytical formula that describes the behavior of the variance as a function of optical depth, sun angle, and mean terrain slope can be developed by considering direct solar radiation variability on a constant-slope terrain which has a uniform albedo and a uniform distribution of slopes.

40|$|The {{delineation}} {{of stream}} networks and catchment areas is one {{the most common}} applications of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). In this article, an innovative reversed approach for the approximation of DEMs from stream networks is presented. As a fundamental preprocessing step, the stream networks are sampled {{with a set of}} points. Then, a Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram are used to extract the skeleton (medial axis) of stream networks as an approximation of the catchment areas. The catchment areas contain implicit information that is representative of the terrain, and so the elevation points can be extracted along the catchment area boundaries. Furthermore, we employ the stream orders to enrich the elevation data set. Finally, the elevation points are converted into an <b>elevation</b> <b>grid</b> through a raster interpolation method. While an approximation approach, the results show that the proposed method achieves the desired results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − We {{present a}} resource-bounded {{optimization}} framework for sensor resource management under {{the constraints of}} sufficient <b>grid</b> <b>coverage</b> of the sensor field. We offer a unique “minimalistic ” view of distributed sensor networks in which sensors transmit/report a minimum amount of sensed data. The proposed theory is aimed at optimizing the number of sensors and determine their placement to support such minimalistic sensor networks. We represent the sensor field as a grid (two- or three-dimensional) of points. The optimization framework is inherently probabilistic due to the uncertainty associated with sensor detections. The proposed algorithm addresses coverage optimization under constraints of imprecise detections and terrain properties. The issue of preferential <b>coverage</b> of <b>grid</b> points (based on relative measures of security and tactical importance) is also modeled.

Within the grid topology, nodes self-organize into a triangular lattice, as shown in Figure 13 (c). This architecture allows two nodes with the same child to share the load of forwarding the same childs data. Load sharing is beneficial when one of the two parent nodes has fewer children than the other, since the parent nodes can take turns forwarding the common childs data packets. We expect that the distances of the two paths from a child to the two parents to be different, and the biased path to be farther than the beeline path, which means a higher BER and lower reliability. So for the biased path, we use another node to cooperatively transmit the packets.|$|R

We present a probabilistic technique based on Gaussian processes that allows terrain models to be learned and updated efficiently using sparse approximation techniques. The major benefit of our terrain model {{is its ability to}} predict elevations at unseen locations more reliably than alternative approaches, while it also yields estimates of the uncertainty in the prediction. In particular, our nonstationary Gaussian process model adapts its covariance to the situation at hand, allowing more accurate inference of terrain height at points that have not been observed directly. We show how a conventional motion planner can use the learned terrain model to plan a path to a goal location, using a terrain-specific cost model to accept or reject candidate footholds.
