5|$|Harmless to humans, the banded houndshark is {{commonly}} displayed in public aquariums in China and Japan, and has reproduced in captivity. Individuals have survived in captivity for over five years. This species is often caught incidentally off Japan in gillnets and set nets; {{the meat is}} sometimes sold, but {{is considered to be}} of poorer quality than that of other <b>houndsharks</b> in the region. It is caught in lesser numbers off Taiwan, and is probably also fished off Korea and northern China. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the banded houndshark under Least Concern, as it remains abundant throughout its range. Off Japan, it can be found in rocky areas that provide refuge from fishing pressure.|$|E
500|$|Like other <b>houndsharks,</b> the whiskery shark is viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are sustained by yolk and probably also maternally produced histotroph. Males can mate every year, while females have a biennial reproductive cycle. Mating {{takes place in}} August and September; females store sperm until late January to early April of the following year, when the ova are ready to be ovulated into the uterus. After a 7– to 9-month-long gestation period, litters of four to 28 (average 19) pups are born between August and October. The litter size increases {{with the size of}} the female. The newborns measure [...] long.|$|E

5|$|Later {{authors have}} reassigned the sharptooth <b>houndshark</b> to the genus Triakis, more {{specifically}} to the subgenus Cazon alongside the sharpfin <b>houndshark</b> (T. acutipinna) and the spotted <b>houndshark</b> (T. maculata). A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés López and colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, found that this species did not group with the leopard shark (T. semifasciata). Instead, it and the flapnose <b>houndshark</b> (Scylliogaleus quecketti) formed a clade within the Mustelus lineage. This result suggests that the two subgenera of Triakis—Cazon and Triakis—may not be closely related, which would warrant a redefinition of the genus.|$|R

40|$|Almost half of {{the known}} chondrichthyans are deep-sea species, {{but most of these}} belong to the groups squaloid dogfishes, scyliorhinid catsharks, skates, and holocephalans. The bulk of our {{knowledge}} of deep water chondrichthyans comes from only a handful of species. The literature on chimaeras is limited. For species where data are available, productivity and rebound potential decrease with depth of occurrence. For a suite of deep-sea species studied, their productivity was on average less than half that of shelf and pelagic species. At present, about 17 species of sharks are fishery targets, and most are depleted or collapsed. On the other hand, some shelf sharks, such as <b>houndsharks</b> and sharpnose sharks might be fished sustainably since they are more productive than most deep-sea shark species. The major issues in assessing the status of deep-sea shark stocks include lack of time series data, lack of species-specific data, poor understanding of stock structure, and the unresolved taxonomy of several groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} phylogenetic {{systematics}} has benefited greatly from {{advances in the}} theory that links the variation among organisms to the evolutionary relationships among the biological lineages to which those organisms belong, and from advances in molecular techniques that allow the rapid and easy access to potentially informative data. Despite the clear benefits (e. g. more exacting methodology, increased participation) that these advances have brought to the field, there is widespread disagreement on the confidence that results produced by different methods of phylogenetic inference should be afforded. The disagreement stems {{in part from the}} proliferation of ever more sophisticated methods of phylogenetic inference while our understanding of the evolutionary process that underlies the generation of biological variation lags behind. In addition, such basic issues as the limits of taxonomic sampling and the reconciliation of contradictory hypothesis are often ignored. This dissertation presents three case studies of phylogenetic relationships; each highlighting {{some of the most important}} issues that affect the confidence that can be placed on a phylogenetic conclusion. The studies focus on: a group of bony fishes (the Esociformes: Pikes and mudminnows) and two groups of galeomorph sharks (Lamniformes: Mackerel sharks and Triakidae: <b>Houndsharks).</b> The study of the phylogeny of esociform fishes demonstrates the utility of synthesis when conflicting hypothesis are available; especially when data derived from morphological and molecular observations are in conflict. The study of lamniform phylogeny shows the limits of current methods of inference when the evolutionary process under study is heterogeneous as a result of shifting forces shaping the evolution of related lineages and/or uneven patterns of formation and extinction of lineages. Finally, the study of triakid phylogeny illustrates the limits that taxonomic sampling places on the value of the findings of a phylogenetic study when this findings are in conflict with the current classification of the group under examination and it advocates a conservative approach in the proposal of novel phylogenetic hypothesis. The three case studies share in common the use of DNA sequences from the recombination-activating gene- 1, therefore an analysis of the characteristics of molecular evolution of that gene also forms part of this work...|$|E
