50|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>lark</b> {{is about}} 12 or 13 cm long. There is {{considerable}} geographic variation and three subspecies are recognized. All subspecies are dull brownish grey with faintly streaked upperparts and appears distinctly short-tailed {{with a fine}} bill. The bill length varies geographically short and stubby {{in the western part}} and long and fine tipped {{in the eastern part of}} its range. Subspecies krishnakumarsinhji found around Bhavnagar in Gujarat is greyer above with broad dark streaks on the upper plumage and breast. The lores and supercilium are white as is the area under the eye and the entire underside. The whitish breast has fine streaks in the subspecies other than krishnakumarsinhji and the streaking on the upperparts is faint. The nominate subspecies is found across the Gangetic plains and extends into southern Burma. Subspecies adamsi of West Asia (Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan) and parts of north-west India is paler.|$|R

Cleland (1947) has given an account of the economic biology of the Sand Whiting, Sillago ciliata, the best known species in Australian waters.

These were observed to be more during day than in night, and more during the receding and low tides than during the incoming tides. The overall abundance was highest during full mdon period.

NCF 2005 has underlined that significance of teaching of English as early as possible so that the learners may have a native speaker like fluency in English. Based on these guidelines Kerala government introduced English Language teaching from class 1 onwards. Teaching of English also affects the quality student acquisition of English. Anxiety is often produced when one tries to interact in English which can affect the language proficiency of the learners. Teacher competence in English and their anxiety can have an influential impact on learners. This study found out that there is a negative correlation between English language anxiety and English language competence of Elementary teacher trainees in Kerala. As elementary teachers have an influential role in developing different competence of the young learners including English language competence, this paper puts foreword a number of suggestion to reduce the anxiety evoking situations and to improve English language competence of the trainees...|$|R
