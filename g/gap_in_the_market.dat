25|$|Ruth Handler {{watched her}} {{daughter}} Barbara play with paper dolls, {{and noticed that}} she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing {{that there could be}} a <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.|$|E
25|$|Caroline's album format meant that, {{although}} the station served a <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> its audience {{was smaller than}} in the 1960s. Caroline also promoted O'Rahilly's concept of Loving Awareness (LA), a far-eastern philosophy of love and peace. Some DJs were embarrassed but some were fascinated by the challenge of an abstract concept. Disc jockey Tony Allan developed a following, combining Loving Awareness with a professional style, humanity, knowledge of music and rich radio voice.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Wilks, Rover's chief {{designer}} {{came up with}} a plan {{to produce}} a light agricultural and utility vehicle, of a similar concept to the Willys Jeep used in the war, but with an emphasis on agricultural use. He was possibly inspired by the Standard Motor Company, who faced similar problems and were producing the highly successful Ferguson TE20 tractor in their shadow factory in Coventry. More likely, he used his own experience of using an army-surplus Jeep on his farm in Anglesey, North Wales. His design added a power take-off (PTO) feature since there was a <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> between jeeps and tractors (which offered the feature but were less flexible as transport). The original Land Rover concept (a cross between a light truck and a tractor) is similar to the Unimog, which was developed in Germany during this period.|$|E

25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I {{and the subsequent}} boycott of, for example, French films left a noticeable <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> By 1916, there already existed some 2000 fixed venues for movie performances and initially film screenings were supplemented or even replaced by variety turns. In 1917 a process of concentration and partial nationalisation of the German film industry began with the founding of Universum Film AG (UFA), which was partly {{a reaction to the}} very effective use that the Allied Powers had found for the new medium for the purpose of propaganda. Under the aegis of the military, so-called Vaterland films were produced, which equalled the Allies' films in the matter of propaganda and disparagement of the enemy. Audiences however did not care to swallow the patriotic medicine without the accompanying sugar of the light-entertainment films which, consequently, Ufa also promoted. The German film industry soon became the largest in Europe.|$|E

Rafferty is a former political correspondent for The Sunday Times, has also written for the Press Association and Business AM, and is a former spokesman for the smokers’ lobby group FOREST. The site was originally inspired by The Onion, a US satirical publication, as Stokes and Rafferty saw a <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for a similar publication in Britain. Both journalists worked mainly for Scottish newspapers.|$|E

500|$|The concept behind Mobius was for {{a mobile}} {{experience}} comparable with console games and [...] "a rich gaming experience, anytime, anywhere". Though {{it was possible to}} make a smartphone game equivalent to console games, it had yet to be done, so game producer Yoshinori Kitase sought to fill this perceived <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> It was called the first Final Fantasy mobile game of this scale. While creation of some artwork and graphics was outsourced, most of the concept work and development was done in-house by Square Enix's Business Division 1. Instead of a new development team dedicated to mobiles, the production team was largely made up of veterans from the console Final Fantasy titles. The staff included scenario supervisor Kazushige Nojima and producer Yoshinori Kitase. The story is connected to the original Final Fantasy only thematically through its focus on [...] "warriors of light" [...] fighting against chaos and darkness: it is not a remake or directly related to the plot of the original. It is also considered by the team behind the game as a full entry in the series rather than a spin-off. Speaking after the game's initial release, Nojima stated that he felt his scenario was too bulky for a mobile experience.|$|E
500|$|Professor Shiela Bird, a {{statistician}} at the Medical Research Council, {{suggested the}} ban of mephedrone {{may lead to}} more cocaine-related deaths. In {{the first six months}} of 2009, the number of cocaine-related deaths fell for the first time in four years, and fewer soldiers tested positive for cocaine in 2009 than in 2008. She suggested this may have been due to users switching to mephedrone from cocaine, but cautioned that before full figures are available for 2009 and 2010, it will be difficult to determine whether mephedrone saved lives, rather than cost them. Other supposedly legal drugs have filled the <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> since mephedrone was made illegal, including naphyrone (NRG-1) (since made illegal) and Ivory Wave, which has been found to contain MDPV, a compound made illegal at the same time as mephedrone. However, some products branded as Ivory Wave possibly do not contain MDPV. When tested, some products sold six weeks after mephedrone was banned, advertised as NRG-1, NRG-2 and MDAI, were found to be mephedrone. A Drugscope survey of drugs workers at the end of 2012 reported that mephedrone use was still widespread in the UK and that there increasing reports of problematic users. It was being taken as not only a [...] "poor man's cocaine" [...] but also amongst users of heroin and crack cocaine. Cases of intravenous use were also reported to be on the increase.|$|E

The factory used some novel manufacturing techniques, including British ALCAN's [...] "Supral" [...] (a superplastic aluminium alloy), adhesives (to {{reduce the number of}} rivets and mass), and a bespoke new British engine, the Hewland AE75.

2500|$|Because of {{the runway}} limitations, Qantas {{purchased}} two short-bodied [...] "Special Performance" [...] 747SP for flights between Wellington and Australia {{during the first half}} of the 1980s. Air New Zealand operated DC-8s from Wellington on trans-Tasman routes, but when the planes were retired in 1981 none of its other planes were capable of operating international flights from Wellington – Air New Zealand's DC-10s required extra runway length, and twinjet planes were not yet ETOPS-certified. The 747SP addressed this <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> with Air New Zealand (after turning down an offer to purchase the type) code-sharing with Qantas. Special markings on the runway assisted Qantas pilots where to touch down and to abort and go round to attempt a landing again. The SP service to Wellington continued until 1985 when Qantas and later Air New Zealand took delivery of the more capable and economical Boeing 767-200ER type.|$|E
