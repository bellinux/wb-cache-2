40|$|Spermidine and {{ornithine}} {{given to}} normal auxin-requiring cell suspensions of sugarbeet inhibited peroxidase secretion {{in the absence}} of Ca 2 +. Habituated (organogenic or not) cells did not respond. Both compounds counteracted the Ca 2 + - promoted enzyme secretion by three cell lines.

40|$|The {{levels of}} the {{water-soluble}} reductants ascorbic acid and glutathione and {{the activities of the}} enzymatic antioxidants superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate and dehydroascorbate reductases and glutathione reductase were determined in a fully habituated nonorganogenic sugarbeet callus line (considered a neoplasm) compared with a normal hormone-dependent callus of the same plant. Ascorbic acid was not recovered from either of the two calluses, irrespective of the technique used. Glutathione was titrated at a slightly higher level in the normal callus. Catalase activity was almost nonexistent in the habituated callus. The other enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and ascorbate peroxidase) were found to have higher activities in the habituated callus. The results are interpreted as a higher protection of the neoplastic <b>habituated</b> <b>cells</b> against oxygen-free radicals and hydroperoxide-dependent oxidations. Such strong scavenging properties of the <b>habituated</b> <b>cell</b> line could explain previous results already reported, namely the stimulation of cell division at the expense of cell differentiation. © 1992 Tissue Culture Association.

Treatment of fully <b>habituated</b> <b>cells</b> of periwinkle with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid led to the decrease of free cytokinin contents (isopentenyl adenine, zeatin riboside, and zeatin) during the late exponential phase of growth.

40|$|A fully habituated (auxin- and cytokinin-independent) nonorganogenic (HNO) {{sugarbeet}} (Beta vulgaris) callus produces {{very little}} ethylene {{as compared with}} a normal (N) hormone-requiring callus of the same strain. Both callus types react by growth changes to application of inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene action, of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) as the immediate precursor of ethylene, to transfer from light to darkness, and also to application of exogenous ethylene or an ethylene trapper. This indicates their growth dependency upon their endogenously biosynthesized ethylene and also their sensitivity to exogenous gas. However, the sensitivity was generally higher for the HNO callus producing naturally less ethylene. The weaker reaction of the HNO callus to the exogenous ethylene was attributed to its hyperhydric status (a water layer surrounding the cells). Because low ethylene production appears as a general characteristic of <b>habituated</b> <b>cell</b> lines, the causal and/or consequential relationships of this low ethylene production with other characteristics of habituated tissues (absence of exogenous hormones in the culture media, deficiency of cell differentiation, accumulation of polyamines in neoplastic tissues) are discussed.

40|$|The {{habituation}} of cell cultures to cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors {{constitutes a}} valuable method for {{learning more about}} the plasticity of plant cell wall composition and structure. The subculture of <b>habituated</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the absence of an}} inhibitor (dehabituation) offers complementary information: some habituation-associated modifications revert, whereas others remain, even after longterm (3 – 5 years) dehabituation processes. However, is dehabituation simply the opposite to the process of habituation, in the same way that the cloth woven by Penélope during the day was unwoven during the night? Principal Component Analysis applied to Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectra of cell walls from dichlobenil-habituated and dehabituated bean cell lines has shown that dehabituation follows a different pathway to that of habituation. Principal component loadings show that dehabituated cells have more pectins, but that these display a lower degree of methyl-esterification, than those of habituated ones. Further analysis of cell walls focusing on the first steps of habituation would serve to identify which specific modifications in pectins are responsible to the fine modulation of cell wall architecture observed during the habituation/dehabituation process...|$|R
40|$|When {{thiamine}} {{concentration in}} subculture medium was rapidly lowered to nil, soybean cells in suspension became necrotic and stopped growing entirely. When it was gradually lowered, cell growth was vigorous until the concentration {{was reduced to}} 7. 8 x 10 ~ 3 mg/liter. The cells at this level of thiamine ceased growing for a time, but prolonged culture in the same medium resulted in the appearance of fresh white cells which could be easily distinguished from the old brown, necrotic cells in the aggregates. These new cell lines could be subcultured with further reduction in the thiamine supply, growing as larger aggregates of about 4 mm in diameter. New cell lines were similarly obtained by prolonged cultures in media containing a thiamine precursor; three lines appeared to be habituated to the pyrimidine moiety and one to the thiazole moiety. The latter cell line could be subcultured without thiamine and its precursors for at least eight passages.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} cadmium (Cd) on the yield of ajmalicine, a secondary metabolite derived from tryptophan, in the suspension cultures of a fully <b>habituated</b> <b>cell</b> line of Catharanthus roseus. The treatment with Cd concentration ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 4 mM and the duration of 24 to 48 h increased ajmalicine production and excretion into culture medium, particularly for cells at the mid-exponential growth phase. For early stationary phase cells and stationary phase cells transferred from the culturing medium to the production medium, we detected less enhancement. Cd treatment in cells at the mid-exponential phase, early stationary phase, and cells transferred from the growth medium to production medium increased the cellular content of tryptophan and tryptamine, the precursors for ajmalicine. The tryptamine level was a major limiting factor for ajmalicine production for cells at the mid-exponential phase. The tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) converting tryptophan to tryptamine was also affected by Cd. We demonstrated that Cd treatment increased the level of TDC transcript, the cellular tryptamine concentration, and ajmalicine excretion, all contributed to the higher yield of ajmalicine. The increase was more significant in cells with active metabolic status and the cellular tryptamine concentration was the major limiting factor for ajmalicine biosynthesis.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{arguments}} for considering a specific fully habituated (auxin and cytokinin-independent) and fully heterotrophic non-organogenic (HNO) sugarbeet callus cell line as terminating a neoplastic progression, {{and thus to}} be made of cancerous cells. The similarities with animal tumour and cancer cells are recalled. All types of habituated tissues examined in the literature share at least three common biochemical characteristics: low apparent peroxidase activity, high content of polyamines (PAs) and low production of ethylene. However, results concerning their auxin and cytokinin levels are not consistent. Peroxidase synthesis in the achlorophyllous HNO callus appears to arise from aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthesis through the Shemin pathway, commonly used by animals and fungi. This pathway is limited by disturbed nitrogen metabolism that diverts glutamate (directly used for ALA synthesis in green higher plants) from the Kreb's cycle into PA synthesis. There is no argument to suggest that the low ethylene production is caused by a competition with PAs for their common precursor, S-adenosylmethionine. The results we report here indicate modified anabolic and catabolic pathways of auxins and cytokinins but also the possibilities of unusual compounds playing similar roles (dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol glucosides, for instance). A higher turnover of PAs is shown in the HNO callus, which could suggest a role for H 2 O 2 and gamma-aminobutyric acid, products or intermediates in the PA catabolic pathway, as secondary messengers. The <b>habituated</b> <b>cells</b> retain some sensitivity towards exogenous auxins and cytokinins. Their increased sensitivity to PAs and ethylene suggests modified hormonal balances for the control of these actively dividing cells. Peer reviewe...|$|R

A 5 -week subculture of the auxinindependent HNO callus on auxin-containing media increased the sensitivity of cells to Ca 2 + and their responsiveness to auxins in suspension cultures. Conversely, subculture of the auxin-requiring NNO callus on auxin-deficient medium induced a decreased sensitivity to Ca 2 + and a complete loss of response to auxins. The possible regulation of peroxidase secretion by Ca 2 +- and auxin-receptors is discussed. © 1983. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Changes in norepinephrine secretion resulting from any of these stimulants correlated with changes in internal calcium levels. Cyclic AMP-, protein kinase C-, and calmodulin-dependent second messenger pathways all modulated norepinephrine secretion caused by acetylcholine and high potassium and showed a distinct hierarchy in their effectiveness.

Corresponding cultures in sterile saline or in heat-sterilized water washings were used as controls. In acetic acid washings, acid-adapted cultures survived better than nonadapted cultures, with survival being greatest at 4 °C and lowest at 25 °C. The pathogen survived without growth in water washings at 4 and 10 °C, while it grew by 0. 8 to 2. 7 log cycles at 15 and 25 °C, and more {{in the absence of}} natural flora. E. coli O 157 :H 7 <b>cells</b> <b>habituated</b> without growth in water washings at 4 or 10 °C were the most sensitive to pH 3. 5, while cells grown in water washings at 15 or 25 °C were relatively the most resistant, irrespective of previous acid adaptation.

At ambient temperatures in meat plants, E. coli O 157 :H 7 may grow to restore acid resistance, unless acid interventions are applied to inhibit growth and minimize survival of the pathogen. Acid-habituated E. coli O 157 :H 7 at 10 to 15 °C may maintain a higher acid resistance than when acid habituated at 4 °C.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of habituation of Listeria monocytogenes on cherry tomatoes or lettuce leaves on its subsequent response to inhibitory levels of acid, osmotic and heat stress. Habituation was performed by inoculating lettuce coupons, whole cherry tomatoes or tryptic soy broth (TSB) with a three-strains composite of L. monocytogenes, which were further incubated at 5 °C for 24 hours or 5 days. Additionally, cells grown overnight in TSB supplemented with 0. 6 % yeast extract (TSBYE) at 30 °C were used as control cells. Following habituation, L. monocytogenes cells were harvested and exposed to: (i) pH 3. 5 adjusted with lactic acid, acetic acid or hydrochloric acid (HCl), and pH 1. 5 (HCl) for 6 h; (ii) 20 % NaCl and (iii) 60 °C for 150 s. Results showed that tomato-habituated L. monocytogenes cells were more tolerant (P < 0. 05) to acid or osmotic stress than those habituated on lettuce, and habituation on both foods resulted in more stress resistant cells than prior growth in TSB. On the contrary, the highest resistance to heat stress (P < 0. 05) was exhibited by the lettuce-habituated L. monocytogenes cells followed by TSB-grown cells at 5 °C for 24 h, whereas tomato-habituated cells were highly sensitized. Prolonged starvation on fresh produce (5 days vs. 24 h) increased resistance to osmotic and acid stress, but reduced thermotolerance, regardless of the pre-exposure environment (i. e., tomatoes, lettuce or TSB).

40|$|Abstract Background Thaxtomin A (TA), a {{phytotoxin}} {{produced by}} the phytopathogen Streptomyces scabies, {{is essential for the}} development of potato common scab disease. TA inhibits cellulose synthesis but its actual mode of action is unknown. Addition of TA to hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides) cell suspensions can activate a cellular program leading to cell death. In contrast, it is possible to <b>habituate</b> hybrid poplar <b>cell</b> cultures to grow in the presence of TA levels that would normally induce cell death. The {{purpose of this study is}} to characterize TA-habituated cells and the mechanisms that may be involved in enhancing resistance to TA. Results Habituation to TA was performed by adding increasing levels of TA to cell cultures at the time of subculture over a period of 12 months. TA-habituated cells were then cultured in the absence of TA for more than three years. These cells displayed a reduced size and growth compared to control cells and had fragmented vacuoles filled with electron-dense material. Habituation to TA was associated with changes in the cell wall composition, with a reduction in cellulose and an increase in pectin levels. Remarkably, high level of resistance to TA was maintained in TA-habituated cells even after being cultured in the absence of TA. Moreover, these cells exhibited enhanced resistance to two other inhibitors of cellulose biosynthesis, dichlobenil and isoxaben. Analysis of gene expression in TA-habituated cells using an Affymetrix GeneChip Poplar Genome Array revealed that durable resistance to TA is associated with a major and complex reprogramming of gene expression implicating processes such as cell wall synthesis and modification, lignin and flavonoid synthesis, as well as DNA and chromatin modifications. Conclusions We have shown that habituation to TA induced durable resistance to the bacterial toxin in poplar cells. TA-habituation also enhanced resistance to two other structurally different inhibitors of cellulose synthesis that were found to target different proteins. Enhanced resistance was associated with major changes in the expression of numerous genes, including some genes that are involved in DNA and chromatin modifications, suggesting that epigenetic changes might be involved in this process. </p...|$|R
