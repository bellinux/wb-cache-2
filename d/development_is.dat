50|$|CDGP is {{a global}} delay in {{development}} that affects every organ system. Delays in growth and sexual <b>development</b> <b>are</b> quantified by skeletal age, which is determined from bone age radiographic studies of the left hand and wrist.

5|$|Tooth <b>development</b> <b>is</b> {{commonly}} {{divided into}} the following stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth <b>development</b> <b>is</b> an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently {{it is difficult to}} decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth. This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.|$|E
5|$|Tooth <b>development</b> <b>is</b> {{the complex}} {{process by which}} teeth form from {{embryonic}} cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their <b>development</b> <b>is</b> largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} <b>development</b> <b>is</b> the {{electric}} action which uses low voltage DC {{to control the}} key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E
