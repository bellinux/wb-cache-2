Lyrically, the track describes a house party, as mentioned in the opening lines [...] "It's our party, we can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> / It's our party, we can say what we want / It's our party, we can love who we want / We can kiss who we want / We can live how we want". It also makes several references to recreational drug use, including [...] "dancing with molly", using a slang term for ecstasy, and [...] "trying to get a line [...] in the bathroom". After initial confusion whether the former lyric was [...] "dancing with molly" [...] or [...] "dancing with Miley", Cyrus clarified that {{she was referring to}} ecstasy, commenting that [...] "if you’re aged ten it’s 'Miley', if you know what I'm talking about then you know. I just wanted it to be played on the radio and they’ve already had to edit it so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of British punk rock's leading figures {{made a show}} of rejecting {{not only}} {{contemporary}} mainstream rock and the broader culture it was associated with, but their own most celebrated music predecessors: [...] "No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977", declared the Clash song [...] "1977". The previous year, when the punk rock revolution began in Great Britain, was to be both a musical and a cultural [...] "Year Zero". Even as nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a nihilistic attitude summed up by the Sex Pistols slogan [...] "No Future"; in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, [...] "punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England." [...] While [...] "self-imposed alienation" [...] was common among [...] "drunk punks" [...] and [...] "gutter punks", there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the [...] "radical leftist utopianism" [...] of bands such as Crass, who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement. As a Clash associate describes singer Joe Strummer's outlook, [...] "Punk rock is meant to be our freedom. We're meant to be able to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do." ...|$|E

5000|$|Even {{before any}} song was composed, the band {{already knew that}} would be the cover and the character's name would be the title, even though the label was {{initially}} reluctant.

2500|$|Overall, Goldfrapp {{expressed}} [...] "not [...] very proud" [...] and [...] "not [...] crazy about" [...] the album, {{describing it}} as too [...] "on the nose". Whilst singling out affection for [...] "Voicething" [...] and [...] "Shiny and Warm" [...] and admitting {{that there were}} [...] "some good tunes on there", {{she felt as though}} they [...] "should have given them to someone else instead of us releasing them as Goldfrapp." [...] In discussing re-signing with Mute after its separation from EMI, Goldfrapp expressed pleasure in their independence [...] "and a new management who are on our side, they're not trying to make a quick buck" [...] and that [...] "it did feel like a new start... 'we're going to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the band's catalog of music is written by You, followed by Morrie, and then Takahiro, who wrote seven of eight songs on the first album. Morrie is responsible for all the lyrics, which are mostly in Japanese with some English lines, and contributed three songs on the second, and four (two with the band's producer Hajime Okano) on the fourth album. Joe composed one song {{in each of the}} first three albums, and they all showcase the bass. The band usually does not discuss their ideas on sound and style, yet Morrie says, [...] "we individually <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do based on the songs that You creates, even if it destroys the original concept of the song". In regard to band's music and lyrics, Morrie described them as explosive and outward with an incentive kind of a death drive.|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{decision}} to make the music for Tame Impala in the studio by himself {{is a result of}} Parker liking [...] "the kind of music that is the result of one person constructing an awesome symphony of sound. You can layer your own voice 700 times for half a second if you want, and I just love that kind of music." [...] However, Parker has to translate his music to a live setting with the band, and the band doesn't play the songs until they have been recorded. [...] "The only jamming that's done as a band is done a long time after the song is recorded {{for the sake of the}} live environment. It's good for us, because we can take a song that's been recorded and <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the New York printers' {{strike of}} 1963, when The New York Times {{and six other}} {{newspapers}} suspended publication, Hardwick, her husband Robert Lowell, and Jason and Barbara Epstein, saw an opportunity to introduce the sort of vigorous book review that Hardwick had imagined. Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books. The group asked Silvers, who was still at Harper's, to edit the issue, and Silvers asked Barbara Epstein to co-edit it with him. Silvers and Epstein [...] "became an inseparable double act", editing The New York Review of Books together for the next 43 years, until her death in 2006. Silvers continued as sole editor {{until his death in}} March 2017. In later years, he described his motivation for continuing to edit the Review: [...] "I feel it's a fantastic opportunity – because of the freedom of it, because of the sense that there are marvelous, intensely interesting, important questions that {{you have a chance to}} try to deal with in an interesting way. That's an extraordinary opportunity in life. And you'd be crazy not to try and make the most of it." [...] He said on another occasion: [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> and don't try to figure out what the public wants." [...] Asked in 2007 about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers replied: [...] "It's not a question that's posing itself". In 2012, he added, [...] "I can think of several people who would be marvelous editors." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{last two}} lines of the stanza give us a pretty true insight into pussy's notions of human {{goodness}}. It is evident that in her opinion goodness consists of stroking her, and patting her, and feeding her with food. I fear this narrow-minded view of virtue, though, {{is not confined to}} pussies. We are all inclined to adopt a similar standard of merit in our estimate of other people. A good man is a man who is good to us, and a bad man is a man who doesn't <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> him to. The truth is, we each of us have an inborn conviction that the whole world, with everybody and everything in it, was created as a sort of necessary appendage to ourselves. Our fellow men and women were made to admire us and to minister to our various requirements. You and I, dear reader, are each {{the center of the universe}} in our respective opinions. You, as I understand it, were brought into being by a considerate Providence in order that you might read and pay me for what I write; while I, in your opinion, am an article sent into the world to write something for you to read.

6000|$|... 'Knowing {{the time}};'--the {{time of this}} our mortal life. How {{soon it will be}} over, at the longest! How short the time seems since we were young! How quickly it has gone! How every year, as we grow older seems to go more and more quickly, and there is less time to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want,</b> to think seriously, to improve {{ourselves}}. So soon, and it will be over, and we shall have no time at all, for we shall be in eternity. And what then? What then? That depends on what now. On what we are doing now. Are we letting our short span of life slip away in sleep; fancying ourselves all the while wide awake, as we do in dreams--till we wake really; and find that it is daylight, and that all our best dreams were nothing but useless fancy? How many dream away their lives! Some upon gain, some upon pleasure, some upon petty self-interest, petty quarrels, petty ambitions, petty squabbles and jealousies about this person and that, which are no more worthy to take up a reasonable human being's time and thoughts than so many dreams would be. Some, too, dream away their lives in sin, in works of darkness which they are forced for shame and safety to hide, lest they should come to the light and be exposed. So people dream their lives away, and go about their daily business as men who walk in their sleep, wandering about with their eyes open, and yet seeing nothing of what is really around them. Seeing nothing: though they think that they see, and know their own interest, and are shrewd enough to find their way about this world. But they know nothing--nothing of the very world with which they pride themselves they are so thoroughly acquainted. None know less of the world than those who pride themselves on being men of the world. For the true light, which shines all round them, they do not see, and therefore they do not see the truth of things by that light. If they did, then they would see that of which now they do not even dream.|$|E
