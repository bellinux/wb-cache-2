40|$|The chief topic {{discussed}} in this thesis is poverty - whether it existed in Cape Town during the 1830 s; if so, {{how it can be}} measured, how it came to exist. Related to this are general living conditions in Cape Town and in particular, the effect their poverty had on the living conditions, health and well-being of the poor. There are also the questions of whether there was any relationship between poverty and race and/or poverty and slavery, {{and the extent to which}} social relations in Cape Town were based an economic or racial considerations. Also, given the changes in the status of coloured people, what effect these changes had on Cape Town society during this period. The emphasis throughout this thesis is on 'the poor'. This raises the question of what 'the poor' and 'poverty' actually mean. In Section I an attempt is made to define poverty 'by <b>drawing</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>estimate</b> of minimum family expenditure, thus establishing a 'poverty line'. Some occupations are identified, the earnings from which were insufficient to meet this minimum. This provides an indication of the sort of people likely to have been suffering poverty...|$|R
40|$|The mass {{transfers}} of water, acid and NaCl in turkey meat cubes (initial volume 1 cm 3 during marination were evaluated at various molalities of acetic acid (0. 0 - 1. 0) and NaCl (0. 0 - 1. 5). An experimental design was <b>drawn</b> <b>up,</b> associated with <b>an</b> <b>estimate</b> of the velocities of each component {{by means of}} kinetic monitoring. High mass yields (mass gain > 0. 3 kg kg_ 1), obtained for the marinades most dilute in acid, were found only {{in the absence of}} NaCl. The presence of NaCl had a negative effect on mass yield, counterbalanced by the positive effect of acetic acid. In the case of acidic marinades with low salt concentration, high solute flux densities were observed upon the start of immersion, as well as solute transfer velocities greater than those in water. This phenomenon may be explained by the superimposition of material diffusion and transport phenomena caused by a fall in internal filtration pressure due to expansion of the protein matrix. The fall in the buffering capacity of the meat in the course of soaking, related to the leakage of proteins, dipeptides and lactates, may explain the low pH values obtained during immersion in comparison with theoretical data.

40|$|This master's thesis follows <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{theme of}} {{budgeting}} for valuation of public construction contracts. It examines in details how to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> budget and optimize {{it to the}} concrete public construction contract. The thesis is structured in three fundamental chapters. The opening chapter describes theoretical grounds of public construction contracts from the contractor's point of view. Also basic methods how to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> budget are described in the first chapter. The second chapter covers {{a description of a}} systematic approach how to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> cost effective budget, throughout structural cost saving activities. In the third chapter the systematic approach is put in place on concrete public construction contract. The goal of the thesis is to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> competitive budget which won't be rejected from the competition for its exceptionally low price at the same time...|$|R
