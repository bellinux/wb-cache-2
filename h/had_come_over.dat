The manor of Hallamshire passed to William de Lovetot, the {{grandson}} of a Norman baron who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to England with the Conqueror. William de Lovetot founded the parish churches of St Mary at Handsworth, St Nicholas at High Bradfield and St. Mary's at Ecclesfield {{at the start of the}} 12th century in addition to Sheffield's own parish church. He also built the original wooden Sheffield Castle, which stimulated the growth of the town.|$|E

According to the other version, {{the fighting}} started after Maulvi Nazir, whom the government claimed <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to its side, ordered the Uzbek followers of former Soviet fighters, Tohir Abduhalilovich Yo'ldoshev and Kamolitdinich Jalolov, to disarm, both were formerly the close confidants of Osama bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|Whilst in Ireland Wilson began courting Cecil Mary Wray, who was {{two years}} his senior. Her family, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to Ireland late in Elizabeth I’s reign, had owned an estate called Ardamona near Lough Eske, Donegal, the {{profitability}} of which had never recovered from the Irish potato famine of the 1840s. On 26 December 1849 two kegs of explosive were set off outside the house, after which the family only ever spent one more winter there. From 1850 Cecil‘s father George Wray {{had worked as a}} land agent, latterly for Lord Drogheda’s estates in Kildare, until his death in 1878. Cecil grew up in straitened circumstances, and her views on Irish politics appear to have been rather more hardline than her husband’s. They were married on 3 October 1891.|$|E
25|$|The {{new stars}} paid almost {{immediate}} dividends in 1992–93. Doug Gilmour, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> from the Flames the previous season, scored 32 goals and 95 assists {{to lead the}} team in scoring. Dave Andreychuk {{had come to the}} Leafs from the Buffalo Sabres and would score 25 goals in his first 31 games as a Leaf as well as being the league's leading power-play goal scorer. Netminder Felix Potvin was also solid with an NHL-best 2.50 goals-against average. Toronto finished with a franchise-record 99 points, good enough for third place in the Norris Division and the eighth-best record in the league. The Leafs dispatched the Detroit Red Wings in the first round with an overtime winner from Nikolai Borschevsky in game seven, then won the Norris Division final by defeating the St. Louis Blues, also in seven games.|$|E

25|$|Born to an {{affluent}} Irish Episcopalian slaveholder {{of the same}} name in Danville, Kentucky, James G. Birney lost his mother during his youth. He and his sister were raised by their aunt, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> from Scotland at the request of his father to look after the two. By 1795, his father's two sisters and their families had migrated from Ireland, settling on farms near his home. Most of his mother's relatives had also migrated nearby, settling in other areas of Mercer County, Kentucky. Growing up, he saw the issue of slavery from a variety of perspectives. Though his father fought to prevent their state of Kentucky from joining the Union as a slave state, when the effort failed, he decided that until the legislature abolished slavery from the state as a whole, a person could own slaves as long as he treated them humanely. Other members of Birney's family felt personal moral responsibility and refused to own slaves. Most notably, the aunt that raised him did not own slaves and paid them when they performed services for her. For his own part, Birney agreed with his father and received his first slave at age six. However, for much of his youth and education, he was under the influence of teachers and friends with strong anti-slavery views. For example, he attended several sermons given by a Baptist abolitionist by the name of David Barrow in his youth, which he later recalled with fondness.|$|E
25|$|By 1940, {{the average}} {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years. A number of small Hollywood companies had folded {{around the turn of}} the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, with additional numbers screening under the policy part-time. In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures (MGM carried on with blocks of twelve for a while). Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding. These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B-movie suppliers. In 1944, for instance, MGM, Paramount, Fox, and Warners released a total of ninety-five features: fourteen had B-level budgets of $200,000 or less; eleven were budgeted between $200,000 and $500,000, a range encompassing programmers as well as straight B movies on the lower end; and seventy were A budgeted at $0.5 million or more. In late 1946, executives at the newly merged Universal-International announced that no U-I feature would run less than seventy minutes; supposedly, all B pictures were to be discontinued, even if they were in the midst of production. The studio did release three more sub-70-minute films: two Cinecolor westerns, Michigan Kid and The Vigilantes Return, in 1947; the self-explanatory Arctic Manhunt in 1949. Fox also phased out B production in 1946, releasing low-budget unit chief Bryan Foy, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> from Warners five years before. For its B-picture needs, the studio turned to independent producers like the now-freelance Sol Wurtzel.|$|E

In 1982, he was honored with the [...] "Man of the Year" [...] award by the New York Friars Club at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He turned 80 in 1984; Peter Bogdanovich noticed that a [...] "serenity" [...] <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> the actor. Grant was in good health until suffering a mild stroke in October that year. In {{the last few years}} of his life, he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man show, A Conversation with Cary Grant, in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. He made some 36 public appearances in his last four years, from New Jersey to Texas, and found his audiences changed from elderly film buffs to enthusiastic college students discovering his films for the first time. Grant admitted that he thought the appearances were [...] "ego-fodder", remarking that [...] "I know who I am inside and outside, but it's nice to have the outside, at least, substantiated".|$|E

500|$|In 1780, after Benedict Arnold's {{attempted}} treason {{had been}} exposed, Captain Beesly Edgar Joel, a British defector and former {{officer in the}} British Army, claimed that another officer besides Arnold had attempted to defect, and after interrogation Joel named Howe as that officer. [...] Joel cited Edmund Fanning, William Tryon's secretary, as the source for his information. [...] Joel further described Howe's method of communicating with the British, which was {{by means of a}} frequently imprisoned-and-exchanged prisoner who would convey messages between the parties. [...] While neither Washington or the Congressional Board of War believed Joel's story due to their suspicion of Joel as a British spy, Joel was later commissioned by Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia government to lead a Patriot militia unit against Loyalists in that state. [...] Furthermore, William Smith, a New York Loyalist and the brother of Howe's agent and Arnold's co-conspirator Joshua Hett Smith, noted in his diary on April 29, 1780, that his brother, Thomas Smith, had been informed that a commissary <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to the British with [...] "information" [...] from the Patriots in much the same manner as Joel had described. On September 28, 1780, William Smith told Henry Clinton that he believed [...] "Bob" [...] Howe would be willing to turn on the Patriots.|$|E
2500|$|In India, Lord Ellenborough had {{softened}} {{his earlier}} attitude. His primary {{objective was to}} avoid {{the expense of a}} long war. He ordered Nott and Pollock to retreat, arguing that once the British had evacuated Afghanistan, negotiations with Akbar Khan for the release of the hostages could proceed calmly. Ellenborough was opposed by his generals and by the government in Britain, all of whom insisted that stern retribution was required. He accordingly modified his orders. Pollock and Nott were again ordered to retreat, but Nott was allowed to retreat by way of Kabul if he chose, making a detour of over , and Pollock was also permitted to move to Kabul to cover Nott's retreat.

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1972, Sunnyside Baptist Church invited Mel and Norma Gabler to speak about their work during a Wednesday night service. In {{spite of the fact}} that neither of The Gablers had any college degrees, and neither {{attended}} secondary education for more than a year they were very active in school textbook issues in the state of Texas and made great strides in restoring that state’s public education system from the historical revisionism that they and many others saw in their students' curriculum. Neal Frey, who worked with the Gablers since 1972 and now runs the organization, said [...] "that Mrs. Gabler’s larger public role was deceptive. [...] "Mr. Gabler wore the pants in that family, and Mrs. Gabler wanted it that way". The Gablers identified the changes that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> the teaching of history as generation after generation of textbooks had the Christian founding of America expunged from them. They claimed that America was losing its Christian heritage because children were never introduced to it in schools: [...] "Allowing a student to come to his own conclusion about abstracts and concepts creates frustration. Ideas, situation ethics, values, anti-God humanism - that's what the schools are teaching. And concepts. Well, a concept will never do anyone as much good as a fact". During the service, pastor Boydstun sensed a mission to provide education within a Christian setting for the students of southwest Oklahoma City. After further discussion, the church established a committee to investigate the feasibility of a Christian school and later to begin the development of the school program.|$|E
