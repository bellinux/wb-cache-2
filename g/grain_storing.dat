The conducted analysis {{of the system of}} obtaining information by <b>grain</b> <b>storing</b> and processing enterprises shows that it does not meet modern requirements. The article reveals main shortcomings of the existing system: absence of trustworthy materials; shortage of the market and scientific and technical information of production purpose; the system functioning is based on outdated hard-copy technologies of collection, processing and distribution of information; contacts are not established, exchange of information with international and national centres of scientific, information and business activity is not arranged. The article justifies expediency of creation of a common information system of the grain market. It considers main provisions of the system concept of protection of information from unauthorised access in automated information systems and identifies four basic subsystems of the system of protection of information from the unauthorised access...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Employing high {{performance}} liquid chromatography, quantitative estimation of neem compounds, NfC and NC, {{was carried out}} in treated insects, Callosobruchus analis, and in contact media, in comparison with an IGR, Diflubenzuron (Dimilin). Adult specimens of Callosobruchus analis were treated with impregnated filter paper mimicking an absorbent surface and treated glass mimicking a non-absorbent surface of <b>grain</b> <b>storing</b> containers. In the case of filter paper impregnation, the recovery of NfC was 4. 57 µg/ 10 µl and 1. 28 µg/ 10 µl in treated insect samples, and 0. 71 µg/ 10 µl and 0. 50 µg/ 10 µl in treated filter paper samples after 24 and 144 h of treatment, respectively. Recovery of NC was 0. 71 µg/ 10 µl after 24 h and no trace was found after 144 h in treated insect samples, whereas treated filter paper samples showed 0. 21 µg/ 10 µl and 0. 07 µg/ 10 µl recovery after 24 and 144 h of treatment, respectively. The recovery of Dimilin was 0. 14 µg/ 10 µl and 0. 08 µg/ 10 µl in treated insect samples, and 0. 36 µg/ 10 µl and 0. 14 µg/ 10 µl in treated filter paper samples after 24 and 144 h of treatment, respectively. In the case of the glass film method, NC treated insects showed 1. 42 µg/ 10 µl and 0. 71 µg/ 10 µl recovery, while the glass rinsed samples showed 0. 71 µg/ 10 µl and 0. 07 µg/ 10 µl recovery after 24 and 144 h of treatment, respectively. Dimilin treated C. analis showed 0. 84 µg/ 10 µl and 0. 33 µg/ 10 µl recovery after 24 and 144 h of treatment, while the glass rinsed samples showed 0. 12 µg/ 10 µl recovery after 24 h and no trace was found after 144 h of treatment. NfC extract showed no significant effect by this method and therefore samples were not analysed. Key Words: Residues, neem compounds, dimilin (IGR), Callosobruchus analis, HPL...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of present work {{was to determine}} and compare the components of bioaerosol in several sectors of plant processing industries. The Study was conducted in 10 Facilities engaged in herb and grain processing, flax threshing, <b>grain</b> <b>storing,</b> baking, and cereals production. The air samples were taken on glass fibre litters with an AS- 50 sampler. We determined the concentrations of airborne microorganisms, dust, endotoxin and peptidoglycan. Total concentrations of viable airborne microorganisms ranged from 0. 18 - 861. 4 x 10 (3) cfu/m(3). The highest levels of microbial contamination of the air were observed at flax farms, in grain elevators and in a herb processing plant. Gram-positive bacteria aid fungi were detected at all sampling sites, and their median concentrations were respectively 18. 1 x 10 (3) cfu/m(3) and 0. 66 x 10 (3) cfu/m(3). The concentration of Gram-negative bacteria ranged from 0. 0 - 168. 0 x 10 (3) cfu/m(3). The concentration of thermophilic actinomycetes ranged from 0. 0 - 1. 45 x 10 (3) cfu/m(3). Qualitatively Gram-positive bacteria constituted 23 - 93 % of the total microbial Count. The most common species were: Staphylococcus spp., Curtobacterium pusillum, Rhodococcus fascians, Aureobacterium testaceum, Sanguibacter keddieii, Microbacterium spp., and Bocillus spp. Gram-negative bacteria formed 0 - 48 % of the total Count. The species Pantoea agglomerans dominated in all examined air samples. Fungi constituted 2. 5 - 76. 9 % of the total microbial count. Among them, Penicillium spp., Mucor spp., Alternario spp., Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus spp. were found. The dust concentration ranged from 0. 18 - 86. 9 mg/m(3). The concentration of endotoxin was large and ranged front 0. 0041 - 1562. 6 mu g/m(3). Muramic acid, the chemical marker of peptidoglycan, was detected in 9 out of 13 (69. 2 %) collected samples. The concentration of peptidoglycan ranged front 1. 93 - 416 ng/m(3). A highly significant correlation {{was found between the}} individual components of bioaerosol determined in this study. The concentration of endotoxin was correlated with the concentration of Gram-negative bacteria, total microorganisms, and peptidoglycan (R> 0. 9, p 0. 9, p< 0. 001) ...|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the marketing of}} wheat in India, focusing on the private marketing system, the marketing efficiency and quality. Wheat is now a major food staple in India, crucial to India’s food economy and security. With production reaching 70 to 75 million tons and a large demand, India’s wheat economy is the second largest in the world. The efficiency of marketing is crucial to farmer incomes, consumer welfare, as well as government budgets and the economy. Substantial changes are {{taking place in the}} marketing of wheat. The study finds that the farmers now almost invariably sell in the nearby primary markets rather than to village traders. The farmer choice of varieties is now becoming market oriented with quality and market acceptance becoming as important as yield. The typically market intermediary provides hardly any special, value adding or developmental services in return for the commissions and margins. The farmers see considerable scope for improvement in the marketing system. The consumer demand for wheat varies considerably across the country. But wheat has made inroads into food consumption in the east and the south. The retailers are increasingly conscious of consumer demand and quality, and keep a varietiy of wheat and wheat products. Direct buying of wheat <b>grain,</b> <b>storing,</b> and own recourse to processing are common in the north and the west, whereas direct purchase of wheat products such as flour is the norm in the east and the south. The trend is towards direct purchase of processed wheat products, and within this from loose to packaged branded wheat products. The estimated average total marketing cost of wheat is found to be of the order of Rs. 266 per quintal, and in this transport has the largest share of 40 percent, commission and taxes make up 25 percent, and wastage another 15 percent. When compared to the consumer-farmer price spread, the marketing costs account for 74 percent of the spread, leaving 26 percent for margins – this is fairly efficient but there is significant scope for improvement. On an average, the farmers receive 66 percent of what the consumer pays. The government channel marketing cost is reported to be Rs. 309 per quintal, but this does not cover the whole chain and is not strictly comparable. Examination of the question of market integration for wheat is difficult due to data and quality difference problems. Co-integration analysis using monthly price data for eight markets for the period April 1997 to June 2004 indicates that nationally the markets are integrated but the LOP (Law of One Price) does not hold, and the presence of six common stochastic trends implies the absence of full pair-wise co-integration. ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{works on}} <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> airflow {{simulation}} {{are related to}} two-dimensional or axisymmetric cases, although, this flow is usually three-dimensional. Even if the grain mass distribution is two-dimensional or axisymmetric, the airflow inlets in those <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> do not satisfy these conditions. Besides, an aeration in large <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> frequently is realized separately for different segments. In this work, based on the math model presented at [1], we developed a software written in ANSI C++ to do the three-dimensional airflow simulation on <b>grain</b> <b>stores.</b> For geometry construction, we used Blender 3 d, which is a free software tool for 3 D modeling. For mesh generation we made use of Netgen, a free software mesh generation tool. Our software imports the mesh generated by Netgen, builds the finite element global matrix, taking account the boundary conditions, and solves the obtained linear system by the Conjugate Gradients method. To take account the model’s non-linearity effects (related to the coefficient of pressure gradient permeability dependency on grain mass compression), the program executes an iterative process calculating the permeability coefficient distribution by the parameters obtained in the last iteration. To show the results graphically, we made use of the Paraview software, which is also free software. The simulations had shown good performance of the software developed, which {{can be applied to}} optimize the <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> performance and to lower the engineering costs of new <b>grain</b> <b>stores</b> projects...|$|R

40|$|The {{wet bulb}} {{temperature}} of the intergranular air in a bulk of <b>stored</b> <b>grains</b> has a most {{profound effect on the}} growth of insect populations and grain quality. In general, <b>grain</b> can be <b>stored</b> for longer if the {{wet bulb temperature}} of the intergranular air is lower. In temperate climate aerating the grains with ambient air is usually beneficial, but in tropical climates this is inadequate. An alternative is to refrigerate ambient tropical air before introducing it into the <b>grain</b> <b>store.</b> This is energy-intensive. In this research it is shown that air leaving the upper surface of a bulk of <b>stored</b> <b>grains</b> can be recirculated around the <b>grain</b> <b>store</b> through a grain-chilling unit in a process dubbed refrigaeration. Ceteris paribus this results in a lowering of the wet bulb temperature from 16. 5 °C using refrigerated ambient air to about 6 °C when refrigeration is implemented.
