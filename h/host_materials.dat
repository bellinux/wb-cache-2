5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the <b>host</b> <b>materials</b> (see Production and availability). Thus, the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount.

5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} {{that more than}} 1 million tons of gallium is contained in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores. Some coal flue dusts contain small quantities of gallium, typically less than 1% by weight. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the <b>host</b> <b>materials</b> (see below). Thus, the availability of gallium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} bauxite, zinc ores (and coal) are extracted.|$|E
5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its <b>host</b> <b>materials</b> per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E

In this investigation, a theoretical model of the strain transferred from the <b>host</b> <b>material</b> to the embedded optical fiber is developed to reveal the differential strains between the optical fiber sensor and <b>host</b> <b>material.</b> The theoretical predictions are validated with the numerical analysis using the finite element method. The percentage of strain in the <b>host</b> <b>material</b> actually transferred to the optical fiber {{is dependent on the}} bonding characteristics such as adhesive layer, protective coating and <b>host</b> <b>material.</b> Parametric study shows that the larger of the <b>host</b> <b>material</b> the more strain is transferred to the optical fiber...|$|R

50|$|For {{materials}} such as components in microelectronics, polymeric coatings, and adhesives, nanocapsules can reduce damage caused by high loads. The healing of cracks within these materials is alleviated by dispersing nanocapsules within the polymer. The healing substances include dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), which is prepared on site within the material by sonication. The nanoencapsulated material is first emulsified within the <b>host</b> <b>material</b> by creating an oil-in-water self-healing epoxy. The emulsified material is then agitated within the <b>host</b> <b>material</b> to form particles which then bond to the <b>host</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R

Nd:YAG lasers and variants are pumped either by flashtubes, continuous gas discharge lamps, or near-infrared laser diodes (DPSS lasers).

The decay time and the spectra of this phosphorescence are temperature sensitive and offer two different methods to measure temperature. The decay time method consists on the fitting of the phosphorescence decay to an exponential function and is normally used in point measurements, {{although it has been}} demonstrated in surface measurements. The intensity ratio between two different spectral lines of the phosphorescence emission, tracked using spectral filters, is also temperature-dependent and can be employed for surface measurements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fiber optic sensor {{with small}} size, light weight and {{immunity}} to electromagnetic interference can be embedded and {{integrated into the}} <b>host</b> <b>material</b> to form a smart structure system. One must recognize that optical fibers are foreign entities to the host structure, therefore will alter the stress state {{in the vicinity of}} the embedded sensor irrespective of the small size of the fiber.

40|$|We use {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to investigate the}} effect of the density of the <b>host</b> <b>material</b> on the isomerization-induced diffusion mechanism that results in surface relief gratings formation. We find that a decrease in density increases the diffusion coefficient in a similar way for driven and spontaneous diffusion. This result suggests that the driving mechanism depends only slightly on the density of the <b>host</b> <b>material.</b> The pressure variations during the isomerization process decrease when the driven diffusion increases due to material softening for smaller densities. These results suggest that the pressure variations are not at the origin of the driven motions.
