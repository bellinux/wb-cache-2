500|$|In August 2003, Smith {{released}} a collaborative gospel album with country artists Barbara Fairchild and Sharon White called Love Never Fails on Daywind Records. In {{an interview with}} Country Stars Central, Smith {{said that she was}} ill with the stomach flu while recording the album, but, [...] still enjoyed making the record, Produced by country and bluegrass artist Ricky Skaggs (White's husband), the album received a nomination from the Dove Awards. The website Slipcue.com reviewed the release and commented that Love Never Fails, [...] "is probably too rowdy for most Southern Gospel fans (who really like tinkly pianos and less-twangy vocals), and while it probably won't wow many country listeners, <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> who are fans any of these three singers, {{this is kind of a}} treat.|$|E
500|$|Pokémon Crystal was {{received}} well by critics, although many commented {{that there were}} just not enough new additions and features to significantly set it apart from Pokémon Gold and Silver. Craig Harris of IGN gave the game an [...] "outstanding" [...] 9 out of 10 stating, [...] "The final (hopefully) Game Boy Color edition is definitely the version to get if you aren't already one of the upteenth billion owners of the previous games, with Crystals slight updates to the design and graphics. But there's not much in this edition {{that makes it a}} [...] "must buy" [...] <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> who already own a copy or two of the previous editions". In Japan, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 34 out of 40.|$|E
500|$|Destructoid's Chris Carter was {{positive}} {{of all the}} changes made to the original that showcased Raven's considerable efforts, but stated that the game was still at its core one from 2007. He cited the story as an example, saying that the game's campaign was still worth playing despite having been topped by its competition. Carter further noted that the cast were [...] "nothing more than warm bodies at points", but opined that {{the crux of the}} story and the relationship between main protagonist Soap and Captain Price was [...] "worth the price of admission". Alternatively, he found the multiplayer to be timeless, and that the design of each map held up well and felt justified. He compared the multiplayer to those offered by other first-person shooter games, such as the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series, stating [...] "There's a nice, comfortable balance between the two philosophies, to the point where it's not too alienating <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> who didn't grow up with twichy FPSes or feel like dedicating the time to learning {{the ins and outs of}} breaching and clearing each and every room, knocking on permadeath's door on every match." ...|$|E

500|$|Elliot Gay of Japanator {{elaborated}} on {{the challenges}} {{that could have been}} faced in adapting a 50- to 80-hour RPG into a 90-minute film but praised its admirable job at pacing albeit a few issues. He noted that one such example was with as with the introduction of the Tartarus Tower which he felt was [...] "rushed and somewhat under-explained". Gay also noted that the film [...] "suffers from not having a strong narrative through-line" [...] {{and that there was no}} sense of closure since [...] "nothing truly significant [...] place". He argued that this was as an [...] "unavoidable side effect of adapting Persona 3". Like Eisenbeis though, Gay felt that Makoto's experiences ultimately result in his growth and that the subtitle Spring of Birth [...] "refers to Makoto and the forward progress he makes as a person." [...] Gay went on to praise the film's visuals, explaining that the [...] "film captures the darker atmosphere of the game admirably." [...] Overall, Gay described the film as delivering [...] "a nostalgic trip down memory lane for longtime fans, and an accessible entry point <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> curious about the franchise." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{health and}} {{well-being}} became a prominent concern in 2008. In February, she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Doctors reported {{that she did not}} break her hip as feared, and she was released from the hospital two days later. News commentators noted that Reagan's step had slowed significantly, as the following month she walked in very slow strides with John McCain. NBC's Brian Williams, who attended a dinner with Reagan in mid-2008, recalled, [...] "Mrs. Reagan's vision isn't what it always was so she was taking very halting steps as a lot of folks her age do... It is so important <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> in her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship. She very much is captain of her own ship." [...] As for her mental ability, Williams remarked, [...] "She's as sharp as ever and enjoys a robust life with her friends in California, but falling is always a danger of course. She's a very stoic, hardy person full of joy and excitement for life... She is not without opinions on politics and political types these days... She is, as most of her friends described her, a pistol." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, then Uber CEO Travis Kalanick {{responded to}} {{criticism}} of dynamic pricing by saying: [...] "it's {{going to take}} some time <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> to accept [...] There's 70 years of conditioning around the fixed price of taxis." [...] Uber has defended this [...] "surge pricing" [...] on its website, arguing that without dynamic pricing, there would not be enough drivers to enable riders to get a ride immediately upon request. Uber cited an example of the aftermath of a sold out concert at Madison Square Garden when pricing was increased. During this event, the number of people who opened the Uber app increased 400%, but, due to the higher prices, the actual ride requests only rose slightly, enabling ride requests to be completed within the usual timeframe.|$|E
