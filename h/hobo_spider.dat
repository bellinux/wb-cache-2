25|$|In Canada, {{there are}} {{scientists}} {{who claim that}} no <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> bites lead to dermal necrosis. Hobo spiders are common in Europe, though bites are relatively uncommon, and other than unconfirmed reports {{there is no evidence}} of them causing necrosis despite hundreds of years of coexistence there. The only documented case of a verified <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> bite leading to necrotic skin lesions involves a person who had a pre-existing medical condition (phlebitis) that can also cause the appearance of skin lesions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hobo</b> <b>spider</b> bites are {{not known}} to be fatal to healthy humans. The {{necrosis}} in purported cases is similar to, but milder than, that caused by the brown recluse spider, and in severe cases can take months to heal. Other reported symptoms include intense headaches, vision abnormalities, and/or general feelings of malaise. These symptoms are not confirmed for the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> bite, specifically {{due to lack of}} positive identification of the spider by an expert, and the Oregon Poison Center (affiliated with the Oregon Health & Science University) is attempting to gather definitive evidence regarding the validity of these reports as of September 2007.|$|E
25|$|The triangulate cobweb spider {{is known}} to prey on many other types of arthropods, ants (including fire ants), other spiders, pillbugs, and ticks. It preys on several other spiders {{believed}} to be harmful to humans, including the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> and the brown recluse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hobo</b> <b>spiders</b> {{lack the}} colored bands found on many spiders of the Agelenidae family where the leg joints meet.|$|R
50|$|Callobius bennetti is {{a species}} of spider in the Amaurobiidae family. It has {{multiple}} common names: Hackled Mesh Weaver, hacklemesh weaver, night spider, and tangled nest spider. They sometimes could be mistaken for <b>hobo</b> <b>spiders.</b> The species {{can be found in}} North America.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Hobo</b> <b>spiders</b> do {{not have}} two {{distinct}} longitudinal dark stripes on the top side of the cephalothorax, instead showing indistinct or diffused patterns. Washington spiders with distinct dark stripes include spiders from the genera Agelenopsis and Hololena and possibly some wolf spiders. (These spiders {{do not have}} common names.) ...|$|R
25|$|It is a {{resident}} of fields, rarely entering human habitations due {{to the presence of}} major competitors, particularly the giant house spider (Eratigena atrica), which is a common resident of houses and other man-made structures in Europe. As a result, human contacts with the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> are uncommon in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> was {{considered}} to be a dangerous species based on a toxicology study on rabbits where lesions appeared after spiders were induced to bite the rabbits. This laboratory study has led to the proposal that {{in some parts of the}} U.S. nearly all bites attributed to the brown recluse spider are in reality the hobo spider's bite. The CDC and other U.S. government agencies have also used this same study as the basis for a report claiming that the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> bite causes necrosis in humans, despite the absence of any confirmed cases. Subsequent attempts to replicate the study by injecting sufficient venom to ensure envenomation have failed to produce necrotic lesions, and there is even question as to whether the lesions observed in the original study were necrotic. The CDC no longer considers it a dangerously venomous species.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1802 by naturalist Charles Athanase Walckenaer as Aranea agrestis, {{in reference to}} its western European habitat in fields, woods, and under rocks. In 1841, Walckenaer transferred the species to the genus Tegenaria. In 2013, Tegenaria was split up, and the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> was transferred to a new genus Eratigena, an anagram of Tegenaria.|$|E
25|$|Some spider bites {{may lead}} to necrosis. In the United States, only spider bites from the brown recluse spider (genus Loxosceles) {{reliably}} progress to necrosis. In other countries, spiders of the same genus, such as the Chilean recluse in South America, are also known to cause necrosis. Claims that yellow sac <b>spiders</b> and <b>hobo</b> <b>spiders</b> possess necrotic venom have not been substantiated.|$|R
5000|$|A {{population}} of giant house spiders is popularly {{thought to be}} a deterrent to the establishment of Eratigena agrestis, known in North America as the [...] "hobo spider", and considered by some to be more likely to bite humans. Giant house spiders may compete with <b>hobo</b> <b>spiders</b> for the same resources.Hobo spiders grow no more than a body size of 15 mm long whereas the larger female giant house spider can have a body size of 18 mm, but has proportionately much longer legs.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To dispel {{prevalent}} myths surrounding {{diagnosis of}} dermonecrotic and associated conditions supposedly resulting from bites of brown recluse, <b>hobo,</b> or other <b>spiders</b> in Canada. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Worldwide, spider bites are regularly misdiagnosed as the etiologic agents in human dermonecrosis mainly {{as a result}} of inaccurate, erroneous, or hyperbolic popular and professional literature based on inference, circumstantial evidence, inferior clinical trials, and misunderstanding of the facts regarding spider-bite envenomation. MAIN MESSAGE: A working diagnosis of "spider bite" or publishing a case history should be considered only when a spider is caught in the act of biting or otherwise reliably associated with a lesion. Accurate identification of the spider could be critical for correct diagnosis and subsequent treatment. CONCLUSION: Brown recluse spiders are not found in Canada. <b>Hobo</b> <b>spiders</b> have not been reliably implicated in dermonecrosis. Worldwide, spider-bite envenomation is an unlikely cause of dermonecrosis. Canadian physicians should give priority consideration to other, more likely, causes...|$|R
25|$|Reported {{cases of}} brown recluse bites occur {{primarily}} in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas. There {{have been many}} reports of brown recluse bites in California—though a few related species may be found there, none of these are known to bite humans. To date, the reports of bites from areas outside of the spider's native range have been either unverified, or, if verified, the spiders have been moved to those locations by travelers or commerce. Many arachnologists believe {{that a large number}} of bites attributed to the brown recluse in the West Coast are either from other spider species or not spider bites at all. For example, the venom of the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider,</b> a common European species established in the northwestern United States and southern British Columbia, has been reported to produce similar symptoms as the brown recluse bite when injected into laboratory rabbits. However, the toxicity of <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> venom has been called into question as actual bites have not been shown to cause necrosis, and no such occurrences have ever been reported where the spider is native.|$|E
25|$|Birds in {{the region}} include American robin, bald eagle, California gull, Canada goose, dark-eyed junco, hairy woodpecker, mallard, {{mountain}} chickadee, red-tailed hawk, Steller's jay, western tanager, and yellow-headed blackbird. The region has numerous venomous spiders, such as the black widow, brown recluse, tarantula, and <b>hobo</b> <b>spider.</b> The mountain yellow-legged frog is also living throughout the area. Fish species in the lake include Tahoe sucker, mountain whitefish, brown bullhead catfish, smallmouth bass, mosquitofish, and brown trout.|$|E
25|$|Hobo spiders have a light stripe {{running down}} the middle of the sternum. If the spider instead has three or four pairs of light spots on the lateral {{portions}} of the sternum, then it is one of the other two related Eratigena species. However absence of spots is not conclusive proof that the spider is a <b>hobo</b> <b>spider,</b> since the spots on other Eratigena species may be extremely faint and not readily visible.|$|E
50|$|Pholcus phalangioides, {{known as}} the longbodied cellar spider or the skull spider due to its {{cephalothorax}} looking like a human skull, is a spider of the family Pholcidae. Females have a body length of about 9 mm; males are slightly smaller. Its legs are about 5 or 6 times the length of its body (reaching up to 7 cm of leg span in females). Its habit of living on the ceilings of rooms, caves, garages or cellars gives rise to one of its common names. They are considered beneficial {{in some parts of}} the world because they kill and eat other spiders, including species that can be considered a problem to humans such as <b>hobo</b> and redback <b>spiders.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> (Eratigena agrestis, {{formerly}} Tegenaria agrestis) is {{a member}} of the genus of spiders known colloquially as funnel web spiders, but not to be confused with the Australian funnel-web spider. The medical significance of its bite is still poorly understood and debated. Individuals construct a funnel-shaped structure of silk sheeting and lie in wait at the small end of the funnel for prey insects to blunder onto their webs. Hobo spiders sometimes build their webs in or around human habitations.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{species of}} these {{seemingly}} benign spiders invade webs of other spiders {{and eat the}} host, the eggs, or the prey. In some cases the spider vibrates the web of other spiders, mimicking the struggle of trapped prey to lure {{the host of the}} web closer. Pholcids are natural predators of the Tegenaria species, and are known to attack and eat redback spiders, huntsman spiders, and house spiders. It is this competition that helps keep Tegenaria populations in check, which may be advantageous to humans who live in regions with dense <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> populations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{toxicity}} {{and aggression}} of the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> {{have long been}} debated; the current consensus {{is that it is}} not a dangerously venomous species. One common name, the aggressive house spider may arise from a misinterpretation of the Latin name agrestis, (lit. [...] "of the fields") as [...] "aggressive". If a <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> is tending an egg sac, it may become aggressive if it perceives the egg sac as being threatened. However, they generally do not bite unless forced to protect themselves.|$|E
2500|$|The spider species Tegenaria domestica, {{commonly}} known as the barn funnel weaver in North America and the domestic house spider in Europe, {{is a member of the}} funnel-web family Agelenidae and a close relative of the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Spiders, {{including}} the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider,</b> vary considerably in appearance, and identification can be difficult. Identification relies on {{an examination of}} the spider’s anatomy. Like many species of spider the positive identification of Eratigena agrestis requires microscopic examination of the epigynum and pedipalps (the female and male sex organs respectively) and is best done by an arachnologist. However, the following characteristics can help in identification of hobo spiders in order to prevent misidentification and eradication of beneficial species with a similar general appearance: ...|$|E
2500|$|Numerous other spiders {{have been}} {{associated}} with necrotic bites in medical literature. Other recluse species, such as the desert recluse (found in the deserts of southwestern United States), are reported to have caused necrotic bite wounds, though only rarely. The <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> and the yellow sac spider have also been reported to cause necrotic bites. However, the bites from these spiders are not known to produce the severe symptoms that can follow from a recluse spider bite, and the level of danger posed by these has been called into question. So far, no known necrotoxins have been isolated from the venom of any of these spiders, and some arachnologists have disputed the accuracy of spider identifications carried out by bite victims, family members, medical responders, and other non-experts in arachnology. There have been several studies questioning the danger posed by some of these spiders. In these studies, scientists examined case studies of bites in which the spider in question was identified by an expert, and found that the incidence of necrotic injury diminished significantly when [...] "questionable" [...] identifications were excluded from the sample set. (For a comparison of the toxicity of several kinds of spider bites, see the list of spiders having medically significant venom.) ...|$|E

50|$|Only {{one species}} of agelenid has become {{prominent}} as a putative {{cause of a}} significant frequency of necrotic arachnidism; this is the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider,</b> Eratigena agrestis. This perception arose when the species accidentally got introduced to the United States in the mid-20th century and propagated rapidly in several regions. It is a fairly large, rapidly moving spider, and accordingly alarms to many people.|$|E
50|$|Agelenids {{have eight}} eyes in two {{horizontal}} rows of four. The cephalothorax narrows somewhat {{towards the front}} where the eyes are. The abdomen {{is more or less}} oval, usually patterned with two rows of lines and spots. Some species have longitudinal lines on the dorsal surface of the cephalothorax, whereas other species do not; for example, the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider</b> does not, which assists in informally distinguishing it from similar-looking species.|$|E
50|$|Eratigena is a genus of spider in the Agelenidae family. Most of its {{species were}} {{moved from the}} genus Tegenaria in 2013. Two species that {{frequently}} build webs in and around human dwellings are now placed in this genus. Eratigena agrestis is the <b>hobo</b> <b>spider,</b> native to Europe and Central Asia, introduced to North America.
