In addition, RAAF F/A-18s have participated in exercises in the Philippines, Thailand and the United States.

5|$|From early April 1965, Ubon {{became an}} {{important}} base for United States Air Force (USAF) attacks on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and No.79 Squadron became part of an <b>integrated</b> <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> system controlled by the USAF on 25June. This changed {{the status of the}} squadron's presence in Thailand, and RAAF Headquarters assessed that the North Vietnamese would be justified in regarding it as forming part of the air campaign against their country. Due to the threat of counter-attacks on Ubon, the base's ground defences were upgraded during 1966; this included the construction of defensive positions for No.79 Squadron's aircraft and personnel as well as the deployment of a detachment of RAAF airfield defence guards. While the squadron did not play {{an active role in the}} war, it supported the US effort by providing air defence for Ubon and taking part in exercises with USAF aircraft in which the Sabres adopted tactics used by North Vietnamese MiG-17 fighters. In December 1965 the commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces, General Hunter Harris, Jr., wrote to the chief of the RAAF, Air Marshal Alister Murdoch, to suggest that No.79 Squadron join the USAF operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail in southern Laos which were being covertly conducted by Ubon-based aircraft. The Thai Government indicated that it would allow the squadron to be used for this purpose as long as the Australian operations were conducted without a formal agreement or any public announcement. On 2March 1966 the Australian Cabinet decided to reinforce the Army and RAAF force in South Vietnam, but rejected the option of expanding the scope of RAAF operations in Thailand. This decision was made on the grounds that the expanded force in South Vietnam and existing deployments to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore represented the maximum forces Australia could commit to the region.|$|E

BAC received orders for 34 multirole single-seat Lightning F.53s that could still retain very high performance and reasonable endurance, and six two-seat T.55 trainers, together with 25 BAC Strikemaster trainers, while the contract also included new radar systems, American HAWK surface-to-air missiles and training and support services.|$|E

The Indian Air Force will also acquire a more advanced unit, called the Aslesha. The LLLWR is a 2D radar {{with a range of}} 40km against a 2 square metre target, intended as a gapfiller to plug detection gaps versus low level aircraft in an <b>integrated</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> Ground network. The LLLWR makes use of Indra-2 technology, namely a similar antenna array, but has roughly half the range and is much smaller and a far more portable unit. The LLLWR can track while scan 100 targets and provide details about their speed, azimuth and range to the operator. The LLLWR makes use of the BFSR-SR experience and many of the subsystem providers are the same. Multiple LLLWRs can be networked together. The LLLWR is meant to detect low level intruders, and will alert Army Air Defence fire control units to cue their weapon systems.|$|E

This consisted of an <b>integrated</b> <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> system which included (i) radar (whose potential Dowding {{was among the first to}} appreciate), (ii) human observers (including the Royal Observer Corps), who filled crucial gaps in what radar was capable of detecting at the time (the early radar systems, for example, did not provide good information on the altitude of incoming German aircraft), (iii) raid plotting, and (iv) radio control of aircraft. The whole network was linked in many cases by dedicated telephone cables buried sufficiently deeply to provide protection against bombing. The network had its centre [...] at RAF Bentley Priory, a converted country house on the outskirts of London. The system as a whole later became known as Ground-controlled interception (GCI).|$|E

40|$|In September 2008, the Missile Defence Group of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, {{together}} with the German Air Force and the US Missile Defence Agency, organised the 10 th edition of Exercise Joint Project Optic Windmill (JPOW). Over the past decade JPOW has become a world leading <b>Integrated</b> <b>Air</b> and Missile <b>Defence</b> (IAMD) exercise, where next to collective training an important focus is on experimenting with novel <b>air</b> and missile <b>defence</b> concepts, new tactics, techniques and procedures, and testing future capabilities in a multinational live, virtual and constructive (LVC) environment. In 2008, over 1500 participants from seven nations joined JPOW X. In this paper we will describe how JPOW has evolved over the past decade. We will then describe in more detail how JPOWX was organised and conducted. We will present the organisational, operational and technical challenges {{that need to be}} addressed to successfully host (distributed) multi-national and multi-level training events and how to address additional challenges that arise when LVC assets come together in an exercise environment. Also, the unique JPOW concept of combining an exercise (collective training) with experimentation (both in terms of new concepts and capabilities) will be addressed. From an organisational point of view we will then present the key lessons learned, both from the experimental and the actual mission execution phase of the exercise. We will conclude this paper by describing how JPOW not only facilitates collective training but also supports the actual transformation on <b>integrating</b> <b>air</b> and missile <b>defence</b> and has led towards a comprehensive Dutch <b>air</b> and missile <b>defence</b> approach.
