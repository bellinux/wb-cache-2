For a particular texture 4 - zero mass matrix, which fairly reproduces PDG CKM matrix, the range of sin 2 β is: 0. 39 - 0. 54 (1 GeV) and 0. 27 - 0. 61 (mz), for the texture 5 - zero case it is 0. 45 - 0. 54 (1 GeV) and 0. 31 - 0. 58 (mZ).

40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{oligomerization}} {{has emerged}} as a vital characteristic of receptor structure. Substantial experimental evidence supports the existence of GPCR-GPCR interactions in a coordinated and cooperative manner. However, despite the current development of experimental techniques for large-scale detection of GPCR heteromers, in order to understand their connectivity it is necessary to develop novel tools to study the global heteroreceptor networks. To provide insight into the overall topology of the GPCR heteromers and identify key players, a collective interaction network was constructed. Experimental interaction data for each of the individual human GPCR protomers was obtained manually from the STRING and SCOPUS databases. The interaction data were used to build and analyze the network using Cytoscape software. The network was treated as undirected throughout the study. It is comprised of 156 nodes, 260 edges and has a scale-free topology. Connectivity analysis reveals a significant dominance of intrafamily versus interfamily connections. Most of the receptors within the network are linked to each other by a small number of edges. DRD 2, OPRM, ADRB 2, AA 2 AR, AA 1 R, OPRK, OPRD and GHSR are identified as hubs. In a network representation 10 modules/clusters also appear as a highly interconnected group of nodes. Information on this GPCR network can improve our understanding of molecular integration.

40|$|International audienceSwitched Ethernet is a {{technology}} that is profoundly reshaping automotive communication architectures {{as it did in}} other application domains such as avionics with the use of AFDX backbones. Early stage timing verification of critical embedded networks typically relies on simulation and worst-case schedulability analysis. When the modeling power of schedulability analysis is not sufficient, there are typically two options: either make pessimistic assumptions or ignore what cannot be modeled. Both options are unsatisfactory because they are either inefficient in terms of resource usage or potentially unsafe. To overcome those issues, we believe it is a good practice to use simulation models, which can be more realistic, along with schedulability analysis. The two basic questions that we aim to study here is what can we expect from simulation, and how to use it properly? This empirical study explores these questions on realistic case-studies and provides methodological guidelines for the use of simulation in the design of switched Ethernet networks. A broader objective of the study is to compare the outcomes of schedulability analyses and simulation, and conclude about the scope of usability of simulation in the desi gn of critical Ethernet networks. 1 C o n t e x t a n <b>d</b> <b>o</b> <b>b</b> j e c t i v e s o f t h e s t u d y Ethernet is meant in vehicles not only for the support of infotainment applications but also to transmit time-sensitive data used for the real-time control of the vehicle and ADAS functions. In such use-cases, the temporal behavior of the communication architecture must be carefully validat ed. Early stage timing verification of critical embedded networks typically relies on simulation and worst-case schedulability analysis, which basically consists in building a mathematical model of the worst possible situations that can be encountered at run-time. When the modeling capabilities of schedulability analysis is not sufficient, which given the complexity of today's architectures is in our experience in many practical situations the case (see [Na 13,Na 14] and § 2. 4), there are typically two possibilities. The first option is to make pessimistic assumptions (e. g., modeling aperiodic frames as periodic ones), which is not always possible because for instance it may result in overloaded resources (e. g., link utilization larger than 100 %). The second option is to ignore what cannot be modeled (e. g., ignoring transmission errors, aperiodic traffic, etc). Both options are unsatisfactory because they are either inefficient in terms of resource usage or potentially unsafe. In addition, it can happen that schedulability analysis tools provide wrong results, most often because the analysis' assumptions are not met by the actual implementation, or possibly because of numerical issues in the implementation (e. g., if floating point arithmetic is used), or simply because the analysis is flawed (see for instance [Da 07]) ...|$|E

A retraction r {{is said to be}} orthogonal if for each x, x — r(x) is normal to F in a sense related to that of R. C. James. This paper establishes three main results. First, a nonexpansive projection is necessarily an orthogonal retraction; if E is smooth, the converse is also true. Second, if E is smooth then there can exist at most one nonexpan-sive projection of C onto a given subset F. Third, if E is uniformly smooth and there exists a nonexpansive retraction of C onto F, then there exists a nonexpansive projection of C onto F. The proximity mapping is a nonexpansive projection in a Hubert space, but not in a general Banach space. We shall adopt the following conventions throughout this paper: E always denotes a real Banach space, E * its dual space, C a non-empty closed convex subset of E, and F a nonempty closed subset of C.

40|$|In this chapter, we {{consider}} two {{problems associated with}} time-delay systems: robust stability analysis and robust stabilization. We first obtain two results for robust stability using the integral quadratic constraint approach and the linear matrix inequality technique. Both results give {{an estimate of the}} maximum time-delay which preserves robust stability. The first stability result is simpler to apply while the second one gives a less conservative robust stability condition. We then apply these stability results to solve the associated robust stabilization problem using static state feedback. Our results provide new design procedures involving linear matrix inequalities. 1 Introduction Consider a time-delay system described by x(t) = A 0 x(t) A <b>d</b> x(t Γ <b>ø)</b> <b>B</b> u u(t) (1) where x(t) 2 IR n is the state, u(t) 2 IR m is the control input, ø is an unknown constant time delay, A 0, A d and B u are constant matrices.

Information given by <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> s turns out to be very informative to explain and predict the dynamics of local search methods. Thus, it allows us to obtain some explanations of an intriguing behavior of the local search method WSAT. Indeed, our experiments show that WSAT stagnates invariably within a particular cost interval, independently of the starting assignment. This behavior can be explained using <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> s.
