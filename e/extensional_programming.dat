40|$|<b>Extensional</b> higher-order logic <b>programming</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} as a generalization of classical logic programming. An important characteristic of this paradigm is that it preserves all the well-known properties of traditional logic programming. In this paper we consider the semantics of negation {{in the context of}} the new paradigm. Using some recent results from non-monotonic fixed-point theory, we demonstrate that every higher-order logic program with negation has a unique minimum infinite-valued model. In this way we obtain the first purely model-theoretic semantics for negation in <b>extensional</b> higher-order logic <b>programming.</b> Using our approach, we resolve an old paradox that was introduced by W.

40|$|Abstract	The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to specify and estimate Sukkari dates cost function and to utilize its indicators to understand the production performance of sukkari date in Qassim region and hence to draw some policy indications for dates production. The study relied on primary data. A stratified random sample of 50 farms representing sukkari date producers was selected from Qassim region. Farm owners sample were interviewed, and primary data were gathered through the interviews in 2005 season. Multiple regression was used to estimate the long run cost function. Various function forms were estimated, and the best form was selected. 	Average and marginal cost functions were derived from the estimated cost function. The economic farm size of sukkari date, cost elasticity, and sukkari date long run supply function were then specified. At average quantity produced in the study area, average cost was SR 1722 /ton, marginal cost was SR 1198 /ton, and cost elasticity was 0. 69. The optimal sukkari farm size was estimated to be 875 ton (about 8928 date palms). 	According to the findings of the study, the following are recommended: (1) 	Encourage sukkari date producers to increase the size of their farms to be about 8928 date trees, in order to minimize the average cost of producing sukkari dates. (2) 	Encourage date producers to replace low quality date varieties with high quality date varieties. (3) 	Intensive <b>extensional</b> <b>programs</b> to train farmers to reduce the cost of production, to increase date productivity and quality, and to improve managerial aspects of big date retail farms. (4) 	Improve date marketing system to increase producers share of date retail prices. (5) 	 Conduct more research to reduce the cost of fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation, labor machinery to help reducing the cost of sukkari date productio...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify economic importance of Qassim region in sukkari date production and to analyze the cost of sukkari date production in Qassim region. The study relied on both secondary and primary data. A stratified purposive sample of 50 farms representing sukkari date producers was selected form Qassim region in 2005 season. Descriptive and analytical procedures were utilized in processing and analyzing both secondary and primary data. 	The results of the study showed significant effects of farm size on costs of production. Large date farms were significantly less per ton costs of dates than small farms. It is concluded from the results that the total cost of sukkari date production was about 292 thousand Riyals per an average farm, of total area 513. 3 donums and having about 2005 sukkari date trees. The total const of sukkari date production was about SR 145. 5 /date palm, and for production about 1513 /ton. The cost of labor represented about 27. 5 % of total cost of sukkari date. The test of differences between small farms and large farms of dates (t-test) showed significant difference between small and large sukkari farms in operating costs, machinery costs, and farm construction costs. There were statistically significant differences between the averages among small and large farms. 	According to the findings of the study, it is recommended to encourage sukkari date producers to increase th size of their farms in order to minimize the average cost of producing it, encourage date producers to replace low quality date varieties with a high quality varieties, conduct more research to reduce the cost of fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation, labor machinery to help reducing the cost of sukkari date production, intensive <b>extensional</b> <b>programs</b> to train farmers to reduce the cost of production and to increase date productivity and quality, establish an information and data base about the cost of production and efficient techniques, to be available and interpreted for date producers to produce efficiently through better technology and technical practices, activating the role of agricultural cooperatives to provide farms with low cost factors of production, establish manufacturing industries that can utilize palm by-products to help reduction the cost of date production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} an <b>extensional</b> higher-order logic <b>programming</b> language which possesses the minimum Herbrand model property. We propose an SLD-resolution proof procedure and we demonstrate {{that it is}} sound and complete {{with respect to this}} semantics. In this way, we ex-tend the familiar proof theory of first-order logic programming to apply to the more general higher-order case. We then enhance our source lan-guage with constructive negation and extend the aforementioned proof procedure to support this new feature. We demonstrate the soundness of the resulting proof procedure and describe an actual implementation of a language that embodies the above ideas. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} information-flow type systems, {{the security}} policy is often formalized as noninterference properties. However, noninterference alone {{is too strong}} to express security properties useful in practice. If we allow downgrading in such systems, {{it is challenging to}} formalize the security policy as an extensional property of the system. This paper presents a generalized framework of downgrading policies. Such policies can be specified in a simple and tracable language and can be statically enforced by mechanisms such as type systems. The security guarantee is then formalized as a concise <b>extensional</b> property using <b>program</b> equivalences. This relaxed noninterference generalizes traditional pure noninterference and precisely characterizes the information released due to downgrading...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn an extensional {{treatment}} of dataflow deadlock Wadge (1981) introduced an elegant nonoperational test for proving {{that many of}} Kahn's data flow message passing networks (Kahn, 1974) must be free of deadlock; a test that “should extend to a much wider context” {{in the study of}} program correctness. Such a context has now been provided with the introduction of partial metric spaces (Matthews, 1992). These spaces can be used to describe semantic domains such as those used in lazy data flow languages (Wadge and Ashcroft, 1985). This paper develops Wadge's ideas on establishing an <b>extensional</b> theory of <b>program</b> correctness by using partial metric spaces to give a nonoperational {{treatment of}} lazy data flow deadlock...|$|R
40|$|Execution of {{programs}} with data parallel language constructs is either {{based on the}} fork/join or on the SPMD model. Whereas the former executes a program sequentially and confines parallel activity to the data parallel constructs, the latter executes the whole program in parallel: while data parallel constructs are performed cooperatively, the remaining code is replicated. However, {{in the presence of}} I/O not all operations may actually be replicated without changing the <b>programs</b> <b>extensional</b> behaviour. Consequently, even SPMD-style parallel execution contains pockets of sequential execution, and the two execution models differ mostly in the default execution mode. Which execution model is better suited depends on an individual programs characteristics. Therefore, we propose a hybrid execution model that combines the advantages of fork/join- and SPMD-style execution. The hybrid model adapts itself {{to the needs of the}} program compiled. While some program parts are effectively executed following a fork/join approach, others are executed in SMPD mode depending on the individual mix of operations. The number of costly execution mode switches and, hence, the overhead for synchronization and communication is reduced with respect to both plain fork/join and SPMD approaches...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{semantics}} {{serves as}} an interface between a language and the user: the interface serving to hide a significant degree of operational detail and present a simpler view of program execution to the user. What are the properties that an abstract semantics should satisfy? It was an insight of Strachey [4 l] that the abstract semantics must be compositional; thus, one {{must be able to}} "build up" the abstract meaning of a program from the abstract meanings of its components. Note that it is not immediately obvious how one thinks of recursive programs in this manner. This is the role of fixpoint theory developed by Scott [62]. Informally, fixpoint theory formalisms the intuitive inductive arguments that one uses in reasoning about recursive programs. The theory developed by Scott works for determinate programs: programs that yield one output for every input. Thus, the theory is inadequate to handle indeterminate programs: programs that can yield more than one output for a given input. Powerdomains, that can be viewed as the computable analogue of the powerset, were developed to enlarge the scope of the theory of Scott to handle indeterminate computations [52, 64]. Domain theory, enriched with powerdomain constructions to handle indeterminacy has been successful in serving as a mathematical formalism powerful enough to specify abstract semantics for tranformational programs: programs that take a input, compute in isolation and return an output. Thus, programs are usually denoted by functions in the determinate case and as Input-Output relations in the indeterminate case. The semantics is termed abstract because it hides significant degree of internal operational detail and presents an <b>extensional</b> view of <b>programs.</b> The situation is not as clear for interactive programming systems: systems built out of processes which engage in communication with the environment and/or other processes while computing. The key difference from transformational systems is that the output produced by a process can influence its input. Static, determinate dataflow [32] is the prime example of the few models interactive systems that are amenable to extensional treatment...|$|R
