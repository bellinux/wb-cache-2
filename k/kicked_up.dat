5|$|In {{addition}} to the parody of King Leopold II, Méliès's scenario for the film features another topical element: the scene with the tar wagon {{is based on the}} experiments of Ernest Guglielminetti, who spread tar over {{a small part of the}} gravel road to Monaco. This experiment, widely reported by the press, successfully eliminated the dust clouds <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> by cars on gravel and sand roads.|$|E

5|$|Just {{minutes after}} the impact, the flyby probe passed by the nucleus at a close {{distance}} of , taking pictures of the crater position, the ejecta plume, and the entire cometary nucleus. The entire event was also photographed by Earth-based telescopes and orbital observatories, including the Hubble, Chandra, Spitzer, and XMM-Newton. The impact was also observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board Europe's Rosetta spacecraft, which was about 80millionkm (50millionmiles) from the comet {{at the time of}} impact. Rosetta determined the composition of the gas and dust cloud that was <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> by the impact.|$|E
5|$|Dust <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> by {{the winds}} of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|Paul Baras of Brasier set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the race}} on his first lap. He {{held on to the}} lead until the third lap, when Szisz took over first position, {{defending}} it to the finish. Hot conditions melted the road tar, which the cars <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> into the faces of the drivers, blinding them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of the rims.|$|E

5|$|Itala driver Maurice Fabry {{started the}} fastest of the competitors; {{he covered the}} first {{kilometre}} in 43.4seconds. Over the full distance of the lap Brasier's Baras was the quickest; his lap time of 52minutes and 25.4seconds (52:25.4) moved him up to third position {{on the road and}} into the lead overall. A mechanical problem caused Gabriel to lose control of his car at Saint-Calais; he regained control in time to avoid a serious accident but was forced to retire. Baras maintained his lead after the second lap, but fell back to second the next lap as Szisz took over the lead. As the day grew hotter—it reached a high of —the tar began to melt, which proved to be a greater problem than the dust; it was <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> by the cars into the faces of the drivers and their mechanics, seeping past their goggles and inflaming their eyes. The Renault driver, J. Edmond, was particularly affected: his broken goggles allowed more tar to seep past and rendered him nearly blind. His attempts to change the goggles at a pit stop were rejected by officials on the grounds that equipment could not be replaced mid-race. Nor could another driver be substituted; he continued for two more laps before retiring.|$|E
5|$|Vietnam was {{the country}} with the worst impacts from Koni. Widespread power outages and telecomunnication {{failures}} were commonplace during the storm's passage. Offshore the northern coast of Vietnam, 19fishing and passenger boats capsized due to strong waves produced by the tropical storm. One of these sinkings near Do Son resulted in the death of a fisherman. Another person was killed in Tam Diep after being hit by a prostrated tree. Eighteen others in four of Vietnam's northern provinces were injured by flying debris <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> by Koni's strong winds. In Thanh Hóa Province, strong winds uprooted trees and electricity poles. The roofs of 300homes in Thanh Hóa were torn apart. Koni also disrupted water supplies and telephone service in the city. Further north, in Thái Bình, gusts reaching as high as 90km/h (55mph) damaged 250residences as well as 300ha (740acres) of rice crops. Ten of the eighteen people injured country wide were injured there. In Hanoi, the winds blew trees down. Overall, 3people were killed in Vietnam. Approximately 1,000homes were destroyed by Koni, resulting in significant impacts to agriculture. Despite significant impacts in Vietnam, rains brought by Koni alleviated persistent drought conditions over Vietnam's northern colonies. Though the name Koni was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization, the name was corrected to Goni for its 2009 usage.|$|E

25|$|Jupiter's {{ring system}} is formed by dust <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the planet's four small inner moons. The {{outermost}} ring is actually two rings, one embedded with the other. There {{is probably a}} separate ring along Amalthea's orbit, as well.|$|E
25|$|Motor vehicle {{emissions}} contribute air pollution. Concentrations of {{air pollutants}} and adverse respiratory health effects are greater near the road than at {{some distance away}} from the road. Road dust <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> by vehicles may trigger allergic reactions. In addition, on-road transportation greenhouse gas emissions are the largest single cause of climate change, scientists say.|$|E
25|$|Man-made lakes, such as {{dams and}} flooded clay pits, gravel pits and {{quarries}}, often have low visibility. Disused and flooded quarries are popular in inland areas for diver training {{as well as}} recreational diving. Rock quarries may have reasonable underwater visibility - there is often little mud or silt to create mid-water particles that cause low visibility, {{and the lack of}} flow allows silt to settle on the bottom, where it may later be <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> by unskilled divers to temporarily reduce visibility locally. As they are not natural environments, and usually privately owned, quarries may contain objects intentionally placed for divers to explore, such as sunken boats, automobiles, aircraft, or structures like grain silos and gravel chutes.|$|E

Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> during the race from injuring his eyes. Boyd, however, needed four weeks of training to feel comfortable (but not expert) at driving the quadriga. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood. Local actors also portrayed charioteers. Among them were Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
25|$|Many other trails {{followed}} the Oregon Trail {{for much of}} its length, including the Mormon Trail from Illinois to Utah; the California Trail to the gold fields of California; and the Bozeman Trail to Montana. Because {{it was more a}} network of trails than a single trail, there were numerous variations with other trails eventually established {{on both sides of the}} Platte, North Platte, Snake, and Columbia rivers. With literally thousands of people and thousands of livestock traveling in a fairly small time slot the travelers had to spread out to find clean water, wood, good campsites, and grass. The dust <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> by the many travelers was a constant complaint, and where the terrain would allow it there may be between 20 and 50 wagons traveling abreast.|$|E
25|$|Lanzhou {{repeatedly}} has had {{the worst}} air quality of any of 84 Chinese cities surveyed. According to the National Environmental Analysis released by Tsinghua University and The Asian Development Bank in January 2013, Lanzhou is among one of ten most air polluted cities in the world. Air quality reportedly was so poor that at times one cannot see Lanshan, the mountain rising up along {{the south side of}} the city. Lanzhou is also the home of many factories, including some involved in petroleum processing, and suffers from large dust storms <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> from the Gobi Desert, especially in the winter and spring. In 2011, using Chinese statistics, the World Health Organization reported that Lanzhou has the worst air quality (annual mean PM10 ug/m3 of 150) among eleven western Chinese cities, and is worse than Beijing with its reading of 121.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, McDonald's {{pledged to}} stop using eggs from battery cage {{facilities}} by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch {{is expected to have}} a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens. The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems. The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being <b>kicked</b> <b>up</b> into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, an expedition, {{funded and}} filmed by the History Channel, brought {{together}} fourteen skilled divers {{to help determine}} what caused the quick sinking of Britannic. After preparation the crew dived on the wreck site on 17 September. Time was cut short when silt was <b>kicked</b> <b>up,</b> causing zero visibility conditions, and the two divers narrowly escaped with their lives. One last dive was to be attempted on Britannics boiler room, but {{it was discovered that}} photographing this far inside the wreck would lead to violating a permit issued by the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, a department within the Greek Ministry of Culture. Partly because of a barrier in languages, a last minute plea was turned down by the department. The expedition was unable to determine the cause of the rapid sinking, but hours of footage were filmed and important data was documented. Underwater Antiquities later recognised the importance of this mission and has since extended an invitation to revisit the wreck under less stringent rules. On this expedition, divers found a bulb shape in her expansion joint. This proved that her design was changed following the loss of Titanic.|$|E
