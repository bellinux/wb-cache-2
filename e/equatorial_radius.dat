25|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the solar wind's plasma from that within Saturn's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The magnetopause distance from the planet's center at the subsolar point varies widely from 16 to 27Rs (Rs=60,330km is the <b>equatorial</b> <b>radius</b> of Saturn). The magnetopause's position depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. The average magnetopause standoff distance is about 22Rs. In front of the magnetopause (at the distance of about 27Rs from the planet) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|E

40|$|We {{apply the}} Hartle {{formalism}} to study equilibrium configurations {{in the framework}} of Newtonian gravity. This approach allows one to study in a simple manner the properties of the interior gravitational field in the case of static as well as stationary rotating stars in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is shown that the gravitational equilibrium conditions reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations which can be integrated numerically. We derive all the relevant equations up to the second order in the angular velocity. Moreover, we find explicitly the total mass, the moment of inertia, the quadrupole moment, the polar and <b>equatorial</b> <b>radii,</b> and the eccentricity of the rotating body. We also present the procedure to calculate the gravitational Love number. We test the formalism in the case of white dwarfs and show its compatibility with the known results in the literature.
