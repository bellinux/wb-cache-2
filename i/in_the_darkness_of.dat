5|$|U-28s fifth war patrol {{took place}} from 11 August to 17 September 1940 {{and was one}} of Kuhnke's most productive. In August, she sank two ships for 5,500tons. On 10 September, U-28 found and tracked Convoy OA 210. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> early morning on 11 September, U-28 {{attacked}} the convoy and claimed two large freighters (13,000tons each) sunk and caused damage to a 10,000ton tanker, bringing Kuhnke's total for the patrol to five ships for 30,000tons. However, during the postwar analysis, he was only credited with sinking a 2,000ton Dutch freighter and damaging a 4,700ton British freighter; which, combined with his earlier sinkings, brought his total to four ships for 9,945tons. On his return to Lorient Kuhnke was awarded the Knight's Cross for his work.|$|E

5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E

500|$|Many {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} suggest that the mysteries of Isis were connected {{in some way to}} salvation and the guarantee of an afterlife. The Greek conception of the afterlife included the paradisiacal Elysian Fields, and philosophers developed various ideas about the immortality of the soul, but Greeks and Romans expressed uncertainty about what would happen to them after death. In both Greek and Roman traditional religion, no god was thought to guarantee a pleasant afterlife to his or her worshippers. The gods of some mystery cults may have been exceptions, but evidence about those cults' afterlife beliefs is vague. Apuleius's account, if it is accurate, provides stronger evidence for Isiac afterlife beliefs than is available for the other cults. The book says Isis's power over fate, which her Greek and Roman devotees frequently mentioned, gives her control over life and death. According to the priest who initiates Lucius, devotees of Isis [...] "who had finished their life's span and were already standing on the threshold of light’s end, if only they could safely be trusted with the great unspoken mysteries of the cult, were frequently drawn forth by the goddess' power and in a manner reborn through her providence and set once more on the course of renewed life." [...] In another passage, Isis herself says that when Lucius dies {{he will be able to}} see her shining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> the underworld and worship her there.|$|E
500|$|After {{the defeat}} at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon {{took more than}} six weeks in {{planning}} and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube. The French brought in more troops, more guns, and instituted better defensive measures to ensure {{the success of the}} next crossing. From 30 June to the early days of July, the French recrossed the Danube in strength, no less than 188,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians. Immediate resistance to the French advance was restricted to the outpost divisions of Nordmann and Johann von Klenau; the main Habsburg army was stationed five miles (8km) away, centred on the village of Wagram. After a successful crossing, Napoleon ordered an attack along the entire line so as to prevent the Austrians from escaping during the night. Furious assaults by the [...] "Terrible 57th" [...] Infantry Regiment and the elite 10th Light Infantry Regiment against the village of Baumersdorf led to an almost immediate French victory, but ultimately, the Austrians did not budge and kept the French from pressing further. Incessant attacks by the heroic Austrian Vincent Chevaulegers' cavalry forced the 10th and the 57th to retreat, leaving the French with no gains. Further attacks {{to the left of the}} line by Eugène and MacDonald also produced nothing.
