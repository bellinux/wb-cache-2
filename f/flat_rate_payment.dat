The model is tested in an area of Emilia Romagna (Italy) in two policy contexts: Agenda 2000 and the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. The results show that different policy design options lead to differences in policy costs as great as 200 – 400 %, with clear advantages for the menu of contracts. However, different policy scenarios may strongly affect such differences. Hence, the paper calls for greater attention to the interplay between CAP scenarios and water quality measure...|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{there are}} {{currently}} three methods of procuring black start. The most common is cost-of-service, {{as it is the}} simplest and is the traditional method. It is currently used by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the PJM Interconnection and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). Although the exact mechanisms differ somewhat the same approach is used, namely that units are identified for black start and their documented costs are then funded and rolled into a tariff for cost recovery. The second method is a new method used by the Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE). The new methodology is a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payment</b> which increases black start remuneration to encourage provision. The monthly compensation paid to a generator is determined by multiplying a flat rate (in $/KWyr and referred to as the $Y value) by the unit's Monthly Claimed Capability for that month. The purpose of this change was to simplify procurement and encourage provision of the black start service. The final method of procurement is competitive procurement as used by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Under this approach ERCOT runs a market for black start services. Interested participants submit an hourly standby cost in $/hr (e.g. $70 per hour), often termed an availability bid, that is unrelated to the capacity of the unit. Using various criteria ERCOT evaluates these bids and the selected units are paid as bid, presuming an 85% availability. Each black start unit must be able to demonstrate that it can startup another unit in close proximity to begin the islanding and synchronization of the grid.|$|E
40|$|We examine {{environmental}} auctions {{on working}} agricultural lands. We organized a discriminatory auction where farmers {{were asked to}} make bids on spreading gypsum on their fields to reduce phosphorus loads to surface waters. The parcel-specific bids were ranked based on their load reduction–compensation ratios. To assess load reductions, we built an environmental benefit index (EBI) based on three factors: P-status of the soil (phosphorus available for crops), field slope and location with respect to waterways. As the per tonne price of gypsum delivery from the factory was higher for small quantities, the auction format allowed bundling of field parcels to reduce transportation costs. We evaluate auction's ability to target the environmental (or abatement) measures to field parcels with the highest load reduction potential and analyse the economic efficiency of the auction by comparing the pilot auction with simulated bidding behaviour and with hypothetical <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payment</b> schemes.

40|$|The 2003 {{reform of}} the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{constitutes}} a rather fundamental shift in the agricultural policy of the EU. Many of the individual elements of the reform are likely to affect organic and conventional farms differently. This article analyses the impacts of the 2003 CAP reform on organic farms, combining an extensive survey of organic farmers in several EU member states with a farm modelling approach based on the European Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). The results highlight that impacts on the relative competitiveness of organic farms will depend strongly on the national implementation of the 2003 CAP reform and will often differ by farm type. In general, the impact will be more beneficial to organic farms in countries that have opted for full rather than partial decoupling, and in countries which have implemented the Single Farm Payment {{on the basis of}} regional <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payments</b> rather than on the basis of historical, individual farm references.

30|$|This study {{applied the}} total {{economic}} value approach which economically elicits preferences {{for changes in}} the state of environment in monetary terms. We empirically determined sample size using the formula 2 adopted from Kothari (2004) based on error margin of 5  % to randomly select farmers from 9 out of 12 PES implementing zones to participate in this survey. Inclusion of non-PES practicing farmers, that is the general public in the study, was beyond scope of this study and therefore a gap for future studies. The study also intended to collect and assess data related to PES impact on project objectives of restoring ecological state of degraded farms to sustain ecosystem services including food (for food security) and water quality and quantity flow demanded by private investors to secure commercial investment downstream therefore balancing environmental conservation and economic development. We used two-stage sampling probability proportional to size to stratify the two WRUAs as primary sampling units. Nine study sites (four in Upper Turasha Kinja: Mutamaiyu, Kianguyo, Mutarakwa, and Tulaga and five in Wanjohi WRUA: Geta, Gitei-Gatondo, Kiamboga, Mikeu, and Rayeta) were purposively selected. A total of 200 households were randomly sampled from the initial 476 farmers in two WRUAs who started PES implementation in 2008. Primary data was collected using pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire through face-to-face interview. The questionnaire written in English was administered by local trained enumerators who translated in either Swahili or local dialect for easier response. We targeted the PES-implementing farmers, members of two WRUAs to assess change in their WTA from the current <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payment</b> of annual Kshs. 1700 (USD 17) per farmer.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of two simulated auction models (AM 1, AM 2) {{with that of}} classical payment mechanisms as a marginal <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payment</b> (MFR) and average <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payment</b> (FR). The models follows the one-shot budget constrained auction model first introduced by Latacz-Lohmann and Van Der Hamsvoort (1997), and subsequently by Viaggi et al. (2008) and Glebe (2008). The first model (AM 1) deals with one-dimensional bids and it allows farmers to make an offer about a per hectare agri-environmental payment {{that they would like}} to receive in order to implement a generic agri-environmental measure on their agricultural land. In the second auction model (AM 2) we further extend the analysis, allowing farmers to offer a combination of payment and a measure of their uptake in the agri-environmental program (i. e. a share of their land to commit under the program). Once simulated for AM 1 and AM 2 the optimal bidding behavior of a population of farmer taken from FADN data of E-R 2010 and 2011, assuming a fixed budget level and the sole objective for the public regulator to maximizes farmers participation to the AEM, we analyzed the total payment, the total cost and the total contracted area comparing the result with MFR and FR payment. The results confirm that the auction has the potential to reduce farmers’ information rent when compared with uniform policy instruments. Though the scale of saving depends crucially on auction design hypotheses and farmers' expectation about the maximum acceptable bid cap. The simulation while reflects a number of plausible assumptions, also remains rather simplified and could be improved in further research. However, it can contribute to feed the debate at EU policy level about the role in considering auction design and bidding behaviour so as to limiting the inefficiency related to the actual agri-environmental payments. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how jointness of environmental benefits and environmental heterogeneity affect auction designs {{and the potential}} benefits of green auctions over conventional flat rate agri-environmental policies. A sealed bid green auction is used to promote an agri-environmental program with two environmental targets, nutrient runoff reduction and biodiversity provision. A score index comprising of environmental performance and the monetary size of bid is developed to rank the farmers ’ applications. The green auction is analyzed empirically by using Finnish data. An auction that screens according to the environmental score and another one with an additional cost-saving component are simulated in the context of two different conservation options based on whether enlarged field edges are located in whichever edge of a parcel, providing only biodiversity benefits or are located on the waterfront (buffer strip) providing joint benefits in terms of promoting biodiversity and reducing nitrogen runoff. Empirical results show that independently of whether the auction program supports simple enlargement of field edges or buffer strips, the green auction with the cost saving component has the highest social welfare performance, followed by the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payment,</b> followed in turn by the green auction ranking by environmental score.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} how wetland restoration policies {{could be}} improved through a more careful design, explicitly taking into account asymmetric information. In particular, the paper applies a principal-agent model {{to the design of}} contracts related to wetland restoration measures in Emilia Romagna (Italy). The model searches for the optimal contract design given the social value of wetlands, the opportunity cost of public funds, and the farmers’ compliance costs. We present the results for three different situations: first best, second best with menu of contracts and second best with a flat rate contract. Below a marginal social benefit of wetland of 500 euro/ha, it is not socially worth to restore wetlands. If this value increases, wetland restoration becomes socially profitable. However, high shadow cost of public funds due to the distortionary effect of taxation may still depress the optimal amount of wetlands to be produced. Savings in payments using a menu of contracts may be as high as 15 - 20 % compared to the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payment</b> and social welfare may increase of the same size. The results show that the way in which contracts are implemented in the area can be improved in order to ensure a higher policy efficiency.

40|$|The European Union is {{not able}} to {{maintain}} CAP in its current form any more: radical reform is unavoidable. The recent past review of the CAP (Health Check) may help to reach a healthier CAP, but the proposed changes are not enough to overcome the difficulties. The future CAP meeting certain criteria – such as providing European added value, maintaining sustainability in economic, social and environmental terms – should be based on completely new principles. While defining these new principles and cornerstones of the policy it has {{to be taken into account}} that there is an ongoing paradigm change: there is a shift from the agricultural policy aiming at food self sufficiency and income parity towards a sustainable rural policy with spatial focus. The shift, itself is considered a continuous challenge, too. As an option could be considered a switch from direct payments to a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payment</b> based on public goods and fully decoupled plus complementary subsidies on regional base that is considered indeed to be targeted support for the provision of public goods. Another tool should be aimed at promoting and strengthening the viability of rural economy and society.

40|$|The Fischler {{reform of}} the CAP deepened the {{decoupling}} process of agricultural support started with the 1992 reform, introducing the Single Payment Scheme (SPS). Two models {{could be used to}} apply the SPS: in the historic model payments are based on individual reference amounts; in the regional model payments are based on regional reference amounts. Italy chose to apply the historic model, thus “freezing” the distribution of support to farms at the historic reference level. The recent Proposal on the Health Check of the CAP envisaged Member States being allowed to adjust their model towards a flatter rate of the SPS from 2010, a move that could become compulsory for Member States after 2013. The paper analyses the effects at territorial and farm level of the application of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>payment</b> in Italy as a replacement for the current payment based on the historic farm reference. The analysis makes it possible to assess and quantify the redistribution effects of alternative hypotheses of “regionalization”, highlighting how these effects, at farm and territorial level, are heavily dependent on the land use on the basis of which support was calculated in the reference period, by the criterion utilized to define “region”, as well as the percentage of regionalization chosen. The originality and significance of the work lies in the fact that, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no similar works at farm level are currently available for Italy. The aim of the territorial analysis is to identify the amount of resources to be redistributed across different areas of Italy according to the definition of “region” adopted (administrative Regions, territorial ”macro-regions”, Italy as a whole) and the percentage of regionalization adopted (10 %, 50 %, 100 %). The farm analysis is based on the 2006 Italian sample of FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) that contains, roughly, 14, 000 farms. For each hypothesis the analysis has considered: the distribution of farms by class of the difference between payments (historic and simulated), to highlight the redistribution of support to farms in the “region” considered; the percentage of farms that gain/lose in excess of a certain amount of support; finally, the redistribution effects are also evaluated in terms of crop land uses. The analysis highlights the fact that the larger the “region” the greater are the redistribution effects. Moreover, as expected, these redistribution effects are more pronounced the wider the diversification of crop land uses, and, therefore, the support received in the historic reference period.

The {{government has been}} introducing many strategies to control PE {{since the inception of}} NHI including price adjustment based on the prices of international products or existing products (inter-brands comparison), or market price and volume survey; delegation of financial responsibility to regional bureaux; co-payment for outpatient drugs; generic grouping (the reference pricing scheme based on chemical equivalence); a global budget payment system for clinics and hospitals; and reduction in the <b>flat</b> daily <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> of the drugs for clinics. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of these cost containment strategies on the PE of the NHI programme from 1996 to 2003. Methods: To take the growth and seasonal trends of monthly PE into consideration, Box and Tiao's time-series event intervention analysis based on the Box-Jenkins auto-regressive integrated moving-average model was applied to evaluate the impact of various cost containment strategies on total and subsector (outpatient, inpatient, clinic and hospital sectors) PE. Monthly data of PE of the NHI programme from 1996 to 2003 (the dependent variables) were obtained from the Bureau of the NHI. Drugs prescribed by dentists and Chinese medical doctors at outpatient departments were excluded. Results: After fitting the patterns of time series and controlling for the calendar effect of the Chinese New Year and the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, three strategies (generic grouping, delegation of financial responsibility and reduction of the <b>flat</b> <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> of clinics) were significantly associated with a reduction in PE. However, the hospital global budget strategy offset partial savings from these three strategies. Cumulative savings during the study period were estimated to be $NT 25. 442 billion ($US 0. 80 billion). Of all the strategies, generic grouping was the most effective although it had less effect on the clinic subsector. Neither drug co-payment nor price adjustment based on the international or inter-brand price comparison had significant impacts on PE. Conclusion: Generic grouping, reduction of the <b>flat</b> <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> and delegation of financial responsibility were effective in controlling PE. A global budget alone would be unable to control PE without other direct financial incentives. Neither drug co-payment nor brand-specific price adjustment based on prices of international/existing products had a significant impact on PE.

40|$|Since its {{establishment}} by the Treaty of Rome in 1958, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{has had a}} {{huge impact}} on the agricultural sector in Europe and more widely. The original CAP altered production incentives, distorting input and output markets. The CAP has undergone a number of reforms, most recently the Fischler reform in 2003 which sought to remove the link between production and farm income support payments. Chapter 1 of this thesis offers some background on the Common Agricultural Policy and outlines the thesis. The move to `decoupled 2 ̆ 7 payments, and its impact on land rental markets, is the focus of Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis. In October 2011, the European Commission published proposals for further CAP reform (European Commission, 2011). At the heart of the proposals were reforms {{to the way in which}} Pillar I income support subsidies were distributed (both between Member States and between farmers within each Member State) and the linking of Pillar I direct income supports explicitly with environmental objectives (so-called 2 ̆ 7 greening 2 ̆ 7). Chapter 4 of this thesis explores the impact of changes in the distribution of subsidies upon the farm income inequality in the UK and Ireland. Chapter 5 discusses the findings and limitations of this research and suggests some future directions for research. I next offer abstracts of the three substantive chapters in this thesis. Abstract for Chapter 2 This chapter analyses the impact of the recent decision by the European Union to `decouple 2 ̆ 7 agricultural support payments from agricultural production on Irish farmers 2 ̆ 7 land market decisions. The land market participation decisions of Irish farmers are modelled using dynamic probit models while the extent of participation decisions are modelled using dynamic tobit models. Decoupling does not appear to have dramatically altered farmers 2 ̆ 7 land market decisions. One likely explanation for this is the cross-compliance obligation for farmers to maintain land in a state fit for agricultural production in order to receive their full payments. Abstract for Chapter 3 In this chapter the effect of decoupling on the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into agricultural rents in Ireland is analysed using a dynamic rental equation estimated with a two step system GMM estimator that accounts for expectation error and endogenous regressors. The findings illustrate the importance of institutional details in determining the extent to which subsidies are capitalised. In the period prior to decoupling Pillar 1 subsidies were highly capitalised into Irish agricultural rents in both the short and the long run. Depending on the farm system considered between 67 and 90 cents per euro of subsidies were capitalised into agricultural rents. In the post decoupling period the rate at which Pillar 1 subsidies are capitalised into Irish agricultural rents is found to have declined. This change is likely due to the short term character of the Irish agricultural land rental market, where 11 month rental periods predominate, and the freedom that the 2003 reform of the CAP offered farmers to consolidate entitlements established on rented land. The generally very short term nature of Irish agricultural rental contracts offered farmers an opportunity to consolidate entitlements that is unlikely to have arisen in other Member States with agricultural land rental markets characterised by long term contracts. The results in both the pre and post decoupling periods highlight the high degree of inertia of agricultural rents in Ireland, and the importance of accounting for dynamics when investigating the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into land rents. The high degree of inertia in rents means that the impact of previously capitalised agricultural policy persists through time. Abstract for Chapter 4 The agricultural sector in Europe is heavily dependent on support payments made as part of the Common Agricultural Policy. In 2011, the European Commission published proposals for CAP reform which might lead to the introduction of a basic payment scheme consisting of <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> per hectare <b>payments,</b> possibly determined at a regional rather than national level. This paper explores the role that these payments may play in reducing farm income inequality in the UK and Ireland. <b>Flat</b> <b>rate</b> per farm <b>payments</b> are also considered to explore how a more dramatic reform would reduce inequality. Movement to <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> per hectare <b>payments</b> does not uniformly decrease inequality of Farm Net Value Added (FNVA) in contrast to what one may anticipate a priori, in fact in Scotland the inequality of FNVA increases in this analysis. In contrast, <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> per farm <b>payments</b> reduce inequality substantially. 2017 - 03 - 3...|$|R

3000|$|We {{find that}} cost cap tariffs {{should never be}} chosen over {{pay-per-use}} or <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> plans if consumers are certain about their preferences and consequently in their demand. In this case, the cost cap tariff is always dominated by either the pay-per-use plan or the <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> However, if consumers have uncertainty in their preferences, the cost cap tariff may generate a higher (expected) consumer surplus than a pay-per-use plan or a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> This holds true even though consumers are charged more at the margin than in a pay-per-use tariff and the maximum possible bill amount is higher under a cost cap compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tariff. This is because the cost cap tariff does not only provide cost insurance in case of high demand (like a <b>flat</b> <b>rate),</b> but also cost flexibility in case of low demand (like a pay-per-use tariff). The main research questions that are addressed are (1) under which conditions are cost cap tariffs potentially chosen (over pay-per-use plans and <b>flat</b> <b>rates)?</b> and (2) what {{is the impact of}} demand uncertainty on tariff choice?
