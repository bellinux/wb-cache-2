50|$|A {{change to}} superannuation {{arrangements}} came about through a tripartite {{agreement between the}} government, employers and the trade unions. In the Prices and Incomes Accord of 1983, the trade unions agreed to forgo a national 3% pay increase which would be put into the new superannuation system for all employees in Australia. This was matched by <b>employers</b> <b>contributions.</b> Since its introduction, employers have been required to make compulsory contributions to superannuation on behalf of most of their employees. This contribution was originally set at 3% of the employees' income, and has been gradually increased. Though there is general widespread support for compulsory superannuation today, {{at the time of}} its introduction it was met with strong resistance by small business groups who were fearful of the burden associated with its implementation and its ongoing costs.|$|E
50|$|As of 2013, {{the most}} common {{matching}} program increased to 100% of the first 6%.This program states that once the employee contributes 6% of their gross pay, the <b>employer’s</b> <b>contributions</b> stop until the following year. If the employee contributes less than 6% of their gross income, the employee foregoes additional compensation from the employer available to them had they contributed up to the 6% limit. For example, an employee whose annual gross pay is $50,000 contributes $3,000 (6% of gross pay) would receive a $3,000 <b>employer</b> <b>contribution.</b> If the employee contributed more than $3,000 the employee would not receive additional <b>employer</b> <b>contributions.</b> If the employee only contributed $2,000 (4% of gross pay), they would only receive a $2,000 <b>employer</b> <b>contribution</b> leaving $1,000 of potential <b>employer</b> <b>contribution</b> on the table.|$|R

5000|$|In February 2010, the Pew Center on the States {{identified}} {{four states}} that demonstrate {{different approaches to}} designing and managing retirement systems: Florida, Nebraska, Iowa and Georgia. [...] Florida's method for calculating annual contribution rates incorporates a portion of any unfunded liability into upcoming actuarially required contributions so that the bill is paid off over time. The state has legally mandated that pension surpluses of less than 5 percent of total liabilities will be reserved to pay for unexpected losses in the system -- {{and even if the}} surplus is greater than 5 percent of total liabilities, only a fraction can be used to reduce participating employer contributions. This process allows for a rebate in required employer contributions to the FRS when the fund is more than 100% funded, and mandates <b>employers</b> <b>contributions</b> in excess of normal required contributions to make up any unfunded liability when the fund is less than 100% funded.|$|E

The figure of £143,887 shown in UNISON's financial statements for 2010 was the total cost to the union of employing Prentis for that year - therefore including both the Employers NI costs (£10,003) and the <b>Employers</b> <b>contributions</b> to UNISON's staff pension fund (£32,818) - both contributions to Prentis' pension pots. The £32,818 was an increase of £7899 (31.6%) over the figure of £24,919 made the previous year. However, his basic salary had been cut from £92,688 the previous year to £86,892 (down by £5,796).

40|$|Several {{tools are}} {{routinely}} {{used to predict}} or analyze the impact of employment policies: macroeconometric models, small-scale GE models, ex post evaluations based either on macroeconomic time series or on microeconomic data. We present here a new instrument whose methodology is intermediate between traditional microsimulation and the more recent agent-based approach to economic modelling. The prototype that we have built simulates job creations and destructions, labour force ageing and renewal, the dynamic matching process between jobs and individuals, and a basic process of wage negotiation for insiders. These processes take place under constraints of profitability and global demand by types of goods/skills. The model has been calibrated to reproduce some stylized characteristics of French unemployment and private salaried employment. It is then applied to the simulation of {{a certain number of}} shocks: a demographic shock, a shock on the minimum wage, or changes in employers social security contributions. The model is able to produce results that are comparable to those provided by existing tools, but it has a stronger potential for analysing detailed consequences of employment policies.

The results show that for the interviewed the main causes of unemployment are due to industrial relocations, low growth and high level of wages <b>employers</b> <b>contributions.</b> Diminishing contributions and boosting consumption are then considered as the better ways to improve employment level. Otherwise the mechanisms favouring the return to work of unemployed are well known but also seem to be overestimated. It might come {{from the fact that the}} mechanisms of incentives tend to become a social norm in the public debate about unemployment. Lastly we note that if the absence of diploma reduces the probability for an individual to say that she or he knows correctly the instruments of employment policies, having a high diploma level do not reveal a better effective knowledge of all instruments.

40|$|In {{a context}} in which the social {{politics}} tend to become an optimization instrument for adapting the social security system to the market’s forces, and the talk of some analysts about reinventing the European social model, the partnership between the public sector and the private one in the social domain presumes, besides a tight collaboration, a combination of advantages specific to the private sector, more competitive and efficient, with the ones from the public sector, more responsible toward the society regarding the public money spending. The existence of the private health insurances cannot be tied, causally, to a social politics failure, reason for which they don’t intend, usually, to replace the public insurances, but rather, to offer a complementary alternative for them. In such a context, the public-private partnership’s goal regards both increasing the insurant’s satisfaction and increasing his/her access degree to services, and increasing the investments profitability made by the insurant and insurer. We are facing thus a mixed competitive system that combines the peculiarities of the public and private sectors. Interesting is the fact that, although the different meanings for the quality term may generate some problems regarding implementing quality management in the two health insurance sectors, the experts in the area reckon that establishing a good relationship between public buyers and private providers of healthcare can reduce the costs of public health programs. An essential condition for operating efficiently the partnership model is defining correctly the basic medical services packet financed by the public budget.

30|$|Pension {{reforms have}} been on the agenda in all Member States during the past decade (overview in European Commission 2008, box 2.1). First of all, early exit schemes were closed in the {{majority}} of countries, leading to increasing average age of exit from the labour market. In five countries 4, the average exit age is still below 60 (in 2010), whereas twelve countries have a retirement age of 62 years or above 5. An increase in the statutory retirement age causes different reactions among persons and firms, with the extent to which such a reform increases the employment rate depending on many factors. Hakola and Määttänen (2007) calculated the impact of the pension reform 2005 in Finland on the average labour market exit age. In the reform, there was a restriction in access to early retirement options and an increase in retirement age of two years (also an increase in pension accrual rate and actuarial adjustment factors), which led to an increase of the average labour market exit age by 8.5 months. The increase of the pension age for early exits in Austria by 2.2 years between 2000 and 2006 leads to a decrease in retirement of 25 percentage points among women of the relevant age cohorts and 19 percentage points among men. Employment increased by 10 / 7 percentage points among women/men, although the unemployment rate also significantly increased (+ 11 / 10 percentage points among women/men) (Staubli and Zweimüller 2011). However, for the outsiders, the unemployed older, the reform leads to a decrease in employment probabilities. Empirical findings for the Netherlands suggest that 11 % of all people entering the disability pensions constitute a form of hidden unemployment (1994 – 2003) (Koenig and van Vuuren 2010). To stop this dynamic, new measures among employers and employees have been established. To reduce labour lay-offs, a firm’s firing costs of older workers were increased through increased pension contributions in the case of lay-offs. The employer’s contributions are experience rated. That is, the higher the amount of workers who exit from the labour market and enter disability pensions, the higher the <b>employers</b> <b>contributions</b> are. The introduced system of experience rating in the health and disability insurance reduced the inflows in disability (Hakola and Uusitalo 2005). In Germany, public pension reforms led to an increase of average labour exit age among women from 61.6 to 61.9 and among men 62.1 to 62.6 years within 2006 to 2009. The reason for this is the introduction of the means-tested ‘unemployment benefit II’ in combination with the shortened entitlement period that paved the way for a higher job-search intensity as well as the broader acceptance of fixed-term contracts and agency work. In France, the past reforms increased the employment rate of older workers and persons beyond the retirement age up to 13 %.|$|E
40|$|En plus d'une appréciation générale, l'auteur examine quelques points spécifiques du Livre blanc sur l'assurance-chômage. The {{value of}} the White Paper {{submitted}} by the Honorable MacKasey depends, both absolutely and even relatively, on one's conception of unemployment insurance. The principles and criteria governing private insurance plans (degree of the risk, frequency of the risk, amount of the premiums, etc.) are definitely {{different from those of}} social security. Therefore, an analysis of the White Paper should previously define its author's outlook. First, unemployment insurance is in my opinion a social security concept, purporting to sustain and provide {{for a short period of}} time a minimum income for every worker. In this respect, it should be considered as a segment or an element of the government's social policy. Consequently, its implementation and its financing should not in any case be ruled according to the same principles or criteria as a private insurance. Secondly, unemployment insurance, as a social security scheme as well as any other scheme of that kind should be based on sound economic conditions, that should prevail not only in the different economic regions, but as well in the different industrial sectors. The soundness of the Canadian economy is a sine qua non condition, the foundation of a progressive social security policy. Our conception of social security and ipso facto of unemployment insurance pointing towards a more equitable income redistribution and a guaranteed minimum income for all, commands a policy to sustain the growth of the Canadian economy. So that a progressive social security policy implies a dynamic economic policy. Otherwise, social security might become a too heavy liability on the economy and, as such, it would bring about a lot of problems, without solving any. Third, the unemployed, both seasonal and permanent (in some Québec and Maritime regions) are the victims of unemployment and not the responsible for it, due to their total absence from the economic decisions centers. It is the overall economic conditions that bring about their unacceptable situation ; it is the carelessness of the government authorities which have left different regions of the country in a permanent unemployment situation. It follows that the Canadian population as a whole should bear the social cost of unemployment in conjunction with the employers, the only decision makers at the firms level as well as the industrial sector level. Thus, unemployment insurance should be financed by a general tax levied upon the rate payers and by the contribution of the employers. In this respect, any category of workers would not be excluded from unemployment benefits, but every one would be compelled to contribute to a universal plan. Fourth, and finally, unemployment insurance should be essentially an income maintaining scheme. This last position of the CNTU on unemployment insurance does put the emphasis on the temporary character of unemployment insurance, onits palliative objective, and on the role essentially complementary it has to play. In other words, any unemployment insurance program, however valuable, is a temporary solution to unemployment consequences or aftermaths : the objective is to combat unemployment itself. In general, the White Paper on unemployment insurance is a document of great and sound value. It contains proposals which are by far more than an improvement of the actual program. The White Paper establishes quite a new system in better accordance with the requirements and problems facing all categories of workers in a modem economy. This metamorphosis of the actual program and the very characteristics of the new one proposed by the While Paper, in so far as the legislation to come will be based on adequate administrative regulations will lead Canada to the forefront in matter of unemployment insurance, on condition that government does accept to fill up the gaps and omissions of the new scheme proposer by the White Paper. The extension of the scheme from 80 to 96 % of the labour force (broader coverage), the lower entrance requirements, the higher benefit payments, the provision for people unemployed due to sickness or pregnancy are some among many positive features of the new scheme proposed by the White Paper. It is also interesting to note that the proposals go farther away from the insurance concept at least according to the prevailling conception so far. In effect, the benefits are partly linked to the national and regional economic outlook and the government depending on this outlook accepts explicitely a greater financial responsability towards the unemployed workers. The <b>employers</b> <b>contributions</b> depend also on the lay off experience rating : « The basis for experience rating will be related to the lay off pattern in his establishment and compared to the pattern of all establishments across the country ». This feature will provide an incentive for employers to stabilize their employment patterns as much as possible. The quasi-universalisation of the new scheme will permit a more equitable distribution of the unemployment insurance cost between all the categories of workers instead of keeping the burden on the low income earner likely to be unemployed relatively more often than others. However, the scheme proposed by the White Paper has shown some very serious and deceiving shortcomings. They are of two kinds. First, those which, in spite of the soundness of the proposals, undermine seriously their impact. This category includes : the relative sticking of the proposals to the insurance concept, the regressive rate system for the employees the inadequate and twisted justification of the federal government exclusive competence in matter of unemployment insurance and finally some omissions in the White Paper. The second category includes those problems which the White Paper will bring about if the proposals are not backed up by adequate economic policies. Among the problems to be listed in the second category are the following : the problem of full employment, the 4 % rate as an indication of the necessity for the Federal government to contribute to the plan, the absence of the sectoral dimension, the regressive way to levy the employees contributions and the constitutional aspect...|$|E
