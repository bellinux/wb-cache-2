50|$|Mini-TOSLINK is a {{standardized}} {{optical fiber connector}} smaller than the standard square TOSLINK connector commonly used in larger consumer audio equipment. The plug is almost {{the same size and}} shape as the ubiquitous 3.5 mm stereo minijack. Adapters are available to connect a full-size TOSLINK plug to a mini-TOSLINK socket. Combined 3.5 mm jack and mini-TOSLINK sockets exist which can accept a 3.5 mm jack or a mini-TOSLINK plug; mini-TOSLINK plugs are made 0.5 mm longer than <b>electrical</b> <b>jack</b> plugs so that the latter are too short to touch and damage the LED of combined connectors. Many laptop computer and portable digital audio equipment models, such as the Google Chromecast Audio device and Apple AirPort Express and iPod Hi-Fi, use these connectors that allow for the insertion of 3.5 mm analog (electrical) headphone output or microphone input or mini-TOSLINK digital (optical) output.|$|E
50|$|A {{keystone}} module is {{a standardized}} snap-in package for mounting {{a variety of}} low-voltage <b>electrical</b> <b>jacks</b> or optical connectors into a keystone wall plate, face plate, surface-mount box, or a patch panel.|$|R
50|$|The First to {{manufacture}} high capacity <b>electrical</b> lifting <b>jacks</b> and ticket printing, ticket chopping, ticket slitting and ticket counting machines.|$|R
50|$|Keystone modules have a {{rectangular}} face of 14.5 mm wide by 16.0 mm high and {{are held in}} place with flexible tabs. This allows them to be snapped into a mounting plate with correspondingly-sized rectangular holes, called ports. All keystones, regardless {{of the type of}} jack they carry, are interchangeable and replaceable. This provides much flexibility in arranging and mounting many different types of <b>electrical</b> <b>jacks</b> in one plate or panel without requiring customized manufacturing.|$|R
5000|$|While larger [...] "decorator" [...] style {{switches}} {{are readily}} available in Australia, {{the advantage of the}} smaller mechanisms is that wall-plates are available to mount from one to six individual switch mechanisms, or other correspondingly sized [...] "mechanisms" [...] - such as dimmers and indicator lights - in the same space as one (or two) switches of larger design could be mounted. Since the mechanisms are small, they can also be mounted into [...] "architrave" [...] plates, for mounting in positions where {{it is not possible to}} mount a [...] "standard" [...] sized wall-plate. An example is shown in the picture below on the right. All of the switch mechanisms have no exposed metal parts requiring grounding (earthing). While switches, wall-plates and cover plates from different manufacturers tend not to be interchangeable, switch mechanisms of this type have been available in Australia since 1971. The keystone module system for extra-low voltage <b>electrical</b> <b>jacks</b> (patented in 1995) is somewhat similar in appearance to these modules, but the design of the keystone mountings are different, and keystone modules can be removed without the use of a tool. (A similar system, but with bigger switches, is used in Italy.) ...|$|R
50|$|The 14 {{daughter}} {{companies in}} their majority were either acquired or specially established. Among them are 5 car dealers (makes: Fiat, Iveco, Piaggio, Skoda, MG, Rover), 5 agricultural machinery factories cooperating with Indian Escorts, Swedish Alfa-Laval Agri, Dutch Netagco, and 2 automotive components factories (mechanical car <b>jacks,</b> <b>electrical</b> harnesses, brake & washer fluid reservoirs). Pol-Mot has also acquired some {{real estate in}} cooperation with different partners.|$|R
5000|$|Established by Albert John (Jack) Ryan, an AIF {{veteran and}} former {{signaller}} {{during the first}} World War, Canberra's first commercial radio station - 2CA - began broadcasting with just a small 50 watt transmitter {{from the back of}} <b>Jack's</b> <b>electrical</b> repair shop in the Canberra suburb of Kingston on 14 November 1931. By 1933 the station had increased its transmitter to 500 watts and moved to a small purpose built studio on a low hill close to the Queanbeyan - Canberra road (near what is now the intersection of Hindmarsh Drive and Canberra Avenue). The hill quickly became known as [...] "Radio Hill". By the late 1930s the 2CA studios were moved from Radio Hill to a new building in Mort Street, Canberra City, next to the Civic theatre. The transmitter power was increased again from 500 watts to 2,000 watts and moved to Gungahlin.|$|R

40|$|The Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Simulator is a {{portable}} training aid, or demonstration tool, designed to physically illustrate real-time critical-safety concepts of electrical lockout/tagout. The {{objective is to}} prevent misinterpretations of what is off and what is on during maintenance and repair of complex electrical systems. The simulator is designed {{in the form of}} a hinged box that opens up and stands on its own as an easel for demonstrations. On the outer face of the unit is a simulated circuit breaker box housing the switches. The breakers control the main power to the unit, a light bulb, and an electrical control cabinet. The light bulb is wired so that either of two breakers can provide power to it. When power is sent to the electrical control cabinet, a red indicator light illuminates. Inside the cabinet is the power supply from a personal computer. The power supply produces a 12 -V dc output that is sent over to a small fan next to it, also from a computer, and an amber light on the front of the cabinet illuminates. A separate switch powers the fan on and off. The power supply is behind a plastic shield to protect against exposure to live conductors. <b>Electrical</b> banana <b>jacks</b> are mounted in the plastic shield to allow a voltmeter to be connected safely when opening the cabinet and taking a meter reading to verify de-energization as part of a simulation exercise. This LOTO simulator prototype is designed and fabricated as an all-in-one unit. All accessories can be stored inside the hinged case, and there is a handle on top for ease of transport. The circuit breaker labels attach with hook and loop fasteners so that they may be moved and changed to fit the training or demonstration scenario. The warning signs and labels on the electrical control box are magnetic, allowing for easy reconfiguration to emulate different equipment setups. A specially designed magnetic cover was made to disguise the indicator lights for demonstrations when these indicators are not used. The cover is disguised as an arc flash safety label that would typically be found on such a cabinet. One indicator light has a separate switch that can take it offline. This is to allow for demonstration to trainees on why it is important not to completely rely on indicator lights, but that they should always take a meter reading at the exposed conductors to absolutely verify de-energization before exposure. A clear plastic barrier and banana jacks inside the cabinet provide a safe way to plug in a voltmeter for demonstrations without exposure to the hazards of energized equipment. A small remote control unit is wired into the fan circuit. The remote allows the demonstrator to turn the fan on and off, provided that all of the breakers and switches leading to it are configured on as well. The remote feature was added in order to demonstrate the importance of starting the lockout/tagout task with energized equipment, then powering it down, isolating it, and locking it out to ensure that the correct breakers have been locked out...|$|R
