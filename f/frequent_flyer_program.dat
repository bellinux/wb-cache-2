5|$|In September, SAS {{announced}} that if Braathens {{took the first}} step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air {{announced that}} they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ã…lesund from four to two. The load factor in August was 43%, and management stated that 50% load would not be sufficient to make money. In particular, the company stated that while aircraft were full during the weekends, the company was not succeeding at garnering the necessary business ridership to fill up the planes during the weekdays. To become more attractive, the company changed its fares to two classes: Business Full Flex and Saver No Flex. The company also stated that to attract more business travelers, it was looking for an international partner to conduct codesharing on international routes, and perhaps also introduce a <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> <b>program</b> alone or in cooperation with the partner.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of DNL. It also applied, {{though the}} sister company Braathens Helikopter, for {{concessions}} for helicopter services from Stavanger to offshore oil platforms. As a reaction, the incumbent, Helikopter Service, applied for Braathens SAFEs West Coast routes. At this point, SAS bought 15% of Helikopter Service. In 1984, Braathens SAFE introduced services to Farsund Airport, using wet leased F-27s from Busy Bee. The same arrangement {{was used to}} connect Haugesund to Bergen and Stavanger. In Haugesund, this was in competition with Norving. Busy Bee-operated planes were also used on routes from Sandefjord in competition with Norsk Flytjeneste. The same year, the cabin crew had a 14-day strike, halting all flights. It {{was caused by the}} company paying lower wages than SAS and Busy Bee. In 1985, a new booking system was introduced, that allowed overbooking. This gave increased revenue, but the company had to start compensating rejected passengers with a full refund and a free seat on the next flight. On 16 December 1985, the airline's administration moved into the a new building, the Diamond, located at Fornebu. The <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> <b>program</b> Bracard was launched in September 1985.
