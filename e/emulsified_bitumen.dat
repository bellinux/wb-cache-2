This area is west of Kenaston and will assist tourism traffic to Lake Diefenbaker resorts. [...] The 19.3 km area south of the Highway 15 junction to Stronfield was used for a test section to develop a framework for highway management. This area has an increase in truck traffic from the potato industry, as well as increase in grain hauling to the Loreburn inland grain terminal. average annual daily traffic AADT was 500 vehicles, of these 11% is due to commercial ventures. Besides economic interest recreations sites are in the area.Construction issues on Highway 19 involve a silty to heavy clay soil type {{in a rural area}} with a traffic load of full loaded trucks and semi trailers. 8000 km of road experienced rutting and pavement failure prior to 2003.27 highway improvement projects include granular spot improvements north of Chaplin for 9.2 km on Highway 19 [...] Experimental strengthening techniques were undertaken which used a rotomix of the existing asphalt oil surface and mulched flax straw. This procedure underwent a series of tests examining whether an increase of the subgrade tensile strength occurred. This experiment was undertaken 100 km south of Saskatoon for three test sections of provincial Highway 19 near Strongfield since 1999 Saskatchewan Highway 19 has a thin membrane surface (TMS) which has been subject to test studies of various cost-effective methods of road strengthening. Systems include granular soil strengthening and applications of different cement products, lime, various grades of fly ash, geotextiles, geogrids, natural and manufactured fibers, <b>emulsified</b> <b>bitumen,</b> tall oil, lignin, foamed bitumen, and synthetic ionic and cationic chemicals.|$|E

The effects of the silicon and silica fine powder additives on the compressive strength of Si 3 N 4 -SiC-C refractory composites were studied. The results indicated that adding an appropriate ratio range of silicon or silica fine powder in the composites both can improve the compressive strength of the material...|$|E
40|$|Bitumen is an {{important}} organic liquid in the nature. The main characteristics which are highly viscous, black, sticky make bitumen are the suitable to use in paving road. This is a major application for bitumen otherwise also use as an intermediate product for roof surfacing, waterproof boats and others. By <b>emulsifying</b> process, <b>bitumen</b> emulsion was creating to reduce the viscosity and get lower temperature for spraying or mixing purposes. But in bitumen emulsion industries, packaging maintenance is a major problem. High cost in packaging because of only drum and large tank is suitable to use for commercialized. For this research, the problem will be solving by converting bitumen emulsion to bitumen powder. Silicon dioxide {{was used as an}} additive to produce bitumen powder from bitumen emulsion. The trade name of silicon dioxide is SIPERNAT an is use as a powdering agent for manufacturing fine-particle powders with good dispersion characteristics In previous invention silicon dioxide is used as a additive to convert liquid bitumen to powder To remove the water from bitumen emulsion drying method was applied by using spray dryer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} mechanistic-empirical structural design models (transfer functions) for foamed bitumen and <b>emulsified</b> <b>bitumen</b> treated materials. The models are developed from HVS and laboratory test data from four HVS test sites. The transfer functions account for the two-phase behaviour of these materials; the stiffness reduction phase (Phase 1) and the accumulation of permanent deformation (Phase 2). In Phase 1 (stiffness reduction phase), the high initial resilient {{modulus of the material}} decreases to a constant modulus representative to that of the parent material. Justification for these distress modes is provided. The procedures used to develop the transfer functions and incremental changes to these procedures are described. Three sets of transfer functions are presented, and their limitations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study bitumen is {{replaced}} by bitumen emulsion {{for the construction of}} flexible pavement. The conventional method of road construction involves the burning of bitumen which produces toxic gases which degrades the environment. In colder region it is difficult to maintain the paving temperature of hot mix. To overcome these problems and conserve the energy bitumen emulsion is considered as good option. Likewise emulsion can be used in the areas having higher rate of rainfall where the hot mix plant is closed most of the time because of rain. <b>Emulsified</b> <b>bitumen</b> can be used during rainy season and colder regions. To study the suitability of emulsion Marshal Test is carried out to find the stability value, flow value and optimum binder content. Experiments performed shows that bitumen emulsion (Cold Mix) have high stability value therefore it can be used as binder...|$|E
40|$|In a {{political}} contest in which {{energy and environmental}} stakes become increasingly strong, road engineering evolve to saving energy and environmentally friendly practices. Cold mixes treated with bitumen emulsion appear as suitable techniques. Cold mix design and manufacture are empirical and usually controlled thanks to local competences. However, in order to set performance-based mix and pavement design methodologies, {{it is necessary to}} assess the cold bituminous mixes in situ behaviour, as during their early life, they behave as no treated gravel, and evolve with time and traffic to bitumen bound materials. A research program is started at LCPC with collaboration of the French Road And Bridges Regional Laboratories to answer this waiting. A first experimental worksite has been carried out in October 2006 on the French departmental road network with a cold bituminous mix treated with <b>emulsified</b> <b>bitumen</b> such as gravel-emulsion used in structural pavement layer. Mechanical and physical evolution of the gravel emulsion is evaluated by mean of temperature probes, inner water content measurements, strain measurements through gauge included during the laying process as well as ex situ monitoring survey such as deflectograph. In this paper, jobsite methodology probes used and instrumental implementation are described. Data collected from this in site monitoring follow-up are also discussed...|$|E

After two experimental sections in 2006 and in 2008, a third experimental section was constructed in 2008 on the French departmental road network, in the frame of a research collaboration between LCPC and the French Union of Road contractors (USIRF) to provide fully documented data. A cold bituminous mix treated with <b>emulsified</b> <b>bitumen</b> (grave-emulsion) was used as a structural pavement layer. Mechanical and physical evolution of the grave-emulsion is evaluated by means of temperature probes, water content measurements, strain measurements through gauges and optical fibres inlaid during the laying process as well as ex situ monitoring survey such as deflexion, density and rutting measurements. In this paper, the methodology, the probes used and the instrumental implementation are described. Data collected from this in situ monitoring are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Hot water {{extraction}} of bitumen from Alberta oil sands generates {{large quantities of}} tailings slurry. The fine grained sludge component of this waste is the most troublesome because of its stability and poor compaction potential. Dispersed bitumen, and organic matter that is insoluble in common solvents (IOM), {{are associated with the}} fines contained in these clay slimes. This organic matter is believed to be partly responsible for the intractability of the sludge, and it could therefore {{play an important role in}} determining the behavioural characteristics of oil sands slimes. In this investigation the settling behaviour of the sludge was studied after removal of <b>emulsified</b> <b>bitumen</b> by an oil phase agglomeration technique. After partial removal of bitumen the sludge was fractionated into settling and non-settling fractions. The insoluble organic matter associated with the clay lines present in the non-settling portion of sludge was concentrated by dissolving the mineral matter in HCl/HF. These fractions were analysed using elemental analysis and solid state 93 C n. m. r. spectroscopy. The elemental analyses were discussed in terms of a van Krevelen diagram by plotting H/C atomic ratios against O/C atomic ratios. N. m. r. data were used to calculate the aromaticities of the various organic fractions. Based on the n. m. r. data, it is suggested that the IOM associated with sludge solids is derived from the parent oil sand feed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
