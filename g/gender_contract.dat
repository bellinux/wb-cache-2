Women's role in subsistence farming in Africa has mostly been analyzed {{through the lens}} of gender division of labor. In addition to this, we used the concept of ‘local gender contract’ to analyze cultural and material preconditions shaping gender-specific tasks in agricultural production, and consequently, men's and women's different strategies for adapting to climate variability. We show that the introduction of cash crops, as a trigger for negotiating women's and men's roles in the agricultural production, results in a process of <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> renegotiation, and that families engaged in cash cropping {{are in the process of}} shifting from a ‘local resource contract’ to a ‘household income contract. ’ Based on our analysis, we argue that a transformation of the local <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> will have a direct impact on the community's adaptive capacity climate variability. It is, therefore, important to take the negotiation of local gender contracts into account in assessments of farming communities' adaptive capacity...|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we examine debates {{related to the}} sexual and <b>gender</b> <b>contract,</b> and {{reproductive}} bargains. We look at how useful these concepts are to understand the historical balkanisation of the labour market and the way families organise different work-care arrangements. We consider how the consequences of austerity will impact on attempts to implement greater gender equality. We argue that progress in gender equality has gone {{hand in hand with}} a continued balkanization of gender contracts within and between countries reflecting societal and class specific legacies of the integration of women into paid work. These balkanized trajectories, evident before the crisis, are likely to become more entrenched as job opportunities diminish, and unless a more radical policy agenda to address these is implemented.

40|$|This thesis explores women’s {{access to}} {{property}} in Kenya. It {{consists of three}} parts. The first gives the Kenyan background, the theoretical and methodological approach. The second presents the findings {{in relation to the}} social construct of the gender and elaborates them in the contexts of women´s subsistence work, colonization and its aftermath and women´s formation of organizations. The third part consists of the conclusions, which include a model of change in gender relations at the micro-level. This is a feminist work situated in the field of women and housing and using <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> theory. It uses data gathered from empirical surveys carried out using random household sample surveys and in depth interviews in three case study settings in Kenya in 1990 - 1992. The settings were selected in peasant, plantation and urban poor areas. Data from secondary sources are also used to build up a picture of changing gender contracts in the processes of colonization and urbanization. The problem examined is how women in Kenya get access to property, meaning land and housing. Specifically, the social mechanisms that govern men’s and women’s relationships {{to each other and to}} property are investigated and the processes through which these relationships change. The <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> – the set of invisible agreements found in every society about how men and women should behave – is identified as the social mechanism, and two are found to be operating in Kenya, the subsistence <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> and the market <b>gender</b> <b>contract.</b> According to both, women cannot inherit property. Also, women are responsible for providing their families’ subsistence, including the provision of water, fuel, food and building materials where these are obtained from natural resources. According to the market <b>gender</b> <b>contract,</b> women may buy property while men control property which they inherit as free capital. The Kenyan gender contracts delineate a power relationship in which women’s lack of access to property keeps them in a subordinate position to men and requires them to provide subsistence. Women see the provision of subsistence as a basic human value although many resent their lack of property rights. A model is presented showing how micro level change takes place by means of women’s responses to the situations in which they find themselves. Women’s actions are based on their strategies for improving their lives. Collective action is one strategy with important implications for housing. It is concluded that a gendered housing policy is needed which recognizes women’s access to property as a basic human right and which builds upon their proven housing production capability. It should support the values and objectives of women’s groups, namely the provision of subsistence to their families...|$|E

40|$|The author aims {{to explain}} the {{differences}} between European countries {{in the proportion of}} women working part-time and, more generally, to develop a theoretical approach for cross-national comparison of women's employment patterns. The concepts of a 'gender contract' and of the 'family and integration model' are used. It becomes clear that, in Germany, part-time work has been an important means for the modernisation of the <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> concerning the family and integration model during the tertiarisation process. In Finland, where a family model based on partnership dominates, the sociocultural and institutional basis for this form of employment is almost entirely lacking. Tertiarisation did not lead to an expansion of part-time employment. It is argued that sociohistorical factors related to the industrialisation process are highly significant in the explanation of these differences. It is possible to distinguish ideal-typically two different models of the development of the industrial society, in which those factors are shaped and combined in a characteristic way. These different models lead to different types of <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> and different chracteristic patterns of labour force behaviour, by women, in the transition to a service society. ...|$|E
40|$|In der vergleichenden Wohlfahrtsstaatsforschung werden sowohl policy {{outcomes}} als auch Regimetypen in Verbindung mit unterschiedlichen Graden der 'Koordination' erklaert. Diese Forschungsperspektive beschraenkt sich dabei in Anlehnung an die klassische politische Oekonomie weitgehend auf die Beziehungen zwischen Staat und Markt, wobei die Reproduktionssphaere als uniform und stabil vorausgesetzt wird. Die spezifische Forschung zum Reproduktionsbereich, i. e. zur Frauenerwerbsbeteiligung, vernachlaessigt dagegen die Steuerungsperspektive. Dies begruendet die im ersten Teil des Papiers vertretene These, dass die Koordination der Reproduktionssphaere einen 'blinden Fleck' in der vergleichende Wohlfahrtsstaatsforschung darstellt. Im zweiten Teil schliessen sich daher Fragen nach der spezifischen Steuerungsproblematik bzw. den spezifischen Koordinationsformen im Reproduktionsbereich an, wobei primaer der Fokus auf die Steuerung familialer Erwerbsmuster gerichtet ist. Dem <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> als gesellschaftspolitischem Leitbild wird dabei generell eine politikfelduebergreifende Koordinationsfunktion zugeschrieben. Im Laendervergleich wird gezeigt, dass der <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> als Leitbild fuer ein egalitaeres Modell in Daenemark tatsaechlich die verschiedenen Politikfelder wie auch die individuellen Praeferenzen der Paare 'koordiniert'. In Deutschland zeigt sich dagegen die Erosion der Koordinationsfunktion des Leitbildes des 'maennlichen Ernaehrermodells'. Ausgehend von der fehlenden Koordination werden negative Effekte in Bezug auf Arbeitslosigkeit, Armut und Geburtenraten angenommen. Dies unterstuetzt das Plaedoyer, den Fokus der 'Koordination' in der vergleichenden Wohlfahrtsstaatsforschung auf die Reproduktionssphaere auszudehnen.

Research an the sphere of reproduction, i. e. an female employment participation, neglects the steering perspective. This gives reason for the argument, {{that there is a}} 'blind spot' in welfare state research concerning 'coordination' of the sphere of reproduction. In the second part therefore questions are asked about the steering conditions and particular forms of coordination in the sphere of reproduction, focusing particularly an the steering of family employment patterns.

Gender relations are an integral aspect of social relations in all societies, yet the literature onhow gender influences climate adaptation is limited.

The aim {{of the study is}} to explore how cultural attributes and power relations of genderinfluence adaptive capacity in relation to climate change among smallholder farmers inwestern Kenya. Furthermore this study contributes to resilience thinking by using the lens ofpost-structural feminist political ecology and the concept of <b>gender</b> <b>contracts,</b> whichhighlights the influence of power laden gender discourses and the construction andreconstruction of such contracts. The study is triangulated by the use of qualitative methodsand draws upon 12 semi-structured interviews, 4 focus group discussions and 4 expertinterviews. Gendered power relations were primarily a constraint to the adaptive capacity of women,restricting their possibilities to pursue a number of coping and adaptation strategies, which inturn affected the resilience of the household. Capacity building and farmer group formationpromoted by a Swedish NGO (ViAFP) resulted in altered power relations, renegotiated andreconstructed <b>gender</b> <b>contracts</b> which increased adaptive capacity and adaptation opportunitiesfor both men and women, although particularly for women because of their initial vulnerableposition.

Questions that the study asks are if the librarians experience that norm critical notions are expressed in the meeting with the user, if the book recommendation as a social practice can strengthen and/or challenge norms and if the library as a room, what it contains and how it is structured, can affect the book recommendation as a social practice where norms are constructed or questioned. The study conducts interviews with six librarians who work with children’s literature, and parts of the interviews were done while walking through the children’s section at the participants libraries to respond to the question about how the room affects the book recommendation as a social practice. The theoretical framework that has been used consists of Connell’s theory about masculinity and Hirdman’s theory about the gender system and its <b>gender</b> <b>contract.</b> The results of the study shows that norms about gender are constructed in the book recommendation meeting with the library user, as experienced by the librarian, and it exists a <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> at the library that contributes to reproduce a distinction between boys and girls.

During this 80 -year period, the development of centralized settlements and regional urban areas brought increasing professionalization of traditional economic activities and greater involvement of the indigenous population in civil service work.

The thesis has a qualitative and hermeneutic approach, with semi-structured interviews with key persons from the planning processes, and site observations and interviews with men and women using the hubs as the main data gathering methods. In the planning processes for the two cases the ambition was to create hubs that were welcoming for everyone, from a theoretical point of view this ambition could be dangerous from a gender perspective since a planning for everyone often leads to a planning for the man. In order to create hubs for everyone there was a focus for creating safety and increase accessibility for the disabled during the planning processes. The observations and the interviews on site shows that the hubs {{could be viewed as}} gender equal since the hubs were open to both men and women to use, but the hubs could also be viewed as not gender equal since women felt unsafe. The analysis shows that the social interaction on site is a crucial factor when defining a place as gender equal or not.

In feminist epistemology women’s historical and social experience is a necessary premise to the interpretation of social dynamics. However, the proposition of its own internal heterogeneity implies an admission of partiality and relative sidedness of the assumption which, while trying to assert itself, cannot but distance itself from any anthropology of identity or politics of truth, following a deconstructive method. These considerations show the meaning of meta-narration in contemporary feminist epistemology: it is closely concerned with the domination-freedom relationship, which is nowadays the individual’s dilemma par excellence.

To deal with the low birth rate reforms and programs were founded both in order to help the women but also in order to support the inadequate motherhood. Government grants were set up to start the so-called vacation home for housewives where the government’s visions of the vacation homes were active rest and recreation.      Based on the Leisure Inquiry report regarding vacation homes for housewives - {{the purpose of this paper}} is to examine how the government visions regarding vacation homes for housewives were practiced and how the future of prevailing <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> affected the holiday home. What activities and what form of education occurred on the vacation home Frykenstrand? Who visited the vacation home and how was Frykenstrand affected by egalitarianism and the state's growing need for labor?      Archive material from the Association of Värmland working women vacation homes have been used for the essay. According to the issues of this essay, the vacation home Frykenstrand is described through text analysis and quantitative method based on protocols, applications, guest books and correspondence. The state’s visions with the vacation homes are based upon the Leisure Inquiry report.      The survey shows that the state's visions regarding giving women rest and recovery were met. The intentions regarding education and training cannot be considered to be met on the vacation home Frykenstrand, nor was the vacation home used by women who might have helped increasing the birth rate. The vacation home was abolished probably affected by the <b>gender</b> <b>contract</b> when more women started work and received a statutory vacation...|$|E
40|$|Part-time work in Japan, as {{in other}} countries, is {{increasing}} {{as a form of}} paid work. There are however significant differences developing out of Japan’s <b>gender</b> <b>contract.</b> Employers have created a gendered employment strategy which has been supported by governments, through social welfare policies and legislation, and the mainstream enterprise union movement which has supported categorisations of part-time workers as ‘auxilliary ’ despite their importance at the workplace. An analysis of one national supermarket chain indicates that part-time work as it is constructed in Japan does not challenge the gendered division of labour but seeks to lock women into the secondary labour market. Part-time work is increasing in significance as a form of paid work in Japan. This affects women particularly, who according to official statistics represent 72 per cent of the part-tim...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{starts off}} by briefly {{considering}} {{some of the}} problems of future studies; it discusses how the origins and principles of the systems of regulation and security have generated different employment systems in Europe. The concept of employment systems allows us to identify how the future of work may well be managed in different ways according to the capacity and constraints of national and European actors. The paper focuses on the characteristics and changes in European regulatory systems of labour and social welfare. Two key developments are identified in these areas. First there are trends to decentralise collective bargaining and to encourage a trade off between labour flexibility and employment security. Second, there have been trends towards a decentralisation and outsourcing of state monopolies and attempts to develop new forms of caring. The prospects these trends imply for regulating the work of the future are discussed in relation {{to the development of a}} new social and <b>gender</b> <b>contract.</b> " (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|Basing {{our work}} on the {{literature}} on psychology that highlights differences in confidence levels between men and women, we provide a rationale for the simultaneous existence of the two dimensions of the gender wage gap: (i) on average, men earn more than women and (ii) the difference in wages depends on the gender structure. We also argue that although an equal compensation policy does not eliminate the gender wage gap, it nonetheless increases social welfare. Finally, endogenizing the choice of task by agents, we show how women, in a vast majority, can self-select on low paying jobs. Bias <b>Gender</b> Optimal <b>contract</b> Wage gap...|$|R
40|$|This {{book was}} first {{published}} in 1988, and was abstracted as 88 V/ 2292. The revised and expanded edition retains the same building blocks designed to explore household decision-making in a social context. Key topics are efficiency, risk, time allocation, <b>gender,</b> agrarian <b>contracts,</b> farm size and technical change. For these and other topics household economic behaviour represents the outcome of the social interactions within the household, and market interactions outside the household. A new chapter on the environment combines exposition of economic tools not previously covered in the book with examination of household and community decision-making in relation to environmental resources. -Publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although the Farce {{is filled}} with {{marketplace}} scenes which present merchants and craftspeople engaged in everyday activities, little {{work has been done}} on the commercial elements of this bourgeois genre. This thesis studies the language and customs of the marketplace, in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the frequent commercial humour seen in the Farce.;Chapter 1 discusses the thematic importance of money and monetary systems for the Farce, and provides a basis for an understanding of commercial activity in the following chapters. Chapter 2 examines the English manuals of French conversation, which are a rich source for the study of commercial language and customs. The second part of this chapter contains a generalized bargain scene, extrapolated from the manuals of conversation, to facilitate an understanding of bargaining humour in the plays.;The commercial patterns established in Chapters 1 and 2 are useful for an analysis of farces structured around mercantile trickery, such as La Farce de Pathelin and its sequel Le Nouveau Pathelin, examined in Chapters 3 and 4. This analysis demonstrates the cultural weight given to reputation and identity in these and other farces.;Commercial customs are again studied in Chapter 5, where they are related to customs of betrothal. As a mark of autonomous consent, these gifts and ritual actions have thematic importance in the Farce, and are particularly useful in understanding the amorous, or adulterous, contract, as well as the marriage bargain. <b>Gender</b> <b>contracts</b> are frequent in these plays, and are formed in an atmosphere of relative equality...|$|R
