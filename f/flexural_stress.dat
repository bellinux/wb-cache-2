PLLA and the nanocomposites were synthesized by ring opening polymerization of the cyclic dimer of lactic acid (lactide), using tin(II) 2 -ethylhexanoate (stannous octanoate) as catalyst. PLLA nanocomposites containing two different fillers concentrations (1 [*]wt% and 2 [*]wt%) were produced. Compared to PLLA, almost all the nanocomposites exhibited an enhancement on thermal resistance.

40|$|Tilt-up {{construction}} {{is becoming more}} popular in the United States due to its ease of construction, reliability, and relatively low construction and maintenance costs. In its most typical form, a concrete panel is cast on the ground. After the concrete sets and has reached a prescribed compressive or flexural strength, a crane lifts the panel {{off the ground and}} hoists it into place. The <b>flexural</b> <b>stresses</b> during liftoff are often times greater than those corresponding to service loads. Concentrations of high shear stress and the associated punching shear {{in the vicinity of the}} pick points could result in pullout. For these reasons, it is particularly important to design the concrete and steel reinforcement to handle the <b>flexural</b> and shear <b>stresses</b> associated with panel erection.

40|$|Many {{structures}} are often prone to bending loads, which {{can result in}} serious damage. Therefore, for structural integrity, structures must be efficient to resist bending. <b>Flexural</b> loading causes <b>stresses</b> in the composites, which vary through the thickness. These <b>flexural</b> <b>stresses</b> are the maximum at the outer surfaces and zero in the middle at the neutral axis. In pure bending, the composite failure initiates on either the tensile or compressive side depending upon whether the composite is stronger in compression or tension respectively. The stress in an individual ply depends upon the stiffness of that ply and its distance from the laminate’s neutral axis. By including, one or more extra components having relatively better elastic properties in the laminate can help in improving the flexural properties of the composite.

40|$|Solid {{state power}} modules are {{subjected}} to harsh environmental and operational loads. Identifying the potential design weakness and dominant failure mechanisms associated with the application is very critical to designing such power modules. Failure of the wedge-bonded wires {{is one of the}} most commonly identified causes of failures in power modules. This can occur when wires flex in response to a thermal cycling load. Since the heel of the wire is already weakened due to the ultrasonic bonding process, the flexing motion is enough to initiate a crack in the heel of the wire. Owing to the prevalence of this failure mechanism in power modules, a generalized first-order physics-of-failure based model has been developed to quantify these flexural/bending stresses. A variational calculus approach has been employed to determine the minimum energy wire profiles. The difference in curvatures corresponding to the wire profiles before and after thermal cycling provide the <b>flexural</b> <b>stresses.</b> The stresses/strains determined from the load transformation model are then used in a damage model to determine the cycles to failure. The model has been validated against temperature cycling test results. The effects of residual stresses, that are introduced during the loop formation, (on the thermal cycling life) of these wires also has been studied. It is believed that the ultrasonic wirebonding process renders the wires weaker at the heel. Efforts have been made to simulate the wirebonding mechanism using Finite element analysis. The key parameters that influence the wirebonding process are identified. <b>Flexural</b> <b>stresses</b> are determined for various heel cross-sectional profiles that correspond to different bond forces. Additional design constraints may prevent some of the wedge-bonded wires from being aligned parallel to the bond pads.

The renewable resources that have been analysed are palm oil and sawdust and the post curing techniques are conventionally and with a microwave. Increasing pressure from environmental groups and the government have encouraged companies to investigate using renewable resources in all areas of their industry. This project investigates the relationships which renewable resources produce as a result of different amounts and sizes of fillers and additives. The three point loading test was used to measure the flexural properties, the Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) testing machine tested the thermal properties and the microscope was used to analyse the level of adhesion between fillers and epoxy. The results indicated that the plasticizing effect of the palm oil reduced the <b>flexural</b> <b>stress</b> and flexural modulus of the samples, while the strain increased with increasing amounts of palm oil. The <b>flexural</b> <b>stress</b> and flexural strain decreased with the increasing size of the sawdust particles, although the size of the sawdust particles had a minimal effect on the flexural modulus. The amount of sawdust added marginally reduced the peak <b>flexural</b> <b>stress</b> of the samples, and the strain and flexural modulus was not affected by increasing amounts of sawdust. The amount and size of sawdust particles, as well as amount of palm oil does not affect the thermal properties of the epoxy composite. The only significant difference between samples is the affect the post curing technique: conventional post cured samples exhibited a higher glass transition temperature. In terms of flexural and thermal properties, natural fillers and additives represent an alternative to traditional fillers and additives, although there is a large amount of study {{that can be done to}} further improve the results.
