5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, <b>high</b> <b>friction,</b> surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E

40|$|The {{friction}} coefficient of rubber sliding against {{different types of}} flooring materials of different surface roughness was investigated under different sliding conditions: dry, water, water/detergent dilution, oil, water/oil dilution. The flooring materials are parquet, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), epoxy, marble, cement and ceramic. Surface roughness variations do take place by continuous rubbing during the life time of the flooring. Based on the experiments, it was found out that at dry sliding, {{friction coefficient}} decreased with increasing surface roughness. Epoxy displayed relatively <b>higher</b> <b>friction</b> than parquet and PVC, while cement tiles gave the <b>highest</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient. Ceramic showed relatively lower friction values than marble and cement. In the presence {{of water on the}} sliding surface, friction coefficient slightly increased up to maximum then decreased with increasing surface roughness. Parquet displayed the <b>highest</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient followed by PVC and epoxy. At higher roughness marble tiles gave the <b>highest</b> <b>friction.</b> Ceramic showed the lowest friction among the tested floorings. Sliding of rubber against water/detergent wetted tiles caused drastic decrease of friction coefficient. Parquet displayed the <b>highest</b> <b>friction</b> values followed by cement and marble. PVC, epoxy and ceramic represented relatively lower friction values. At oil lubricated sliding of flooring materials, friction coefficient slightly increased up to maximum then decreased with increasing surface roughness of the flooring materials. Hard floorings such as marble and ceramic showed friction increase with increasing surface roughness. Parquet and cement tiles showed the relatively <b>highest</b> <b>friction.</b> Finally, sliding of rubber against water/oil dilution wetted floorings caused significant decrease in friction coefficient. Parquet and cement tiles still displayed the <b>highest</b> <b>friction...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were known}} for their poor pitch handling characteristics. The famous aerodynamicist Irv Culver told Albatross owner Jeff Byard that the problem came from three sources. First, the rotation axis of the all flying horizontal tail was located at 35% chord instead of slightly {{in front of the}} aerodynamic center at 25% chord. [...] Second, the horizontal tail rotation hinge had <b>high</b> <b>friction.</b> Third, the relatively soft pitch axis cable control system stored elastic energy reacting the friction in the tail hinge. As the pilot tried to input pitch controls into the unstable tail, the friction of the tailplane hinge prevented initial movement which then stored up energy in the control cables. The pilot then applied more force to get the desired reaction. Eventually, the <b>high</b> <b>friction</b> would break loose and the horizontal tail would move much farther than desired due to the higher than necessary force applied by the pilot and releasing the force in the control cables. The resulting over control often resulting in PIO and when near the ground would likely damage the aircraft. [...] Culver instructed the owner to move the hinge axis forward to 24.5%, add a downspring to the pitch control, and liberally lubricate the hinge axis before each flight to reduce friction. According to Byard, the plane flies significantly better with the improvements.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a sliding friction model for an electro-deposited coating. Reciprocating sliding tests using ball-on-flat plate test apparatus are performed to determine an {{evolution of the}} kinetic friction coefficient. The evolution of the friction coefficient is classified into the initial running-in period, steady-state sliding, and transition to <b>higher</b> <b>friction.</b> The friction coefficient during the initial running-in period and steady-state sliding is expressed as a simple linear function. The friction coefficient in the transition to <b>higher</b> <b>friction</b> is described with a mathematical model derived from Kachanov-type damage law. The model parameters are then estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. It is identified that estimated friction coefficients obtained by MCMC approach are in good agreement with measured ones...|$|R
