This was done to attempt describing ageing in terms of varying electronic properties of the cells, such as <b>doping</b> density or <b>profile,</b> and to correlate this with the observed evolution of the main cell parameters (η, Jsc, V oc, FF). Some cells show an increase in efficiency after ageing, others a decrease. This different behaviour was attributed to a different evolution of the <b>doping</b> <b>profiles</b> upon ageing.

5000|$|Capacitance-voltage {{profiling}} (or C-V profiling, sometimes CV profiling) is {{a technique}} for characterizing semiconductor materials and devices. The applied voltage is varied, and the capacitance is measured and plotted {{as a function of}} voltage. The technique uses a metal-semiconductor junction (Schottky barrier) or a p-n junction or a MOSFET to create a depletion region, a region which is empty of conducting electrons and holes, but may contain ionized donors and electrically active defects or traps. The depletion region with its ionized charges inside behaves like a capacitor. By varying the voltage applied to the junction it is possible to vary the depletion width. The dependence of the depletion width upon the applied voltage provides information on the semiconductor's internal characteristics, such as its <b>doping</b> <b>profile</b> and electrically active defect densities., Measurements may be done at DC, or using both DC and a small-signal AC signal (the conductance method, [...] ), or using a large-signal transient voltage.|$|E
50|$|The emitter-base {{junction}} of a bipolar NPN transistor behaves as a Zener diode, with {{breakdown voltage at}} about 6.8 V for common bipolar processes and about 10 V for lightly doped base regions in BiCMOS processes. Older processes with poor control of doping characteristics had the variation of Zener voltage up to ±1 V, newer processes using ion implantation can achieve no more than ±0.25 V. The NPN transistor structure can be employed as a surface Zener diode, with collector and emitter connected together as its cathode and base region as anode. In this approach the base <b>doping</b> <b>profile</b> usually narrows towards the surface, creating a region with intensified electric field where the avalanche breakdown occurs. The hot carriers produced by acceleration in the intense field sometime shoot into the oxide layer above the junction and become trapped there. The accumulation of trapped charges can then cause 'Zener walkout', a corresponding change of the Zener voltage of the junction. The same effect {{can be achieved by}} radiation damage.|$|E
