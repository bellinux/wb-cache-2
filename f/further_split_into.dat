25|$|Before {{the time}} that ion-exchange methods and elution were available, the {{separation}} of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallisation. In those days, the first separation was into two main groups, the cerium-group earths (scandium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium) and the yttrium-group earths (yttrium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium). Europium, gadolinium, and terbium were either considered as a separate group of rare-earth elements (the terbium group), or europium was included in the cerium group, and gadolinium and terbium were included in the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare-earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are difficultly soluble, those of the terbium group slightly, and those of the yttrium group are very soluble. Sometimes, the yttrium group was <b>further</b> <b>split</b> <b>into</b> the erbium group (dysprosium, holmium, erbium, and thulium) and the ytterbium group (ytterbium and lutetium), but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups.|$|E

By the 16th century it was largely confined to Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran and the Malabar Coast of India (Kerala).

As expected, we observe the splitting of the angular-momentum states following the Fock-Darwin scheme, but we also observe that each state <b>further</b> <b>splits</b> <b>into</b> a doublet which shows an unexpected evolution with increasing magnetic field. This behavior cannot be explained by a simple Zeeman spin splitting but is rather consistent with the observation of spin-orbit coupling where the spin of electrons is coupled with the envelope function orbital angular momentum. We show that the addition of this type of spin-orbit coupling to the single-particle Fock-Darwin model can account for the observed dependence. By comparison of our data with such a model, we derive a spin-orbit intensity of [(3. 9 ¬± 0. 3) √ó 10 ‚àí 9 eV cm] 2...|$|R
