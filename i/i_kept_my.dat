25|$|<b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> {{money in}} a 'grouch bag'. This was a small chamois bag that actors used to wear around their neck to keep other hungry actors from {{pinching}} their dough. Naturally, you're going to think that's where I got my name from. But that's not so. Grouch bags were worn on manly chests long {{before there was a}} Groucho.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

I {{came from}} America at a moment's notice; I left my husband {{without even a}} word of farewell; I entered upon a hateful task, and though {{to think of it}} now makes me loathe myself--I succeeded. <b>I</b> have <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> vows, <b>I</b> have done my duty. Be generous now, and let me go." ...|$|R
500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson clinched his fifth pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 31.049. He was joined on the grid's front row by Scott Speed. Marcos Ambrose qualified third, Martin took fourth and Stewart started fifth. Harvick, Newman, Greg Biffle, Bill Elliott and Bowyer completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Kurt Busch, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twelfth, while Jeff Gordon set the twentieth fastest time. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Dave Blaney, Mike Skinner, Max Papis and David Stremme. After the qualifier Johnson said, [...] "I had a talk with myself to do what I could today and don't freak out if it's not as good as what Mark [...] ran. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> emotions in check and drove the car with the right touch and feel, and that comes from being relaxed, so it went well." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] finished eighteenth {{in the ratings}} for the week of February 6 to February 12, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 14.9. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Entertainment Weeklys Dalton Ross said the episode was both touching and humorous. He added that in the scene where Bart runs a videotape in slow motion to show Lisa how [...] "you can actually pin-point the second when [...] heart rips in half", the audience does not really know [...] "whether you're shedding tears of laughter, empathy, or bothâ€”you just know that it's damn good any way you slice it." [...] The Arizona Republics Bill Goodykoontz named the episode one of his five favorites and highlighted Ralph's line [...] "and my doctor said I wouldn't have so many nosebleeds if <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> finger out of there" [...] {{as one of the}} best lines in the history of the show. In a review of The Simpsons season four, Lyndsey Shinoda of Video Store cited [...] "Brother from the Same Planet" [...] and [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] among her [...] "personal favorites" [...] from the season.|$|E
2500|$|She told {{press in}} London that her latest album will reflect her {{emotional}} state and chronicle events in {{her personal life}} since her last musical release in 2002. She said [...] "That makes it real. The changes that we go through, the transitions that we go through, the tests that we go through, being a mother, becoming a single mother. It all had its ups and its downs, {{but for the most}} part, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> faith and <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> head up... I took my time. All the triumphs and the ups and downs and stuff, it's all incorporated on the album, and hopefully not only does it inspire me, but inspires a whole lot of other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foo Fighters {{frontman}} Dave Grohl {{joined the}} grunge group Nirvana as its drummer in 1990. During tours, {{he took a}} guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs {{from the rest of}} the band; he said in 1997, [...] "I was in awe of , and [...] intimidated. I thought it was best that <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> songs to myself." [...] Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos and covers of songs he liked and even issued a cassette of some of those songs called Pocketwatch under the pseudonym [...] "Late!" [...] in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|Evel Knievel {{took great}} pride in his core values. Throughout his career and later life he would {{repeatedly}} talk {{about the importance of}} [...] "keeping his word". He stated that although he knew he may not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would. Prior to the canyon jump, Knievel stated, [...] "If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon. You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.' Do me a favor. Tell him that you saw me here and regardless of what I was, that you knew me, and that <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes,' he says, 'but if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> eye skinned {{there would}} 've been. All those fellows had bombs in their pockets. They're reg'lar anarchists.' ...|$|R

2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E
2500|$|Kirby Smith {{pleaded with}} Bragg {{to follow up}} on his success: [...] "For God's sake, General, let us fight Buell here." [...] Bragg replied, [...] "I will do it, sir," [...] but then {{displaying}} what one observer called [...] "a perplexity and vacillation which had now become simply appalling to Smith, to Hardee, and to Polk," [...] he ordered his army to retreat through the Cumberland Gap to Knoxville. Bragg referred to his retreat as a withdrawal, the successful culmination of a giant raid. He had multiple reasons for withdrawing. Disheartening news had arrived from northern Mississippi that Earl Van Dorn and Sterling Price had been defeated at Corinth, just as Robert E. Lee had failed in his Maryland Campaign. He saw that his army had not much to gain from a further, isolated victory, whereas a defeat might cost not only the bountiful food and supplies yet collected, but also his army. He wrote to his wife, [...] "With the whole southwest thus in the enemy's possession, my crime would have been unpardonable had <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> noble little army to be ice-bound in the northern clime, without tents or shoes, and obliged to forage daily for bread, etc." [...] He was quickly called to Richmond to explain to Jefferson Davis the charges brought by his officers about how he had conducted his campaign, demanding that he be replaced as head of the army. Although Davis decided to leave the general in command, Bragg's relationship with his subordinates would be severely damaged. Upon rejoining the army, he ordered a movement to Murfreesboro, Tennessee.|$|E
