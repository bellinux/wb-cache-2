5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun for Hire (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E

25|$|He {{says that}} these ideas may converge, {{but since they}} may as well not, it is {{unacceptable}} to exclude any definitions only {{on the basis that}} they do not satisfy the standards of taxonomical validity, like e.g. evaluative definitions which nevertheless can be useful <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>way.</b> Besides discussing the issue of wrapper definitions in general, Shusterman has also criticized particular definitions of that kind invented by George Dickie and Arthur Danto.|$|E
40|$|The German-Jewish {{philosophers}} Hermann Cohen and Franz Rosenzweig, have - both <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>ways</b> - produced {{systems of}} philosophy {{at a time}} {{that was supposed to be}} the time after systems.

These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Quaker {{memorial}} {{services are}} held {{as a form}} of worship and are known as memorial meetings. Friends gather for worship and offer remembrances about the deceased. In some Quaker religious traditions, the coffin or ashes are not present. Memorial meetings may be held many weeks after the death, which can enable wider attendance, and can also replace grief with spiritual reflection, and celebration of life to dominate. Memorial meetings can last over an hour, particularly if many people attend. Memorial services give everyone a chance to remember the lost individual <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> comforting those present, and re-affirming the love {{of the people in the}} wider community.|$|E
