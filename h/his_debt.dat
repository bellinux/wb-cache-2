Before he died, Conn arranged for his grandson Thomas Smythe to continue the Foundation after his death.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} become a chauffeur in order to earn more money, but is pulled over when {{he does not have}} a chauffeur's license. When he goes to the DMV with Marge to apply for one, Patty and Selma are his evaluators. The two mercilessly fail his driving and written test. The two light up {{cigarettes}} and are spotted by their supervisor, who informs them that smoking on the job is an offense which could cost them both their promotions. After being persuaded by Marge, Homer reluctantly covers for them by claiming the cigarettes as his own, thus clearing <b>his</b> <b>debt</b> to Patty and Selma.|$|E
5|$|Sledd's {{advocacy}} {{of social change}} and an evolving understanding of biblical texts came at a high personal price. Given his chosen career of minister and professor, he never accumulated much personal wealth. Sledd died deep in debt, having lost the family home to foreclosure after the salaries of Candler professors were cut when financial support of the school fell during the Great Depression in the 1930s. His creditors obtained a deficiency judgment for the unpaid portion of <b>his</b> <b>debt</b> after the foreclosure and, following his death, forced the sale {{of some of his}} furniture and parts of his personal library in partial satisfaction of his remaining debts.|$|E

5|$|Tacitus' major {{historical}} works, including The Histories and Agricola's biography, {{were all}} written and published under Domitian's successors Nerva (96–98) and Trajan (98–117). Unfortunately, {{the part of}} Tacitus' Histories dealing with {{the reign of the}} Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five books, and the short but highly negative characterization in Agricola in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits <b>his</b> <b>debt</b> to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.|$|E
5|$|Word {{of mouth}} {{has it that}} an {{individual}} would have <b>his</b> <b>debt</b> paid when a third person or group would offer to pay it off if the bankrupt person undergoes the corda, serving as public entertainment. Those condemned to death often were subjected to endure torture and later hanged outside Valletta, in the whereabouts of the Bastion of St. Jacob. According to , the historian of the Order, amid {{the last three days}} of the Maltese carnival the locals used to recite a Roman tradition at the Castellany by dangling a stone above the pillory (instead of a human) and hit it which symbolised a temporal halt of punishment during those days.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in <b>his</b> <b>debt,</b> and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakar's {{relationship}} with the ruler of Muar, Sultan Ali was strained. Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali asserting Johor's sovereignty over Segamat, which Sultan Ali had hoped to exert political influence over. In addition, Sultan Ali, who had borrowed a large sum from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties in repaying <b>his</b> <b>debt,</b> Sultan Ali asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali's monthly pension to the moneylender; but he alternated asking for payment to himself and to the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government, Sultan Ali tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to sign an agreement to terminate Sultan Ali's pension at the agreement of Abu Bakar and Governor.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} as a footballer, Wills turned to umpiring and committee work, {{and despite his}} continued slide into debt, donated money and trophies for football competitions. He served as Geelong's vice-president from 1873 to 1876, {{and was one of}} three delegates appointed by the club after the 1877 formation of the Victorian Football Association (VFA), but was dropped soon after for unknown reasons. During the 1878 VFA season, he acted as central umpire, and defended his adjudication of a June match between Carlton and Albert Park in what would be his last public letter. That year, Wills, broke and hounded by creditors, began selling land in Geelong to help clear <b>his</b> <b>debt,</b> and moved with Barbor to South Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, when Macdonald was 15, {{the family}} moved to the town of Port Hood, Cape Breton. Macdonald {{attended}} the Port Hood Academy. He hoped to enroll next in the Bachelor of Arts program at St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, but his family couldn't afford to pay for a university education so Macdonald obtained a teaching licence and taught for two years to finance his education. Midway through his university studies, he took another year off to earn money teaching. He completed his final term on credit and was required to teach in the university's high school during 1914–15 to pay off <b>his</b> <b>debt.</b> Macdonald did well at St. FX. He played rugby, joined the debating team, edited the student newspaper and, in his graduating year, won the gold medal in seven of his eight courses. He was also class valedictorian.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Ali {{delegated}} {{the administrative}} affairs of Muar to the Raja Temenggung of Muar (also {{known by the}} title of Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar) {{and spent most of}} his time in Malacca. Muar was sparsely populated in 1855 and had a population of 800 and no formal structure of government was formed. In 1860, Sultan Ali reportedly borrowed $53,600 from a Chettiar money lender, Kavana Chana Shellapah. Sultan Ali signed an agreement with Shellapah to contribute a portion of his monthly allowance to repay <b>his</b> <b>debt.</b> However, Sultan Ali found himself unable to settle his debts in time, and an angry Shellapah wrote to the British government in 1866. Pressured to liquidate his debts in time, Sultan Ali granted Shellapah the right to trade off Muar to the Temenggong of Johor as mortgage if he is unable to pay off his debts in time.|$|E
5|$|The agents authorize Jones {{to recover}} the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the {{headpiece}} is {{in the possession of}} Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but when Jones returns to the bar to fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees the tavern screaming. Indy and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Indy in his search for the Ark so he can repay <b>his</b> <b>debt</b> to her.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbald lived until 757 {{and carried}} Mercian {{power to a}} new height. <b>His</b> <b>debt</b> to Crowland was not forgotten: soon after his {{accession}} he richly endowed a new church on the site where Guthlac had lived as a hermit. The first Life of Guthlac, written by the monk Felix, appeared soon after Guthlac's death. Nothing is known about Felix, although Bertram Colgrave has observed {{that he was a}} good scholar who evidently had access to works by Bede and Aldhelm, to a Life of Saint Fursey and Latin works by Saint Jerome, Saint Athanasius and Gregory the Great. Felix was either an East Anglian or was living in the kingdom when he wrote the book, which was written at the request of Ælfwald. In the Life, Felix portrays Æthelbald's exile at Crowland and asserts Ælfwald's right to rule in East Anglia. Two Old English verse versions of the Life drawn on the work of Felix were written, which show the vigour of vernacular heroic and elegiac modes in Ælfwald's kingdom.|$|E
