5000|$|The decree {{establishing}} the NMA applied the 40-40-20 principal {{defined by the}} United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). This meant that 40 of cargo should be allocated to ships from the importer, 40% to ships from the exporter and 20% subject to open competition, which may include ships from other countries. For non-conference and bulk cargoes it went further, sharing on a 50-50 basis, with the NMA having authority to allocate all export cargoes.Despite this ruling, in practice the oil extraction companies supplied their own tankers to transport most of the crude to their refineries abroad. However, members of the American-West African Shipping Conference {{said they had been}} arbitrarily denied shipments by the NMA, an issue raised several times by the United States government.In 1988 the NMA announced that it would be setting up <b>freight</b> <b>booking</b> <b>offices</b> in Liverpool, London, Hamburg, Paris, Tokyo, New York and Brazil. Dr. Bassey U. Ekong, Director General of the NMA, said the centers would record all inbound Nigerian cargos and would ensure [...] "full implementations of UNCTAD's 40-40-20 principle". In the end, none of the offices opened.|$|R
