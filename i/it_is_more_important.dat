25|$|Nick Bostrom {{has argued}} that from a {{utilitarian}} perspective, space colonization should be a chief goal as it would enable a very large population to live {{for a very long}} period of time (possibly billions of years), which would produce an enormous amount of utility (or happiness). He claims that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to reduce existential risks to increase the probability of eventual colonization than to accelerate technological development so that space colonization could happen sooner. In his paper, he assumes that the created lives will have positive ethical value despite the problem of suffering.|$|E
25|$|Transcortical aphasias include transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory aphasia, {{and mixed}} transcortical aphasia. Patients with transcortical motor aphasia {{typically}} have intact comprehension {{and awareness of}} their errors, but poor word finding and speech production. Patients with transcortical sensory and mixed transcortical aphasia have poor comprehension and unawareness of their errors. Despite poor comprehension and more severe deficits in some transcortical aphasias, small {{studies have indicated that}} full recovery is possible for all types of transcortical aphasia.

25|$|Any {{aircraft}} rudder {{is subject}} to considerable forces that determine its position via a force or torque balance equation. In extreme cases these forces can lead to loss of rudder control or even destruction of the rudder, as on American Airlines Flight 587 (the same principles also apply to water vessels, of course, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> for aircraft because they have lower engineering margins). Maximum rudder deflection is controlled by rudder travel limiter. The largest achievable angle of a rudder in flight is called its blowdown limit; it is achieved when the force from the air or blowdown equals the maximum available hydraulic pressure.|$|E

25|$|The enzyme is {{also thought}} {{to act as}} a safety valve for stress {{conditions}} in the photosynthetic apparatus. By providing an electron sink when the plastoquinone pool is over-reduced, the oxidase is thought to protect photosystem II from oxidative damage. Knockouts for Rubisco and photosystem II complexes, which would experience more photodamage than normal, exhibit an upregulation of plastid terminal oxidase. This effect is not universal because it requires plants to have additional PTOX regulation mechanisms. While many studies agree with the stress-protective role of the enzyme, one study showed that overexpression of PTOX increases the production of reactive oxygen species and causes more photodamage than normal. This finding suggests that an efficient antioxidant system is required for the oxidase to function as a safety valve for stress conditions and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> during chloroplast biogenesis than in the regular functioning of the chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of active}} sonar by a {{submarine}} to determine bearing is extremely rare {{and will not}} necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team. However, use of active sonar on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to determine {{the position of a}} hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy). Active sonar is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable.|$|E
25|$|Kamui's {{decisions}} reflects one of X main themes {{which is}} {{caring for the}} humans even if does not help the Earth. While Ohkawa considers it common sense that people care about protecting the planet, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> loving friends and relatives. Ohkawa also applied to Kamui and Fuma ideas she had during middle school such {{as the fact that}} both possess a dual nature as she states people can be considered good or evil. As a result of Kamui losing Kotori and all his relatives, Ohkawa placed emphasis on Kamui's friendship with Fuuma as she believes his feelings have become stronger. Across the manga, Kamui meets Subaru Sumeragi whose rivalry with Seishiro Sakurazuka serves as parallel to Kamui's rivalry with Fuma Monou. Clamp referred to Kamui and Subaru as siblings; Kamui is supposed to learn from their Subaru's final fight with Seishiro and avoid his final fight against Fuuma have the same tragic conclusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{recovery}} {{swings the}} arms sideways {{across the water}} surface to the front, with the elbows straight. The arms should be swung forward {{from the end of}} the underwater movement, the extension of the triceps in combination with the butterfly kick will allow the arm to be brought forwards relaxed yet quickly. In contrast to the front crawl recovery, this arm recovery is a ballistic shot. The only other way of lifting the arms and the shoulders out of the water is by dropping one's hip. Therefore, the recovery, at least the acceleration of the arms, is in no way relaxed. It is important not to enter the water too early, because this would generate extra resistance as the arms moved forward in the water against the swimming direction, however, during longer distances, this cannot be avoided, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to avoid dropping one's hips. A high elbow recovery, as in front crawl, would be disadvantageous because of the natural undulations that are partially caused by the recovery and the relaxed movement caused by the momentum of a triceps extension. Limitations of the shoulder movement in the human body make such a motion unlikely. Hands should enter into the water again at 11 and one with thumbs entering first and pinkie last.|$|E
25|$|The {{baseball}} behaves {{differently in}} those stadiums with artificial turf as well. Artificial surfaces are harder and more uniform than grass, {{and the ball}} tends to roll farther and straighter, and to bounce truer and more highly on these fields. Teams built to play {{the majority of their}} games on this field tend to place a higher premium on defence (since it is more likely to get an infield out) and speed (since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to be able to beat out a throw) than on power hitting. The altitude of the stadium (most notably Coors Field) can also impact the distance a batted ball travels and the amount of ball movement a pitcher can generate with his deliveries, although recently balls have begun being placed in humidors at high-altitude parks to negate these effects. The amount of moisture in the dirt on the basepaths can also affect the behaviour of ground balls and the ease with which players may steal bases; some teams are known to alter the amount of watering done to the dirt depending on the skills of the home and visiting team. The amount of foul territory is also an important variable, since foul pop-ups that would be outs in some parks (e.g. the Oakland Coliseum) may end up in the stands in other parks, thereby allowing the batter to remain at the plate (e.g. Fenway Park and Coors Field). On the whole, though, these variations do not produce effects as great as variations in cricket pitches, with one arguable exception being Coors Field.|$|E

500|$|Besides {{the great}} trilogy, Clement's only other extant {{work is the}} {{treatise}} Salvation for the Rich, also known as Who is the Rich Man who is Saved? Having begun with a scathing criticism of the corrupting effects of money and misguided servile attitudes towards the wealthy, Clement discusses the implications of [...] The rich are either unconvinced {{by the promise of}} eternal life, or unaware of the conflict between the possession of material and spiritual wealth, and the good Christian has a duty to guide them towards a better life through the Gospel. Jesus' words are not to be taken literally — we should seek the supercelestial [...] meaning in which the true route to salvation is revealed. The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, {{as long as it is}} used charitably, but men should be careful not to let their wealth dominate their spirit. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich man is to be saved, all he must do is to follow the two commandments, and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of our neighbor.|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} Rose set sail, things were {{complicated}} {{again when the}} Crown decided to place a minder on board named John Knepp [...] "to look after the King's interest". Knepp {{seems to have been}} a purser. In the English Navy, the purser acted as a sort of Company Store, tempting sailors far from shore with whiskey, tobacco and other desirables by offering them credit against their wages, (collected through the captain). [...] It was a lucrative post and required an investment to procure, hence it usually went to young Naval clerks and scions who could afford the capital outlay. It seems like a terrible idea to place a purser on a voyage like that of the Rose, on a shoestring budget, with the men receiving no wages and collectively buying and sharing food together. [...] (Knepp brought great quantities of fancy cheese and brandy, with predictable results). But either way, the purser was dependent on good relations with the captain, yet Knepp seems to have looked down on Phips and decided to be forward in introducing himself to the crew of HMS Rose while Phips was absent in London. The reception was rather less than friendly: [...] "... then most of them began to curse the ship and wished she had been afire before they saw her and that they had better have hired a ship of merchants..."The crew were a salty bunch to say the least, a [...] "rum lot" [...] as Peter Earle calls them, and this final last-minute bait-and-switch, after the previous addition of Randolph, seems to have nearly put them over the edge. Everything we know about the crew comes from a detailed journal of the trip to Boston was kept by Knepp and he has rightly been called a [...] "hostile observer" [...] but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to note that he was often ignorant of the complex, dual nature of the voyage, as well as basic colonial politics, if not some important elements of human nature. [...] Distant historians must grope for any available source to shed light on events of the past, and so history tends to be swayed heavily by the writers. Phips was never a writer and so much of his story comes from others, with Knepp's Journal at the top of this pile. Like the rest of us, Knepp does not seem to have understood the role Phips was intended to play, either in support of Randolph, or as a possible decoy and cleanup for the Falcon & Bonetta. In Knepp's first interaction, he says that he is seeking signatures between the crew and the King though the July 13 agreement (see image) would more accurately be portrayed as between Phips and the crew, as the first mate protests. [...] Knepp's job seemed to be to seek additional signatures from the crew, which is easily done when Phips returns to the ship, with Randolph acting as a witness. Next Knepp complained to Phips about the firing of the ships cannons to set the watch. By the time the ship set sail the next day, Phips and Knepp were distinctly at odds, as Knepp records when asked for a cabin or berth and was told he would have to make do sleeping on a trunk. This was an unfortunate turn of events for both of them, as well as the historian who would prefer to have Knepp at the Captain's table recording the dinner conversation between Randolph, his brother, and Phips. Class friction surely played a strong role in the conflict between Knepp and Phips. Knepp consistently presents himself as a victim and there are many times he is bullied and badly mistreated, but it also seems that he must have set himself above, and thought of himself as being of a higher class than Phips. The articles of agreement testify to the trust that the king and Narborough placed in Phips, and the crew seemed willing to do as Phips commanded, but Knepp acts as if he is not beholden to Phips. Knepp's journal is addressed to Narborough (and Haddock) and it reads like a sycophant's strong gambit for a future promotion. He presents Phips as the trope of a tarpaulin captain—every sailor his comrade, questionable literacy level—and so it is probably safe to infer that Knepp was of the gentleman class and likely some years younger than Phips, perhaps in his mid-twenties. [...] Knepp is excellent at taking coordinates and seems trained in piloting, but does not exhibit the a breadth of experience or knowledge of the rigging. [...] Though he records every perceived misstep by Phips, his careful plotting of the journey also shows the great ability Phips possessed as a sailor, crossing the Atlantic in half the time of another ship that they meet, and making first landfall at Cape Ann.|$|E
