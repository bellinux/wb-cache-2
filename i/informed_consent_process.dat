40|$|<b>Informed</b> <b>consent</b> is {{essential}} in ethical health care practice. Information and advice regarding choices is a precondition of <b>informed</b> <b>consent.</b> Autonomy, truthfulness and ethical decision making are all relevant to the <b>informed</b> choice and <b>consent</b> <b>process.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is firstly to discuss these topics. Following this, a case of <b>informed</b> choice and <b>consent</b> for cervical spine manipulation is examined.

40|$|<b>Informed</b> <b>consent</b> to {{biomedical}} research {{in developing countries}} is a highly topical issue. When <b>consent</b> forms and <b>processes</b> are simply borrowed from developed countries, obtaining genuine <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> becomes extremely challenging.

The paper goes on to discuss the effect of social, cultural, and economic factors identified by the intervention in a particular context and demonstrates how knowledge of these influences helped to develop a socially relevant and practical <b>consent</b> <b>process</b> prior to conducting a programme of community-based genetic research. The paper concludes that this intervention is an effective and economical means by which to ensure the efficacy and ethical integrity of <b>consent</b> <b>processes</b> when recruiting participants to new research sites, even within countries with which researchers are already acquainted...|$|R
5000|$|The PI is {{responsible}} for the conduct of the trial, however, [...] "it has been said that the CRC is {{the heart and soul of}} the research study and that, ultimately, it is the CRC who carries forward the research goals, thereby playing a significant role in the success of the research study. Most importantly, CRCs are often involved in essential duties that have been traditionally performed by the PI, such as conducting the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>process</b> and ensuring compliance with the protocol." [...] The CRC's primary responsibility, as with all clinical research professionals, is the protection of human subjects, but the CRC has many other responsibilities. Although not inclusive, some of the CRC responsibilities include preparing the Institutional Review Board submission, writing the informed consent document, working with the institutional official in contract negotiations, developing a detailed cost analysis, negotiating the budget with the Sponsor (i.e., pharmaceutical company or granting agency), subject recruitment, patient care, adverse event reporting, preparing the case report form (CRF), submitting CRFs and other data to the Sponsor as necessary and study close-out.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{settlement}} pattern and isolation of the province's population, Newfoundland has [...] "big clusters" [...] of certain genetic conditions, making it a focus of research in genetics. In 1998, one such [...] "cluster" [...] emerged {{in the community of}} Grand Falls, where a number of people were found to have ARVD and some died of the condition. A group of researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine arrived in Newfoundland to study the community. The group collected blood samples from community members in order to test for a particular biomarker indicating a genetic predisposition to the condition. However, study participants voiced concerns about the way the study was conducted, suggesting that the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>process</b> had been rushed or even skipped, or that potential participants had been made to feel they might die if they did not take part. They also objected to not being given the results of the study: [...] "the Baylor Research team should know who is at risk of those people they tested, of having the condition and those who do not...That information has not been made available to the families".

5000|$|As {{the medical}} {{guidelines}} {{established in the}} Nuremberg Code were imported into the ethical guidelines for the social sciences, informed consent became a common part of the research procedure. However, while informed consent is the default in medical settings, {{it is not always}} required in the social science. Here, research often involves low or no risk for participants, unlike in many medical experiments. Second, the mere knowledge that they participate in a study can cause people to alter their behavior, as in the Hawthorne Effect: [...] "In the typical lab experiment, subjects enter an environment in which they are keenly aware that their behavior is being monitored, recorded, and subsequently scrutinized."In such cases, seeking informed consent directly interferes with the ability to conduct the research, because the very act of revealing that a study is being conducted is likely to alter the behavior studied. List exemplifies the potential dilemma that can result: [...] "if one were interested in exploring whether, and to what extent, race or gender influences the prices that buyers pay for used cars, {{it would be difficult to}} measure accurately the degree of discrimination among used car dealers who know that they are taking part in an experiment." [...] In cases where such interference is likely, and after careful consideration, a researcher may forgo the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>process.</b> This is commonly done after weighting the risk to study participants versus the benefit to society and whether participants are present in the study out of their own wish and treated fairly. Researchers often consult with an ethics committee or institutional review board to render a decision.|$|E

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> is basically a crucial paradigm in medical decision-making. Ethical dilemmas are to be met at each and every stage when obtaining the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> in pediatric oncology; this doctrine seems to apply particularly in case of children and teenagers, who lack the decisional capacity or the legal empowerment to give their <b>informed</b> <b>consent.</b> Debates related {{to the rights of}} the child have lately taken a different direction with the spreading acceptance by national and international law of the fact that children also benefit from most of human rights. In pediatric oncology particularly, where patients and their families have to face several decisions during the illness, the importance of the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> as a continuous process is to be recognized, during which obtaining the signature is nothing but a phase. Two factors at least particularize the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> in pediatrics First, many conversations and decisions take place primarily between clinicians and parents, with an increasing involvement of children according to their development capabilities. Secondly, patients cared for within the context of clinical trials is increasing.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} patients' perceptions {{and expectations of}} their families' participation in the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>process</b> of elective surgery. Methods: This is a survey study. Anonymous questionnaires that were mailed to potential participants included a demographic data sheet and a scale, measuring patients' perceptions {{of themselves and their}} families' participation level in the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>process.</b> A convenience sample of patients who had undergone surgery and had been discharged within 4 months from a medical center in southern Taiwan (n =  1, 737) were recruited. Results: One hundred and forty-five recipients replied, gaining a response rate of 10. 0 %, and 120 provided complete data. The mean age of the participants was 56. 0 years (range 20 – 85, SD =  14. 98), and more than half were female (54. 2 %). Twenty-one participants (17. 5 %) perceived having less family participation than their own participation in the surgery <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>process,</b> and 40 % expected more family participation in the process. The mean scores of the self-rated participation level was significantly higher than that of the families (p <. 001). Patients' expectations of family participation were significantly higher than their perceptions of family participation (p <. 001). Eleven patients (9. 2 %) reported having more family participation than they expected. Participants received the most information about the disease during the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>process</b> and the least information about alternatives to surgery. Age, gender, number of previous surgeries and admissions influenced the study participants' perceived level of participation in the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>process.</b> Conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrates that patients' perceptions and expectations for family participation in the surgical <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>process</b> vary.

40|$|<b>Informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>processes</b> are a vital {{component}} of {{both human and}} veterinary medicine. Current practice encourages veterinarians to learn from insights in the human medical field {{about how best to}} achieve valid consent. However, drawing on published literature in veterinary and medical ethics, this paper identifies considerable differences between the purposes of veterinary and human medical consent. Crucially, it is argued that the legal status of animal patients as ‘property’ has implications for the ethical role of veterinary <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> and the protection of the animal ‘patient’. It is suggested that veterinary <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> should be viewed as an ethical pivot point where the multiple responsibilities of a veterinary professional converge. In practice, balancing these responsibilities creates considerable ethical challenges. As an example, the paper discusses the renewed call for UK veterinarians to make animal welfare their first priority; we predict that this imperative may increasingly cause veterinary <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> to become an ethical pressure point due to tensions caused by the often conflicting interests of animals, owners and the veterinary profession. In conclusion, the paper argues that whilst gaining <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> can often be presented as a robust ethical justification in human medicine, the same cannot be said in veterinary medicine. If the veterinary profession wish to prioritise animal welfare, there is an urgent need to re-evaluate the nature of authority gained through owner <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> and to consider whether animal patients might need to be better protected outside the <b>consent</b> <b>process</b> in certain circumstances...|$|R

The findings point to the centrality of trust and elements of mistrust in general community views, in parents' (mis) understanding of studies they consent their children to be involved in, in refusals and concerns, and in community members' views about whether <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> is a relevant and practical model to follow. Tentative ideas on how trust and a healthy mistrust might be balanced highlight the importance of strengthening communication surrounding basic health care as well as research, and of fostering 'an inner generated ethic of service'.

40|$|Written {{behavioral}} agreements (WBAs) {{are gaining}} popularity {{as part of}} the effort to manage the alarming increase in prescription drug abuse. The rationale for increased use of WBAs in managing patients with chronic pain is that they are believed to increase adherence to agreed-upon behaviors, reduce addiction to or diversion of prescription drugs, and satisfy <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> requirements. However, there are no high-quality data to support their widespread use in any of these areas. The evidence used to support the use of WBAs is insufficient to justify their unfairness and the high risk of harm they pose to the doctor-patient relationship. Instead, we contend that WBAs are being used to provide leverage for severing relationships with some of our most challenging patients. We propose that physicians treating patients for chronic pain abandon the use of WBAs.

We compared <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> using a tablet computer to a paper approach to assess comprehension and satisfaction of patients and clinic staff for a future osteoporosis clinical trial. Methods: Nine community-based practices identified and recruited patients to compare the <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>processes</b> (tablet vs. paper) in a mock osteoporosis clinical trial. The tablet <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> included an animation summarizing the trial, complete <b>informed</b> <b>consent</b> document, and questions to assess and reinforce comprehension of the study.
