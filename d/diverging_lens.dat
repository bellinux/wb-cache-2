5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a <b>diverging</b> <b>lens</b> (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E

Lenses are characterized by their focal length: a converging lens has positive focal length, while a <b>diverging</b> <b>lens</b> has negative focal length. Smaller focal length indicates that the lens has a stronger converging or diverging effect. The focal length of a simple lens in air is given by the lensmaker's equation.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{power of}} {{corrective}} lenses {{is measured in}} diopters, a value equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres; with a positive focal length corresponding to a converging lens and a negative focal length corresponding to a <b>diverging</b> <b>lens.</b> For lenses that correct for astigmatism as well, three numbers are given: one for the spherical power, one for the cylindrical power, {{and one for the}} angle of orientation of the astigmatism.|$|E

25|$|The {{focal length}} f is {{positive}} for converging lenses, and negative for <b>diverging</b> <b>lenses.</b> The reciprocal of the focal length, 1/f, is the optical {{power of the}} lens. If the focal length is in metres, this gives the optical power in dioptres (inverse metres).|$|R

The performance of the lenses was proved by interferometrical measurements of wavefront aberrations. Applications of gradient-index lenses to the fast-axis-collimation (FAC) of high-power lasef diodes and in endoscopic systems are discussed...|$|R
25|$|All {{of these}} {{conditions}} can be corrected using corrective lenses. For presbyopia and hyperopia, a converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary to bring the near point closer to the eye while for myopia a <b>diverging</b> <b>lens</b> provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity. Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly in one direction than in another, compensating for the non-uniformity of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|If {{the lens}} is biconcave or plano-concave, a {{collimated}} {{beam of light}} passing through the lens is diverged (spread); the lens is thus called a negative or <b>diverging</b> <b>lens.</b> The beam, after passing through the lens, appears to emanate from a particular point on the axis {{in front of the}} lens. The distance from this point to the lens is also known as the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging lens.|$|E
25|$|A <b>diverging</b> <b>lens</b> (one that {{is thicker}} {{at the edges}} than the middle) or a convex mirror forms a virtual image. Such an image is so reduced in size when {{compared}} to the original object. A converging lens (one that is thicker in the middle than at the edges) or a concave mirror is also capable of producing a virtual image if the object is within the focal length. Such an image will be magnified. In contrast, an object placed in front of a converging lens or concave mirror at a position beyond the focal length produces a real image. Such an image may be magnified or reduced depending on the position of the object.|$|E

25|$|With <b>diverging</b> <b>lenses,</b> {{incoming}} parallel rays diverge {{after going}} through the lens, {{in such a way}} that they seem to have originated at a spot one focal length in front of the lens. This is the lens's front focal point. Rays from an object at finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal point, and on the same side of the lens as the object. The closer the object is to the lens, the closer the virtual image is to the lens. As with mirrors, upright images produced by a single lens are virtual, while inverted images are real.|$|R
40|$|Optical lenses are {{pervasive}} in various areas of sciences and technologies. It is well-known that the resolving {{power of a}} lens and thus optical systems {{is limited by the}} diffraction of light. Recently, various plasmonics and metamaterials based superlenses have been emerging to achieve super resolution. Here, we show that the phase compensated negative refraction lenses perform as "Janus Lenses", i. e. either converging <b>lenses</b> or <b>diverging</b> <b>lenses</b> depending on the illumination directions. Extraordinary imaging equations and properties that are different from those of all the existing optical lenses are also presented. These new imaging properties, along with the super resolving power, significantly expand the horizon of imaging optics and optical system design.

5000|$|Some {{photographic}} zoom lenses are long-focus lenses, with focal lengths {{longer than}} a normal lens, some are wide-angle lenses (wider than normal), and others cover a range from wide-angle to long-focus. Lenses in the latter group of zoom lenses, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "normal" [...] zooms, have displaced the fixed focal length lens as the popular one-lens selection on many contemporary cameras. The markings on these lenses usually say W and T for [...] "Wide" [...] and [...] "Telephoto". Telephoto is designated because the longer focal length supplied by the negative <b>diverging</b> <b>lens</b> is longer than the overall lens assembly (the negative <b>diverging</b> <b>lens</b> acting as the [...] "telephoto group").|$|E
50|$|One special {{application}} {{is to determine}} the focal length of a diverging lens: A light source is placed at twice the focal length of a converging lens {{on one side and a}} screen at the same distance on the other side so that the image of the light source is the sharpest possible. When this is achieved, the screen is replaced with a mirror and the <b>diverging</b> <b>lens</b> is inserted between the converging lens and the light source at such a distance to the mirror that the light returning through the diverging and converging lenses produces a sharp image on top of the luminous object. This is the case when the beam hitting the mirror is collimated. The distance found is the (negative) focal length of the <b>diverging</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E

40|$|When thermal {{energies}} are weak, {{two dimensional}} lamellar structures confined on a curved substrate display complex patterns {{arising from the}} competition between layer bending and compression {{in the presence of}} geometric constraints. We present broad design principles to engineer the geometry of the underlying substrate so that a desired lamellar pattern can be obtained by self-assembly. Two distinct physical effects are identified as key factors that contribute to the interaction between the shape of the underlying surface and the resulting lamellar morphology. The first is a local ordering field for the direction of each individual layer which tends to minimize its curvature with respect to the three-dimensional embedding. The second is a non-local effect controlled by the intrinsic geometry of the surface that forces the normals to the (nearly incompressible) layers to lie on geodesics, leading to caustic formation as in optics. As a result, different surface morphologies with predominantly positive or negative Gaussian curvature can act as converging or <b>diverging</b> <b>lenses</b> respectively. By combining these ingredients, as one would with different optical elements, complex lamellar morphologies can be obtained. This smectic optometry enables the manipulation of lamellar configurations for the design of novel materials. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

The geometry of such a lens is shown in Figure 1, which is taken from a graphics section in the video that describes Fresnel lens construction. Thus Fresnel lenses can be made much thinner and lighter than standard lenses. The operation of Fresnel lenses is also illustrated in the video. Fresnel invented this type of lens for use in lighthouses.

Lens L3 is fixed, but lenses L1 and L2 can be moved axially in a particular non-linear relationship.

40|$|The Bribie Island HF radar (situated at 27 S, 153 E) synthesizes {{a narrow}} beam, 2. 5 wide at an {{operating}} frequency of 5. 8 MHz, {{which is used}} to measure angle of arrival of echoes reflected from the ionosphere. At times underlying sporadic-E (Es) ionization appears to disturb the F-region angle of arrival. This effect on the narrow beam is evidently due to refraction and diffraction effects caused by Es having significant horizontal structure. Examples are presented along with theoretical models, using wind-shear theory and parameters of the Es event recorded on a phase ionosonde. To model the horizontal structure either the wind-shear compression or the metallic-ion content is allowed to vary horizontally. The resulting cloud is moved across the sky and synthetic measurements of angle or arrival, amplitude and Doppler shift are produced, allowing a comparison between the two models and experimental data. Neither model fits the data in all cases. Variation in the wind shear best models small irregularities in larger background clouds, while variations in metallic-ion content best fits the structure of blanketing Es (foEs ≈ fbEs). However, severe quantitative problems arise when fitting either model as a travelling cloud to blanketing Es While blanketing Es structure appears to move at about the same velocity as the small irregularities (∼ 35 ms 1). it seems that variations in foEs are primarily due to the electron concentration changing uniformly over a very large region including the region over the radar. This leads to little horizontal gradient and hence little refraction is seen with the radar. Another interesting point is that the cloud size is much smaller than would be deduced from using geometry and the time and strength of occultation. This is due to the small irregularities acting as powerful <b>diverging</b> <b>lenses.</b> Irregularity sizes of the order of 1 km are detected...|$|R

A convex elliptical mirror will reflect light directed towards one focus as if it were radiating from the other focus, both of which are behind the mirror. A convex hyperbolic mirror will reflect rays emanating from the focal point {{in front of the mirror}} as if they were emanating from the focal point behind the mirror.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the scintillation properties of 151 young, energetic pulsars with the Parkes radio telescope and have identified two extreme scattering events (ESEs). Towards PSR J 1057 - 5226 we discovered a three-year span of strengthened scattering {{during which the}} variability in flux density and the scintillation bandwidth decreased markedly. The transverse size of the scattering region is 23 au, and strong flux density enhancement {{before and after the}} ESE may arise from refractive focusing. Long observations reveal scintillation arcs characteristic of interference between rays scattered at large angles, and the clearest arcs appear during the ESE. The arcs suggest scattering by a screen 100 - 200 pc from the earth, perhaps ionized filamentary structure associated with the boundary of the local bubble(s). Towards PSR J 1740 - 3015 we observed a "double dip" in the measured flux density similar to ESEs observed towards compact extragalactic radio sources. The observed shape is consistent with that produced by a many-au scale <b>diverging</b> plasma <b>lens</b> with electron density 500 cm^- 3. The continuing ESE is at least 1500 d long, making it the longest detected event to date. These detections, with materially different observational signatures, indicate that well-calibrated pulsar monitoring is a keen tool for ESE detection and ISM diagnostics. They illustrate the strong rôle au-scale non-Kolmogorov density fluctuations and the local ISM structure play in such events and are key to understanding both their intrinsic physics and their impact on other phenomena, particularly fast radio bursts.

40|$|Organizational success {{increasingly}} {{depends on}} leaders’ abilities to address competing demands simultaneously. Scholars have applied both institutional theory and paradox theory {{to better understand}} the nature and responses to these competing demands. These two <b>lenses</b> <b>diverge</b> in their understanding and responses to tensions. Institutional theory depicts competing demands emerging from divergent field-level pressures and stresses their contradictory and oppositional nature. Organizational responses vary from making tradeoffs and choosing pressures with which to conform to seeking strategies for engaging both and managing conflict. Paradox theory locates competing demands as inherent with organizational systems, surfaced through environmental conditions, individual sensemaking, or relational dialogue. According to these scholars, paradoxes are contradictory, interdependent, and persist over time, demanding strategies for engaging and accommodating tensions but not resolving them. In this essay, we highlight these distinctions and argue that drawing from both of these lenses will results in rich, generative theorizing to better address key challenges in the world. We identify specific areas where future research can benefit from such integration. This is the author accepted manuscript. The final version is available from SAGE Publications via [URL]...|$|R
