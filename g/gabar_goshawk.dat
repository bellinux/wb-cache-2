50|$|The <b>gabar</b> <b>goshawk</b> (Micronisus gabar) {{is a small}} {{species of}} African and Arabian bird of prey in the family Accipitridae.|$|E
50|$|Males are {{characteristically}} dark sooty grey above with rufous {{thighs and}} vent. In flight, the wing lining is white, contrasting {{with the dark}} wing feathers. Adult males of the closely related red-footed falcon have a dark grey wing lining. In Africa, males can be confused with melanistic <b>Gabar</b> <b>goshawks,</b> but the chestnut on the vent is distinctive. Also, {{there may be some}} superficial resemblance to the sooty falcon and the grey kestrel, but those two species both have yellow feet and cere. The wings are long as in most falcons (with a span of 63-71 cm) and at rest the wing tip reaches or extends just beyond the tail-tip.|$|R
50|$|The {{recorded}} predators {{of adult}} little sparrowhawks include the <b>gabar</b> <b>goshawk</b> (Micronisus gabar), while chicks have sometimes been predated by lizard buzzards (Kaupifalco monogrammicus).|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Accipitrinae contains Accipiter; it {{also contains}} genera Micronisus (<b>Gabar</b> <b>goshawk),</b> Urotriorchis (long-tailed hawk), and Megatriorchis (Doria's goshawk). Melierax (chanting goshawks) may {{be included in}} the subfamily, or given a subfamily of its own.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gabar</b> <b>goshawk</b> {{occurs in}} open woodland, {{especially}} dry Acacia savanna and broad-leaved woodland, with miombo (Brachystegia), cluster-leaf Terminalia, and mopane (Colosphermum mopane). In the more arid regions of southern Africa {{such as the}} Karoo and Namib Desert, it is generally restricted to tree-lined watercourses, {{but it may also}} move into cities and towns.|$|E
50|$|The lake is alkaline, feeding {{blue-green algae}} {{which in turn}} feed flamingoes. At {{times the number of}} flamingoes feeding in the lake may be as high as two million.Raptors such as tawny eagles prey on the flamingoes.In total, 135 species of bird have been recorded. They include little grebe, pratincole, swift, little bee-eater, cape wigeon, yellow-billed stork, African spoonbill, augur buzzard, <b>gabar</b> <b>goshawk,</b> water dikkop, great tit, starling, {{hornbill}} and crombec.|$|E
50|$|Small {{birds are}} the {{major part of the}} gabar goshwakâ€™s diet, with small mammals, reptiles, and insects also taken on occasion. The prey is {{typically}} flushed from trees and caught following a persistent and energetic pursuit. The <b>gabar</b> <b>goshawk</b> sometimes hunts from the perch, swooping down to catch prey off the ground or in flight. They have also been recorded attacking the nests of colonial birds such as weavers by clawing their way destructively through the nest top to snatch the chicks from the nest.|$|E
50|$|The little {{sparrowhawk}} is a monogamous {{and territorial}} solitary nester. The male's display sees him perch {{with his body}} held parallel to the perch the sways his {{head from side to}} side. The female takes most of the responsibility of building the nest constructing a small stick platform which has a thin lining of green leaves. She typically places the nest in the main fork of a tree, favouring alien species, such as Eucalyptus, poplars, jacaranda and weeping willow. She will use old nest of a shikra or <b>gabar</b> <b>goshawk</b> rather than building her own nest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gabar</b> <b>goshawk</b> {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be sedentary, but immature birds are somewhat nomadic and some small migratory movements have been recorded in parts of its range. It is most frequently observed alone, but pairs are also common, particularly during the breeding season, when the male is often observed pursuing the female through trees, or calling from his perch. The small platform nest is typically constructed using thin twigs and positioned in a vertical fork in the crown of a thorny tree, such as an acacia. One notable aspect of their nest construction is that the birds collect spider webs including the live spiders, the spiders spin new webs which may help camouflage the nest, and the spiders may consume arthropods that would parasitize the chicks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gabar</b> <b>goshawk</b> is {{polymorphic}} and {{occurs in}} two distinct forms which fluctuate in relative abundance across the geographic {{range of the}} species. The more frequent, paler form has mostly grey upperparts with a conspicuous, white rump and white and grey barring on the chest, thighs and underwings, and a dark grey, barred tail. In contrast, the less frequent form, which accounts on average for approximately 25 percent of the overall population, is almost completely black. In both forms of adult the eyes are dark, and the long legs and the cere are red. The cere and the legs are yellow in immatures and the plumage is generally browner, with the pale birds having untidy barring on the chest than the adult. The females are significantly larger than the males, the male's weigh 90 - 173g and the females 167 - 240g The body length is 28-36 cm and the wingspan 63 cm.|$|E
