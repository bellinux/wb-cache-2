40|$|In this lecture note, I <b>discuss</b> <b>why</b> {{many of us}} {{are expecting}} rich physics at the TeV scale, drawing analogies from the history of physics in the last century. Then I review some of the {{possible}} candidates of new physics at this energy scale. I also <b>discuss</b> <b>why</b> we believe much of the matter in the universe is not atoms (baryons) or compact astronomical objects, and hence requires physics beyond the standard model. Finally I discuss some of the candidates for the non-baryonic dark matter.

40|$|International audienceWe review recent results {{dealing with}} the {{analysis}} of spike train statistics in neural networks models, using methods from dynamical systems (thermodynamic formalism).

40|$|XML {{will have}} a {{profound}} impact on the way data is exchanged on the Internet. An important feature of this language is the separation of content from presentation, which makes it easier to select and/or reformat the data. However, due to the likelihood of numerous industry and domain specific DTDs, those who wish to integrate information will still be faced with the problem of semantic interoperability. In this paper we <b>discuss</b> <b>why</b> this problem is not solved by XML, and then <b>discuss</b> <b>why</b> the Resource Description Framework is only a partial solution. We then present the SHOE language, which we feel has many of the features necessary to enable a semantic web, and describe an existing set of tools that make it easy to use the language...|$|R

40|$|Núñez and Fias raised {{concerns}} on whether our results demonstrate a linear number-space mapping. Patro and Nuerk urge caution {{on the use}} of animal models to understand the origin (cultural vs. biological) of the orientation of spatial–numerical association. Here, we <b>discuss</b> <b>why</b> both objections are unfounded...|$|R
40|$|We <b>discuss</b> <b>why</b> {{projection}} valued {{measures are}} not sufficient {{in the description of}} position and momentum of a one dimensional particle. A satisfactory solution is offered using positive operator measures. We also argue why the relevant positive operator measures, but not all, may be called unsharp observables...|$|R
40|$|The term {{exaptation}} {{was introduced}} to encourage biologists to consider alternatives to adaptation to explain the origins of traits. Here, we <b>discuss</b> <b>why</b> exaptation has proved more successful in technological than biological contexts, and propose a revised definition of exaptation applicable to both genetic and cultural evolution...|$|R
40|$|The variational {{principle}} for conformational dynamics has enabled the systematic construction of Markov state models through the optimization of hyperparameters by approximating the transfer operator.
