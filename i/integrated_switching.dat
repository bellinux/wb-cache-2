40|$|For {{examination}} of the channel occupancy of the transmission channels {{a model of a}} service <b>integrated</b> <b>switching</b> network is introduced in which the information of two services with different bitrates is transmitted in a time division multiplex mode within one common network. The occupancy of the transmission channels that can be achieved is compared for different access modes in the common multiplex frame. Depending on the number of channels of the transmission media and of the bitrate ratio of the services a limit can be determined from which a common transmission with unlimited access of all service demands to all channels cannot be justified by a higher occupancy of the transmission channels. Whether a common transmission for services of different bitrate in separated subframes of a multiplex frame within a wideband transmission media represents an economic alternative compared with separate networks must therefore mainly be determined by other important considerations...|$|E

40|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>switching</b> devices {{comprise}} {{the building blocks}} of ultrafast optical signal processing. As the next stage following intensity switching circular polarization switches are attracting considerable interest because of their applications in spin-based architectures. They usually take advantage of nonlinear optical effects, and require high powers and external optical elements. Semiconductor microcavities provide a significant step forward due to their low-threshold, polarization-dependent, nonlinear emission, fast operation and integrability. Here, we demonstrate a non-local, all-optical spin switch based on exciton–polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity. In the presence of a sub-threshold pump laser (dark regime), a tightly localized probe induces the switch-on of the entire pumped area. If the pump is circularly polarized, the switch is conditional on the polarization of the probe, but if it is linearly polarized, a circularly polarized probe fully determines the final polarization of the pumped area. These results set the basis for the development of spin-based logic devices, integrated in a chip...|$|E
