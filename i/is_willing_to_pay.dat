5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an {{announcement}} by Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) on television {{that he plans to}} travel to outer space, and <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> up to thirty million dollars to do so. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) agrees to help Tracy with his dream of traveling in space, promising to call his friends at NASA. Instead of doing this, however, he asks The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to create a fake space experience for Tracy. Pete and the TGS crew construct a model space shuttle and place Tracy in it after disorienting him by flying him in a helicopter blindfolded. The deception is a success, and Tracy believes that he is, in fact, flying in space.|$|E
5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Raskolnikov is {{introduced}} to the detective Porfiry, who begins to suspect him of the murder purely on psychological grounds. At the same time, a chaste relationship develops between Raskolnikov and Sonya. Sonya, though a prostitute, is full of Christian virtue and is only driven into the profession by her family's poverty. Meanwhile, Razumikhin and Raskolnikov manage to keep Dunya from continuing her relationship with Luzhin, whose true character is exposed to be conniving and base. At this point, Svidrigaïlov appears on the scene, having come from the province to Petersburg, almost solely to seek out Dunya. He reveals that his wife, Marfa Petrovna, is dead, and that he <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Dunya a vast sum of money in exchange for nothing. She, upon hearing the news, refuses flat out, suspecting him of treachery.|$|E

Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> $10,000 for the apartment.

40|$|Abstract: This survey {{investigated}} the willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for an improved {{water quality and}} reliability in Chobe ward in Maun. On average, 54 % of the households <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for improved water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for its provision. Those with a higher income <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for improved water quality and reliability. Larger families <b>are</b> not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for an improved provision of water services. Also, educated people <b>are</b> lesser <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for improved water quality and reliability...|$|R

Of the patients who stated that they would pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, the median (IQR) amount they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>was</b> $ 750.00 (1500.00). Moreover, when {{patients were}} asked if they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada and <b>pay</b> out-of-pocket <b>to</b> have an ACLR, 41 (16.4 %) said yes, 151 (60.4 %) said no, and 58 (23.2 %) said that they were unsure.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to estimate the potential demand for certified clams in Italy and to investigate the determinants of maximum amount that respondents <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for this product. Quantitative analysis was used based on 1, 067 face-to-face interviews collected in 3 Italian regions in the north bordering the Adriatic Sea (Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna) carried out during 2008. The consumers' willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> (WTP) is measured using a contingent valuation method. In order to estimate separately the determinants of the probability that respondents <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> and the maximum that they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> a generalization of Tobit model was adopted. The results indicate that consumers <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a premium price mainly to purchase better quality products.

Editions such as the 1916 containing the obituary and career details of W. G.
