5|$|Pugs {{can suffer}} from necrotizing meningo{{encephalitis}} (NME), {{also known as}} Pug dog encephalitis (PDE), an inflammation {{of the brain and}} meninges. NME also occurs in other small dogs, such as the Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, and Chihuahua. There is no known cure for NME, which is believed to be an inherited disease. Dogs usually die or <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> to sleep within a few months of onset, which, in those susceptible to this condition, is typically between six months and seven years of age.|$|E

25|$|On 14 April 1922, 200 Anti-Treaty IRA militants, led by Rory O'Connor, {{occupied}} the Four Courts {{and several other}} buildings in central Dublin, resulting in a tense stand-off. These anti-treaty Republicans wanted to spark a new armed confrontation with the British, which they hoped would unite the two factions of the IRA against their common enemy. However, {{for those who were}} determined to make the Free State into a viable, self-governing Irish state, this was an act of rebellion that would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> down by them rather than the British.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Burns {{was hired}} to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. This horse was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, {{who had once been}} a trainer at Paul Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already {{suffered}} from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> down by a vet. Burns decided to sub-contract the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar.|$|E
25|$|The island's unique {{social and}} {{economic}} organisation has evolved over the years, but {{is based on the}} principles set out by William Glass in 1817, when he established a settlement based on equality. All Tristan families are farmers, owning their own stock and/or fishing. All land is communally owned. All households have plots of land at The Patches on which they grow potatoes. Livestock numbers are strictly controlled to conserve pasture and to prevent better-off families from accumulating wealth. Unless the community votes for a change in its law, no outsiders are allowed to buy land or settle on Tristan; theoretically the whole island would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> up for sale. All people– including children and pensioners– are involved in farming, while adults additionally have salaried jobs working either for the government, or, a small number in domestic service. Many of the men are involved in the fishing industry, going to sea in good weather. The nominal fishing season lasts 90 days; however, during the 2013 fishing season– 1 July to 30 September– there were only 10 days suitable for fishing.|$|E

500|$|The most {{significant}} long-term {{consequence of the}} Frémont Emancipation was the effect it had on Lincoln's perceptions of emancipation and, specifically, {{how it should be}} accomplished. [...] As historian Allen Guelzo describes, Lincoln became determined, after Frémont's failed proclamation, that emancipation could not be a matter of martial law or some other temporary measure that would later be challenged in courts. [...] To ensure its permanence, Lincoln felt, emancipation would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> into effect by the federal government in a manner that was incontrovertibly constitutional. [...] Equally important, the timing of emancipation would need to be [...] orchestrated carefully, so as not to interfere with the war effort. [...] Although in 1861, Lincoln had not yet espoused the idea of immediate emancipation and still hoped to work with state governments to accomplish gradual and perhaps even a compensated emancipation, the Frémont incident solidified Lincoln's belief that emancipation was the President's responsibility and could not be accomplished by scattered decrees from Union generals. [...] This realization was one of several factors that led to Lincoln's own Emancipation Proclamation in September 1862.|$|E

[...] They are sometimes a bit longer than chinks, but still stopping above the top of the boot, fringed on the sides and on the bottom to reach the boot tops, attached by a fringed belt.|$|E

When Amboyna arrived at Macao, {{it was discovered that}} she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> on her side to repair damage from a grounding in the Sulu Sea. While Dobbie went up to Whampoa, he left Amboyna in the Typa (inner harbour) under the supervision of Lieutenant Arthur Farquhar, a friend who had traveled on her as a supernumerary. While she was being turned on her side, a gang of [...] "ladrones" [...] (thieves) attempted to capture and loot her; fortunately Farquhar was able to drive them off.|$|E
2500|$|As the EU's fifth largest economy, Spain {{remains a}} large concern. In 2011 Mariano Rajoy {{took over the}} {{government}} with his conservative views, pushing out José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and his left-wing views. [...] Trying to get Spain out of the highest unemployment rate in the European Union was proven to be harder than expected. The bailout for Spain has been estimated to {{not be enough to}} restore the economy. [...] There is a serious debt in the country, and substantial cuts would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> in place to restore the economy at this point. The recession has been a concern for a while and shows no sign of lifting any time soon as Spain has yet to meet budget cuts and shows no sign of changing. [...] Many youths are trying to find jobs abroad, creating a problem for the future domestic economy and job market. [...] Rajoy recently proposed a new budget for 2013 that would be very different and would cut government spending by 8.9%. By April 2013, unemployment had risen to 27%.|$|E
2500|$|After the First English Civil War, King Charles I was a {{prisoner}} of the Parliamentarians. They tried to negotiate a compromise with him, but he stuck steadfastly to his view that he was King by Divine Right and attempted in secret to raise an army to fight against them. It became obvious to {{the leaders of the}} Parliamentarians that they could not negotiate a settlement with him and they could not trust him to refrain from raising an army against them; they reluctantly {{came to the conclusion that}} he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> to death. On 13 December 1648, the House of Commons broke off negotiations with the King. Two days later, the Council of Officers of the New Model Army voted that the King be moved from the Isle of Wight, where he was prisoner, to Windsor [...] "in order to the bringing of him speedily to justice". In the middle of December, the King was moved from Windsor to London. The House of Commons of the Rump Parliament passed a Bill setting up a High Court of Justice in order to try Charles I for high treason in the name of the people of England. [...] From a Royalist and post-restoration perspective this Bill was not lawful, since the House of Lords refused to pass it and it failed to receive Royal Assent. However, the Parliamentary leaders and the Army pressed on with the trial anyway.|$|E
