5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and <b>induced</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi {{wanted to see if}} he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E
5|$|Levi {{worked as}} Franck's assistant, {{publishing}} two papers {{with him on}} the fluorescence of chlorophyll, until he left Denmark for the United States in 1935. She then became assistant to the Hungarian physical chemist George de Hevesy. The recent discovery of <b>induced</b> <b>radioactivity</b> and the consequent creation of short-lived radioactive isotopes opened up a number of new uses for radioactive substances in biology which she explored with de Hevesy, publishing a number of papers with him. The University of Berlin cancelled Levi's doctorate in 1938. In April 1940, the Germans occupied Denmark. When the Nazis began rounding up Danish Jews in September 1943, Levi was one of the thousands of Jews who fled to Sweden. For the rest of the war she worked for the biologist John Runnström at the Wenner-Gren Institute for Experimental Biology in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he <b>induced</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E
50|$|Other UFO {{researchers}} {{point out}} that high-energy ionizing radiation {{of the kind that}} can cause damage to human beings (e.g. gamma radiation) does not <b>induce</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in objects, and would not have left behind any residual radioactivity in the area.|$|R
50|$|The neutron {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many nuclear reactions. For example, neutron capture often results in neutron activation, <b>inducing</b> <b>radioactivity.</b> In particular, knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has been important in the development of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. The fissioning of elements like uranium-235 and plutonium-239 is caused by their absorption of neutrons.|$|R
2500|$|Irradiation with X-rays, gamma rays, or {{electrons}} {{does not}} make materials radioactive, because the energy used is too low. [...] Generally an energy of at least 10 MeV is needed to <b>induce</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in a material. [...] Neutrons and very high-energy particles can make materials radioactive, but have good penetration, whereas lower energy particles (other than neutrons) cannot make materials radioactive, but have poorer penetration.|$|R
5|$|Up to {{and after}} the {{discovery}} of the final component of the atomic nucleus, the neutron in 1932, most scientists did not seriously consider the possibility of elements heavier than uranium. While nuclear theory at the time did not explicitly prohibit their existence, there was little evidence to suggest that they did. However, the discovery of <b>induced</b> <b>radioactivity</b> by Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie in late 1933 opened up an entirely new method of researching the elements and inspired a small group of Italian scientists led by Enrico Fermi to begin a series of experiments involving neutron bombardment. Although the Joliot-Curies' experiment involved bombarding a sample of 27Al with alpha particles to produce the radioactive 30P, Fermi realized that using neutrons, which have no electrical charge, would most likely produce even better results than the positively charged alpha particles. Accordingly, in March 1934 he began systematically subjecting all of the then-known elements to neutron bombardment to determine whether others could also be induced to radioactivity.|$|E
25|$|The same year, his {{doctoral}} student James Chadwick discovered the neutron, which was immediately {{recognized as a}} potential tool for nuclear experimentation because of its lack of an electric charge. Experimentation with bombardment of materials with neutrons led Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie to discover <b>induced</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in 1934, which allowed the creation of radium-like elements at much less the price of natural radium. Further work by Enrico Fermi in the 1930s focused on using slow neutrons to increase the effectiveness of <b>induced</b> <b>radioactivity.</b> Experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led Fermi to believe he had created a new, transuranic element, which was dubbed hesperium.|$|E
25|$|Third-generation fusion fuels produce only charged {{particles}} in the primary reactions, and side reactions are relatively unimportant. Since a very small amount of neutrons is produced, {{there would be little}} <b>induced</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in the walls of the fusion chamber. This is often seen as the end goal of fusion research. 3He has the highest Maxwellian reactivity of any 3rd generation fusion fuel. However, there are no significant natural sources of this substance on Earth.|$|E
40|$|When Enrico Fermi {{discovered}} slow neutrons, he {{accounted for}} their great efficiency in <b>inducing</b> <b>radioactivity</b> by merely mentioning the well-known scattering cross-section between neutrons and protons. He did {{not refer to}} capture cross-section, at that early stage. It is put forward that a thermodynamic approach to neutron-proton radiative capture then widely debated might underlie his early accounts. Fermi had already met with a similar approach, and repeatedly used it. Comment: 14 pages; submitted to "American Journal of Physics...|$|R
50|$|Neutron {{activation}} analysis {{is one of}} the most sensitive and accurate methods of trace element analysis. It requires no sample preparation or solubilization and can therefore be applied to objects that need to be kept intact such as a valuable piece of art. Although the activation <b>induces</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in the object, its level is typically low and its lifetime may be short, so that its effects soon disappear. In this sense, neutron activation is a non-destructive analysis method.|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron by Chadwick in 1932 (27), {{and the production of}} artificial radioactivity two years later by Curie and Joliot (33) made possible the investigation of a completely new field.

50|$|Neutron {{activation}} is {{the process}} in which neutron radiation <b>induces</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in materials, and occurs when atomic nuclei capture free neutrons, becoming heavier and entering excited states. The excited nucleus often decays immediately by emitting gamma rays, or particles such as beta particles, alpha particles, fission products, and neutrons (in nuclear fission). Thus, the process of neutron capture, even after any intermediate decay, often results {{in the formation of}} an unstable activation product. Such radioactive nuclei can exhibit half-lives ranging from small fractions of a second to many years.|$|R
5000|$|A {{less common}} form {{involves}} removing a neutron via photodisintegration. In this reaction, a high energy photon (gamma ray) strikes a nucleus with an energy {{greater than the}} binding energy of the atom, releasing a neutron. This reaction has a minimum cutoff of 2 MeV (for deuterium) and around 10 MeV for most heavy nuclei. [...] Many radionuclides do not produce gamma rays with energy high enough to induce this reaction. The isotopes used in food irradiation (cobalt-60, caesium-137) both have energy peaks below this cutoff and thus cannot <b>induce</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in the food.|$|R

50|$|In {{health physics}} neutron {{radiation}} {{is a type}} of radiation hazard. Another, sometimes more severe hazard of neutron radiation, is neutron activation, the ability of neutron radiation to <b>induce</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in most substances it encounters, including the body tissues. This occurs through the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei, which are transformed to another nuclide, frequently a radionuclide. This process accounts for much of the radioactive material released by the detonation of a nuclear weapon. It is also a problem in nuclear fission and nuclear fusion installations as it gradually renders the equipment radioactive such that eventually it must be replaced and disposed of as low-level radioactive waste.|$|R
