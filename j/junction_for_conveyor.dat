40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the lateral {{fluctuate}} in the conveying process of double-pitch roller chain <b>for</b> <b>conveyors</b> and implement smooth and steady conveying and based on the engagement theory and design method of silent chain, a new type of double-pitch silent chain <b>for</b> <b>conveyors</b> was proposed. Its chain plate was designed and analyzed its time-shared meshing theory and the reason of lateral fluctuates. and when rotating speed ω = 400 r/min, rotational resisting moment T = 20 Nm, a compared simulation tests between the new double pitch silent chains <b>for</b> <b>conveyors</b> and traditional double pitch roller chains <b>for</b> <b>conveyors</b> about lateral fluctuate values had been done. The analysis results show that the lateral fluctuate value of double pitch silent chain was largely smaller than the double-pitch roller chain’s and the design could improve the conveying conditions distinctly. Therefore, the design of double-pitch silent chain <b>for</b> <b>conveyors</b> has value of application...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve current {{problems}} of large noise of double-pitch roller chain <b>for</b> <b>conveyors,</b> and implement higher efficiency and accuracy, {{a new type of}} double pitch silent chain was proposed by the method of change some plates with Nano-structured metal mesh - polyurethane composite material. Tested the noise characteristics among the new type double-pitch silent chain, the double-pitch roller chain and the short-pitch silent chain <b>for</b> <b>conveyor</b> and analysed the results. The results show that this new type of chain could effectively increase the transmission speed, ease chordal action, reduce the impact between chian plates and the sprocket tooth, and noise reduction effect is obvious. And the design could improve the conveying conditions distinctly. Therefore, the design of double-pitch silent chain <b>for</b> <b>conveyors</b> has value of application...|$|R
