Here he spent his mornings walking or cycling in the surrounding countryside, and his afternoons writing. The original idea for The War of the Worlds came from his brother during one of these walks, pondering on what <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if alien beings were suddenly to descend on the scene and start attacking its inhabitants.|$|E
500|$|Thief: The Dark Project {{has been}} {{declared}} {{one of the greatest}} games of all time by several publications. Inducting it into its hall of fame, GameSpy writer Rich Carlson wrote: [...] "With a tactical philosophy contrary to nearly every [...] action game at that time, Thief rewarded stealth and sneaking over brazen frontal assault," [...] continuing: [...] "While inadvertently undermining the notion that all action games need be shooters, it carved a completely new niche in the same already glutted genre." [...] GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin argued that, while Metal Gear Solid, [...] and Thief all defined the stealth action genre, it was Thief that displayed [...] "the purest depiction of what <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to slip from shadow to shadow" [...] and [...] "largely remains an unsurpassed achievement in gaming." [...] In 2009, Thief was added to IGN's hall of fame. Sid Shuman, writing for GamePro, asserted that Thief [...] "pioneered its own genre ... the stealth-action title." [...] John Walker of Eurogamer wrote in a retrospective review: [...] "Thief is an embarrassment to modern stealth games, each of which produces only a faded parody of this masterful original." [...] In 2012, Mike Fahey of Kotaku called Thief [...] "the best stealth game I've ever played", superior to modern games in the genre. That same year, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time.|$|E

[...] In an article for The Texas Monthly in 1994, Nick Tosches eloquently described the singer's vocal style: [...] "While he and his idol, Hank Williams, have both affected generations with a plaintive veracity of voice that has set them apart, Jones has an additional gift—a voice of exceptional range, natural elegance, and lucent tone. Gliding toward high tenor, plunging toward deep bass, the magisterial portamento of his onward-coursing baritone emits white-hot sparks and torrents of blue, investing his poison love songs with a tragic gravity and inflaming his celebrations of the honky-tonk ethos with the hellfire of abandon." [...] In the New Republic essay [...] "Why George Jones Ranks with Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday," [...] David Hajdu writes: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{inability}} to choose and design the character the player played {{as in the}} game was both commended and criticised. The YouTube channel Extra Credits commended Rust for promoting diversity {{in the way in}} which the game decides for the player their in-game race; by randomly selecting a player's race and tying it to their Steam ID, the game can force players to experience the game as a different race than they would normally experience, thereby promoting a greater level of empathy for what <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be someone of different ethnicity than the player. The lack of communication between Facepunch and the community when adding female models was criticised by David Craddock (Shacknews), where he mentions he understands Facepunch's reasoning behind the lack of options but the way they implemented it could've been more effective if the communication was better. In response to the criticism, Garry Newman commented that he had felt some trepidation towards adding the racial feature, fearing that it might be seen as just the original character model [...] "blacked up", and stressed how the chosen ethnicity was permanent as [...] "just like in real life, you are who you are". Garry Newman discussed the reasoning behind not giving the option to choose the gender and race of the player's character in an article on The Guardian, saying Rust is about survival, not characterization and identity. When female models were added, sales reportedly increased by 74%.|$|E

More specifically, it explores what it calls ‘poetic’ engagements with animals – engagements in which our relations with nonhuman others are not cast in appropriative or instrumental terms. Along the way, it draws on the work of the American philosopher Cora Diamond. It also takes inspiration from a famous passage from George Eliot’s Middlemarch, and offers a creaturely, environmental reading of some of the ideas invoked in that novel.

I heard no prayer, no appeal to God for mercy, nothing indeed from any of us, {{to show that we}} thought at all on the subject. Hunger gave me a little trouble, and during the second night I would fall into a doze, and wake myself up by dreaming of eating meals that were peculiarly grateful to me.

6000|$|I had {{not been}} acquainted with Guert Ten Eyck a fortnight, before I saw he had a {{tendency}} to the same sort of excesses as those to which Col. Van Valkenburgh was addicted. There was an old French Huguenot living near Satanstoe--or rather, the son of one, who still spoke his father's language--and who used to call Col. Follock's frolics his [...] "grands couchers" [...] and his [...] "petit couchers;" [...] [27] inasmuch as he usually got to bed at the last, without assistance; while at the first, it was indispensable that some aid should be proffered. It was these [...] "grands couchers" [...] at which my father never assisted. On these occasions, the colonel invariably held his orgies over in Rockland, in the society of men of purely Dutch extraction; there being something exclusive in the enjoyment. I have heard it said that these last frolics sometimes lasted a week, on really important occasions; during the whole of which time the colonel and all near him were as happy as lords. These [...] "grands couchers" [...] however, occurred but rarely--coming round, as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> <b>like</b> leap-years, just to regulate the calendar, and adjust the time.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{possible}} that, aware as I {{was of the}} jeopardy in which we were all placed, my imagination may have heightened {{the effect of the}} fair apparition that had come to save us, as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> <b>like</b> a messenger from above. But, even there, where I stood panting from the effect of exertions that I have never equalled in my own case most certainly, exhausted, nearly breathless, and almost unable to stand, my mind's-eye saw nothing but the flexible form, the elastic, ready step, the golden tresses, the cheek suffused by excitement, the charming lips compressed with resolution, and the whole air, attitude, and action characterized, as was each and all, by the devotion, readiness, and loveliness of her sex. When my pulses beat more regularly, and my heart ceased to throb, I looked around in quest of that strange vision, but saw no one who could, in the least, claim to be connected with it. The females had huddled together, like a covey that was frightened, and were exclaiming, holding up their hands, and indulging in the signs of alarm that are customary with their sex and class. The [...] "vision" [...] was certainly not in that group, but had vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.|$|E

The helm of the ship was put a-lee; and, as her head came sweeping up into the wind, a sheet of flame flashed from her leeward bow-port, sending the customary amicable intimation across the water, that those who governed her movements would communicate with the possessors of the vessel in sight. At the same instant, a small flag, with a spotless field was seen floating at the topmost elevation of all her spars, whilst the flag of England was lowered from the gaff. A half minute of deep inquietude succeeded these signals, in the bosoms {{of those who had}} ordered them to be made. Their suspense was however speedily terminated. A cloud of smoke drove before the wind from the vessel of the Rover, and then the smothered explosion of the answering gun came dull upon their ears. A flag, similar to their own, was seen floating, as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> <b>like</b> a dove fanning its wings, far above her tops; but no emblem of any sort was borne at the spar, where the colours which distinguish the national character of a cruiser are usually seen.|$|E

The Age reported in 1891 that [...] "it afforded a very good opportunity for people to see what <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>like</b> at Eureka".
