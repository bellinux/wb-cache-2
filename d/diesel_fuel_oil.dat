40|$|SUMMARY: Notice is hereby {{given that}} {{the staff of the}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has {{prepared}} a model Application related to changes to the <b>Diesel</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Oil</b> Testing Programs. The changes relocate references to specific American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards for fuel oil testing to licensee-controlled documents and adds alternate criteria to the “clear and bright ” acceptance test for new fuel oil. The NRC staff has also prepared a model safety evaluation (SE) and no significant hazards consideration (NSHC) determination relating to this matter. The purpose of these models is to permit the NRC to efficiently process amendments that propose to adopt the associated changes into plant-specific technical specifications (TS). Licensees of nuclear power reactors to which the models apply could request amendments confirming the applicability of the SE and NSHC determination to their reactors. DATES: The NRC staff issued a Federal Register Notice (71 FRN 9179, February 22, 2006) that provided a model SE and a model NSHC determination relating to changes to the <b>Diesel</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Oil</b> Testing Programs. The NRC staff hereby announces that the model SE and NSHC determination may be referenced in plant-specific applications to adopt the changes. The staff has posted a model application on the NRC web site to assist licensees in using the 2 consolidated line item improvement process (CLIIP) to revise TS <b>Diesel</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Oil</b> Testing Programs. The NRC staff can most efficiently consider applications based upon the model application if the application is submitted within one year of this Federal Register Notice...|$|E

40|$|The world energy {{industry}} {{is in the}} throes of significant technological and policy change, providing Bermuda with an unprecedented opportunity to move toward a sustainable energy model. Presently, electricity on the island is supplied almost entirely by a <b>diesel</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> utility, Belco, which is expecting to retire almost 50 % of their generators in the next six years. At the same time, Bermuda’s Department of Energy is developing a new Energy Policy and establishing an independent Regulatory Authority. This study asks what Bermuda can learn from other island states which have committed to a sustainable energy portfolio. The first section of the report describes the current energy model in Bermuda and two currently proposed plans for the future. The local monopoly utility, Belco, generates 97 % of Bermuda’s electricity using heavy <b>diesel</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> with the balance purchased from an independent waste-to-energy plant. Renewable energy has barely penetrated the island; there are no commercial–scale renewable energy installations, and fewer than 200 (0. 5 %) residences have installed rooftop solar systems. Given the cost of renewable technology, particularly solar, is now competitive with fossil fuel generation in many situations, Bermuda has the opportunity to invest in alternative energy infrastructure at a lower price than was possible a few years ago, allowing for the displacement of a meaningful portion of Belco’...|$|E

Energy supplied to an engine is the heat value of the fuel consumed. But only a part of this energy is transferred into useful work. From heat balance sheet of a typical CI engine we find out that the total heat loss is around 33 - 45 %, of which 33 % is due to exhaust gases and the rest is lost to the surroundings.

40|$|Abstract: Kyoto’s {{protocol}} {{respects the}} view that, {{within the context}} of worldwide preservation and improvement, the quality of life is impossible to maintain without bringing forward new and replacement technologies. Energy supply is perhaps the most significant contributing vector and it is, in consequence, intrinsically linked to nearly all environmental actions. Liquid fuels, such as diesel oil, for transportation and heating needs, are in the centre of these preoccupations. The Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis is an “old ” technology but it can be adapted for use with syngas, biosyngas or biogas, for the production of diesel oil.

40|$|AbstractSmall {{islands are}} often {{characterized}} by water availability problems becoming critical in summer {{time during the}} touristic season. The current water supply systems rely on the shipping {{of water from the}} mainland, with relevant fall backs in terms of water price and CO 2 emissions. On the other hand the recur to local desalination raises the other issue in minor islands: energy supply. In this respect, the use of renewable energy appears to be the most natural option to the power mix pending the adequate consideration of the environmental constraints. In minor islands, the high environmental quality could often results in more severe landscape conservation rules as such introducing limitations to the most common renewable energy based installations. To this end, this paper discusses the use of near-shore wave energy technologies as a solution to cope with low impact energy generation to the water demand of a typical island in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the island of Ponza.
