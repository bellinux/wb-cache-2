5|$|The lakes were {{deliberately}} <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> their {{orientation was}} related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra. The lakes stretched {{from east to west}} and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretched from Capital Hill—the future location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial (although a casino was originally planned in its place). This was <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak.|$|E
5|$|Another {{manner in}} which the proofs might be {{undermined}} is if 1−0.999... simply does not exist, because subtraction is not always possible. Mathematical structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include commutative semigroups, commutative monoids and semirings. Richman considers two such systems, <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> 0.999... < 1.|$|E
5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} Perl can be {{understood}} as a response to three broad trends in the computer industry: falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive computer hardware. In contrast, Perl was <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> computer programmers could write programs more quickly and easily.|$|E
5|$|With the {{scarcity}} of Los Angeles-based animators willing to move their families so far north, give up traditional animation, and try computer animation, Pixar's new hires at this time either came directly from college or had worked outside feature animation. For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar animation software Marionette was <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> traditional animators would require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> individual {{nucleic acid}} strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall secondary {{structure of the}} target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main game, Sam & Max Hit the Road includes several minigames. Some of these, such as a carnival game based on Whac-A-Mole but involving live rats, must be completed {{in order to receive}} new items and further the game's plot, while others, such as a car-themed version of Battleship, are entirely optional as to whether the player uses them. As with the majority of LucasArts adventure games, Sam & Max Hit the Road is <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the player characters cannot die or reach a complete dead-end.|$|E
5|$|Planned as {{the first}} chapter of a trilogy from the very beginning, Mass Effect was {{developed}} over the course of {{three and a half years}} and uses the Unreal Engine 3 as a groundwork. It was <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the player would assume the role of a central character that could make important decisions and impact the story of the game in numerous ways. The combat was designed to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and real-time third-person shooter interface. In 2008 and 2009, two downloadable content packs that introduced new missions to the base game were released.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario 3D Land was {{designed}} {{to bridge the gap}} between 2D Mario games and 3D Mario games, and influenced by Miyamoto's philosophy of keeping the games fun in nature and making sure the player had the utmost opportunity to enjoy the experience of the game. A main concern during development was making a game that would appeal to fans of the 2D Super Mario games as well as the 3D games; levels were <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the player would not get lost, moving Mario in one general direction towards each level's goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{operates}} with seven stadium-style seating X-Car trains. Each train has two cars that can hold six riders each {{for a total}} of twelve riders per train. On the head rest of each seat there are two speakers that play music during the ride. The speakers have been <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> only the rider's selected music track will be audible. On the restraint is a small touch screen where riders can choose which song they want to listen to during the ride. Additionally, the trains are equipped with multi-coloured lights that can be seen during the night.|$|E
5|$|A mould {{is usually}} <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the moulded part {{reliably}} {{remains on the}} ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|E

5|$|Cupola furnace: American {{anthropologist}} Vincent C. Pigott of the University of Pennsylvania {{states that}} the cupola furnace existed in China at least by the Warring States period (403–221 BC), while Donald B. Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast furnace may have been cast directly into molds, but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a hot blast before reaching {{the bottom of the}} furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it would not spoil {{the events of the}} main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
30|$|Designing a true GNSS {{receiver}} is not {{a trivial}} task.

50|$|The {{electricity}} {{needs in}} remote locations are usually small and highly variable. Large {{nuclear power plants}} are generally rather inflexible in their power generation capabilities. SMRs have a load-following <b>design</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> when electricity demands are low they will produce a lower amount of electricity.|$|R
5|$|Hudson {{explained}} {{that they wanted to}} evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of Knights of the Old Republic into a real-time third-person shooter interface. The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> players would not need to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough, and went through a lot of trial and error to balance the combat between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.|$|E
5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E
5|$|The Fujita {{scale and}} the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert elicitation, using {{engineered}} wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was <b>designed</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.|$|E
40|$|Robustness {{has become}} a popular issue in engineering. For products, Taguchi {{suggests}} to adjust the <b>design</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> product performance is insensitive {{to the effects of}} uncontrolled environmental variations. For systems (to be distinguished from products), we propose to adjust the <b>design</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the risk of getting poor performance is minimized. This risk is evaluated by simulating the system over a sample of environmental scenarios: this procedure yields an estimate of the probability distribution of the outcome. We illustrate this risk/uncertainty approach to robustness through the comparison of four pull productioncontrol systems, including Kanban and Conwip. We conclude that the traditional approach consisting of optimizing the design of a system for a specific environment (base scenario) may be risky...|$|R
