5|$|The Enterprise was {{refurbished}} for its space shots, {{with its}} shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail {{added to the}} frame. Compared to the newly built Reliant, the Enterprise was hated by the effects artists and cameramen; it took eight people to mount the model, and a <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> to move it. The Reliant, meanwhile, was lighter and had less complex internal wiring. The ships were filmed on a blue screen with special film that does not register the color; the resulting shots could be added to effects shots or other footage. Any reflection of blue on the ship's hull would appear as a hole on the film; the gaps had to be patched frame by frame for the final film. The same camera used to film Star Wars, the Dykstraflex, was used for shots of the Enterprise and other ships.|$|E

The fitting of the 21-ton firebox and boiler unit to the wheeled locomotive frame {{was said to have}} been a perfect fit, requiring no grinding at all, a tribute to the accuracy of the design and construction by the Meiningen works. The fitting was not without incident though, as the extra weight caused some compaction of the track bed, and assistance was required to move the locomotive back into the works, by a combination of being winched, towed by a <b>forklift</b> <b>truck</b> and pushed with Land Rovers.|$|E

This paper outlines how <b>forklift</b> <b>trucks</b> with integrated RFID hardware can be deployed in warehouse IT systems. <b>Forklift</b> <b>trucks</b> {{will be able to}} communicate with management assistant systems by means of RFID and WLAN. Goods carriers like pallets and pallet cages are equipped with RFID transponders. Information about handling and processing can be locally stored on the goods carriers. A method for the measurement of the stability of communication with components integrated in <b>forklift</b> <b>trucks</b> is presented. Components, which are specifically developed for this new system architecture, are described. Economic advantages are investigated, too. I...|$|R

Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a <b>forklift</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E
