He was the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's education writer from 1969 to 1972 and lecturer in general studies and interdisciplinary studies at the University of Washington (1970–1972).

Draft phase I, II, and III mitigation reports prepared by Otis Bay <b>Ecological</b> <b>Consultants</b> were reviewed prior to completion of these preliminary restoration plans. White Horse Associates 2005 i Preliminary Restoration PlansEXECUTIVE SUMMARY A memorandum of understanding (MOU) requires Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) to provide 1, 600 acre-feet of water per year for restoration as mitigation for impacts to springs/seeps resulting from groundwater pumping. The purpose of these preliminary restoration plans is to evaluate if restoration of water/wetland at Hines Spring, Hidden Lake, and Warren Lake is feasible. Information regarding the relative benefits and costs for various feasible alternatives are provided, from which the reasonableness of various feasible alternatives can be determined. The preliminary restoration plan for Hines Spring is founded on a recently completed inventory of 2000 conditions and the plan for Hidden Lake is founded on an inventory of the Blackrock Waterfowl Management Area. Warren Lake was mapped from the 2000 orthophoto and fiel...|$|R

40|$|RAL {{quality and}} test regulations, {{in the product}} and service areas, can meet the {{relevant}} requirements for environmental protection and also help to promote rational usage and recycling of row materials. Therefore, RAL quality and test regulations, {{as well as other}} technical regulations, are an important means of implementing goals concerning environmental protection. Consequently, there was a big interest for all concerned to undertake a detailed inventory of the present situation. Moreover, it was necessary to describe the ecological requirements already met and the contribution to the environmental protection, as well as creating new possibilities for improvement in cooperation with the quality setting members. Hence the public sector, especially consumer and <b>ecological</b> <b>consultants,</b> should be informed about this subject. They should be interested in the integration of ecological seals of approval in the consultancy. The aim of the study was not however to call the existing regulation into question or to significantly alter the quality assessment, but to prsent proposals according to the present guidelines, so that the standard of each quality regulation is adapted to the existing ecological requirements.

40|$|An {{examination}} of Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) {{points to a}} clear need for change in the current process of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in Australia. The recent approval of a Boatharbour/Marina at Shellharbour, New South Wales, Australia, serves as an example that underscores {{some of the problems}} common to most EISs. Budgetary constraints imposed on the <b>ecological</b> <b>consultants</b> can lead to the use of inappropriate methodology and the collection of inaccurate biological data. The limitations in methodology must be taken into consideration in EISs and all conclusions should be substantiated with data or reference to the literature. There is a need for stricter guidelines for ecological studies and monitoring programmes. A comprehensive list of potential impacts requiring consideration in an EIS should be provided for all designated developments. Novel mitigation methods should always be subject to monitoring. The consequences of not proceeding with the development should be considered in conjunction with alternatives to the proposed development and it should be essential to consider ecotourism as an alternative to all purely tourist oriented proposals. There is a need tor peer review in the EIA process. Many of the flaws in the Shell Cove EIS might have been negated by more input from independent scientists. The future of ecologically sustainable development in Australia depends on our ability to learn from, and improve on, mistakes from the past...|$|R

Fish escapement from the reservoir was included in the 2001 work plan for Elkhead Reservoir enlargement studies conducted by Miller <b>Ecological</b> <b>Consultants,</b> Inc. Miller and Laiho (1997) recommended study of escapement prior to the selecting an escapement control device. The potential cost of building and installing a flexible, Kevlar-like net, suspended in the water column to minimize fish escapement from Elkhead Reservoir is estimated near $ 1 million. It is presumed that annual operating and maintenance of this screen will also be significant. These potential costs compel an evaluation of fish escapement as a pre-requisite task to justify this investment in both the recovery of the endangered Colorado river fishes and the reservoir sportfishery. Project Goal Document magnitude and characteristics of escapement of nonnative fishes from Elkhead Reservoir to guide design and operational criteria for potential screening, refine sportfishery management, and evaluate translocation of nonnative fish from Yampa River removal actions. Objectives The objectives of the study are: 1) Quantify escapement of fishes from Elkhead Reservoir by species and size during spring runoff; 2) Recommend the design and operational criteria for screening reservoir outflows that would be most effective for minimizing escapement; and 3) Evaluate escapement rates of nonnative gamefish relocated from the Yampa River to the reservoir...|$|R

The specific epithet (pauciflora) is from the Latin words paucus meaning [...] "few" [...] or [...] "little" [...] and flos meaning [...] "flower" [...] or [...] "blossom" [...] referring to the small number of flowers of this species, easily distinguishing it from others in the genus.|$|E

As this happens, nature is removed from urban areas and replaced with concrete, slate and metal surfaces; carbon emissions increase; the Urban Heat Island Effect is exacerbated and habitats are lost; so solutions need to be found to attain urban sustainability. This study examines whether rooftop gardens can provide benefits economically, environmentally and socially to urban areas and stakeholders in the UK; it considers if rooftop gardens can be easily installed in urban centres; and identifies future developments which may enhance rooftop gardens’ ability to improve urban life. By conducting nine interviews in London, Manchester and Edinburgh with Architects, Gardeners, an <b>Ecological</b> <b>consultant,</b> a Museum Manager and Head Chef of a Restaurant, this {{research has demonstrated that}} rooftop gardens can provide social, economic and environmental benefits for urban areas and their inhabitants; that significant barriers can prevent the wider establishment of rooftop gardens; and that future developments can create innovative solutions to many barriers. Although rooftop gardens can not be considered feasible methods for urban sustainability at present, they have the potential to improve urban sustainability in the future with the help of funding and improved logistical planning...|$|E
