40|$|The study {{explores the}} inter-organizational {{relationships}} (IORs) between {{one of the}} biggest utility companies in the UK and its first tier contractors in its asset management programme. UK utility companies exist in heavily regulated environments and lack direct market competition, however they still need to work collaboratively with suppliers and partners. The relationships between the utility company and contractors are complex given their and other stakeholders' interests vary. The utility company adopts a programme management approach to deliver thousands of projects with contractors to maintain existing, and establishes new, asset configurations according to a five-year cycle agreed with the lead regulator. The utility company has adopted different approaches to managing groups of projects in the past. Thus the complexity of the context can be rather intensive in terms of the large number of projects and imposed regulatory mechanism. The research question of the study can be addressed as "how do inter-organizational partnerships in a regulated utility's asset management programme evolve over the programme lifecycle?" The main methodology is mixed methods approach, a combination of qualitative (e. g. interview) and quantitative (social network analysis). Interviews help establish context and specify detailed research design. Social network analysis is used to map out IORs using sociograms The study has conducted two case studies. Case study 1 examines the social networks of the utility company's first tier contractor partners and a consulting company and explores the factors and context impeding the speedy closing down of projects. Case study 2 investigates how JORs evolve given organizational change to partner location and project <b>grouping.</b> <b>Programme</b> lifecycle sets the context for the two case studies where case study 2 looks at the definition/planning stage and execution stage of one programme and case study I examines the closure stage of another programme. The nature of programme lifecycle is rarely studied in the programme management literature. The findings show that the utility company's asset management programme faces high levels of complexity {{in a number of different}} dimensions including temporally along the programme management lifecycle. In particular, case study 2 also explores changes to the same organisation network over a period of months. The study contributes to the theoretical understanding of asset management programmes with two case studies at the definition/planning stage and execution stage and closure stage. In addition, it sheds light on the evolution of JORs along the programme lifecycle. The study contributes to the theoretical and empirical development of programme management literature, especially in the utility sector. The empirical nature of the research has direct contribution to practice, both for the UK utility sector, regulated industries and programme management practice in general.

40|$|Objectives: To design, {{implement}} {{and evaluate}} an alternative physiotherapy <b>group</b> exercise <b>programme</b> used for managing chronic {{low back pain}} (CLBP) in Primary Care. Introduction: CLBP is a disabling condition with no established standard management. Conservative treatments such as supervised exercise and manual therapy have demonstrated some benefit. <b>Group</b> exercise <b>programmes</b> used in physiotherapy practice are a cost effective treatment for managing CLBP but currently lack a combination of individualized specific exercises, one to one education and manual therapy (‘hands on’ techniques). An alternative <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> was designed to address these limitations. Methods: This thesis consisted of two stages; a survey and a mixed methods design study.

40|$|Background: Psychoeducational {{interventions}} that provide disorder-related {{information in a}} goal-oriented and structured manner have been integrated in psychiatric and psychotherapeutic approaches. The present cognitive psychoeducational <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> for inpatients with affective disorders {{is based on a}} multidimensional functional illness concept which covers aspects of vulnerability, stressors and coping strategies. It covers information about the disorder and its treatment options, building up rewarding activities, cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention. Materials und Methods: This programme was developed and modified at the University of Munich, Department of Psychiatry (LMU). A feasibility study was set up in a follow-up single group design and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed. A total of 231 patients participated in 46 groups. Results: 125 patients evaluated the effectiveness of the programme and its treatment strategies. The <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> was widely accepted among patients that were pharmacologically and psychotherapeutically treated: more than three quarters of the patients rated its contents to be informative, helpful and applicable to everyday living. Conclusions: Inpatients with affective disorders may already benefit from a structured <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> if it takes into account their cognitive and motivational deficits. The group leaders' didactic and psychotherapeutic strategies as well as the patients' exchanging ideas with each other play a central role. In the course of further investigations the programme was differentiated for patients with major depression or bipolar disorders. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Three {{randomised}} controlled {{trials have}} provided {{strong evidence that}} Weight Watchers(®) is an effective weight-loss programme but there is insufficient evidence to determine whether three other weight-loss programmes are also effective. AIM: To examine whether other group-based weight-loss programmes were not inferior to Weight Watchers. DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cohort study using a non-inferiority analysis of 3290 adults referred through primary care. METHOD Participants who met the eligibility criteria for primary care obesity management treatment chose a free programme (Weight Watchers, Rosemary Conley Diet and Fitness Clubs, Slimming World or a NHS <b>group</b> <b>programme)</b> lasting 3 months; they were weighed at 3 months (programme end) and self-reported their weight at 12 months. RESULTS: At 3 months, weight loss achieved through Rosemary Conley and Slimming World was not inferior to Weight Watchers. The NHS <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> was inferior. At 12 months Slimming World and Rosemary Conley were not inferior to Weight Watchers, although participants using Slimming World lost significantly more weight than those using Weight Watchers. Data on the NHS <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: In the short term all commercial weight-loss programmes appear to result in similar weight loss but the NHS alternative appears to produce less weight loss.

40|$|PhD (Social Work), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The general {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to evaluate a social work support <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> with informal caregivers that aimed to enhance the quality of care provided to older persons in an urban and rural community setting in Namibia. In order to achieve the {{general objectives}} of the study, the following specific objectives were formulated: * To explore how informal caregiving situations in urban and rural communities lead to elder abuse and neglect. * To describe existing literature on the various factors that contribute to elder abuse and neglect within community settings. * To develop a support <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> for informal caregivers of older persons in urban and rural community settings that aimed at preventing elder abuse and neglect. * To implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the support <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> for informal caregivers that aimed at preventing elder abuse and neglect. The thesis consists of 5 sections: Section A consists of the problem statement, research objectives, central theoretical argument and the theoretical approaches that underpin the study. Furthermore, the research methodology, the definition of key concepts and the limitation of the study are presented. Section B contains four articles that together formed part of the research outcomes. Each article can function independently with it’s own objectives and distinctive content. However, each article is also a sub-project of the umbrella research study. Therefore, some of the data have to be repeated in different sections. The four articles are: Article 1 : Informal caregiving, elder abuse and neglect in urban and rural areas of the Khomas region in Namibia: A needs assessment A needs assessment on informal caregiving situations and how it may lead to elder abuse and neglect of older persons from an urban and rural constituency in the Khomas region was explored. Data was collected through in-depth interviews with professional and community leaders. In addition, focus group discussions were held with older persons and informal caregivers in the urban and rural constituency. Article 2 : Factors contributing to elder abuse and neglect in community settings In this article, a comprehensive review of the literature pertaining to the risk and protective factors to elder abuse and neglect was done. The ecological theory was worthwhile to describe the risk factors to elder abuse and neglect. Article 3 : Designing a social work support <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> with informal caregivers of older people in Namibia A social work support <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> was developed for informal caregivers of older persons in community settings. The eight-week support <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> was developed based on a needs assessment and a comprehensive literature review, and included the following topics; the normal processes of aging, handling of difficult caregiving situations, caregiver stress, self-care of the caregiver, elder abuse and neglect and caregiver grief and loss. The planning model for group work was also utilised to design the group. Article 4 : Evaluation of the effectiveness of a support <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> with informal caregivers to prevent elder abuse and neglect An eight-week support <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> with ten female informal caregivers from an urban group and twelve informal caregivers from a rural group setting was implemented and evaluated. Standardized measuring instruments that assessed the outcome of the group at pre-test, post-test and postponed post-test were the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Potentially Harmful Behaviour (PHB) scale and the Caregiver Abuse Screen (CASE). The Group Engagement Measure (GEM) assessed the group processes at the fourth, sixth and eight group sessions. In addition, open-ended questions were used to collect qualitative data. The quantitative and qualitative evaluations indicated that both the urban and rural groups gained knowledge on aging and caregiving, and caregivers acquired vital qualities such as patience, compassion and communication skills. The process evaluation showed that caregivers from the urban group were more engaged in the group process than the rural group. Elder abuse was underreported in the study, while personal stress of caregivers reduced significantly because of the intervention. Section C consists of the summary of the most important findings and conclusions to the research study. In addition recommendations are provided. Section D consists of the annexures to the research report, such as the measuring instruments and interview schedules used for data collection. Section E contains a consolidated list of references.

40|$|Cognitive {{behaviour}} therapy (CBT) is a structured, collaborative psychotherapy, which emphasizes {{the link between}} thoughts, feelings and behaviour in maintain-ing psychological disorders. Over the last decade, CBT techniques {{have been shown to}} have a robust efficacy in studies with the child and adolescent population, and more recently, when delivered as group interventions for young people. This article describes the clinical outcome of eight adolescents who attended a 12 -session CBT <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> run once a week within a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). The group differs from previous CBT groups for adolescents described in the literature, in that those attending had a wide range of different psychiatric and developmental disorders. Most had received some type of previous psychological or psychopharmacological intervention, but had remain-ing deficits, particularly in the area of social relating. The therapeutic techniques used, the setting and the principles are described in detail. Results are presented in terms of clinical change, as reported by the adolescent’s carers, their schools and the group participants themselves. It is concluded that the CBT <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> is a user-friendly and clinically valuable adjunct to other therapeutic methods, specifically in ameliorating social skill deficits, which, untreated, would be a risk factor for relapse. Further quantitative research into the properties of the CBT <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> is indicated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Group therapy offers {{individuals}} {{the opportunity}} to learn behavioural techniques for smoking cessation, and to provide each other with mutual support. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were {{to determine the effects of}} smoking cessation programmes delivered in a group format compared to self-help materials, or to no intervention; to compare the effectiveness of group therapy and individual counselling; to determine the effect of adding group therapy to advice from a health professional or nicotine replacement and to determine the rate at which offers of group therapy are taken up. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised trials which compared group therapy with self-help, individual counselling, another intervention or usual care or waiting list control. We also considered trials which compared two <b>group</b> <b>programmes</b> with manipulation of the group interaction and social support components. We included those trials with a minimum of two group meetings, and follow-up of smoking status at least six months after the start of the programme. We excluded trials in which group therapy was provided to both active therapy and placebo arms of trials of pharmacotherapies, unless they had a factorial design. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the nature of the groups and the controls, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. Subjects lost to follow-up were counted as smokers. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies compared a <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> with a self-help programme. There was an increase in cessation with the use of a <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> (odds ratio 2. 10, 95 % confidence interval 1. 64 to 2. 70). <b>Group</b> <b>programmes</b> were more effective than no intervention or minimal contact interventions (odds ratio 1. 91, 95 % confidence interval 1. 20 to 3. 04). There was no evidence from two trials that group therapy was more effective than a similar intensity of individual counselling. There was no evidence that manipulating the social interactions between participants in a <b>group</b> <b>programme</b> had an effect on outcome. There was limited evidence that the addition of group therapy to other forms of treatment, including advice from a health professional or nicotine replacement produced extra benefit. There was variation in the extent to which those offered group therapy accepted the treatment. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that groups are better than self-help, and other less intensive interventions. There is not enough evidence on their effectiveness compared to intensive individual counselling...|$|R

Over a 3 -year period, 77 participants with clinically significant hoarding were recruited into 12 <b>group</b> <b>programmes.</b> All completed treatment; however, as this was a community-based naturalistic study, only 41 completed the post-treatment assessment. Treatment included psychoeducation about hoarding, skills training for organization and decision making, direct in-session exposure to sorting and discarding, and cognitive and behavioural techniques to support out-of-session sorting and discarding, and nonacquiring. Self-report measures used to assess treatment effect were the Savings Inventory-Revised (SI-R), Savings Cognition Inventory, and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales. Pre-post analyses indicated that after 12  weeks of treatment, hoarding symptoms as measured on the SI-R had reduced significantly, with large effect sizes reported in total and across all subscales.
