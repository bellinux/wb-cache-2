5000|$|A [...] "reentrant {{interrupt}} handler" [...] is an <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> that re-enables interrupts {{early in}} the <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler.</b> This may reduce interrupt latency.In general, while programming interrupt service routines, it is recommended to re-enable interrupts {{as soon as possible}} in the <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler.</b> This practice helps to avoid losing interrupts.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes the <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> {{will add}} longer tasks to a queue structure. Later, after the <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> has finished, these tasks are {{executed}} by the main loop. This method brings the system close to a multitasking kernel with discrete processes.|$|E
50|$|Since an <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> {{blocks the}} highest {{priority}} task from running, and since real time operating systems are designed to keep thread latency to a minimum, interrupt handlers are typically kept as short as possible. The <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> defers all interaction with the hardware if possible; typically all that is necessary is to acknowledge or disable the interrupt (so that it won't occur again when the <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> returns) and notify a task that work needs to be done. This {{can be done by}} unblocking a driver task through releasing a semaphore, setting a flag or sending a message. A scheduler often provides the ability to unblock a task from <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> context.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{low-level}} microcontroller, the chip might lack protection modes {{and have no}} memory management unit (MMU). In these chips, the execution context of an <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> will be {{essentially the same as}} the interrupted program, which typically runs on a small stack of fixed size (memory resources have traditionally been extremely scant at the low end). Nested interrupts are often provided, which exacerbates stack usage. A primary constraint on the <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> in this programming endeavour is to not exceed the available stack in the worst-case condition, requiring the programmer to reason globally about the stack space requirement of every implemented <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> and application task.|$|E

50|$|The entire VM {{state is}} held within normal ARM registers, {{allowing}} compatibility with existing operating systems and <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> unmodified.

5000|$|... iRMX {{supports}} multiple processes (known as jobs in RMX parlance) {{and multiple}} threads are supported within each process (task). In addition, <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> and threads exist {{to run in}} response to hardware interrupts. Thus, iRMX is a multi-processing, multi-threaded, pre-emptive, real-time operating system (RTOS).|$|R
50|$|Control of {{interrupt}} level {{was also used}} to synchronize access to kernel data structures. Thus, the level-3 scheduler <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> would temporarily raise IPL to 7 before accessing any actual scheduler data structures, then lower back to 3 before actually switching process contexts. However, it was not allowed for an <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> to lower IPL below that at which it was entered, since to do so could destroy {{the integrity of the}} synchronization system.|$|E
50|$|Accepting {{interrupts}} is {{the normal}} state of a domain's interrupt mechanism. When Adeos encounters a domain that is accepting interrupts it summons its <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> after having set the required CPU environment and stack {{content for the}} <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> to operate correctly. The OS then may decide to operate any number of operations including task scheduling. Once the OS is done, the pipeline proceeds as planned by propagating interrupts down the pipeline.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{operating}} systems differentiate between threads, which are {{managed by the}} kernel scheduler, and <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers,</b> which are scheduled by the hardware. This approach is not only asymmetrical in its nature, but also introduces problems relevant to real-time systems because lowpriority <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> can <b>interrupt</b> high-priority threads. We propose to internally design all threads as interrupts, thereby simplifying the managed control-flow abstractions and letting the hardware interrupt subsystem {{do most of the}} scheduling work. The resulting design of our very light-weight SLOTH system is suitable for the implementation of a wide class of embedded real-time systems, which we describe with the example of the OSEK-OS specification. We show that the design conciseness has a positive impact on the system performance, its memory footprint, and its overall maintainability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most {{real-time}} systems require responsive interrupt handling. Programming of <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> is challenging: {{in order}} to ensure responsiveness, it is often necessary to have interrupt processing enabled in the body of lower priority handlers. It would be a programming error to allow the <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> to <b>interrupt</b> each other in a cyclic fashion; it could lead to an unbounded stack. Until now, static checking for such errors could only be done using model checking. However, the needed form of model checking requires a whole-program analysis that cannot check program fragments. In this paper, we present a calculus that contains essential constructs for programming interrupt-driven systems. The calculus has a static type system that guarantees stack boundedness and enables modular type checking. A number of common programming idioms have been type checked using our prototype implementation. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of {{determining}} stack boundedness and the exact maximum stack size for three classes of interrupt-driven programs. Interrupt-driven programs are used in many real-time applications that require responsive interrupt handling. In order to ensure responsiveness, programmers often enable interrupt processing {{in the body of}} lower-priority <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers.</b> In such programs a programming error can allow <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> to be <b>interrupted</b> in cyclic fashion to lead to an unbounded stack, causing the system to crash. For a restricted class of interrupt-driven programs, we show that there is a polynomial-time procedure to check stack boundedness, while determining the exact maximum stack size is PSPACE-complete. For a larger class of programs, the two problems are both PSPACE-complete, and for the largest class of programs we consider, the two problems are PSPACE-hard and can be solved in exponential time. ...|$|R
50|$|EOIs may {{indicate}} the interrupt vector implicitly, or explicitly. An explicit EOI vector is indicated with the EOI, whereas an implicit EOI vector will typically use a vector {{as indicated by}} the PICs priority schema. For example, the highest vector in the ISR. Also, EOIs may be sent at the end of interrupt processing by an <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler,</b> or the operation of a PIC may be set to auto-EOI {{at the start of the}} <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler.</b>|$|E
50|$|Modern {{architectures}} are interrupt driven. This {{means that}} if the CPU requests data from a disk, for example, it {{does not need to}} busy-wait until the read is over; it can issue the request and continue with some other execution. When the read is over, the CPU can be interrupted and presented with the read. For interrupts, a program called an <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> is installed, and it is the <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> that handles the interrupt from the disk.|$|E

50|$|The {{events are}} created by the {{framework}} based on interpreting lower-level inputs, which may be lower-level events themselves. For example, mouse movements and clicks are interpreted as menu selections. The events initially originate from actions on the operating system level, such as interrupts generated by hardware devices, software interrupt instructions, or state changes in polling. On this level, <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> and signal handlers correspond to event handlers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Event latency is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important properties when selecting an event-driven real-time operating system. This is why in previous work on the SLOTH kernel, we suggested treating threads as ISRs—executing all application code in an interrupt context—and thereby reducing event latencies by scheduling and dispatching solely in hardware. However, to achieve these benefits, SLOTH does not support blocking threads or ISRs, but requires all control flows to have run-to-completion semantics. In this paper, we present SLEEPY SLOTH, an extension of SLOTH that provides a new generalized thread abstraction that overcomes this limitation, while still letting the hardware do all scheduling and dispatching. SLEEPY SLOTH abolishes the (artificial) distinction between threads and ISRs: Threads can be dispatched as efficiently as <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> and <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> can be scheduled as flexibly as threads. Our SLEEPY SLOTH implementation of the automotive OSEK OS standard provides much more flexibility to application developers while maintaining efficient execution of application control flows. SLEEPY SLOTH runs on commodity off-the-shelf hardware and outperforms a leading commercial OSEK implementation by a factor of 1. 3 to 19...|$|R

5000|$|SVC invokes a {{supervisory}} function - usually implemented as a [...] "closed subroutine" [...] of the system's SVC <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler.</b> Information passed {{to and from}} the SVC routines is passed in general purpose registers or in memory. [...] Under IBM-developed operating systems, return from an SVC routine is, for type 2, 3 and 4 SVC routines, via an SVC 3 (EXIT) invocation, and for other SVC types by the privileged Load PSW (LPSW) instruction, and which is executed on behalf of the SVC routine by the control program's dispatcher or SVC <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} form of <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> is {{the hardware}} <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler.</b> Hardware interrupts arise from electrical conditions or low-level protocols implemented in digital logic, are usually dispatched via a hard-coded table of interrupt vectors, asynchronously {{to the normal}} execution stream (as interrupt masking levels permit), often using a separate stack, and automatically entering into a different execution context (privilege level) {{for the duration of}} the interrupt handler's execution. In general, hardware interrupts and their handlers are used to handle high-priority conditions that require the interruption of the current code the processor is executing.|$|E
40|$|This WiP {{describes}} {{some preliminary}} results obtained when experimenting with {{the priorities of}} IRQ threads in a real-time version of the Linux kernel. IRQ threads allow to schedule <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> so that their interference on real-time activities can be controlled. However, the exper-iments {{presented in this paper}} indicate that fixed priority scheduling does not provide enough flexibility for finding a trade-off between real-time performance and throughput, and we argue that reservation-based scheduling is needed. ...|$|R
50|$|RTLinux is {{structured}} {{as a small}} core component {{and a set of}} optional components.

50|$|A {{real mode}} pointer {{is defined as}} a 16-bit segment and a 16-bit offset into that segment. The segment is {{expanded}} internally by the processor to 20 bits by shifting it 4 bits to the left, thus limiting real mode <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> to the first 1 megabyte of memory. The first 32 vectors are reserved for the processor's internal exceptions, and hardware interrupts may be mapped to any of the vectors by way of a programmable interrupt controller.|$|R

5000|$|In system programming, an {{interrupt}} is {{a signal}} to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a function called an <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the <b>interrupt</b> <b>handler</b> finishes, the processor resumes normal activities. [...] There are two types of interrupts: hardware interrupts and software interrupts.|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} in event-triggered {{real-time}} systems {{is caused by}} low-priority tasks that are implemented as <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers</b> <b>interrupting</b> and disturbing high-priority tasks that are implemented as threads. This problem is termed rate-monotonic priority inversion, and current software-based solutions are restricted in terms of more sophisticated scheduler features as demanded for instance by the AUTOSAR embedded–operating-system specification. We propose a hardware-based approach that makes use of a coprocessor to eliminate the potential priority inversion. By evaluating a prototypical implementation, we show that our approach both overcomes the restrictions of software approaches and introduces only a slight processing overhead in exchange for increased predictability.

50|$|The typical {{method of}} {{utilizing}} an interrupt vector involves reading its present value (the address), storing {{it within the}} memory space of the TSR, and installing a pointer to its own code. The stored address is called {{before or after the}} TSR has received the interrupt and has finished its processing, in effect forming a singly linked list of <b>interrupt</b> <b>handlers,</b> also called <b>interrupt</b> service routines, or ISRs.

Preemption improves latency, increases responsiveness, and makes Linux more suitable for desktop and real-time applications. Older versions of the kernel had a so-called big kernel lock for synchronization across the entire kernel, which was finally removed by Arnd Bergmann in 2011.|$|R
