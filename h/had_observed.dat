5|$|Basketball {{was first}} {{introduced}} in England between March 1892 and January 1893 {{by the president of}} the Birkenhead YMCA, C.J. Proctor, who <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> the game during a business trip to Canada. This introduction of the game led to a growth in participation in the new game of basketball initially as an internal league played at Birkenhead YMCA members (England's first Central Venue League), and later to other YMCA clubs in the Wirral and Merseyside regions.|$|E
5|$|During Stearn's initial {{four years}} in Cambridge (1929–1933), he {{published}} twenty-four papers, predominantly in the Gardeners' Chronicle and Gardening Illustrated and the Journal of Botany, his first in 1929. While working as a gardener's boy during school holidays he <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> a specimen of Campanula pusilla (Campanula cochleariifolia) with a distorted corolla. He then described and published the first appearance of the causative agent, the mould Peronospora corollaea, in Britain, using the facilities of the Botany library.|$|E
5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

However, they also observed the daughter of 266Bh, 262Db, undergo alpha decay instead of spontaneous fission: the Japanese team observed the latter decay mode.|$|E

5|$|The administration's new vigorously anti-Soviet policy {{also became}} evident when, at Kennan's suggestion, the U.S. changed its hostility to Francisco Franco's anti-communists regime in Spain {{in order to}} secure U.S. {{influence}} in the Mediterranean. Kennan <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> during 1947 that the Truman Doctrine implied a new consideration of Franco. His suggestion soon helped begin a new phase of U.S.–Spanish relations, which ended with military cooperation after 1950.|$|E

5|$|Tycho {{and others}} <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> the {{supernova}} of 1572. Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova {{and the less}} bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and discussed Kepler's supernova in 1604. Since these new stars displayed no detectable diurnal parallax, Galileo concluded that they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in the immutability of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel, {{along with}} another Uranian satellite, Ariel, was {{discovered}} by William Lassell on October 24, 1851. Although William Herschel, the discoverer of Titania and Oberon, claimed {{at the end of}} the 18th century that he <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> four additional moons of Uranus, his observations were not confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.|$|E
5|$|When the MERIS sensor {{aboard the}} European Space Agency's {{satellite}} Envisat observed and recorded Hurricane Elida at peak intensity, {{it was the}} first time that the sensor <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> a hurricane.

5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater <b>had</b> <b>observed.</b> It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
5|$|Aruba competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Their {{participation}} marked their sixth Olympic appearance, {{and included}} the smallest number of athletes {{that had ever}} represented Aruba in its history. Two Arubans competed in the Olympic games: Jan Roodzant participated as a swimmer, and Fiderd Vis participated in judo. The Aruban delegation arrived in Beijing between August 1 and August 4, including the athletes, coaches, and various officials from both the IOC and the Aruban Olympic Committee (Comité Olimpico Arubano, COA), Aruba's local Olympic committee. Fiderd Vis came to Beijing on special invitation from the IOC, which <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> his progress while he trained in Brazil. Vis was the flagbearer in the opening ceremony, while Roodzant was so in the closing ceremony. Both athletes were eliminated in the preliminary rounds on August 12, 2008; consequently, Aruba did not earn any medals.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} objectives comprised commercial, {{scientific and}} geographical goals. He considered forming {{a company to}} exploit the extensive guano deposits that he <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> during his 1894–95 voyage, but this came to nothing. In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could {{be carried out by}} a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the South Magnetic Pole. The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines—magnetism, meteorology, biology, zoology, taxidermy and cartography. Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the geographical South Pole itself. With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick {{was himself}} {{a critic of}} Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose {{approach}} he considered careless and focused on technology {{at the expense of}} science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence <b>had</b> <b>observed.</b> This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} Ellet {{published}} several books. In 1839 she wrote The Characters of Schiller, a critical {{essay on the}} writer Friedrich Schiller including her translation {{of many of his}} poems. She wrote Scenes in the Life of Joanna of Sicily, a history of the lifestyles of female nobility, and Rambles about the Country, a lively description of the scenery she <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> in her travels through the United States, in 1840. She continued writing poems, translations and essays on European literature which she contributed to the American Monthly, the North American Review, the Southern Literary Messenger, the Southern Quarterly Review and other periodicals. Ellet wrote abundantly {{in a wide variety of}} genres.|$|E
5|$|Following Mary's childless death, her {{half-sister}} Elizabeth {{inherited the}} throne. One {{of the most}} important concerns during Elizabeth's early reign was religion. Elizabeth could not be Roman Catholic, as that church considered her illegitimate. At the same time, she <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> the turmoil brought about by Edward's introduction of radical Protestant reforms. Communion with the Roman Catholic Church was again severed by Elizabeth. She relied primarily on her chief advisors, Sir William Cecil, as her Secretary of State, and Sir Nicholas Bacon, as the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, for direction on the matter. Chiefly she supported her father's idea of reforming the church but made some minor adjustments. In this way, Elizabeth and her advisors aimed at a church that included most opinions.|$|E

5|$|Following World War I, in the {{capacity}} as an engineering advisor, Verville joined General Billy Mitchell and his aide, Lieutenant Clayton Bissell, on their sailing trip to Europe in December 1921. The three men toured France, Italy, Germany, Holland, and England in order {{to check on the}} European progress of aviation. From their research they produced a 206-page report, which was published as an U.S. Army Air Service Information Circular. General Mitchell asked Verville to incorporate some of the European developments they <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> and to produce a plane for the U.S. Army Air Service's participation in the upcoming 1922 National Air Races.|$|E
5|$|Healy {{assessed}} {{that his}} company had encountered a force of at least company-size.

Throughout the day Viet Cong reconnaissance parties, perhaps including those that had been contacted intermittently, <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> the approaching Australian force on a line leading directly to the U1 headquarters. During the fighting the Viet Cong company commander—Nguyen Van Bao—had split his force into two, allocating one platoon to fight the advancing Australians, and the other two to protect the headquarters. Following the Australian withdrawal Van Bao had also withdrawn, pre-empting the ensuing barrage, yet the U1 base remained in communist hands.|$|E
5|$|In 1735 Brandt {{proposed}} {{to make the}} presence or absence of malleability the principle of this classification. On that basis he separated mercury from the metals. The same view was adopted by Vogel (1755, Institutiones Chemiæ) and Buffon (1785, Histoire Naturelle des Minéraux). In the interim, Braun <b>had</b> <b>observed</b> the solidification of mercury by cold in 1759–60. This was confirmed by Hutchins and Cavendish in 1783. The malleability of mercury then became known, and it was included amongst the metals.|$|E
