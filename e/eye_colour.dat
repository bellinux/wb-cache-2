5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The father's semen and the mother's menses have {{movements}} that encode their parental characteristics. The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define the form or eidos of the species, while {{the movements of}} both the father's and the mother's uniform parts define features other than the form, such as the father's <b>eye</b> <b>colour</b> or the mother's nose shape.|$|E
5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} in humans includes blue <b>eye</b> <b>colour</b> and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their skin pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the sinking, several ships sailed to the disaster area to recover victims' bodies. The White Star Line chartered the cable ship Mackay-Bennett from Halifax, Nova Scotia to retrieve bodies. Three other ships followed in the search: the cable ship Minia, the lighthouse supply ship Montmagny and the sealing vessel Algerine. Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Upon recovery, each body retrieved by the Mackay-Bennett was numbered and given as detailed a description as possible to help aid in identification. The physical appearance of each body—height, weight, age, hair and <b>eye</b> <b>colour,</b> visible birthmarks, scars or tattoos, was catalogued and any personal effects on the bodies were gathered and placed in small canvas bags corresponding to their number.|$|E
50|$|Microscopes {{are used}} to observe the {{physical}} parameters of fibre, yarn, fabric and other textile product which cannot be observed with necked <b>eyes.</b> <b>Colour</b> measurement and matching is a common feature of dyeing and printing processes. This laboratory includes different types of optical and video microscopes, <b>Colour</b> <b>Eye</b> and other <b>colour</b> measuring equipments.|$|R
50|$|At first sight, the {{two women}} and their two babies appear almost identical, each mother wearing white clothes {{decorated}} with elaborate lace and jewellery, and each baby swaddled in a scarlet christening robe. On closer inspection, {{the details of the}} clothing of each pair and their <b>eye</b> <b>colours</b> differ. The women may be sisters, and they are often thought to be twins due to their close physical resemblance, but the different <b>eye</b> <b>colours</b> - one blue, one brown - mean that are not identical.|$|R
5|$|Head: The head {{should be}} broad with {{slightly}} pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate <b>eye</b> <b>colours</b> are brown and hazel. The lining {{around the eyes}} should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and set slightly above the eyes.|$|R
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adults, {{but lack}} throat hackles, and sometimes have a pink fleshy gape. The bill is shorter and shallower; its base can be pinkish and the tip can be light grey. The plumage is more ruffled and softer in appearance, lacks the glossy highlights and often having a brown tinge. The bare {{skin on the}} throat is pink in bird that have recently left the nest. <b>Eye</b> <b>colour</b> varies with age, gradually lightening from juvenile to adult. Nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey irises, juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises, and immature birds have hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Immature birds older than one year develop hackles, while some pink remains in the gape until the bird is {{two or three years}} of age.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} the specimen, van Grouw {{noticed that the}} legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob {{at the base of}} its bill, {{similar to that of the}} Nicobar pigeon. This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. It is unknown whether this represents the natural <b>eye</b> <b>colour</b> of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.|$|E

50|$|There are 30 playable characters, many {{of which}} are remodeled {{versions}} of one another, with minor variation in such things as hair and <b>eye</b> <b>colours</b> and hair lengths. Only the more important characters in the game are given a unique appearance. These characters include Robert, David, and Alfred.|$|R

25|$|The Asian {{domestic}} cat breed {{is related}} to the Burmese; the Asian is physically similar but comes in different patterns and colours. The Singapura is always homozygous for the Burmese gene, combining it with a ticked tabby pattern. Snow Bengals with <b>eye</b> <b>colours</b> other than blue also have the gene.|$|R
25|$|Some colored {{contact lenses}} {{completely}} cover the iris, thus dramatically changing <b>eye</b> <b>colour.</b> Other colored contact lenses merely tint the iris, highlighting and beautifying its natural colour. A new trend in Japan, South Korea and China is the circle contact lens, which extend {{the appearance of}} the iris onto the sclera by having a dark tinted area all around. The result is an appearance of a bigger, wider iris, a look reminiscent of dolls' eyes.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{have only}} one class of pigment cell, the {{mammalian}} equivalent of melanophores, to generate skin, hair, and <b>eye</b> <b>colour.</b> For this reason, and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise, melanophores {{are by far the}} most widely studied chromatophore. However, there are differences between the biology of melanophores and that of melanocytes. In addition to eumelanin, melanocytes can generate a yellow/red pigment called phaeomelanin.|$|E
25|$|A {{genetic map}} is a map {{based on the}} {{frequencies}} of recombination between markers during crossover of homologous chromosomes. The greater the frequency of recombination (segregation) between two genetic markers, the further apart they are assumed to be. Conversely, the lower the frequency of recombination between the markers, the smaller the physical distance between them. Historically, the markers originally used were detectable phenotypes (enzyme production, <b>eye</b> <b>colour)</b> derived from coding DNA sequences; eventually, confirmed or assumed noncoding DNA sequences such as microsatellites or those generating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been used.|$|E

5000|$|Petz's genes carry {{through to}} their {{offspring}} but can mutate, resulting in different fur and <b>eye</b> <b>colours</b> {{to that of}} the parents. The shape and size of body parts is also inherited in [...] "sections;" [...] e.g. the legs, head, and ears could be inherited from one parent and the feet, tail, and body could be inherited from the other parent.|$|R
50|$|Van-patterned Turkish Vans are not {{prone to}} deafness, because their {{phenotype}} {{is associated with}} the van pattern (Sv) semi-dominant gene. Solid-white Turkish angoras carry the epistatic (masking) white colour (W) dominant gene associated with white fur, blue eyes and often deafness. All white Van cats may share this gene. All three types of cat may exhibit <b>eye</b> <b>colours</b> that are amber, blue or odd. Deafness is principally associated with cats having two blue eyes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>colour</b> {{varies from}} brown to blue, and {{occasionally}} eyes of differing colour occur; {{this is usually}} seen with merles. The ears of the Border Collie are also variable — some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar {{to those of the}} rough Collie). Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general a dog's appearance is considered by the American Border Collie Association to be irrelevant. It is considered much more useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability than by its looks.|$|E
25|$|In {{the genome}} of an organism, each gene {{is located at}} a {{specific}} place called the locus for that gene. Allelic variations at these loci cause phenotypic variation within species (e.g. hair colour, <b>eye</b> <b>colour).</b> However, most alleles {{do not have an}} observable impact on the phenotype. Within a population new alleles generated by mutation either die out or spread throughout the population. When a population is split into different isolated populations (by either geographical or ecological factors), mutations that occur after the split will be present only in the isolated population. Random fluctuation of allele frequencies also produces genetic differentiation between populations. This process is known as genetic drift. By examining the differences between allele frequencies between the populations and computing genetic distance, we can estimate how long ago the two populations were separated.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player creates their character, the Hunter. The player determines the basic details of the Hunter; gender, hairstyle, name, skin colour, body shape, voice, and <b>eye</b> <b>colour,</b> are some of the details the player determines. The player also chooses a starting class, known as an 'Origin', which provides a basic backstory for the Hunter and sets the player's starting attributes. The Origins allow the player's Hunter to have a distinct play style, which, along with physical appearance, give the Hunter a unique personality. For example, one Origin may describe the Hunter as a cowardly weakling, which would indicate the player prefers to avoid conflict, while another Origin may describe the Hunter as being a ruthless, killing machine, which would indicate that the Hunter prefers to engage in combat. Another way the player defines their Hunter is by choosing what brotherhood they are a member of. These religious societies, known as 'Covenants', each have their own views on the world of Yharnam.|$|E

500|$|Evolution in organisms occurs through {{changes in}} {{heritable}} traits—the inherited characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, <b>eye</b> <b>colour</b> is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the [...] "brown-eye trait" [...] {{from one of}} their parents. Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome (genetic material) is called its genotype.|$|E
500|$|Many animal body-parts, such as skin, eyes, feathers, fur, hair, {{scales and}} cuticles, contain {{pigments}} in specialized cells called chromatophores. [...] These cells {{are found in}} a wide range of animals including amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and cephalopods. Mammals and birds, in contrast, have a class of cells called melanocytes for colouration. [...] The term chromatophore can also refer to coloured, membrane-associated vesicles found in some forms of photosynthetic bacteria.

2500|$|Blue eyes do not {{actually}} contain any blue pigment. <b>Eye</b> <b>colour</b> {{is determined by}} two factors: the pigmentation of the eye's iris and the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris. [...] In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black. The appearance of blue, green, and hazel eyes results from the Rayleigh scattering {{of light in the}} stroma, an optical effect similar to what accounts for the blueness of the sky. The irises of the eyes of people with blue eyes contain less dark melanin than those of people with brown eyes, which means that they absorb less short-wavelength blue light, which is instead reflected out to the viewer. <b>Eye</b> <b>colour</b> also varies depending on the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-coloured eyes.|$|E

2500|$|Chromatophores {{are largely}} {{responsible}} for generating skin and <b>eye</b> <b>colour</b> in ectothermic animals and are generated in the neural crest during embryonic development. Mature chromatophores are grouped into subclasses based on their colour (more properly [...] "hue") under white light: xanthophores (yellow), erythrophores (red), iridophores (reflective / iridescent), leucophores (white), melanophores (black/brown), and cyanophores (blue).|$|E
2500|$|... ‘La Bella’ (Palazzo Pitti, Florence) {{has been}} {{discussed}} {{as an alternative to}} Titian’s 1536 portrait in Vienna, because the commission from the 60-year-old patron was for a rejuvenated portrait; if La Bella were Isabella, <b>eye</b> <b>colour,</b> hair colour, eyebrows and general appearance would homogenize in all known portraits, allowing potential links toward further identifications.|$|E
2500|$|Dogs bred {{for show}} are more {{homogeneous}} in appearance than working Border Collies, since {{to win in}} conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and colour.
