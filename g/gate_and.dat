5|$|Edward {{appears in}} his world, reunited with Alphonse and their friend Winry Rockbell, who fits Edward with new automail limbs. The Amestris {{military}} manages to stop most of Eckhart's soldiers {{with the help}} of Roy Mustang. Edward battles Eckhart before Alphonse transmutes parts of his soul to a group of armors, which attack her and force her to retreat. Upon reappearing in her own world, Eckhart is covered with shadow creatures from the <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> killed by an officer out of alarm of her new, monstrous appearance. Understanding the danger posed by the connection between the two worlds, Edward returns to Earth to seal the Gate on the other side, knowing he will be trapped there forever. Instead of sealing the Gate on the other world's side as per Edward's request, however, Alphonse has Mustang seal the <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> follows Edward to remain with his brother. Following Alfons' funeral, the Elric brothers leave Munich with Noah, intending to close the <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> destroy the weapons meant to be used in Hitler's attack. They enjoy their new lives together as they leave Germany with Noah, while on the Elric brothers homeworld, their friends go back to their normal lives.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the medieval}} walls of Mdina were {{gradually}} dismantled between the 1530s and 1720s, when the city's fortifications were being upgraded by the Hospitallers. One {{of the most significant}} visible remnants {{of the medieval}} fortifications is the Greeks <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding curtain walls, which still retains its medieval form apart from the outer portal which was built in the 18th century. Parts of the double walls, including the remains of two gun loops, still stand between the <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> the Torre dello Standardo. Most of the northern and eastern walls date back to the medieval period, although some sections were rebuilt by the Hospitallers. The northern ramparts contain a medieval wall tower, while the remains of Byzantine antemurals and the foundations of a late 15th-century artillery platform have been found in the eastern walls.|$|E

In 2006, they were re-released with Baldur's <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> Tales of the Sword Coast as Baldur's Gate: 4 in 1 Boxset.

5|$|The {{building}} of the Parliament House {{was a part of}} the City Gate Project, which was meant to redevelop the entrance of Valletta. The project consisted of the demolition of the fourth City <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> the Freedom Square Arcade and the construction of the fifth City <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> the Parliament House. In addition, the ruins of the Royal Opera House were converted into an open-air theatre known as Pjazza Teatru Rjal. The City Gate project was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano, and the plans were revealed on 27 June 2009. The Grand Harbour Regeneration Corporation paid Piano €6.6 million for his work on the project.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the complexity of}} superscalar decode/issue logic assuming primitive gates. We show, assuming that the issuing is performed {{on the base of}} opcodes, that the complexity of checking data dependencies is in the order of k 3 <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> log k <b>gate</b> delay, k being the issue width, when assuming infinite resources and in-order issuing. In assuming out-of-order issuing the complexities are in the order of 2 k <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> log k <b>gate</b> delay, <b>and</b> for out-of-order issuing with renaming in the order of 2 k <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> k <b>gate</b> delay. When the resources are restricted we show that the complexity is in the order of n k <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> k 2 log n delay, n being the cardinality of the instruction set. Finally, by assuming that the issuing is performed using grouping of instructions rather than opcode specific description the complexity is in the order of m k <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> k 2 log m delay, where m is the number of instruction groups. 1.
