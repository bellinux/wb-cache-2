5|$|Brakk was {{a primal}} zerg pack leader on Zerus. When Sarah Kerrigan arrived on Zerus, Brakk {{declared}} that her zerg intruded on <b>his</b> <b>territory.</b> Wishing {{to stop her}} from waking Zurvan, he sent his pack to destroy the quillgor meat that her drones were harvesting. When this was unsuccessful, he personally led an attack on her hive cluster and was killed. The remnants of Brakk's pack were destroyed shortly afterwards by Yagdra's pack.|$|E
5|$|It is a migratory {{passerine}} which {{winters in}} southern and western Europe, southern Asia and north Africa. Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named onomatopoeically for its simple chiff-chaff song. It {{has a number}} of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> against rivals, and attacks potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{agreement}} between Salih and Mansur fell through {{as the latter}} abandoned most of his promises to Salih, including giving his daughter's hand in marriage and according the Kilab their share of Aleppo's revenues. Salih retaliated by besieging Aleppo, while the Kilab and their Bedouin allies plundered the countryside. Mansur appealed for Byzantine intervention and warned Emperor Basil II that if left unchecked, the Bedouin uprising could spread to <b>his</b> <b>territory.</b> Basil dispatched 1,000 Armenian relief troops in response, but withdrew them after Salih informed him of Mansur's treachery and pledged his goodwill to the Byzantines. Basil may have also acquiesced to Salih to avoid provoking Bedouin raids against <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> as the emirates of both the Kilab and their Numayri kinsmen bordered the Byzantines. The withdrawal of Byzantine troops weakened Mansur's position further and strengthened Salih, who dispatched {{one of his sons}} to Constantinople to pay allegiance to Basil.|$|E

5|$|Problems rose soon {{already in}} the summer of 1461, when Pavao Špirančić, who governed Croatia as ban on behalf of the Hungarian king and {{frequently}} clashed with King Thomas, seized a border town. By late summer, Stephen and Kosača were preparing to strike him jointly and divide <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> between themselves. Venice objected, fearing that the fortresses Klis and Ostrovica, paramount to the defense of Dalmatia, might fall to the Ottomans if first taken over by the Bosnians.|$|E
5|$|The National Alliance and Resistance Records {{released}} a similar game, White Law, in June 2003. It starred an Irish-American police officer taking up arms to protect <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> from racial minorities.

The National Alliance intended to create an entire line of racist games, but no more have surfaced.|$|E

5|$|Writing to {{the king}} of Spain in late August 1535, Cerezeda {{reported}} that Sicumba had attacked Puerto de Caballos and killed a number of Spaniards there. The Spanish wife {{of one of the}} dead was seized by the Indians, and Sicumba took her as his woman. Cerezeda launched an attack upon Sicumba while de la Cueva was still in Higueras, and gained a victory, but Sicumba launched renewed resistance as soon as the Spanish left <b>his</b> <b>territory,</b> and began to organise regional indigenous resistance to the Spanish incursions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, {{it is more than}} likely that on Somairle's demise, <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E
5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and <b>his</b> <b>territory.</b> The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E

5|$|As {{they return}} to the human world, Yusuke is {{stripped}} of his detective title as King Enma orders he be captured and executed in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him {{to go on a}} rampage in the human world. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to <b>his</b> <b>territory,</b> is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits <b>his</b> <b>territory.</b> Yusuke takes initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated and knocked unconscious. Yusuke awakens days later to find that the tournament has ended and that a similar competition is to be held every so often to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. Yusuke stays in the Demon Plane for a while longer, but eventually returns to the human world after several years to be with Keiko.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930–31 season, {{the team}} was openly selling players to make ends meet. Star defenceman King Clancy was sold to Toronto for an {{unprecedented}} $35,000 and two players on October 11, 1930. The team fell into last place {{for the first time}} since 1898. In 1931, a potential deal arose with the owners of Chicago Stadium, including grain magnate James E. Norris, who wanted to move the team to Chicago, but the deal was vetoed by Chicago Black Hawks owner Frederic McLaughlin who did not want another team in <b>his</b> <b>territory.</b> Norris bought the bankrupt Detroit Falcons instead and turned them into the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{interests}} in the area were damaged when de Courcy lost <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> in eastern Ulster to his rival Hugh de Lacy in 1203. John de Courcy, with help from his wife's brother King Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson (Raghnall mac Gofraidh) and perhaps from Donnchadh, tried to regain his principality, but was initially unsuccessful. De Courcy's fortunes were boosted when Hugh de Lacy (then Earl of Ulster) and his associate William III de Briouze, themselves fell foul of John; the king campaigned in Ireland against them in 1210, a campaign that forced de Briouze to return to Wales and de Lacy to flee to St Andrews in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Following the Qatari–Bahraini War in 1868, British representatives signed another {{agreement}} with the Al Khalifas. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent. In return the British promised to protect Bahrain from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack. More importantly the British promised to support {{the rule of the}} Al Khalifa in Bahrain, securing its unstable position as rulers of the country. Other agreements in 1880 and 1892 sealed the protectorate status of Bahrain to the British.|$|E
5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions {{encapsulated}} {{all that}} {{was wrong with the}} Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians highlight the affair {{as one of the most}} significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E
5|$|Henry II died in 1189 and was {{succeeded by}} Richard I. Rhys {{considered}} {{that he was}} no longer bound by the agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding <b>his</b> <b>territory.</b> He ravaged Pembroke, Haverfordwest, and Gower and captured the castles of St. Clear's, Laugharne, and Llansteffan. Richard's brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September and tried to make peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard was not prepared to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.|$|E

5|$|However, in {{the same}} year Alfred won a decisive victory against the Danes at the Battle of Edington, and he {{exploited}} the fear of the Viking threat to raise large numbers of men and using a network of defended towns called burhs to defend <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> and mobilise royal resources. Suppressing internal opposition to his rule, Alfred contained the invaders within a region known as the Danelaw. Under his son, Edward the Elder, and his grandson, Æthelstan, Wessex expanded further north into Mercia and the Danelaw, and by the 950s and the reigns of Eadred and Edgar, York was finally permanently retaken from the Vikings. The West Saxon rulers were now kings of the Angelcynn, that is of the whole English folk.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Kundajiq {{initially}} accepted, but in 880/1 {{the coalition}} against him was renewed, and open warfare broke out. This time, Ibn Kundajiq was victorious {{in a battle}} fought in April/May 881, driving his opponents before him to Amid, which he left under siege. A few inconclusive skirmishes followed, and the situation was not resolved {{by the time of}} Isa's death in 882/3, as Ibn Kundajiq became involved in the Abbasid efforts to recover Syria from the Tulunids. Isa was succeeded by his son Ahmad, who ruled the Diyar Bakr as an independent prince. Ahmad expanded <b>his</b> <b>territory</b> into southern Armenia, and, after Ibn Kundajiq's death in 891/2, occupied even Mosul. In the next year, however, the resurgent Abbasids under Caliph al-Mu'tadid wrested the city from him, and in 899 the rest of the family's Jaziran domains from Ahmad's heir, Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|In 1171 Rhys {{made peace}} with King Henry and was {{confirmed}} in possession of his recent conquests {{as well as being}} named Justiciar of South Wales. He maintained good relations with King Henry until the latter's death in 1189. Following Henry's death Rhys revolted against Richard I and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding <b>his</b> <b>territory,</b> capturing a number of castles. In his later years Rhys had trouble keeping control of his sons, particularly Maelgwn and Gruffydd, who maintained a feud with each other. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196 and captured a number of castles. The following year he died unexpectedly and was buried in St David's Cathedral.|$|E
