50|$|A. terreus causes {{opportunistic}} infections mostly in immunocompromised {{people such as}} COPD patients who are taking corticosteroids, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatment, or HIV/AIDS patients. In an immunocompetent individual, the inhalation of spores initiates an immediate release of macrophages and neutrophils. In an <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>individual,</b> this response is less vigorous. Most of these individuals suffer from neutropenia, which makes them less capable of defending themselves. In addition, A. terreus releases toxic metabolites that attack immune cells like neutrophils which provide the suitable conditions for the fungus to thrive.|$|E

Skin ulcer biopsy was positive by immunohistochemical staining for CMV infected endothelial cells.

40|$|Abstract- Pulmonary {{nocardiosis}} (PN) is an infrequent {{and severe}} infection due to Nocardia spp. It {{is more common}} in <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>individual.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the clinical features, evolution and prognosis of PN in immuno-competent hosts. The study group comprised 4 consecutive immuno-competent patients with pulmonary nocardiosis acquired in a community setting, diagnosed and followed in a tertiary care hospital. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary tuberculosis were the underlying diseases. Two patients had received anti-tubercular treatment before isolation of Nocardia spp. Clinical course was chronic and diagnosis was delayed 2 weeks or more in two out of four patients. Lobar or multilobar condensation was the most frequent radiographic pattern. The disease remained localized in the lung in all the four cases, with a trend toward chronicity in one with bronchiectasis. The following conclusions were reached: (1) In our geographical setting Nocardia presents as a subacute or chronic pulmonary infection, mainly outside the hospital. (2) Pulmonary nocardiosis is difficult to diagnose, diagnosis is frequently delayed and a high level of suspicion is, thus, required in patients with underlying diseases e. g. COPD, pulmonary tuberculosis. (3) Diagnosis requires a high clinical suspicion, and can be made on the basis of a microbiological investigation of sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. (4) The treatment of choice for this infection includes cotrimoxazole but some Nocardia spp. may show resistance to this drug...|$|E

We analyzed the {{prevalence of}} these polyomaviruses in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and bone marrow samples from PML patients, <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>individuals</b> with or without HIV, and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Distinct PCR tests for KIPyV, WUPyV and MCPyV DNA performed in two independent laboratories detected low levels of MCPyV DNA only in 1 / 269 samples. The infrequent detections of these viruses in multiple samples from <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>individuals</b> including those with PML suggest that their reactivation mechanisms may be different from that of JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) and that they do not {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of PML...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} animal-associated infections occur in persons {{infected}} with the human immunode-ficiency virus (HIV), including those due to Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium, Microsporida, Salmonella, Campylo-bacter, Giardia, Rhodococcus equi, Rochalimaea, and Listeria monocyto-genes. Most of these infections, {{with the exception of}} those due to Rochalimaea, appear to be acquired by the <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>individual</b> from sources other than exposure to animals. Drs. Glaser and colleagues review our current understanding of the role of exposure to animals, especially pets, in the natural history of these opportunistic infections. They suggest that the risk of zoonotic transmission is small and offer practical suggestions designed to reduce this low risk. They conclude that the benefits of animal companionship outweigh the risks to patients and that prohibition of pet ownership by individuals infected with HIV is not warranted. -John P. Phair Most people, including those {{infected with the}} human im-munodeficiency virus (HIV), have contact with animals. Al-most 60 % of households in the United States have pets [I], and the level of pet ownership apparently remains constant even among those persons with HIV who are at risk for oppor-tunistic infections [2]. Aside from direct encounters with pets or other animals, indirect contact may also occur through such means as contaminated food and water. Animals are involved in the epidemiology of many of the AIDS-defining infectious diseases and several other opportu-nistic infections in HIV-infected persons (table I). The de-gree to which infected animals may contribute to these diseases varies widely-some of these infections are well-re-cognized zoonoses that are naturally transmitted between vertebrates and humans. Others are associated with, but not directly transmitted by, animals; the role of animals in the transmission ofmost ofthese diseases has not been fully clari-fied...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cystoisospora (Isospora) belli is a coccidian, {{protozoan}} parasite that {{resides in}} the gastrointestinal tract of humans. It is mainly reported from HIV-positive individuals. However, a few cases {{have been reported in}} other <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>individuals</b> including renal transplant patients, and those with lymphoma and leukemia. Materials and Methods: During a period of 5 years (2008 - 2012), approximately 1700 stool samples of immunosuppressed patients were screened for the presence of opportunistic parasitic infections by a modified acid fast staining technique. Results: A total of 41 C. belli were reported, out of which 30 were HIV-positive individuals while 11 were HIV negative. The latter <b>individuals</b> were also <b>immunosuppressed</b> due to prolonged use of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs. Twenty-six out of 30 HIV-positive patients and all the HIV-negative individuals with C. belli infection had diarrhea. Conclusion: All <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>individuals</b> should be examined for the presence of opportunistic coccidian parasitic infections and treated accordingly and alternatively, isolation of opportunistic parasites should trigger a hunt for immunocompromised state to reduce the morbidity and mortality in such patients...|$|R

40|$|Aspergillus {{species are}} {{ubiquitous}} fungi {{and have been}} implicated as the causative agents {{of a variety of}} lung disorders in humans. These disorders include allergic, saprophytic, and systemic manifestations. The allergic disorders mainly affect atopic persons, and invasive or systemic diseases affect <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>individuals.</b> Immunodiagnosis can help the practitioner diagnose these diseases. Demonstration of circulating antibodies is a useful criterion, but the lack of dependable and standardized antigens is a limiting factor in the diagnosis of most Aspergillus-induced diseases.

Aims: To study the possible role of EBV in PCNSL in immunocompetent individuals. Setting and Design: Retrospective study. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with PCNSL were studied immunohistochemically with antibodies to CD 45, CD 20, CD 3 and EBV latent membrane protein- 1 (EBV LMP- 1). In situ hybridization was done in 19 patients where enough tissue was available using a specific oligonucleotide probe for EBV-Early RNA (EBER). Results: All the patients were immunocompetent and mean age was 41. 6 years. Histologically they were diffuse large cell lymphoma: 25 (83. 3 &#x 0025;) were B cell, 1 (3. 3 &#x 0025;) was T cell and 4 (13. 3 &#x 0025;) were unclassified.
