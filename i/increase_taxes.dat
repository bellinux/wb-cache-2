5|$|Rivers {{introduced}} legislation to <b>increase</b> <b>taxes</b> on medical marijuana.

5|$|Desha {{gradually}} became more conservative {{after his return}} to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy. He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe's request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large standing army provided the advocates of a larger federal government with an excuse to <b>increase</b> <b>taxes,</b> and proposed that the standing army should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 7565. The version of the bill passed by the Senate, however, required a standing army of 15,000 men. The legislation was referred to a conference committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.|$|E

The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.|$|E

25|$|The suddenness of the €85 billion bailout deal led to {{worries that}} Irish {{sovereignty}} had been lost, {{and that the}} Irish economy might not grow fast enough to afford the bailout costs.

25|$|The {{use of the}} Sunni Islam as a legitimisation of the Ottoman dynastic rule {{is closely}} linked to Sultan Süleyman I and his kazasker and later Schaykh al-Islām Ebussuud Efendi.
