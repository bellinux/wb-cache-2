50|$|A {{reversing}} <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> (also {{commonly called}} a non-tilting mixer) {{is a type}} of concrete mixer that produces concrete in single batches. The entire drum rotates around its axis as materials are loaded through a charge chute {{at one end of the}} drum and exit through a discharge chute at the opposite end of the drum.|$|E
5000|$|Drum mixers (reversing <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> and {{tilting drum}} mixers), used where large volumes (batch sizes of [...] ) are being produced. This type of mixer dominates the ready-mixed market {{as it is}} capable of high {{production}} speeds, ideal for slump concrete, and where overall cost of production is important. Drum mixers have the lowest maintenance and operating cost of the three styles of mixers.|$|E
5000|$|Industrial sized {{reversing}} <b>drum</b> <b>mixers</b> {{can have}} a capacity of 9 m³ and can produce a mid quality concrete mix {{in as little as}} 40 seconds. Reversing <b>drum</b> <b>mixers</b> provide for efficient mixing and leave very little build up within the mixer. [...] Wear is reduced as the drum rests on rubber or polyurethane wheels and there is no steel on steel contact. There is no direct contact between the stationary charge and discharge chutes and the rotating drum. The flexible tires, absorb vibration and make for low maintenance and a quiet operation. The efficient mixing within the concrete, results in a reduction in wear of the drum liners. The reversing <b>drum</b> <b>mixers</b> are known for the extremely low maintenance and operating costs, yet a good mixing effect relative to other <b>drum</b> <b>mixers.</b>|$|R

As early as 1916, Stephen Stepanian of Columbus, Ohio, developed a self-discharging motorized transit mixer that was the predecessor of the modern ready-mix concrete truck, but the patent that Stepanian filed in 1916 was rejected in 1919.

50|$|A pugmill or {{pug mill}} is a machine in which clay or other {{materials}} are mixed {{into a plastic}} state or a similar machine for the trituration of ore. Industrial applications are found in pottery, bricks, cement and {{some parts of the}} concrete and asphalt mixing processes. A pugmill may be a fast continuous mixer. A continuous pugmill can achieve a thoroughly mixed, homogeneous mixture in a few seconds, and the right machines can be matched to the right application by taking into account the factors of agitation, drive assembly, inlet, discharge, cost and maintenance. Mixing materials at optimum moisture content requires the forced mixing action of the pugmill paddles, while soupy materials might be mixed in a <b>drum</b> <b>mixer.</b> A typical pugmill consists of a horizontal boxlike chamber with a top inlet and a bottom discharge at the other end, 2 shafts with opposing paddles, and a drive assembly. Some of the factors affecting mixing and residence time are the number {{and the size of the}} paddles, paddle swing arc, overlap of left and right swing arc, size of mixing chamber, length of pugmill floor, and material being mixed.|$|E

40|$|Reclaimed asphalt, {{obtained}} by milling of asphalt road layers can be re-used at once or stored. In {{the case of}} storage, an heterogeneity issue may occur when several types of materials, with different origins are mixed. At the scale of a storage zone or a stock pile, composition and properties of the reclaimed asphalts will be different, including variations of the final material properties, constraints for the stock manager, and the necessary adaptation of the manufacturing process. The reclaimed asphalt heterogeneity issue and the specific manufacturing process used in <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> asphalt plants {{have to be taken}} into account in ordre to optimize the laboratory mix design study as well as the physical, chemical and environmental criteria set in European legislation. The objective of this research work is to estimate the RAP heterogeneity in a material stockpile, as well as to improve the laboratory mixing procedure in order to better reproduce in laboratory the specific manufacturing process which can be found in <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> asphalt plants for these materials. The most relevant parameters are identified and a parametric study is carried out to estimate their level of influence on the behavior of the final bituminous material...|$|E

A two-electrode electrical capacitance method is used to measure the permittivity of mixtures while flowing in a 1 -D set up. An emphasis is placed on the possibility of following homogeneity evolution through permittivity measurement, without the necessity to calculate the volumetric proportions of each component from an effective medium formulation.

40|$|Composition {{quantification}} in granular mixtures through colorimetric imaging is addressed. Digital {{images of}} binary mixtures have been analysed {{with three different}} colour spaces: gray scale, L⁎a⁎b⁎ and HSV. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on a small scale <b>drum</b> <b>mixer.</b> After blending, the mixtures have been impregnated with a binder, solidified and sliced. The colorimetric analysis has been carried out on the interior of the granular bed. Results obtained using the three colour-spaces have been performed and compared. The HSV colour space yields better results in terms of accuracy and computational effort. Effectiveness of HSV relies on its independence from shadows that are a distinctive feature of pictures of the three-dimensional granular surface. Very important, HSV does not require a calibration curve to convert colour information into composition, differently from the other colour spaces...|$|E

40|$|Mixtures of {{granular}} media often exhibit {{size segregation}} along {{the axis of}} a partially-filled, horizontal, rotating cylinder. Previous experiments have observed axial bands of segregation that grow from concentration fluctuations and merge in a manner analogous to spinodal decomposition. We have observed that a new dynamical state precedes this effect in certain mixtures: bi-directional traveling waves. By preparing initial conditions, {{we found that the}} wave speed decreased with wavelength. Such waves appear to be inconsistent with simple PDE models which are first order in time. Typeset using REVTEX 1 Many heterogeneous granular materials stubbornly refuse to mix when shaken or stirred. [1, 2] Instead, the grains segregate by size. A simple apparatus, the horizontal <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> [3 – 11], dramatically illustrates this effect. A binary mixture of grain sizes partially fills a horizontal cylinder, which is then rotated about its axis. The components separate into bands arranged along the long axis of the cylinder.

40|$|Objective: This {{research}} was conducted to obtain several formulation and evaluate the physical characteristics of the soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr Detam II variety tablets. Methods: Detam II varieties of soybean (G. max (L.) Merr.) were cleaned and grinded into 30 mesh-sized powder. Weighed soybean powder and internal phase of excipients (based on the formula) mixed by a Y-cone mixer until homogeneous, and then continue with dry granulation process. Granules formed, then sieved into 16 mesh size, and then, the characteristics examined. Dried granules then mixed with magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide using a <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> and compressed into tablets. Physical characteristics of tablets measured at 0, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Results: Evaluation was done for particle size distribution, moisture content (MC), flow properties, weight uniformity, friability, hardness, and disintegration time. Dry granulation was the best method to improve the characteristics of soybean powder with poor compressibility, poor flowability, and hygroscopic. Flow properties of the granules became better for Formula II and III by adding the concentration of silicon dioxide. The formulas also showed the good uniformity of weight, size, MC, friability, and disintegration time. Reducing the lubricant until 0, 5...|$|E
40|$|Disposal of used tires {{has been}} a problem {{throughout}} the United States. The 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) requires the use of recycled rubber in asphalt concrete starting in FY 94. A moratorium has delayed this requirement until FY 95. The Iowa DOT has researched six projects using crumb rubber modifier in asphalt concrete using the wet process. This process involves using a blender-reactor to blend the asphalt cement and crumb rubber. Using the wet process the asphalt cement has to reach a hotter temperature, than is normally required, for reaction to occur. The wet process is also much more expensive than conventional asphalt. This research deals with using a dry process to incorporate crumb rubber into the asphalt concrete mix. The project was constructed by Western Engineering of Harlan, Iowa, on IA 37 between Earling, Iowa and US 59. It was completed in September 1993. Western Engineering used a double <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> to produce the crumb rubber modified asphalt concrete by the dry process.
