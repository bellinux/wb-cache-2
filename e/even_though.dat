When the network failed to work, Blockbuster withdrew from the contract. Enron continued to recognize future profits, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the deal resulted in a loss.|$|E

6000|$|... "I was {{in great}} {{hopes that the}} {{cardinal}} would have met you at dinner," [...] said Lady St. Jerome, [...] "but he wrote only this afternoon to say unexpected business would prevent him, but he would {{be here in the}} <b>evening,</b> <b>though</b> late." ...|$|R

5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton <b>even</b> <b>though</b> Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season <b>even</b> <b>though</b> Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E

60|$|From Edinburgh to Greenock, I had the ex-secretary of the E.U. Conservative Club, Murdoch. At Greenock I spent {{a dismal}} <b>evening,</b> <b>though</b> I found a pretty walk.

5|$|Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice {{cultivation}} has been threatened {{since the late}} 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> they continue to support their community.

50|$|Arriving at Dijon with roughly 5,000 men Garibaldi {{attacked}} the Prussians that <b>evening.</b> <b>Though</b> his soldiers were passionate and aggressive, {{they were also}} raw recruits against an army larger and better trained.

60|$|I am in lovely health again to-day: I-walked {{as far as}} the Pont St. Louis very nearly, besides {{walking and}} {{knocking}} about among the olives in the afternoon.
