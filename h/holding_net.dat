40|$|This paper {{describes}} some long-run {{aspects of}} the Swiss balance of payments, highlighting two macroeconomic phenomena that make Switzerland stand out among other countries: first, it has had a persistent current account surplus and the largest ratio of net foreign assets to GDP in the world; second, its real interest rates have been significantly {{lower than those of}} most other industrialized countries, earning it the label “interest rate island”. These two distinctive features may be related, and ultimately both may result from an excess of national savings over investment for many years.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the efficiency of fish diversion and survivorship of diverted fishes in the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Fish Return System in 1984 and 1985. Generally, fishes were diverted back to the ocean with high frequency, particularly in 1984. Most species were diverted at rates of 80 % or more. Over 90 % of the most abundant species, Engraulis mordax, were diverted. The system worked particularly well for strong-swimming forms such as Paralabrax clathratus, Atherinopsis californiensis, and Xenistius californiensis, and did not appreciably divert weaker-swimming species such as Porichthys notatus, Heterostichus rostratus, and Syngnathus sp.

40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of Enterprise combination costs and returns in cassava–based food crop farming systems in Delta State, Nigeria were studied {{with the purpose}} of establishing the most profitable number and types of enterprises (in terms of net farm income generation) to combine Cross sectional data were collected from a sample of 443 farmers, selected using multi-stage sampling technique during the 2004 / 2005 and 2005 / 2006 cropping seasons. The results showed that cassava production is basically carried out on small-scale basis, with average <b>holding,</b> <b>net</b> farm income and returns to investment of about 1. 69 hectares, N 16711 and 24 % respectively. Labour constituted the single most important cost item, accounting for about 79 % of total cost of production on the average. Generally, all forms of enterprise combinations generated higher net farm income per unit of land cultivated than cassava sole cropping. In all, combining four enterprises significantly generated the highest net farm income, with Cassava + Yam + Maize + Vegetable combination giving the highest of about N 21514 per hectare. It is recommended that appropriate spatial arrangements of crop should be worked out to make possible the profitable use of mechanised devises so that mixed cropping can be practiced on large scale basis thereby reducing labour cost and increased volume of output per resource. Also, appropriate policies to enable the farmers have easy access to sufficient land for cultivation and affordable production credit should be put in place. The study has shown that combing two or more enterprises is more profitable then sole enterprises...|$|E

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBrian C. BriggemanGarden City Co-op, Inc. is a farm {{cooperative}} in Southwest Kansas. It provides marketing and storage of grain, fertilizer, crop protection products, seed, and petroleum to both member and non-member accounts. The cooperative also operates a transportation company called Western Transport. Western Transport provides transportation of anhydrous ammonia (NH 3), liquid fertilizer (32 - 0 - 0 or 10 - 34 - 0), diesel, gasoline, and propane utilizing semi-tractors and trailers to Garden City Co-op, Inc. {{as well as}} to other agribusinesses in the region. The purpose of this thesis is to integrate and optimize the supply chain strategies for the cooperative’s fertilizer and petroleum products as it relates to storage and transportation of those commodities. Utilizing the framework of an aggregate production plan, a model is constructed to minimize costs associated with inventory <b>holding,</b> <b>net</b> storage asset depreciation after tax savings, net transportation asset depreciation after tax savings, labor, operations, and freight. By varying the quantities of petroleum and fertilizer the cooperative purchases, sells, and stores each month over a one-year period, an optimum mix of storage and transportation assets is determined. Two different demand scenarios are evaluated that relate to demand during a drought year versus demand during a non-drought year. Also, different model scenarios include varying beginning period inventory and ending period inventory to stress transportation assets versus storage assets. The model is optimized using a genetic algorithm solver in the software program Evolver produced by Palisade Corporation. Results of the optimization provided two feasible strategies for the cooperative. By continuing services to non-member accounts, there was a greater investment placed on transportation. Investments included additional trucks, NH 3 trailers, petroleum trailers, and drivers. The strategy favored a just-in-time inventory approach versus inventory smoothing with storage. When discontinuing services to non-member accounts, investment between storage and transportation assets were relatively equal. The model favored a reduction in NH 3 trailers, liquid fertilizer trailers, trucks, and drivers. However, additional storage was necessary as well as petroleum trailers. The scenario favored an inventory smoothing approach across the model year...|$|E
