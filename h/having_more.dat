5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually <b>having</b> <b>more</b> winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E

5|$|Allan Cunningham sent seed of G.juniperina to England in 1820; it {{was grown}} there the {{following}} year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some <b>having</b> <b>more</b> horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage. Plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. Direct contact with the plant may cause a skin rash.|$|E

5|$|Cordray {{announced}} his 2008 candidacy for Ohio {{state attorney general}} on June 11, 2008. He was endorsed by Ohio Governor Ted Strickland.

Several leading Republican party contenders such as Montgomery, Jim Petro, DeWine, Maureen O'Connor, and Rob Portman declined to enter the race. Cordray's opponents in the race were Michael Crites (Republican), and Robert M. Owens (Independent). Cordray had a large financial advantage over his opponents with approximately 30 times as much campaign financing as Crites. Crites' campaign strategies included attempts to link Cordray with Dann—an association The Columbus Dispatch called into question—and promoting himself as <b>having</b> <b>more</b> years of prosecutorial experience.

40|$|While {{friendship}} {{patterns and}} the relationship between friendship status and school adjustment have been studied in same-age classrooms, little is known about friendship patterns and the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in mixed-age classrooms. The purposes of the present study were to investigate friendship patterns in a large sample of mixed-age (ungraded) primary classrooms and to examine the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in a smaller subsample of ungraded primary children. Peer acceptance level and age relative to classmates both {{had a significant impact on}} the number of reciprocated friends children had, and on the relative age of their friends. High-accepted and relatively old children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> reciprocated friends than did less accepted and relatively young children. Also, high-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old, and intermediate age friends than did than average- and low-accepted children, and average-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends at all relative ages than did low-accepted children. Children who were older in relative age <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends who were also older in relative age than did children who were intermediate and young in relative age. Intermediate age children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than did relatively young children. Chi square tests of independence revealed that low-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends who were young in relative age, and high-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than expected by random pairing, and that relatively young children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively young friends and relatively old children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than expected by random pairing. There were some similarities in friendship patterns between the larger data sample and the school adjustment subsample. Peer acceptance influenced friendship patterns in a similar manner, however, there was no significant effect of relative age. Also, high- and average-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends who were young and intermediate in relative age than did relatively young children. High-accepted children also <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than did average and low-accepted children, and average-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than did low-accepted children. Chi-square analysis revealed patterns similar to those in the larger sample; high-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends and low-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively young friends than expected. There was no significant of relative age on the relative age of children 2 ̆ 7 s friends. In the school adjustment subsample, children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math, reading, and science were positively related to math, reading, and science achievement scores. Friendship status was significantly related to children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math and achievement scores. Specifically, if children had at least one friend, they <b>had</b> <b>more</b> positive attitudes toward math and higher average achievement scores. Also, females <b>had</b> <b>more</b> positive attitudes toward math, but not other subjects...|$|R
