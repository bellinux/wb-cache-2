It is Chadderton's second town hall, {{the first was the}} former Chadderton Lyceum {{building}} (demolished in 1975). The current town hall, Chadderton's first purpose built municipal building, was designed by Taylor and Simister of Oldham, and was opened in 1913 by Herbert Wolstencroft JP, the then chairman of Chadderton Urban District Council. The architectural style was intended to have [...] "a broad and strong treatment of the English Renaissance". It features [...] "charming gardens and a beautifully renovated ballroom". English Heritage granted it Grade II listed status in July 2013.

40|$|Previous {{histories}} <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> {{concentrated on}} cataloguing and describing practices of delivery {{and failed to}} address the way society continually redefined and shaped these practices. The history of the design {{and changes in the}} popularity of a traditional artifact <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> the birth chair, illustrates these subtle shifts in the values and attitudes of society toward women and birth. These changes in the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> significantly influenced and altered the actual practice of delivery. The history <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> chairs indicates that the change from a natural philosophy to a medicalized definition <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> was not merely the result of a heightened knowledge of anatomy and physiology, but a consequence of the rise in medical professionalism, prevailing social attitudes of women as fragile and invalid, and the growing economic rewards <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> as a medical specialty. Furthermore, the revival <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> chairs {{in the late twentieth century}} illustrates the contest between official obstetrics and the alternative birth movement over the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> This debate was characterized by questions about the safety of medical delivery, the role <b>of</b> women in <b>birth,</b> and the efforts of official medicine toward further medicalization and consolidation of the lucrative business <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> The history <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> chairs clearly illustrates changes in the prevailing philosophy <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> and the way in which society practiced delivery in response. Midwifery and obstetrical texts, artistic renditions <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> scenes, and interviews, in conjunction with a study <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> chairs, provides the basis for a history <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> which does not merely catalogue practices and beliefs, but creates a context in which the influence of the attitudes and beliefs of society on this culturally patterned event can be understood. ...|$|R

We evaluated the shock <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> {{in a sample}} of 313 consecutive term newborns at 4, 24 and 48 hours of life. We correlated neurologic findings on examination with maternal, obstetric and perinatal data.
