25|$|Pratt's {{first-class}} career then tailed {{off in the}} 1963 and 1964 seasons: in 1963, he was {{a regular}} in the team {{until the end of}} June, but then reappeared in only the last two games; and in 1964, he made only eight first-class appearances. In both seasons, he played in Leicestershire's single matches in the Gillette Cup one-day competition. He scored 25 and took the first three wickets, albeit expensively, in the first-ever English List A match in 1963; Leicestershire were so comprehensively thumped in 1964 that he did not even <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> bowl. At the end of the 1964 season, he left the Leicestershire staff.|$|E

To return to that stupendous New World, which makes you almost guiddy [...] because of its immencity, [...] its noise, its striving, its fearful impetuous [...] to <b>get</b> <b>on,</b> <b>to</b> do always more, always bigger, quicker, more astonishingly a restless, flaring great world, where I think everything can be realised... I know, as long as I live, breathe and think, the love for America will beautify my life and thoughts... Perhaps Fate will allow me one day {{to go back to}} America." ...|$|E
500|$|The book {{begins with}} a {{quotation}} from Henry James, [...] "Never say you know the last word about any human heart." [...] A short preface (an anonymous editor suggests {{it was written in}} 1987) explains that the earliest pages have been lost, and recounts briefly Mountstuart's childhood in Montevideo, Uruguay before he moves to England aged seven with his English father and Uruguayan mother. In his final term at school he and two friends set challenges. Logan is to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the school's first XV rugby team; Peter Scabius has to seduce Tess, a local farmer's daughter; and Ben Leeping, a lapsed Jew, has to convert to Roman Catholicism. Mountstuart enters Oxford on an exhibition and leaves with a third in History. Settling in London, he enjoys early success as a writer with The Mind's Imaginings, a critically successful biography of Shelley; The Girl Factory, a salacious novel about prostitutes (which is [...] poorly reviewed but sells well); and Les Cosmopolites, a respectable book on some obscure French poets. Mountstuart's mother loses the family wealth in the Wall Street Crash. He embarks on a series of amorous encounters: he loses his virginity to Tess, is rejected by Land Fothergill whom he met at Oxford, and marries Lottie, an Earl's daughter. They live together at Thorpe Hall in Norfolk, where Mountstuart, unstimulated by slow country life and his warm but dull wife, becomes idle.|$|E

500|$|On a {{slightly}} less positive note, Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B+. He remarked that it [...] "starts out intense and crazy" [...] but [...] "becomes fairly predictable {{in its second}} half," [...] as he correctly predicted Walternate's involvement in the abduction. Murray concluded, [...] "Ultimately, 'Bloodline' {{is more of a}} plot-mover than most episodes of Fringe. There’s no additional case to solve, and no profound theme to explore. If anything, it’s like the writers decided to inject a serum into the belly of show and accelerate the story, to get Fauxlivia’s baby out and to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the next phase." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler also didn't find the birth storyline all that shocking [...] "since {{the number of people that}} had the power and knowledge to do this kind of thing was low." [...] Rating the episode 7.5/10, Isler added that [...] "the story could have used a bit more misdirection and a red herring or two to really keep us guessing, but that's a minor critique. Overall, Walternate's Machiavellian role in this story works, and the most important takeaway from this story is that it moved the overarching plot forward in one huge leap. Instead of waiting nine 'story' months for Fauxlivia's baby to pop out, we've already got the kid ready to fit into whatever plot twist the show runners have planned." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> me about it or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} {{important}} performances in Cooper's early career was his portrayal of a sullen legionnaire in Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film Morocco with Marlene Dietrich in her introduction to American audiences. During production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively. Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German. The [...] actor approached the [...] director, physically picked him up by the collar and said, [...] "If you expect to work in this country you'd better <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the language we use here." [...] Despite the tensions on the set, Cooper produced [...] "one of his best performances", according to Thornton Delehanty of the New York Evening Post. In 1931, after returning to the Western genre in Zane Grey's Fighting Caravans with French actress Lili Damita, Cooper appeared in the Dashiell Hammett crime film City Streets playing a westerner who gets involved with big-city gangsters in order to save the woman he loves. Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two unsuccessful films: I Take This Woman with Carole Lombard, and His Woman with Claudette Colbert. The demands and pressures of making ten films in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health, suffering from anemia and jaundice. He had lost [...] during that period, and felt lonely, isolated, and depressed by his sudden fame and wealth. In May 1931, Cooper left Hollywood and sailed to Algiers and then Italy, where he lived for the next year.|$|E

Joginder Tuteja from IndiaFM gave the film's soundtrack 4 out of 5 stars and noted, [...] "Songs in Tashan excite, <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> you quickly {{and make you}} {{put them on a}} repeat mode". There is not a single dull moment in this entire album which has its tallest highpoints in 'Dil Dance Maare', 'Dil Haara' and 'Falak Tak'.|$|E
2500|$|Robertson {{was a man}} {{of strong}} {{physique}} and physical presence, admired by the King for his rise from humble origins. He had a prodigious memory and was very quick on the uptake, sometimes interrupting briefings with: [...] "yes, I have got that, <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the next point". However, although he could be amusing company off duty, as he rose the career ladder his brusque manner, possibly adopted to assert his authority, became more marked, even with superiors. [...] "I've 'eard different" [...] was a favourite retort to politicians who made military suggestions.|$|E
2500|$|Booth take s a {{different}} approach to the sonnets. He suggests that the entire sonnet is an [...] "emblem of the poets self-mocking tactics. He argues that though the sonnet works to remind the reader to forget the speaker, it is also contradicts as it constantly reminds the reader of the speaker. His comment on the reading of the first quatrain is that, the experience of reading the poem [...] "an experience of being unable to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> something new." [...] Booth sees the [...] "Give warning" [...] not only as a literal warning of death but a comment of mortality, [...] "an idea that undercuts the advice the speaker purports to offer by inviting a wider view of all particular deaths that his mundane premises allow for." [...] This reading takes a particular view of the speaker and highlights the theme of aging in the sonnets.|$|E

[...] …I was called in to be interrogated three or four times during the next two years. Each time, it was the same setting, and the same set of questions.

[...] …At each interrogation, I refused to tell them anything. [...] Each time I was amazed that, while I was truly terrified by their tactics and their threats, I was able to stonewall their questions and refuse to give them the answers they were so desperate for.

2500|$|The 2012 edition {{was to be}} {{expanded}} into a 16 team format however this was reverted to 12. It {{was the first time}} the tournament took place in an Asian country, hosted by Sri Lanka in three cities; Colombo, Pallekele and Hambantota. It was played by the same 12 teams that played in the 2010 tournament, Ireland and Afghanistan and the ten full members. For the first time, a host nation managed to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the knock-out stage of the ICC World Twenty20. However the tournament was won by the West Indies, by defeating Sri Lanka by 36 runs. It was by the virtue of the power packed 78 scored by Marlon Samuels the followed some tight bowling by the slow bowlers. Ironically West Indies qualified for the Super-8 stage without winning even a single match in the initial round. Pakistan and Australia were the losing semi-finalists, with Pakistan making into last four on all the occasions and Australia missing only in 2009. India won both the matches of the first round becoming the only team not to lose even a single first round match in the first four editions of the ICC World Twenty20. Shane Watson topped the run charts with 249 runs. Chris Gayle struck 16 sixes, maximum by any player. Ajantha Mendis topped wickets chart with 16 wickets, including an all-time best performance of 6 for 8 against Zimbabwe ...|$|E
