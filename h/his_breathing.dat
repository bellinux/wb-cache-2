5|$|Elvis Presley was {{inducted}} into the Army on March 24, 1958. During the final months of his service, Presley began experimenting with new material in anticipation of his return to recording. Friend Charlie Hodge taught him to improve <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> and expand his vocal range, and Presley added a full octave. He was discharged on March 5, 1960.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{during her}} reign, Anne {{and her husband}} spent the winter at Kensington and St James's Palaces, and the summer at Windsor Castle or Hampton Court Palace, where the air was fresher. George had {{recurrent}} asthma, and the cleaner air in the country was better for <b>his</b> <b>breathing.</b> They visited the spa town of Bath, Somerset, in mid-1702, {{on the advice of}} George's doctors, and again in mid-1703. They occasionally visited Newmarket, Suffolk, to view the horse racing. On one visit, Anne bought George a horse, Leeds, for the vast sum of a thousand guineas.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School {{opened a}} new music wing, and Holst {{composed}} St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and {{his family moved to}} a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected <b>his</b> <b>breathing.</b> For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.|$|E

5|$|Thomas {{arrived in}} New York on 20 October 1953 to {{undertake}} another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout {{while still in}} Britain, {{there is no record}} that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox-vaccination certificate.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1704 Beatrix Laing {{approached}} Patrick Morton, a 16-year-old {{working in}} his father's smithy, {{to ask if he}} would make her some nails. Morton refused as he was already assigned an urgent task making nails for a merchant's ship in the harbour. Displeased, Laing left threatening revenge on him. The following day Morton noticed a bucket filled with water and burning coal outside Laing's house; he thought it was there to cast a spell on him. Laing had a reputation as a witch having already appeared before the Kirk session in 1696 for charming. Morton immediately felt weak and had difficulty standing or walking. His health deteriorated; he began to have fits and convulsions, his stomach became distended and his body was rigid and twisted. People claimed they could see marks left on his skin by fingernails where Morton said he had been pinched. He refused food and <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> was laboured.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, {{a copy of a}} desk calendar chronicling all of Ron Swanson's meetings {{from the}} episode was placed on the official Parks and Recreation website. That site also featured three deleted scenes from the episode. In the first, 80-second clip, Leslie and Jessica get into a fight about the gazebo, and Jessica reveals she has trimmed the mansion's historic hedges into the shape of elephants. The second clip, which lasted one minute, features several more of Ron Swanson's meetings, including one where he tries to literally will a man away with his mind. Andy also tells Ron he accidentally agreed to sell the recreation center to the Quiznos fast food restaurant chain. In the third, 90-second clip, Leslie tries to end Nick Newport Sr.'s birthday party by pulling the plug on the lights, but accidentally disconnects <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> machine instead.|$|E

25|$|On June 28, 1995, Reeve {{was taken}} to the Kessler Rehabilitation Center in West Orange, New Jersey. He was given several blood transfusions in the first few weeks because of very low {{hemoglobin}} and protein levels. Many times <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> tube would become disconnected and he would be at the mercy of nurses to come in and save his life.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to this success, {{the most difficult}} time of his career began in May 1971 during a match against Warwickshire at Cardiff. Davis was struck on {{the head by a}} cricket ball, while fielding close to the batsman at short leg. Cricket players wore little protective equipment at the time, and David began to suffer convulsions before being given CPR by a doctor from the crowd. He was then rushed to hospital, where it transpired that both his heart and <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> had stopped when he was hit. After making a full recovery, Davis continued to play for Glamorgan. Later that year, he also played for the England Under-25s.|$|E
25|$|On May 27, 1995, Reeve's horse made a refusal. Witnesses {{said that}} the horse began the third fence jump and {{suddenly}} stopped. Reeve fell forward off the horse, {{holding on to the}} reins. His hands somehow became tangled in the reins, and the bridle and bit were pulled off the horse. He landed head first {{on the far side of}} the fence, shattering his first and second vertebrae. This cervical spinal injury, which paralyzed him from the neck down, also halted <b>his</b> <b>breathing.</b> Paramedics arrived three minutes later and immediately took measures to get air into his lungs. He was taken first to the local hospital, before being flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Medical Center. Afterwards, he had no recollection of the accident. Due to this injury, Armand Assante replaced Reeve for the role of Alan Breck Stewart in Kidnapped.|$|E

25|$|Chávez was {{diagnosed}} with cancer following the discovery of a mass in his pelvic region in June 2011. He traveled to Havana, Cuba where he underwent a surgical operation to remove a malignant cancerous tissue mass 'about the size of a baseball' from his waist. He underwent a second surgical operation in Venezuela one month later. Over the next 12 months, he followed a cycle of chemotherapy. The type of cancer Chávez {{was diagnosed}} with was never made public which fueled speculation over his condition (with speculations from being prostate cancer to colon cancer among others). Following the presidential election in October 2012 (where he was re-elected to a fourth term), he went to Cuba for more treatment and then returned to Venezuela and stayed at a Caracas army hospital for one week until his death. Successive announcements of his return and updates of his health were criticised by the country's opposition that the population were unaware of his health and location. The fact that the cancer had metastasised was not made public during the campaign, and strongly denied by Government officers. After the first lung infection (pneumonia) in the last stages of his life, Chávez was intubated nearing the end of December. <b>His</b> <b>breathing</b> worsened until his death was announced at 16:25 VET (20:55 UTC) on 5 March 2013, almost two years after he was first diagnosed.|$|E
500|$|Leale {{entered the}} box to find Lincoln seated with his head leaning to his right as Mary held him and sobbed: [...] "His eyes were closed {{and he was in}} a profoundly {{comatose}} condition, while <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous." [...] Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Leale shifted him to the floor. Meanwhile, another physician, Charles Sabin Taft, was lifted from the stage into the box.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Lincoln's {{features}} were calm and <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> slow and steady. Later {{one of his}} eyes became swollen and {{the right side of}} his face discolored. Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote in a letter to The New York Times that the President then started [...] "breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering.". As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became [...] "perfectly natural" [...] (except for the discoloration around his eyes).|$|E
500|$|Several riders {{were injured}} in the crash [...] from the finish. The worst-affected was Yukiya Arashiro, who {{suffered}} several broken bones. Gianluca Brambilla (Etixx-Quick Step) broke his collarbone. [...] had two riders with injuries: Paul Martens broke his hand and Bram Tankink suffered from concussion and bruises. Nicolas Roche and Simon Gerrans both suffered some discomfort after their crashes, but neither had significant injuries. Dan Martin rode the Tour de Romandie the following week. After he suffered with <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> through the race, he discovered that he had broken two ribs in the crash in Liège–Bastogne–Liège.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Los Angeles and Italy in June and July 2009. Benicio del Toro, Erin Wasson {{and members of the}} band Rooney have cameos in the film. In a feature for The New York Times website, Coppola {{discussed}} making the scene when Marco visits a special effects studio. She said she initially was unsure of how to approach it, but Savides did a long, slow zoom which captures <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> and creates a sense of claustrophobia. Despite many takes, Dorff was a [...] "good sport", she said. The sound of the phone ringing was added by Sarah Flack, the editor, to indicate that Marco has been forgotten.|$|E

500|$|Because Mucho Macho Man {{was born}} {{late in the}} year for a Thoroughbred foal, as a growing two- and three-year-old he had to compete against horses that were several months older and more mature. [...] He was also very tall, and as a young racehorse {{sometimes}} got in his own way; as a three-year-old, he stepped on his front feet with his hind feet and tore off a horseshoe in two different races. In 2011, he competed in all three Triple Crown races, coming in third in the Kentucky Derby. [...] Following a five-month layoff due to surgery that addressed a problem with <b>his</b> <b>breathing,</b> he returned to the track in November 2011 with a win, won three graded stakes races in 2012, and finished a close second to Fort Larned in that year's Breeders' Cup Classic.|$|E
500|$|St-Pierre's trainer Greg Jackson {{denied any}} wrongdoing, stating that Nurse was rubbing and tapping on St-Pierre's body {{as part of}} a drill to aid in <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> techniques. [...] Jackson said that any Vaseline {{transferred}} from residue on Nurse's fingers was accidental and wiped off when pointed out. [...] Georges St-Pierre spoke to Sports Illustrated with regard to the controversy stating, [...] "I haven't seen the fight yet, but I remember at some point something happened and the athletic commission was complaining. [...] They used a towel to wet my back and wipe it off. [...] I don't mind. [...] I didn't put Vaseline on myself and I'm not a cheater." [...] However, St-Pierre offered Penn a rematch in the summer that Penn verbally accepted but is unlikely to happen due to the fact they have both since been scheduled for title defenses.|$|E
500|$|During {{his final}} {{months in the}} Army, Presley started to {{experiment}} with new material and thinking ahead to his anticipated return to recording. For his first scheduled recording session, Presley considered The Four Fellow's [...] "Soldier Boy", the Golden Gate Quartet's [...] "I Will Be Home Again", The Drifters' [...] "Such a Night" [...] and Jesse Stone's [...] "Like a Baby". His friend Charlie Hodge taught Presley techniques to improve <b>his</b> <b>breathing</b> and expand his range. For inspiration, Presley used Roy Hamilton's [...] "I Believe" [...] and his version of [...] "Unchained Melody", the traditional Irish song [...] "Danny Boy", and Tony Martin's [...] "There's No Tomorrow" [...] (an English adaptation of [...] "'O sole mio"). Presley also studied the phrasing and notes of records by The Inkspots and the Mills Brothers. [...] By {{the end of his}} time in Germany, Presley had added a full octave to his vocal range.|$|E
