5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble {{is large enough to}} have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

Using {{a book or}} a website, a person does the kinds of exercises {{that would be used}} in therapy, but they do <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> perhaps with some email or phone support from a therapist. A systematic analysis of trials testing this kind of self-help found that websites, books, and other materials based on cognitive-behavioral therapy could help some people. The best-studied conditions are panic disorder and social phobia.|$|E
25|$|The primary Scottish {{objective}} of ending the Union was now possible {{and they wanted}} to consolidate their position; although willing to assist an English rising or French invasion, they would not do <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> For the Irish, only a Stuart on the British throne could provide the autonomous, Catholic Ireland promised them by James II. Charles argued only removing the Hanoverians could guarantee an independent Scotland and thousands of supporters would join once they entered England, while the Marquis d'Eguilles provided assurances a French landing was imminent.|$|E
25|$|For {{everyone}} else, {{health insurance}} {{must be paid}} for privately. Some 59% of U.S. residents have {{access to health care}} insurance through employers, although this figure is decreasing, and coverages as well as workers' expected contributions vary widely. Those whose employers do not offer health insurance, {{as well as those who}} are self-employed or unemployed, must purchase <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Nearly 27 million of the 45 million uninsured U.S. residents worked at least part-time in 2007, and more than a third were in households that earned $50,000 or more per year.|$|E

25|$|Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc. is {{a lawsuit}} brought by Facebook in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Power Ventures Inc., a {{third-party}} platform, collected user information from Facebook and displayed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> website. Facebook claimed {{violations of the}} CAN-SPAM Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ("CFAA"), and the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. According to Facebook, Power Ventures Inc. made copies of Facebook’s website {{during the process of}} extracting user information. Facebook argued that this process causes both direct and indirect copyright infringement. In addition, Facebook alleged this process constitutes a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). Finally, Facebook also asserted claims of both state and federal trademark infringement, as well as a claim under California's Unfair Competition Law ("UCL").|$|E
25|$|Props {{have to take}} in {{pressure}} from the locks and loose forwards pushing from behind and the opposition pushing against them, so they are often among the strongest players in a team. Some of the more successful props have short necks and broad shoulders to absorb this force as well as powerful legs to drive the scrum forward. Since the game has become professional, non-specialist props or hookers cannot play in the front row. If, through sendings-off or injuries, a team {{does not have enough}} specialist front row players, the scrums become 'uncontested' (i.e. no pushing is allowed and the team putting the ball into the scrum wins <b>it).</b> <b>On</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> scrum, the loosehead's role is to provide the hooker with a clear view to strike the ball, while the tighthead tries to keep the scrum stable. When the opposition is putting the ball in, the tighthead attempts to disrupt the opposing hooker or loosehead, making {{it difficult for them to}} win the ball.|$|E
25|$|After European {{contact with}} tribes {{in what is}} today the Southeastern United States, colonists began using the charred leaves of the yaupon holly to make a tea similar to the black drink, but without the ritual {{vomiting}} of it. Its use by colonists in Spanish Florida is documented {{as far back as}} 1615. An account from that year describes Spaniards as experiencing symptoms that would now be described as caffeine dependence due to daily consumption of what they called cacina or té del indio. The use of Ilex vomitoria by colonists for tea making and for medicinal uses in the Carolinas is documented by the early eighteenth century. In the English-speaking colonies, it was known variously as cassina, yaupon tea, Indian tea, Carolina tea, and Appalachian tea. It was commonly believed to be and used as a diuretic. By the late 1700s, yaupon tea was described as being more commonly used in North Carolina at breakfast than tea made with Camellia sinensis. In addition to using <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> Spanish and British colonist often drank black drink when engaging in discussions and treaties with Natives. Its preparation by British and Spanish colonists was nearly identical to the method of preparation used by their Native neighbors. Its use by colonists in French Louisiana is speculated to have occurred, but lacks documentation other than one source describing its medicinal uses from 1716.|$|E

500|$|For the album, {{the band}} {{wanted to create}} the {{atmosphere}} of hyperactivity they knew [...] their fans wanted. They wrote a few songs, but felt the songs [...] "weren't strong enough" [...] {{and sent them to}} other musicians. Shay Haley, a member of the band, explained that in their new work, the band wanted to add energy to the emotional appeal of their past albums, though the band did not conceive a clear plan for the direction of the new album. N.E.R.D described the desired outcomes of [...] the album as [...] "a pre-cognitive effort to make music that would make sense for us on while we're on a stage and to recapture that feeling we love so much" [...] and additionally, [...] "to make something that was thought provoking and for people to listen to it and enjoy <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> time".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film four stars out of four, {{predicting}} it would carry [...] "the type of {{word of mouth}} that money can't buy. This movie is not only great entertainment but a breakthrough in craftsmanship." [...] Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune spent {{a considerable amount of}} time in the Siskel & Ebert episode in which they reviewed the film analyzing the film's painstaking filmmaking. Siskel also praised the film, and ranked it #2 on his top ten films list for 1988, while Ebert ranked it as #8 on a similar list. Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that [...] "although this isn't the first time that cartoon characters have shared the screen with live actors, it's the first time they've done <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> terms and make it look real". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post considered Roger Rabbit to be [...] "a definitive collaboration of pure talent. Zemeckis had Walt Disney Pictures' enthusiastic backing, producer Steven Spielberg's pull, Warner Bros.'s blessing, Canadian animator Richard Williams' ink and paint, Mel Blanc's voice, Jeffrey Price's and Peter S. Seaman's witty, frenetic screenplay, George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic, and Bob Hoskins' comical performance as the burliest, shaggiest private eye." [...] Gene Shalit on the Today Show also praised the film, calling it [...] "one of the most extraordinary movies ever made". Filmsite.org called it [...] "a technically-marvelous film" [...] and a [...] "landmark" [...] that resulted from [...] "unprecedented cooperation" [...] between Warner Bros. and Disney.|$|E

2500|$|Yamashita {{visited the}} Ministry of War at 12:00 {{and told the}} rebel {{officers}} that the issuance of the imperial command was {{merely a matter of}} time and that they should [...] "take responsibility". Hori joined the group at 12:30 and confirmed Yamashita's words. Shortly after, Kurihara, speaking for the group, asked that an Imperial messenger be sent. He said that the officers would commit suicide and the NCOs would take the soldiers back to their barracks. Yamashita, joined by Kawashima, immediately went to the Palace, where he informed Honjō of the request. Honjō asked that the request be granted, but the Emperor refused, saying that they could do <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of social}} {{technologies}} (blogs, wikis, RSS) {{allow students to}} shift from simply consuming media to creating <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Pundits argue that student-produced podcasting can promote several powerful ideas that students can use over a lifetime. These include a hands-on and reflective approach to copyright and fair use in creating digital media. That is, they can create original content as they ethically and effectively collect and remix the work of others. Thus, it is argued, podcasting becomes a tool for students {{to think about the}} balance between individual rights and community benefits. In addition, some argue that podcasts help students learn 21st century literacy skills. [...] Students, for example, can use digital audio recording and editing software to create audio dramas, news shows or audio tours. Within Social Studies contexts, for example, podcasting offers a means for encouraging students to question their world, [...] to explore their intuitions about relationships between history, people and to think about things in relation to larger contexts, rather than simply focus on dates and facts. Educators who use podcasting with students argue that it offers learners and teachers flexibility and learner control, opportunities for learner motivation, clarity of instruction, novelty of engagement, widening of 'locations' in which learning is situated – an expansion of the temporal and spatial, engagement with and collaboration around dialogue, and opportunities for learners to get involved in construction of learning for others.|$|E
