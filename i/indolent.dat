5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and <b>indolent</b> lives of the clergy.|$|E

25|$|Large {{granular}} {{lymphocytic leukemia}} may involve either T-cells or NK cells; like hairy cell leukemia, which involves solely B cells, it {{is a rare}} and <b>indolent</b> (not aggressive) leukemia.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} persons who never succeed, from being too <b>indolent</b> to {{undertake}} anything; {{and others who}} regularly fail, because the instant they find success in their power, they grow indifferent, and give over the attempt.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013 it was {{revealed}} {{in an interview in}} Fædrelandsvennen that Schuff had been diagnosed with Follicular lymphoma in the Fall of 2012, a form of cancer which, while <b>indolent,</b> is generally considered medically incurable after Stage I.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{case reports}} of infective {{endocarditis}} caused by unusual organisms have been published. Few examples include: Propionibacterium sp., which are normal skin flora, {{have been responsible}} for infective endocarditis sometimes leading to deaths due to the <b>indolent</b> course of this abscess producing infection.Tropheryma whipplei has caused endocarditis without gastrointestinal involvement. Citrobacter koseri was found in an immunocompetent adult. Neisseria bacilliformis was found in a patient with a bicuspid aortic valve.|$|E
25|$|The goal of full {{employment}} was of most importance to Petty, having recognised that labour {{was one of}} the major sources of wealth for individuals and 'the greatest Wealth and Strength of the Kingdom'. In this vein, he extended the cloth-wine argument above, arguing that it is better to employ men and burn their product or to engage in extravagant public works projects, than to have <b>indolent</b> 'supernumeraries' in an economy – hence his famous example of relocating Stonehenge across the plains of Salisbury.|$|E
25|$|Refractory corneal ulcers are {{superficial}} ulcers that heal poorly {{and tend}} to recur. They are also known as <b>indolent</b> ulcers or Boxer ulcers. They {{are believed to be}} caused by a defect in the basement membrane and a lack of hemidesmosomal attachments. They are recognized by undermined epithelium that surrounds the ulcer and easily peels back. Refractory corneal ulcers are most commonly seen in middle aged or older dogs and often occur in the other eye later. They are similar to Cogan's cystic dystrophy in humans.|$|E
25|$|Their {{conversion}} {{was reinforced}} after 1810. In that year, George III, {{who had suffered}} periodically from mental instability (due to a blood disorder now known as porphyria), became permanently insane and spent the remaining 10 {{years of his life}} unable to discharge his duties. The Prince Regent was prevented from using the full powers of Kingship. The Regent became George IV in 1820, but during his 10-year reign was <b>indolent</b> and frivolous. Consequently, for 20 years the throne was virtually vacant and Tory Cabinets led by Tory Prime Ministers filled the void, governing virtually on their own.|$|E
25|$|Rituximab is a {{chimeric}} monoclonal IgG1 antibody specific for CD20, {{developed from}} its parent antibody Ibritumomab. As with ibritumomab, rituximab targets CD20, making it effective in treating certain B-cell malignancies. These include aggressive and <b>indolent</b> lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma and leukaemias such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although {{the function of}} CD20 is relatively unknown, CD20 may be a calcium channel involved in B-cell activation. The antibody's mode of action is primarily through the induction of ADCC and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Other mechanisms include apoptosis and cellular growth arrest. Rituximab also increases the sensitivity of cancerous B-cells to chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Brian Klugman as Dr. Oliver Wells (seasons 8–11): Oliver is a lab {{assistant}} who boasts of his 160 IQ and is considerably arrogant. He has multiple doctorates in various subjects {{and is the}} only intern who is a doctor. He struggles to get along with all of the lab members due to his arrogance. He and Dr. Brennan do not enjoy the best of working relationships, especially after he tells her that he aims to surpass her reputation. A polymath, he has a wide, if <b>indolent,</b> range of interests, from physics to psychology. He appears to bond with Hodgins later in the series, and {{with the rest of the}} team, to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet {{almost none}} of the {{information}} we think we possess is true. Eskimos do not rub noses. The rickshaw was invented by an American. Joan of Arc was not French. Lenin was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither haggis, whisky, porridge, clan tartans or kilts are Scottish. So we stand, silent, on a peak in Darien a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. QI country. Whatever is interesting we are interested in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at in the right way. At one extreme, QI is serious, intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, silly and frothy enough to please the most <b>indolent</b> couch-potato.|$|E
25|$|Many low-grade lymphomas remain <b>indolent</b> {{for many}} years. Treatment of the nonsymptomatic patient is often avoided. In {{these forms of}} lymphoma, such as {{follicular}} lymphoma, watchful waiting is often the initial course of action. This is carried out because the harms and risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. If a low-grade lymphoma is becoming symptomatic, radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatments of choice; although they do not cure the lymphoma, they can alleviate the symptoms, particularly painful lymphadenopathy. Patients with these types of lymphoma can live near-normal lifespans, but the disease is incurable. Some centers advocate the use of single agent rituximab {{in the treatment of}} follicular lymphoma rather than the wait and watch approach. Watchful waiting is not a good strategy for all patients, as it leads to significant distress and anxiety in some patients. It has been equated with watch and worry.|$|E
500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] is a pop {{record that}} {{experiments}} with pop-rock balladry. The song features guitar and bass instrumentation, {{and according to}} the Daily Mail, evokes the music of harmony groups from the 1960s. John Mulvey of NME characteristed the song as having [...] "tasteful slippery beats, tasteful acoustic guitars, [...] the usual <b>indolent</b> harmonies". The song's lyrics immediately begin with a sense of decision through the line [...] "I Touch the sky", and largely focus on the enjoyment of life.|$|E
500|$|The series {{revolves}} around identical twins Kenny and Keef Lucas (voiced by Kenny and Keith Lucas, respectively), who run a moving company called [...] "Lucas Bros Moving Co" [...] in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, {{out of their}} van after receiving it from their dead uncle. The two are shown to frequently consume marijuana, emitting a calm demeanor throughout the various escapades caused at their job. Scrawny and <b>indolent,</b> their customers are often apprehensive towards their weaknesses, but the brothers like to remind themselves [...] "that's why God made two of them." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} year, 1791, {{after one of}} William Wilberforce's many efforts to suppress the slave trade failed to pass Parliament, Barbauld wrote her Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade. In it, she calls Britain {{to account for the}} sin of slavery; in harsh tones, she condemns the [...] "Avarice" [...] of a country which is content to allow its wealth and prosperity to be supported by the labour of enslaved human beings. Moreover, she draws a picture of the plantation mistress and master that reveals all of the failings of the [...] "colonial enterprise: [...] <b>indolent,</b> voluptuous, monstrous woman" [...] and a [...] "degenerate, enfeebled man." ...|$|E
500|$|Sidney Colvin, in his 1917 {{biography}} on Keats, grouped [...] "Indolence" [...] {{with the}} other 1819 odes in categorizing Keats's [...] "class of achievements". In 1948, Lord Gorell described the fifth stanza as, [...] "lacking the magic of what the world agrees are the great Odes" [...] but describes the language as [...] "elicate, charming even". Later, in a 1968 biography of Keats, Gittings describes {{the importance of the}} poem: [...] "The whole ode, in fact, has a borrowed air, and he acknowledged its lack of success by not printing it {{with the other}}s... Yet with its acceptance of the numb, dull and <b>indolent</b> mood as something creative, it set the scene for all the odes that followed." ...|$|E
500|$|Renée, who conceals {{her true}} self {{to conform to}} the lowly image of typical concierges, {{introduces}} herself as [...] "a widow, short, ugly, chubby", with [...] "bunions on my feet and, on certain difficult mornings, it seems, the breath of a mammoth". Her outward appearance is summarized by The Guardian reviewer Ian Samson as [...] "prickly and bunioned". When Paloma eventually discovers Renée's identity, she describes the latter in her journal as having the [...] "elegance of the hedgehog"—although like the spines of the hedgehog, she is covered in quills and prickly, within, she has {{in the words of the}} English translation of the book quoted by Viv Groskop [...] "the same simple refinement as the hedgehog: a deceptively <b>indolent</b> little creature, fiercely solitary—and terribly elegant".|$|E
500|$|Further {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} acute myeloid leukemia occurred rapidly with the development of new technology. In 1877, Paul Ehrlich developed a technique of staining blood films which allowed him to describe in detail normal and abnormal white blood cells. Wilhelm Ebstein introduced the term [...] "acute leukemia" [...] in 1889 to differentiate rapidly progressive and fatal leukemias from the more <b>indolent</b> chronic leukemias. The term [...] "myeloid" [...] was coined by Franz Ernst Christian Neumann in 1869, as {{he was the first to}} recognize white blood cells were made in the bone marrow (Greek: µυєλός, myelos = (bone) marrow) as opposed to the spleen. The technique of bone marrow examination to diagnose leukemia was first described in 1879 by Mosler. Finally, in 1900, the myeloblast, which is the malignant cell in AML, was characterized by Otto Naegeli, who divided the leukemias into myeloid and lymphocytic.|$|E
500|$|As {{the ship}} settled into her sea-going routine, Bligh {{introduced}} Cook's strict discipline regarding sanitation and diet. According to the expedition's historian Sam McKinney, Bligh enforced these rules [...] "with a fanatical zeal, continually fuss and fum over the cleanliness of his ship {{and the food}} served to the crew." [...] He replaced the navy's traditional watch system of alternating four-hour spells on and off duty with a three-watch system, whereby each four-hour duty was followed by eight hours' rest. For the crew's exercise and entertainment, he introduced regular music and dancing sessions. Bligh's despatches to Campbell and Banks indicated his satisfaction; he had no occasion to administer punishment because, he wrote: [...] "Both men and officers tractable and well disposed, & cheerfulness & content in the countenance of every one". The only adverse feature of the voyage to date, according to Bligh, was {{the conduct of the}} surgeon Huggan, who was revealed as an <b>indolent,</b> unhygienic drunkard.|$|E
500|$|Morrell also records how {{a hunting}} trip ashore in California {{led to a}} {{skirmish}} with the locals which turned into a full-scale battle ending, he says, with seventeen natives dead and seven of Tartars men wounded. Morrell claims that {{he was among the}} casualties, with an arrow in his thigh. Of a visit to San Francisco Morrell writes: [...] "The inhabitants are principally Mexicans and Spaniards who are very <b>indolent</b> and consequently very filthy." [...] After revisiting the Galapagos Islands and gathering a harvest of fur seal and terrapin, Tartar began a slow journey home on October 13, 1825. As they left the Pacific Morrell claimed to have personally inspected and identified every danger existing along the American Pacific coast. Tartar finally reached New York Harbour on May 8, 1826 with a main cargo of 6,000 fur seals. This haul did not please Morrell's employers, who had evidently expected rather more. [...] "The reception I met from my owners was cold and repulsive", he wrote. [...] "The Tartar did not return home laden with silver and gold, and therefore my toils and dangers counted for nothing".|$|E
500|$|Other {{institutions}} {{also have}} a reputation for having a [...] "Hooray Henry" [...] image. The participants and viewers of the University Boat Race are frequently referred to as Hooray Henries or toffs, even by non-tabloid media like The Guardian who said that it is [...] "easy to sneer at the kind of event where triumphant, red trouser-wearing hooray-henrys greet their returning heroes with a rousing rendition of the timeless rowing shanty I'd Rather Be a Leper Than a Cam", and CNN who spoke of the [...] "Barbour jacket-wearing 'hooray-henry' crowd", posing the question as to whether the boat race was a [...] "prestigious battle, a vulgar display of elitism, or the ultimate meritocracy." [...] A 2005 Wales Online article reported on how the Countryside Alliance were acutely aware of their [...] "Hooray Henry" [...] image and that they were very keen to change their image and how they were perceived in Wales. The upper-class people who turn up at horseracing events, particularly Royal Ascot, have also often been cited as Hoorah Henries. The journalist Robert Chesshyre spoke of the [...] "Hooray Henry world of polo, gatecrasher balls and <b>indolent</b> ostentation at Ascot and Henley" [...] in his 1987 book The Return of a Native Reporter.|$|E
500|$|The Imperial army, {{although}} smaller, was {{not much}} better, and certainly not the battle-hardened army the Prussians had faced at Kolin. This was the Reichsarmee, an army consisting of units sent by the constituent members of the Holy Roman Empire. [...] Their commander had {{reported that they were}} defective in training, administration, armaments, discipline and leadership. The same might be said of their commander, Saxe-Hildburghausen, an <b>indolent</b> and slow-moving man. The Imperial regimental officers often lacked even basic garrison training. [...] These units had little experience working together, much less fighting together, a problem that expressed itself most evidently in the disastrous wheeling pivot. Furthermore, the Reichsarmee contingents came from many principalities, some of which were Protestant, and many of which were unhappy about any alliance with the French; most were more adverse to the French than they were to the Prussians. Once news of the battle's uneven resolution spread, some Germans felt satisfaction; the battle could be seen as retribution for the years of suffering under the French atrocities in the Rhineland and Palatinate during the Palatinate campaign and the subsequent invasions and occupation of Louis XIV. Mostly, though, Rossbach was significant for the strengthening of Prussia's relationship with Frederick's uncle, King George, and George's other subjects. The British could now see the advantage of keeping the French occupied on the Continent while they continued their expansion in North America.|$|E
