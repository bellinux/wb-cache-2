5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} his judgment as referring to {{judicial review of}} statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair, while others argue he meant that the common law courts {{have the power to}} completely strike <b>down</b> <b>those</b> statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E
5|$|Woolfolk {{told the}} AP in 1982 of {{receiving}} offers of representation from some 50 agents {{while he was}} still in college. Woolfolk noted that he was offered under-the-table payments by agents {{while he was still}} in school, as well as cars, and even a job for his stepfather, William Johnson, a Newark dockworker. Woolfolk turned <b>down</b> <b>those</b> offers and signed with Jerry Argovitz.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track <b>down</b> <b>those</b> responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E

5|$|THX 1138 was {{released}} in March 1971 and Lucas was offered opportunities to direct Lady Ice (1973), Tommy (1975) or Hair (1979). He turned <b>down</b> <b>those</b> offers, determined to pursue his own projects despite his urgent desire to find another film to direct. During this time, Lucas conceived {{the idea for a}} space opera (as yet untitled) which later became the basis for his Star Wars franchise. At the May 1971 Cannes Film Festival, THX was chosen for the Directors' Fortnight competition. There, Lucas met David Picker, then president of United Artists, who was intrigued by American Graffiti and Lucas's space opera. Picker decided to give Lucas $10,000 to develop Graffiti as a screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Enemies of the Association soon fought back. George Henderson, {{the range}} detective who had pinned Ella Watson, {{was murdered by}} rustlers near Sweetwater Creek in October 1890, an obvious taunt to the Association. The cattle barons soon {{tightened}} their control and hunted <b>down</b> <b>those</b> who tried to oppose them. The double lynching of the Averells {{was followed by the}} lynching of Tom Waggoner, a horse trader from Newcastle, in June 1891. A friend of Waggoner named Jimmy the Butcher, who was once arrested for rustling the Standard Cattle Company, was also murdered. Range detective Tom Smith killed a suspected rustler, and when he was indicted for murder, political connections of the Association secured his release. These killings would precipitate more hostilities and violence in the years to come.|$|E

25|$|Among the 20 cricketers offered contracts, 13 of {{them were}} offered central contracts. To complicate things further, five players turned <b>down</b> <b>those</b> contracts: Alex Obanda, Shem Ngoche, James Ngoche, Nehemiah Odhiambo, and Elijah Otieno. Sears {{said that they were}} pleased with the group of seven players who {{committed}} to Cricket Kenya, while equally disappointed with those who refused contracts. Accordingly, they were left out of the squad to face the UAE in the ICC Intercontinental Cup.|$|E
25|$|It also {{represents}} {{a microcosm of}} the slaughtering of animals by humans, accompanied by their dogs in their hunting camps subsequent to the initial creation. Not only did men hunted animals, but trees cut <b>down</b> <b>those</b> closest to them and animals killed each other, as found in the myth of the hyena and the talking tree. This disorder led to Roog's direct intervention and its reoganisation of the Universe which the narrative says would have repercussions for Planet Earth.|$|E

25|$|On October 6, 2014, the Supreme Court {{denied to}} review Kitchen, {{allowing}} the Tenth Circuit's decision to become final. Thus, Utah {{was required to}} immediately begin licensing and recognizing same-sex marriages. This decision also became binding on federal courts throughout the Tenth Circuit, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico (the only state that already allowed same-sex marriage prior to Kitchen). In the next months that followed, district courts in all remaining Tenth Circuit states struck <b>down</b> <b>those</b> state's same-sex marriage bans. Kansas is currently the only state where same-sex marriage is not recognized, due to Kansas' interpretation of the injunction ordered.|$|E
25|$|The company grew by {{increasing}} sales and through acquisitions. After purchasing competing firms, Rockefeller shut <b>down</b> <b>those</b> he {{believed to be}} inefficient and kept the others. In a seminal deal, in 1868, the Lake Shore Railroad, {{a part of the}} New York Central, gave Rockefeller's firm a going rate of one cent a gallon or forty-two cents a barrel, an effective 71% discount from its listed rates in return for a promise to ship at least 60 carloads of oil daily and to handle load and unload on its own. Smaller companies decried such deals as unfair because they were not producing enough oil to qualify for discounts.|$|E
25|$|Most banking {{services}} {{have their own}} credit card services that handle fraud cases and monitor for any possible attempt at fraud. Employees that are specialized in doing fraud monitoring and investigation are often placed in Risk Management, Fraud and Authorization, or Cards and Unsecured Business. Fraud monitoring emphasizes minimizing fraud losses while making an attempt to track <b>down</b> <b>those</b> responsible and contain the situation. Credit card fraud is a major white collar crime that {{has been around for}} many decades, even {{with the advent of the}} chip based card (EMV) that was put into practice in some countries to prevent cases such as these. Even with the implementation of such measures, credit card fraud continues to be a problem.|$|E

25|$|When Sahuc {{participated in}} the Battle of Raab on 14 June, only the 8th and 25th Chasseurs were present. While Emmanuel Grouchy and Louis-Pierre Montbrun's cavalry on the right flank {{defeated}} the Austrians opposed to them, his division guarded the left. As the Austrian army withdrew {{at the end of}} the battle, Sahuc's cavalry launched a pursuit which soon came upon some Hungarian insurrection (militia) infantry formed in squares. Though the raw Hungarians fired a scattered volley, they managed to fend off the first charge because the French horsemen attacked in a disorderly fashion. The second charge was better organized. One Chasseur regiment concentrated on one side of a square and broke through. Furious at their earlier repulse, they butchered the helpless Hungarians without mercy, even cutting <b>down</b> <b>those</b> who tried to surrender.|$|E
25|$|The French {{captured}} four generals, 17 colonels, 306 lower-ranking officers, and 5,560 men for a {{total of}} 5,887 prisoners. The I Corps also seized four artillery pieces and 20 colors. In addition, the Spanish suffered losses of perhaps 1,000 killed and wounded. Victor admitted a loss of 150 though another source gave a total of 200 French casualties. Despite their easy triumph, the French soldiery got out of control after the battle, sacking Uclés and murdering 69 civilians. In particular, monks were singled out for slaughter for allegedly firing on French soldiers. The prisoners were also treated cruelly, according to two French eyewitnesses. When the Spaniards were marched to Madrid, their captors shot <b>down</b> <b>those</b> who were unable to keep up; 30 or more men per day were put to death in this manner.|$|E
25|$|Lanier's campus {{has been}} {{expanded}} numerous times {{since it was}} first built. The most notable expansion was {{the addition of the}} area of the building housing the cafeteria and gymnasium. This expansion has resulted in some quirks in the building that are still visible today, most notably a door leading to stairs to the basement that is only half-exposed above the floor of the hallway. These stairs are no longer in service, though the door can be opened even though it's blocked by the hallway floor. Students aren't allowed to open the door and/or go <b>down</b> <b>those</b> stairs. Prior to this expansion, the cafeteria was located where the library is today, on the third floor. A dumbwaiter, located where the elevator is today, carried food to the cafeteria.|$|E

25|$|Amadioha (from ámádí + ọ̀hà, 'free {{will of the}} people' in Igbo) is the Alusi of justice, thunder, {{lightning}} and the sky. He {{is referred to as}} Amadioha in southern Igboland, Kamalu, Kamanu, Kalu among the Aro and other Cross River Igbo people, Igwe among the Isuama Igbo and in northwestern Igboland, and Ofufe in certain parts of Igboland. His governing planet is the Sun. His color is red, and his symbol is a white ram. Metaphysically, Amadioha represents the collective will of the people and he is often associated with Anyanwu. He is the expression of divine justice and wrath against taboos and crimes; in oaths he is sworn by and strikes <b>down</b> <b>those</b> who swear falsely with thunder and lightning. Amadioha shrines exist around Igboland, his main shrine is located at Ozuzu in the riverine Igbo region in northern Rivers State. While Anyanwu is more prominent in northern Igboland, Amadioha is more prominent in the south. His day is Afo, which is the second market day. In mbari houses Amadioha is depicted beside Ala as her consort.|$|E
25|$|It is only by {{maintaining}} such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot {{themselves in the}} act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking <b>down</b> <b>those</b> guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.|$|E
