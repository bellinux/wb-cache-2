5|$|In the 1780s, Catherine {{slightly}} favored Poniatowski {{over the}} opposition, {{but did not}} support any of his plans for significant reforms. Despite repeated attempts, Poniatowski failed to confederate the sejms, which would have made them immune to liberum veto. Thus, although he had {{a majority in the}} Sejms, Poniatowski was unable to pass <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> reform. The Zamoyski Code was rejected by the Sejm of 1780, and opposition attacks on the king dominated the Sejms of 1782 and 1786.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{there were}} {{problems}} {{with all of these}} hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis did not explain why <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells. Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E

5|$|The {{show was}} {{primarily}} filmed using Sony DSR-570 cameras, although special equipment {{was needed for}} some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' burrows, mini fibre-optic infra-red cameras were employed; wide-angle shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote-controlled camera platform. An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. Eye-level shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> tripods.|$|E
5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
5|$|The mantapa is {{the hall}} where {{groups of people}} gather during prayers. The {{entrance}} to the mantapa normally has a highly ornate overhead lintel called a makaratorana (makara is an imaginary beast and torana is an overhead decoration). The open mantapa which serves the purpose of an outer hall (outer mantapa) is a regular feature in larger Hoysala temples leading to an inner small closed mantapa and the shrine(s). The open mantapas which are often spacious have seating areas (asana) made of stone with the mantapa's parapet wall acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the parapet wall. The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars that create many bays. The shape of the open mantapa is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> open mantapa has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The mantapa ceiling is generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contains sculptural depictions of banana bud motifs and other such decorations.|$|E

60|$|When {{the sheik}} woke, after two hours' sleep, he drank some broth. His voice was louder and clearer, {{and it was}} evident that <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> {{quantity}} that he had taken before, and the quiet sleep, had refreshed him greatly.|$|R

25|$|Nearly all lines use {{the core}} route {{through the city}} centre in the underground, {{creating}} a bottle-neck responsible for long and increasingly frequent delays from <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> disruptions. The disadvantage of current core route is the inability of trains to reroute themselves onto different tracks in an event of disruption.|$|E
25|$|Thus, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> social actions {{contribute}} to the alteration or reproduction of social systems. Social stability and order is not permanent; agents always possess a dialectic of control (discussed below) which allows them {{to break away from}} normative actions. Depending on the social factors present, agents may cause shifts in social structure.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{wavelength}} for <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> of macroscopic objects is extremely small, diffraction of matter waves is only visible for small particles, like electrons, neutrons, atoms and small molecules. The short wavelength of these matter waves makes them {{ideally suited to}} study the atomic crystal structure of solids and large molecules like proteins.|$|E

25|$|Few {{structures}} {{associated with}} Saladin survive within modern cities. Saladin first fortified the Citadel of Cairo (1175–1183), {{which had been}} a domed pleasure pavilion with a fine view in more peaceful times. In Syria, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> city is centred on a defensible citadel, and Saladin introduced this essential feature to Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Covering the {{affected}} patch of {{ground with a}} non-translucent material {{can be an effective}} follow-up strategy. However, the trimmed stems of the plant can be razor sharp and are able to pierce through most materials. Covering with non-flexible materials such as concrete slabs has to be done meticulously and without leaving <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> splits. The slightest opening can be enough for the plant to grow back.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} in Austria {{is similar to}} Germany. There are just six career fire services in Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck, Klagenfurt, Salzburg and Linz. As of 2007, some 4,527 volunteer fire departments, the back-bone of the Austrian fire service, could rely on about 320,000 men and women voluntary firefighters as active members. Fire departments exist in <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> villages, where they contribute to community life, usually by organizing fairs and other fund-raising activities.|$|E
50|$|The first patrol was unsuccessful, Allied {{precautions}} and counter-measures {{were effective}} {{enough to prevent}} her from successfully targeting <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> coastal vessels {{to be found in}} this area. She returned empty-handed, and Haas was replaced by Konstantin von Rappard, who now commanded her for the remainder of her service career.|$|R

25|$|Barn funnel weavers {{are active}} and agile hunters, relying on both their vision and {{movement}} speed {{as well as}} web mechanisms. Their eye configuration, with six out of eight sighting forward, allows them to distinguish <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> movement {{in front of them}} and either follow it, or retreat, if the movement is too large. These spiders are also known to be photosensitive, i.e. moving to or fleeing from the light, depending on situations.|$|E
25|$|The Bush Company {{terminal}} business {{became the}} Bush Terminal Co. in 1902 when Irving T. Bush bought {{the land from}} the Standard Oil Co. The warehouses were built circa 1892–1910, the railroad from 1896 to 1915, and the factory lofts between 1905 and 1925. Together, Bush Terminal offered economies of scale for its tenants, so that <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> interests had available to them the type of facilities normally only available to large, well-capitalized firms.|$|E
25|$|The {{acoustics}} of {{the enclosed}} place {{make it a}} whispering gallery where <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> sound is heard across {{the other side of}} the Gumbaz. Any whisper, clap or sound gets echoed around 10 times. Each tower consists of seven storeys, and the upper floor of each opens on to a round gallery which surrounds the dome. In the centre of the chamber is a square raised podium approached by steps in the centre of each side.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} {{intended}} to be historically accurate. Hugh Gray, a noted historian and motion picture studio researcher, was hired by Zimbalist as the film's historical advisor. A veteran of the Hollywood historical epic, it was the last film he worked on. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> details were historically correct. For example, Wyler asked a professor at the University of Jerusalem to copy a portion of the Dead Sea Scrolls for a scene that called for parchment with Hebrew writing on it.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 (two {{years after}} the incident), the World Health Organization {{indicated}} that {{the residents of the}} area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative Linear no-threshold model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect.|$|E
25|$|From {{the ninth}} {{cervical}} vertebra to the back, the vertebral joints show {{the remains of}} articular capsules. Between the spines at places very thin interspinal and supraspinal ligaments are visible. Six vertebrae are visibly capped by cartilaginous synchondroses, a typical juvenile feature. Cartilaginous caps are also present on all limb joints, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest,</b> and are especially thick in the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. Also the pubic foot is capped and the ilium and pubic bone are separated by cartilage.|$|E
50|$|For {{residents}} of Anglesey, the air service is significantly quicker than surface transport. Gate-to-gate travel time to Cardiff is around 1 hour. However passenger usage is very low. Holyhead railway station had 237,000 passengers in 2012-2013, and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> station near <b>the</b> airport Valley railway station with 17,968 annual passengers far surpassed {{the usage of}} the airport.|$|R
