40|$|Mast cells cannot produce, {{but take}} up {{exogenous}} IL- 17 A. IL- 17 A, a major proinflammatory cytokine, {{can be produced}} {{by a variety of}} leukocytes, but its exact cellular source in human inflammatory diseases remains incompletely understood. IL- 17 A protein is abundantly found in mast cells in human tissues, such as inflamed synovium, but surprisingly, mechanistic murine studies failed to demonstrate IL- 17 A production by mast cells. Here, we demonstrate that primary human tissue mast cells do not produce IL- 17 A themselves but actively capture exogenous IL- 17 A through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The exogenous IL- 17 A is stored in intracellular granules and can subsequently be released in a bioactive form. This novel mechanism confers to mast cells the capacity to steer IL- 17 A-mediated tissue inflammation by the rapid <b>release</b> <b>of</b> preformed <b>cytokin...</b>|$|R

40|$|Moraxella catarrhalis is {{the second}} most common cause of {{bacterial}} exacerbation of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Contrary to that fact, {{little is known about the}} interaction between this pathogen and the human bronchial epithelium. The present study analyses whether M. catarrhalis is able to evoke an inflammatory immune response in bronchial epithelial cells and which pattern recognition receptors, signal transduction pathways and other regulation mechanisms are involved in such a potential activation. The results of this study showed that an infection of human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS- 2 B) with M. catarrhalis induced a secretion of many different inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. In detailed investigation of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), it was found that M. catarrhalis induced a time- and dose-dependent secretion in these cells. Furthermore, M. catarrhalis-infected bronchial epithelial cells showed a clearly activation of the mitogen-activeted protein kinases (MAPK) ERK 1 / 2, p 38 and JNK as well as of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. The inhibition of MAPK-phoshorylation of p 38 and ERK 1 / 2 and activation of NF-kappaB reduced the <b>cytokin</b> <b>release</b> by M. catarrhalis. Interestingly, M. catarrhalis of the cells, lead to a decrease in global histone deacetylase expression and activity which was associated with an augmented <b>cytokin</b> <b>release.</b> The toll-like receptors TLR 2 and TLR 4 are involved in lung epithelial cell response to M. catarrhalis and the specific M. catarrhalis Lipooligosaccharide has been identified as a TLR 4 ligand. The results presented here, provide a better understanding into important molecular and cellular mechanisms of the pulmonary epithelial response to infection with M. catarrhalis. The ability to influence the immune response induced by M. catarrhalis may potentially contribute to provide the basis for new therapeutic strategies for patients with COPD...|$|R

40|$|The number <b>of</b> vesicles <b>released</b> at {{excitatory}} synapses and {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>release</b> sites per synaptic connection are key determinants of information processing in the cortex, yet they remain uncertain. Here we show that the number <b>of</b> functional <b>release</b> sites {{and the number}} of anatomically identified synaptic contacts are equal at connections between spiny stellate and pyramidal cells in rat barrel cortex. Moreover, our results indicate that the amount <b>of</b> transmitter <b>released</b> per synaptic contact is independent <b>of</b> <b>release</b> probability and the intrinsic release probability is high. These prop-erties suggest that connections between layer 4 and layer 2 / 3 are tuned for reliable transmission of spatially distributed, timing-based signals. Synaptic weight is thought to be a primary determinant of neural computation. Accord-ing to the quantal hypothesis (1, 2) the effi-cacy of a connection is determined by the product of the probability <b>of</b> <b>release,</b> the num-ber <b>of</b> <b>release</b> sites, {{and the size of the}} postsynaptic response to a quantum of trans-mitter. Quantal parameters determine how reliably information is transmitted (3, 4), with higher rates of information transfer pos-sible at connections with larger numbers <b>of</b> <b>release</b> sites and higher (sustained) release probabilities (3). However, basic synaptic properties, such as number of functional and anatomical release sites per connection and the release probability per site, remain uncer-tain at most cortical synapses. Moreover, the number <b>of</b> vesicles <b>released</b> at individual syn-aptic contacts is controversial. Correlation <b>of</b> functional <b>release</b> sites and anatomicall...|$|R

30|$|The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>release</b> times <b>of</b> a vesicle for depressing synapses with a singlerelease site is {{simpler to}} calculate {{than that for}} facilitating synapses, because whenconsidering synaptic depression alone, the probability <b>of</b> <b>release</b> from a single sitesimply depends on the time since last <b>release</b> <b>of</b> a vesicle from that site. Therefore, wewill solve for depressing synapses {{before moving to the}} case of facilitating synapses,where the probability <b>of</b> <b>release</b> depends on the number of intervening spikes. Thesubsequent result for facilitating synapses will prove to be more biologically relevant,as synapses typically contain multiple releasable vesicles, so {{it is only in the}} casewhere the baseline release probability is lowâ€”in which case facilitationdominatesâ€”that failure <b>of</b> <b>release</b> is common enough to affect the distribution ofrelease times.

40|$|AbstractThe rate <b>of</b> <b>release</b> from nerve {{terminals}} {{depends on}} both the number <b>of</b> <b>release</b> sites and the rate <b>of</b> <b>release</b> at each site. The latter remains largely unknown at central synapses. We addressed this issue by simultaneously measuring the nerve terminal membrane capacitance and the postsynaptic current at single calyceal synapses in rat brainstem. We found that a 10 ms presynaptic step depolarization depleted a releasable pool containing 3300 â€“ 5200 vesicles. Released vesicles were endocytosed with a time constant of {{a few seconds to}} tens <b>of</b> seconds. <b>Release</b> <b>of</b> only one third of this pool saturated both postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptors. A release site can release more than three vesicles in 10 ms (> 300 vesicles per second).
