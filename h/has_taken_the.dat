5|$|Among revivals in the 1950s and later, Hepokoski singles out as {{particularly}} notable the Glyndebourne productions with Fernando Corena and later Geraint Evans {{in the title}} role; three different stagings by Franco Zeffirelli, for the Holland Festival (1956), Covent Garden (1961) and the Metropolitan Opera (1964); and Luchino Visconti's 1966 version in Vienna. A 1982 production by Ronald Eyre, more reflective and melancholy than usual, was staged in Los Angeles, London and Florence; Renato Bruson was Falstaff and Giulini conducted.

5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As {{shown in figure}} 4, after an atomic exchange event the adatom <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> place of a surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom. This process may take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate {{due to the fact}} that both atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination throughout the process.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} two {{distinct}} objectives: to evaluate how effectively the family life education program at Sir John A. Macdonald High School in Hamilton, Ontario is meeting its stated objectives and {{to evaluate the}} relative effectiveness of a traditional teaching method and an annovative teaching method with this family life education program. There are three groups in this study. <b>The</b> first group <b>took</b> <b>the</b> family life education program taught with the innovative method, <b>the</b> second group <b>took</b> <b>the</b> family life education program taught with the traditional method,a nd the third group did not take a family life education program. Students in all three groups were administered a pretest questionnaire in October, 1975 and a posttest questionnaire in May, 1976. Tests of significance were applied {{to all of the}} following hypotheses: Degree of change in the proportion of students who report having positive relationships with their parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students seeking help with their personal problems from their parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students reporting a high level of assertiveness with their parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students who have occupational goals will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students with a nontraditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students {{with a high level of}} self-esteem will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> not <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students who report having positive relationships with their parents, teachers, friend and siblings will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> innovatively taught family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students seeking help with their personal problems from parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> innovatively taught family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students reporting a high level of assertiveness with parents, teachers, friends and siblings will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> innovatively taught family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students with a nontraditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> innovatively taught family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> traditionally taught family life education program. Degree of change in the proportion of students with a high level of self-esteem will be greater for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> innovatively taught family life education program than for students who <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> traditionally taught family life education program. Analysis of the pretest data showed that there were no significant differences among the three groups on age, sex, religion, father’s education, father’s occupation, participation in class, birth position, grade average, relationships with others, help-seeking behaviour, level of assertiveness, the proportion having career goals or attitude toward marriage and woman’s role. The control group had a significantly higher level of self-esteem at pretest. At posttest, this significant difference had disappeared. We also found that there had been a significant increase in the proportion of comparison group respondents who felt that trial marriages was acceptable for others. The experimental group, at posttest, showed a significant increase in help-seeking behaviour with siblings. There were also two significant findings which were in the opposite direction to that hypothesized. The control group showed a significantly less traditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role on two counts; there was a significant increase in the number of control group respondents who were undecided about having children, and there was a significant increase in the percentage who had a positive attitude toward trial marriage for themselves. Only one of the hypotheses predicting greater effectiveness for the innovative teaching method was supported; that students who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> innovatively taught family life education program would be more likely to seek help from siblings with their personal problems. The traditionally taught family life educationa program proved significantly more effective in increasing the proportion of students who found trial marriage acceptable for others. These findings give tentative support ot the proposition that the family life education program at Sir John A. Macdonald High School in Hamilton, Ontario meeting its stated objectives, as outlined in the text. They also suggest that the traditional teaching method and the innovative roleplaying method are equally effective with this particular course material and these particular teachers...|$|R

Karnas reminds Jameson that his treachery during their last encounter on Mordan IV resulted in years of war. Against the advice of Picard, Jameson devises plans to rescue the hostages by transporting the away team, now including the captain, to the tunnels beneath Karnas' mansion, where Jameson believes the hostages are being held. Picard privately confronts Jameson about Karnas' motives. Jameson reveals that in the past, Karnas had captured a Federation starliner in revenge {{for the death of}} his father by another local tribe. Jameson had negotiated for the passengers' release by giving Karnas what he demanded, a supply of Federation weapons. However, Jameson, in his interpretation of the Prime Directive, also supplied the warring tribes with an equal number of weapons. Jameson had thought this would only lead to a short-lived skirmish, and had not expected a war that would last over forty years. Jameson is now insistent on correcting his past mistake and thus took the reverse aging drug in order to be at his best.|$|E

5|$|Kenya gained ODI {{status in}} its own right {{following}} a strong performance in the 1996 World Cup, a competition they qualified for by gaining a second-placed finish in the 1994 ICC Trophy. The team's first ODI came against India in the 1996 World Cup, a competition for which Kenya was given temporary ODI status, with the team then playing four further matches in the competition. Kenya's first ODI win came in their fourth World Cup match against the West Indies. The Kenyans won the game by 73 runs but ultimately finished last in group A. Kenya have since qualified for four more Cricket World Cups. They reached the group stage in the 1999 competition, the 2007 competition and the 2011 competition. At the 2003 Cricket World Cup, partly hosted in Kenya, the Kenyan team finished second in their group and in doing so qualified for the Super Sixes stage. Kenya finished third in the Super Sixes stage and qualified for the semi-finals where they lost to India by 91 runs. The Kenyan team have played 154 ODI games with the most recent coming in 2014.
