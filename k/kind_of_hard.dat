Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy.

500|$|Prior {{to writing}} [...] "Smells Like Nirvana", Yankovic's music career had {{suffered}} from the poor financial performance of his 1989 feature film, UHF and the associated soundtrack. Yankovic called that [...] "the beginning of three years where it was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> for me to recover". He started work on a new studio album around 1990. To revitalize his career, he considered creating a parody of a Michael Jackson song, which had proven successful twice before with [...] "Eat It" [...] and [...] "Fat". He had composed a parody of Jackson's [...] "Black or White", titled [...] "Snack All Night", but Jackson said he was uncomfortable with the parody, given that the original song {{was intended to be}} a political statement. Yankovic would later believe that Jackson's refusal was, in retrospect, a blessing; he felt that [...] "Snack All Night" [...] was not one of his better works. While he had compiled other original songs for a new album he feared the lack of a good parody song would doom the album to failure and held off from releasing anything until an idea presented itself.|$|E

They were only {{important}} to her." [...] Carey included a cover of [...] Def Leppard's song [...] "Bringin' On the Heartbreak". During the photo shoot for Charmbracelet at Capri, Carey happened to listen to Def Leppard's greatest hits album [...] (1995), which contains the song, and decided to cover it. In an interview with Billboard, Carey said that the song is [...] "an example of her musical diversity". Jackson also worked on [...] "My Saving Grace", which Carey said describes her thoughts about the writing, recording and mastering process. While working in Capri, Carey's father became ill with cancer and she returned to New York {{to spend some time with}} him; he died soon after. In his memory, Carey wrote and produced the song [...] "Sunflowers for Alfred Roy". Carey said that the song represents [...] "his side of the family and is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> to talk about."

Of GoonRock, Lopez commented by stating that he is [...] "very forward with his sound". After recording her vocals for the song, Flo Rida recorded a rap verse for the song. Those involved {{in the production of}} the song were extremely happy with the song before Flo Rida's rap appeared on it, but once his vocals were on the song it [...] "took it over the top top". When choosing who she wanted to feature on the song, Lopez had several other rappers in mind, such as Big Sean. Lopez revealed: [...] "We had a couple of people who said yes, that they would get on it, but [...] just seemed like the perfect one."

500|$|Most of the {{material}} was written by Cornell and bassist Ben Shepherd, the latter having already worked on six of the sixteen album tracks. Reportedly, tensions within the group arose during the recording sessions, with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Thayil's only contribution to the album was the song [...] "Never the Machine Forever", for which he wrote both the lyrics and the music, and which was also the last song the band recorded. The song initially {{came out of a}} jam session Thayil had with Seattle musician Greg Gilmore. In the liner notes, Thayil credits Gilmore for inspiring the song. He stated that {{he had a lot of}} incomplete music ideas that were missing lyrics and were not arranged, so they did not make the album. Thayil said, [...] "It can be a little bit discouraging if there isn't satisfactory creative input, but on the other hand, I write all the solo bits and don't really have limitations on the parts I come up with for guitar." [...] Cornell said, [...] "By the time we were finished, it felt like it had been <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard,</b> like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering." ...|$|E

500|$|Will Smith {{signed on}} to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like [...] "Gladiator [...] Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [...] always felt like it had those {{possibilities}} to me." [...] The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that [...] "when you're on your own, it is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> to find conflict." [...] The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with {{a person who had}} been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, [...] "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" [...] He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000).|$|E
500|$|Following the {{worldwide}} tour {{in support of}} Superunknown, the band began working on what would become their last studio album for over 15 years, choosing to produce the record themselves. However, tensions within the group reportedly arose during the sessions, with Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Cornell said, [...] "By {{the time we were}} finished, it felt like it had been <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard,</b> like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering." [...] The band's fifth album, Down on the Upside, was released on May 21, 1996. It was notably less heavy than the group's earlier albums, and marked a further departure from the band's grunge roots. At the time, Soundgarden explained that they wanted to experiment with other sounds, including acoustic instrumentation. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric." [...] The overall mood of the album's lyrics is less dark than on previous Soundgarden albums, with Cornell describing some songs as [...] "self-affirming". The album spawned several singles, including [...] "Pretty Noose", [...] "Burden in My Hand", and [...] "Blow Up the Outside World". [...] "Pretty Noose" [...] was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1997. Despite favorable reviews and modest sales, the album did not match the sales or critical praise of Superunknown.|$|E

[...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it was going to be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, it was kind of like, [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E

Looking back at this time, Vedder said, [...] "It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young.
