Later they found similar results in Giganotosaurus specimens, who lived on a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it does not necessarily mean that it was endothermic.

The Enquiry is 9 books of [...] "applied" [...] botany dealing with the forms and classification of plants and economic botany, examining the techniques of agriculture (relationship of crops to soil, climate, water and habitat) and horticulture. He described some 500 plants in detail, often including descriptions of habitat and geographic distribution, and he recognised some plant groups that can be recognised as modern-day plant families. Some names he used, like Crataegus, Daucus and Asparagus have persisted until today. His second book Causes of Plants covers plant growth and reproduction (akin to modern physiology). Like Aristotle he grouped plants into [...] "trees", [...] "undershrubs", [...] "shrubs" [...] and [...] "herbs" [...] but he also made several other important botanical distinctions and observations. He noted that plants could be annuals, perennials and biennials, they were also either monocotyledons or dicotyledons and he also noticed the difference between determinate and <b>indeterminate</b> <b>growth</b> and details of floral structure including the degree of fusion of the petals, position of the ovary and more.

40|$|SummaryPlants have a {{remarkable}} potential for sustained (<b>indeterminate)</b> postembryonic <b>growth.</b> Following their specification {{in the early}} embryo, tissue-specific precursor cells first establish tissues and later maintain them postembryonically. The mechanisms underlying these processes are largely unknown. Here we define local control of oriented, periclinal cell division as the mechanism underlying both the establishment and maintenance of vascular tissue. We identify an auxin-regulated basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor dimer as a critical regulator of vascular development. Due {{to a loss of}} periclinal divisions, vascular tissue gradually disappears in bHLH-deficient mutants; conversely, ectopic expression is sufficient for triggering periclinal divisions. We show that this dimer operates independently of tissue identity but is restricted to a small vascular domain by integrating overlapping transcription patterns of the interacting bHLH proteins. Our work reveals a common mechanism for tissue establishment and indeterminate vascular development and provides a conceptual framework for developmental control of local cell divisions...|$|R

Once we allow for the endogenous determination of labour and of total human capital, we find that equilibrium can be indeterminate with a much lower elasticity of intertemporal substitution of consumption. Moreover, if some modest increasing returns are introduced into the production function for human capital, the issue of global as opposed to local indeterminacy arises: this refers to situations when there exist multiple determinate BGPs, but where the global dynamics is still indeterminate from given initial conditions. ...|$|R

Depending {{on the plant}} species, two mechanisms of infection have been described: The first is observed in [...] casuarinas or alders and is called root hair infection. In this case the infection begins with an intracellular infection of a root hair and {{is followed by the}} formation of a primitive symbiotic organ lacking any particular organization, a prenodule. The second mechanism of infection is called intercellular entry and is well described in Discaria species. In this case bacteria penetrate the root extracellularly, growing between epidermal cells then between cortical cells. Later on Frankia becomes intracellular but no prenodule is formed. In both cases the infection leads to cell divisions in the pericycle and the formation of a new organ consisting of several lobes anatomically similar to a lateral root. This organ is the actinorhizal nodule also called actinorhizae. Cortical cells of the nodule are invaded by Frankia filaments coming from the site of infection or the prenodule. Actinorhizal nodules have generally an <b>indeterminate</b> <b>growth,</b> new cells are therefore continually produced at the apex and successively become infected.

Orthologs of GhFT 1 was previously isolated and characterized from Gossypium hirsutum. We demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of GhFT 1 in tobacco, other than promoting flowering, promoted lateral shoot outgrowth at the base, induced more axillary bud at the axillae of rosette leaves, altered leaf morphology, increased chlorophyll content, had higher photosynthesis and caused flowers abscission. Analysis of gene expression suggested that flower identity genes were significantly upregulated in transgenic plants. Further analysis of tobacco FT paralogs indicated that NtFT 4, acting as flower inducer, was upregulated, whereas NtFT 2 and NtFT 3 as flower inhibitors were upregulated in transgenic plants under long-day conditions, but downregulated under short-day conditions. Our data suggested that sufficient level of foreign FT might disturb the balance of the endogenous FT paralogs of inducers and repressors and resulted in altered phenotype in transgenic tobacco, emphasizing the expanding roles of FT in regulating shoot architecture by advancing determine growth.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of exogenous mortality risks, future reproduction by an individual is worth less than present reproduction to its fitness. Senescent aging thus results inevitably from transferring net fertility into younger ages. Some long-lived organisms appear to defy theory, however, presenting negligible senescence (e. g., hydra) and extended lifespans (e. g., Bristlecone Pine). Here, we investigate {{the possibility that the}} onset of vitality loss can be delayed indefinitely, even accepting the abundant evidence that reproduction is intrinsically costly to survival. For an environment with constant hazard, we establish that natural selection itself contributes to increasing densitydependent recruitment losses. We then develop a generalized model of accelerating vitality loss for analyzing fitness optima as a tradeoff between compression and spread in the age profile of net fertility. Across a realistic spectrum of senescent age profiles, density regulation of recruitment can trigger runaway selection for ever-reducing senescence. This novel prediction applies without requirement for special life-history characteristics such as <b>indeterminate</b> somatic <b>growth</b> or increasing fecundity with age. The evolution of nonsenescence from senescence is robust to {{the presence}} of exogenous adult mortality, which tends instead to increase the age-independent component of vitality loss.

It is generally, but erroneously held that the RAM indefinitely produces new cells throughout the lifespan of a plant, resulting in <b>indeterminate</b> root <b>growth.</b> On the contrary, convincing data, mainly from the lab of Thomas L.

In addition, RAM organization evolved to become highly plastic and dynamic in response to environmental triggers (e. g. water and nutrient availability, pollutants). Under unfavourable conditions, the RAM is rapidly reorganized, and, {{as a result of}} the cessation of new cell production at the root tip, root growth is altered, and lateral root production is enhanced, thus providing the plant additional strategies to overcome the stress. It is now becoming increasingly clear that this environment-responsive developmental plasticity is linked to reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, antioxidants, and related enzymes, which form part of a complex signalling module specifically operating in the regulation of RAM functioning, in strict relationship with hormonal control of root development exerted by auxin, gibberellins and cytokinins.

Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an advanced imaging technique widely used in animal developmental biology, providing efficient fast optical sectioning under physiological conditions with considerably reduced phototoxicity and photobleaching. Long-term 4 D imaging of living plants offers advantages for developmental cell biology not available in other microscopy approaches. Recently, LSFM was implemented in plant developmental biology studies, however, it is largely restricted to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
