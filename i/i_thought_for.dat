500|$|Villeneuve {{was joined}} by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and even briefly led the {{championship}} after winning back to back races in USA and South Africa. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve's wheel-banging duel with René Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix. Arnoux passed Villeneuve for second place with three laps to go, but Villeneuve re-passed him on the next lap. On the final lap Arnoux attempted to pass Villeneuve again, and the pair ran side-by-side through the first few corners of the lap, making contact several times. Arnoux took the position but Villeneuve attempted an outside pass one corner later. The cars bumped hard, Villeneuve slid wide but then passed Arnoux on the inside at a hairpin turn and held him off for {{the last half of}} the lap to secure second place. Villeneuve commented afterwards, [...] "I tell you, that was really fun! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> sure we were going to get on our heads, you know, because when you start interlocking wheels it's very easy for one car to climb over another." [...] At the Dutch Grand Prix a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve's left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pits on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pits Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair. Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the Italian Grand Prix, but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. During the extremely wet Friday practice session for the season-ending United States Grand Prix, Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver. His teammate Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest, recalled that [...] "I scared myself rigid that day. I thought I had to be quickest. Then I saw Gilles's time and — I still don't really understand how it was possible. Eleven seconds!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Kearns went to Washington, D.C. as a White House Fellow {{during the}} Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Johnson {{initially}} {{expressed interest in}} hiring the young intern as his Oval Office assistant, but after an article by Kearns appeared in The New Republic laying out a scenario for Johnson's removal from office over his {{conduct of the war}} in Vietnam, she was instead assigned to the Department of Labor; Goodwin has written that she felt relieved to be able to remain in the internship program in any capacity at all. [...] "The president discovered that I had been actively involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement and had written an article entitled, 'How to Dump Lyndon Johnson'. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> sure he would kick me out of the program, but instead he said, 'Oh, bring her down here for a year and if I can't win her over, no one can'." [...] After Johnson decided not to run for reelection, he brought Kearns to the White House as a member of his staff, where she focused on domestic anti-poverty efforts.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. G. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> cared <b>for</b> him--and I didn't--and {{then you}} came--and I cared for you very, very much indeed. That's all. (Face hidden.) You aren't angry, are you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} have told me," [...] Tommy said, staring into her face, [...] "if you had <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> cared <b>for</b> you. Had you <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> cared <b>for</b> you a little jot--" ...|$|R

60|$|She lay in my arms, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} she had fainted.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} over this reply. It was obscure, perhaps, but I thought that I saw dimly his meaning.|$|E
60|$|Hereupon Marble {{made what}} he called a rumpus in good earnest. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> a minute, he would kick the cabin-doors down.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Wait a moment, Mr. Robbie,’ said I. ‘You {{forget the}} chapter of expenses. <b>I</b> had <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> a beginning, of placing a {{thousand}} pounds in your hands.’ ...|$|R

60|$|As {{they drew}} near <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> many reasons {{that it would}} not be {{advisable}} to show myself, and I stepped behind a tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "With what?" [...] I asked. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> {{the moment}} he was {{suggesting}} potted pigs' feet in the nearest English he could get to it.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> hard <b>for</b> a few minutes. We were speculating boldly, {{and already}} had {{undertaken}} rather {{more than we}} could manage; but the offer was tempting, and, noting Harry's eagerness, I agreed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{expensive}} indeed," [...] she agreed, with a sigh. [...] "I {{have been}} looking forward to seeing you, Jerry. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> perhaps, <b>for</b> the sake of old times you might advise me." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> my part, {{that they}} had all said enough already. They had praised and thanked us for things we had never thought of.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{disturbs}} you? What are you {{staring at}} the book for? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> an instant that {{you must have been}} overcome again!" [...] I jumped up.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{following}} letter being a panegyric upon me for {{a quality}} which every man may attain, an acknowledgment of his faults; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it <b>for</b> the good of my fellow writers to publish it." [...] [T.S.]] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, to be sure! <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} you {{had come for}} pleasure, or out of civility, as it might be. Of course I didn't expect that when I saw you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "By George," [...] Harry exclaimed, {{taking his}} pipe {{suddenly}} from his mouth, and jumping {{up from his}} chair,--"By George, if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> a moment that Percy Desborough----" ...|$|E
60|$|In another {{instant he}} had me by the throat. His grasp {{was that of a}} band of steel, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> a surety my last hour had come.|$|E
60|$|Of course I'd ask her {{to marry}} me if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> a moment that she'd accept. But I'm so terrified that she'll refuse, and then perhaps I shall never see her again.|$|E
60|$|SAVVY. Oh, I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was <b>for</b> a moment. I can believe, {{in a sort}} of way, {{that people}} might live for three hundred years. But when you came down to tin tacks, and said that the parlor maid might, then I saw how absurd it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove! yes, I'm awfully lucky; <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} that she'd have me, you know--a woman like her, with so much {{attention}} and everything. I can't imagine what she sees in me." ...|$|R
60|$|Hamet. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{your passion}} <b>for</b> the queen was dead, Or that your love had, with your hopes, been fled.|$|R
6000|$|... “I realize that. If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment}} that baby was in any peril I would go distracted, and scream louder than poor Louise is doing. Do you hear her? Isn’t it awful?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be {{very sure}} that you do," [...] Anna said slowly. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> a moment {{that there was any}} chance of a relapse, I should stop here and tell him the truth even now." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{some days}} I was smitten {{with the idea}} of {{dedicating}} my little booklet to one of my numerous personal antagonists, and conveying some subtly devised insult with an air of magnanimity. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> instance, of Blizzard-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. G.—Yes (but rather reluctantly, <b>I</b> <b>thought).</b> As <b>for</b> Marie Antoinette, {{she was not}} a {{striking}} character in any senses she was horribly frivolous; and, I suppose, we must say she was, what shall I call it—a very considerable flirt? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My wife,' {{said the}} little lord, 'shall write no sonnets or billets-doux; and I'm heartily glad to think I have obtained, in good time, a {{knowledge}} of the heartless vixen with whom <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> myself <b>for</b> a moment in love.' ...|$|R
