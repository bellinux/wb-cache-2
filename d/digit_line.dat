Removed functions include last answer recall, nPr/nCr, reduction study, highest common factor/lowest common multiple, quotient/remainder calculation, equation playback. However, it gains cubic power/root, hyperbolic trigonometry, angle unit conversion, polar/cartesian coordinate conversion, complex number calculation, Bin/Oct/Hex calculations (without logical operations) over EL-500W.

2500|$|After {{the second}} number {{has been written}} down under the first one so that <b>digits</b> <b>line</b> up in their correct columns, draw a line under the second (bottom) number. Start with the ones-column: the ones-column should contain a pair of digits: the ones-digit of the first number and, under it, the ones-digit of the second number. Find the sum of these two digits: write this sum under the line and in the ones-column. If the sum has two digits, then write down only the ones-digit of the sum.

50|$|The {{parity check}} digit is {{calculated}} as follows: Each number digit is multiplied by two {{to the power}} of labels's position minus two.

The sum of all these numbers modulo 11 is the check digit.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{previous}} papers, {{new digital}} transmission schemes that can drastically simplify multiplexing and clock recovery {{have been investigated}} [1 - 4].

After brief overview of the principles of new digital transmission schemes that use multipled block codes (MBCs), the principles of hunting-free reframing will be discussed. Then, conditions to be satisfied by line coding for hunting-free reframing will be investigated. II. MULTIPLED BLOCK CODES A.
