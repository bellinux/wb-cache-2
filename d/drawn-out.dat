5|$|Although {{all of the}} {{original}} Class A1 locomotives were eventually rebuilt to Class A3 specifications, it was a <b>drawn-out</b> process that lasted until 1949; 60068 Sir Visto was the last locomotive to be converted. The changeover to left-hand drive took longer, and continued into the Fifties.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{responsible}} for several unique volcanological objects. Small volcanic particles are carried and formed by the wind, chilling quickly into teardrop-shaped glassy fragments known as Pele's tears (after Pele, the Hawaiian volcano deity). During especially high winds these chunks may even {{take the form of}} long <b>drawn-out</b> strands, known as Pele's hair. Sometimes basalt aerates into reticulite, the lowest density rock type on earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the main facade, with its dominant <b>drawn-out</b> and elevated projection and the two symmetrical lower lateral parts, reflects the internal division into three naves. At ground-floor level, the front was distinguished by the three-arch entrance and bifora, whereas the first-floor level had a high triforium with an elevated arch and the quadrifoliate rosettes on the staircases.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed at the Brazilian move, Argentina and Chile quickly nullified their 1902 pact {{and sought}} dreadnoughts of their own. Argentina's orders, after a <b>drawn-out</b> bidding process, {{went to an}} American company, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, while Chile's orders, delayed by the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake, went to Armstrong. Since Brazil's {{relations}} with Argentina were warming and the country's economic boom was losing steam, the government negotiated with Armstrong to remove the third dreadnought from the contract, but without success. They borrowed the necessary money, and Armstrong laid down Rio de Janeiros keel in March 1910.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} war of such length, the <b>drawn-out</b> Byzantine–Arab Wars had {{long-lasting}} effects {{for both the}} Byzantine Empire and the Arab world. The Byzantines experienced extensive territorial loss, while the invading Arabs gained strong control in the Middle East and Africa. The focus of the Byzantine Empire shifted from the western reconquests of Justinian to a primarily defensive position, against the Islamic armies on its eastern borders. Without Byzantine interference in the emerging Christian states of western Europe, the situation gave a huge stimulus to feudalism and economic self-sufficiency.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the retreat from Winchester, Matilda rebuilt her court at Devizes Castle, a former property of the Bishop of Salisbury that had been confiscated by Stephen. She established her household knights on the surrounding estates, supported by Flemish mercenaries, ruling through the network of local sheriffs and other officials. Many of those that had lost lands in the regions held by the King travelled west to take up patronage from Matilda. Backed by the pragmatic Robert of Gloucester, Matilda was content to engage in a <b>drawn-out</b> struggle, and the war soon entered a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{disputes}} between Karta and Ladbroke led the British firm {{to exit the}} project, and its shares were assumed by Alfred Akirov's Alrov company. However, further objections from many sourcesincluding religious groups opposed to an entertainment area {{so close to the}} Old City and possible operation on the Jewish Sabbathkept construction at a crawl. Both Alrov and Karta accused each other of breach of contract and sued. After years of frozen construction and <b>drawn-out</b> mediation, the Jerusalem district court found parts of both parties' complaints to be justified and ordered 100 million NIS paid to Alrov by Karta, which allowed construction to resume.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the battle}} began, the Swedish {{flagship}} Kronan sank, taking with it almost the entire crew, including the Admiral of the Realm and commander of the Swedish navy, Lorentz Creutz. The allied force {{under the leadership of}} the Dutch admiral Cornelis Tromp took full advantage of the ensuing disorder on the Swedish side. The acting commander after Creutz's sudden demise, Admiral Claes Uggla, was surrounded and his flagship Svärdet battered in a <b>drawn-out</b> artillery duel, then set ablaze by a fire ship. Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with the loss of a second supreme commander, the rest of the Swedish fleet fled in disorder.|$|E
5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and <b>drawn-out</b> sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 as the work of the Devil. In the Middle Ages, the Church had <b>drawn-out</b> discussions as to when the desire for martyrdom was suicidal, {{as in the case of}} martyrs of Córdoba. Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe, even for the times: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{extended}} his rule southward toward Nazareth and the Marj Ibn Amer plain (Jezreel Valley) between Galilee and Jabal Nablus. Capturing these areas was a <b>drawn-out</b> process, and Zahir's efforts to take Nazareth (a town in Safad Sanjak, but {{controlled by the}} Jarrar clan based in Nablus Sanjak) caused the ruling clans of the Nablus hinterland (Jabal Nablus), along with Zahir's erstwhile allies in the Bani Saqr tribe, to challenge him. Zahir, meanwhile, relied on his Zaydani kinsmen, Maghrebi mercenaries whom he commissioned in the mid-1730s under commander Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, and Nazareth's residents. In 1735, Zahir's 2,000-strong force routed the Jarrars and the Bani Saqr at al-Rawha in Marj Ibn Amer, killed their leader Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jarrar, and captured Nazareth. According to historian Hanna Samarah, Zahir's forces inflicted 8,000 fatalities among the Jarrar-Saqr coalition during the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 22November 1941, during Operation Crusader, Rawlinson led No.3 Squadron on a bomber escort mission near Bir el Gubi in the morning, and {{a fighter}} sweep {{south-east}} of El Adem in the afternoon. German Messerschmitt Bf109 fighters shot down three Tomahawks {{for the loss}} of two of their own in the first action, Rawlinson claiming a 109 damaged. In the second action, a <b>drawn-out</b> battle for air superiority, the squadron lost six Tomahawks against two 109s destroyed, one of which was claimed by Rawlinson along with one probable and one damaged. He had also taken a shot at a distant 109 and, believing he had missed it, did not claim. After the war it was established that Rawlinson's bullets had damaged the 109 and wounded its pilot, Ernst Düllberg, who made a forced landing back at base. Rawlinson was credited with his final victory on 30November, when he downed an Italian Macchi C.200 in an engagement that saw No.3 Squadron's tally of claims rise to 106 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no direct}} sources {{describing}} {{the conquest of}} the Chajoma by the Spanish but {{it appears to have}} been a <b>drawn-out</b> campaign rather than a rapid victory. The only description of the conquest of the Chajoma is a secondary account appearing in the work of Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán in the 17th century, long after the event. After the conquest, the inhabitants of the eastern part of the kingdom were relocated by the conquerors to San Pedro Sacatepéquez, including some of the inhabitants of the archaeological site now known as Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo). The rest of the population of Mixco Viejo, together with the inhabitants of the western part of the kingdom, were moved to San Martín Jilotepeque. The Chajoma rebelled against the Spanish in 1526, fighting a battle at Ukub'il, an unidentified site somewhere near the modern towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez and San Pedro Sacatepéquez.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, <b>drawn-out</b> alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E
5|$|Although the Offaly revolt was {{followed}} by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of <b>drawn-out</b> conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir Antony St Leger, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, who would remain into the post past Henry's death. Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's. The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} diocesan {{succession}} of Argyll is uncertain, the jurisdiction itself {{appears to have}} lain outwith the domain of Rǫgnvaldr's direct control, allowing the meic Somairle to readily act as religious patrons without his interference. Like the Kingdom of the Isles itself, the great geographic size of the Diocese of the Isles appears to {{have contributed to the}} alienation of outlying areas, and to its eventual disintegration. In fact, there is reason to suspect that portions of the new diocese were likewise detached from the Scottish dioceses of Dunblane, Dunkeld, and Moray. Although the Scottish Crown may have welcomed the formation of the new diocese, as it may have formed part of a plan to project Scottish royal authority into the region, the meic Somairle rulers of the region were in fact hostile to the Scots, and the diocese's seat on Lismorealbeit first recorded in the early fourteenth centurylay far outwith the Scottish king's sphere of influence. Whatever the case, the foundation of the Diocese of Argyll {{appears to have been a}} <b>drawn-out</b> and gradual process that was unlikely to have been the work of one particular mansuch as Somerled, Dubgall, or Ragnall himself. Although the early diocese suffered from prolonged vacancies, as only two bishops are recorded to have occupied the see before the turn of the mid thirteenth century, over time it became firmly established in the region, allowing the meic Somairle to retain local control of ecclesiastical power and prestige.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{announcement}} of victory, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian and his post passed to Sallustius Lucullus. Agricola's successors were seemingly {{unable or unwilling}} to further subdue the far north. Despite his apparent successes, Agricola himself fell out of favour and it is possible that Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of his claims to have won a significant victory. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge (erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius) were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is possible that the costs of a <b>drawn-out</b> war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was deemed more profitable to leave the Caledonians to themselves. By 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the 1st century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period as may Castle Greg in West Lothian, which was most likely used as a monitoring base for an east-west road running along the foot of the nearby Pentlands, from the Forth to the Clyde Valley.|$|E
5|$|The French gained {{access to}} the {{outermost}} ward by undermining its advanced main tower. Following this, Philip ordered a group of his men {{to look for a}} weak point in the castle. They {{gained access to}} the next ward when a soldier named Ralph found a latrine chute in use through which the French could clamber into the chapel. After ambushing several unsuspecting guards, and setting fire to the buildings, Philip's men then lowered the movable bridge and allowed the rest of their army into the castle. The Anglo-Norman troops retreated to the inner ward. After a short time the French successfully breached the gate of the inner ward, and the garrison retreated finally to the keep. With supplies running low Roger de Lacy and his garrison of 20knights and 120other soldiers surrendered to the French army, bringing the siege to an end on 6March 1204. In <b>drawn-out</b> medieval sieges, contemporary writers often emphasised the importance of dwindling supplies in the capitulation of the garrison, {{as was the case with}} the Siege of Château Gaillard. With the castle under French control, the main obstacle to the French entering the Seine valley was removed; they were able to enter the valley unmolested and take Normandy. Thus, for the first time since it had been given as a duchy to Rollo in 911, Normandy was directly ruled by the French king. The city of Rouen surrendered to Philip II on 23June 1204. After that, the rest of Normandy was easily conquered by the French.|$|E

25|$|The party {{experienced}} another {{split in}} 1932 when the Independent Labour Party, which {{for some years}} had been increasingly {{at odds with the}} Labour leadership, opted to disaffiliate from the Labour Party and embarked on a long, <b>drawn-out</b> decline.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a <b>drawn-out</b> debate on the stone's authenticity, but the {{scholarly}} consensus has classified it as a 19th-century hoax since it was first examined in 1910, with some critics directly charging the purported discoverer Ohman with fabricating the inscription.|$|E
25|$|The Duchy of Milan {{found itself}} in the focus of European power {{politics}} in the 15th century, leading to the <b>drawn-out</b> Italian Wars, which persisted for {{the best part of}} the 16th century before giving way to the Early Modern period in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Moynihan was {{a popular}} public speaker with a {{distinctly}} patrician style.

Buckley, Jr.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×trudellii {{is a small}} fern, with {{evergreen}} fronds {{growing in}} tufts. It is similar to A.pinnatifidum, with a triangular leaf blade, pinnatifid (lobed) in the upper part, with a long, <b>drawn-out</b> tip. The fronds are monomorphic, showing little or no difference between sterile and fertile fronds.|$|E
25|$|After Jackson {{was elected}} President in 1828 he {{resolved}} {{to finish the}} <b>drawn-out</b> question of removal for good. The Indian Removal Act was passed in May, 1830, giving the President direct authority to negotiate the removal treaties for the Five Civilized Tribes still clinging to their southeastern homelands.|$|E
25|$|On the radio, Farber became easily {{identifiable}} by his unique combination of <b>drawn-out</b> Southern drawl, intense delivery, verbose prose, and quick wit. Sponsors loved {{his ability to}} deliver a live commercial spot, often ad-libbed, and make whatever the particular product was sound tantalizing; he always sounded like he truly believed in the product.|$|E
25|$|However, British Imperial General Peregrine Maitland {{rejected}} the treaty and sent an insulting letter {{back to the}} Xhosa paramount-chief, demanding greater acts of submission and servility. Furious, Stockenström and his local commandos resigned and departed from the war, leaving the British and the Xhosa – both starving and afflicted by fever – to a long, <b>drawn-out</b> war of attrition.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the Republican and Democratic {{conventions}} {{were held}} in late July before the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, instead of after the Olympics as in 2008 and 2012. One reason why the Republican Party scheduled its convention in July was to help avoid a longer, <b>drawn-out</b> primary battle (as in 2012). The Democrats then followed suit, scheduling their convention the week after the Republicans' convention, to provide a quicker response.|$|E
25|$|Klein {{announced}} his timetable days before party delegates were {{to vote in}} a review of his leadership on March 31, 2006. The <b>drawn-out</b> schedule for his retirement, along with his announcement that any cabinet minister who wished to run for leader must resign by June 2006, generated a large degree of controversy, including criticism from cabinet minister Lyle Oberg who was subsequently fired from cabinet and suspended from caucus.|$|E
25|$|Time. A {{key factor}} in guerrilla {{strategy}} is a <b>drawn-out,</b> protracted conflict that wears down {{the will of the}} opposing counter-insurgent forces. Democracies are especially vulnerable to the factor of time. The counter-insurgent force must allow enough time to get the job done. Impatient demands for victory centered around short-term electoral cycles play {{into the hands of the}} guerrillas, though it is equally important to recognize when a cause is lost and the guerrillas have won.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×kentuckiense {{is a small}} fern, whose fronds grow in upright, {{spreading}} tufts. The stem is a shiny dark brown, {{the color}} extending well into the leaf blade. The blades are cut into pinnae near the base, which diminish into lobes in the upper part and eventually to teeth {{on the sides of}} a long, <b>drawn-out</b> tip. The fronds are dimorphic, with the fertile fronds much longer and of a different shape than the sterile fronds.|$|E
25|$|Three Soviet armies (the 16th, 19th and the 20th army) were encircled and {{destroyed}} {{just to the}} south of Smolensk, though significant numbers from the 19th and 20th armies managed to escape the pocket. Some historians have asserted that the losses of men and materiel incurred by the Wehrmacht during this <b>drawn-out</b> battle and the two-month delay in the drive towards Moscow, led to the defeat of the Wehrmacht by the Red Army in the Battle of Moscow of December 1941.|$|E
25|$|The recommendation, which Transit {{could have}} ignored {{only at the}} risk of <b>drawn-out</b> legal fights at the Environment Court level (which would {{probably}} have delayed the project until after the 2011 Rugby World Cup), was based on the concerns of residents, who feared that the new interchange would increase and cement separation of their suburb from the Manukau Harbour. Partly due to this, Transit New Zealand decided in August 2007 to continue with building the new bridge without including a new interchange for the time being.|$|E
