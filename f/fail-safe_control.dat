This control system can detect certain unsafe conditions and respond by automatically shutting off the flow of methane from the degasification borehole to the drainage pipeline. Methane flow is shut off when the methane content in the return airways reaches a predetermined level (typically 1. 5 pct), when the methane drainage pipeline is ruptured by roof fall, or {{when there is an}} electric power failure. The <b>fail-safe</b> <b>control</b> system was designed using commercially available components and a methane analyzer system previously developed by the Bureau. The fail-safe system consists of a unit that combines a shutoff valve and pneumatic valve actuator, and electronic and mechanical equipment designed to detect hazards and effect shutdown.

40|$|Cell {{proliferation}} is a {{key factor}} in sex determination where a size increase relative to the XX gonad {{is one of the first}} signs of testis differentiation. Moreover, proliferation of Sertoli cells during development is important in building up the stock of supporting cells necessary for subsequent successful fertility. Because proliferation is such an essential part of testis development, the hypothesis under long-term investigation is that it is under <b>fail-safe</b> <b>control</b> by multiple alternative growth factors. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on developing mouse Sertoli cells in vitro. Sertoli cells, isolated from mouse embryos at three stages of testis development, were maintained for 2 – 7  days in vitro (div) in the presence or absence of GDNF at 1, 10 and 100  ng mL− 1. Overall the presence of extracellular matrix gel had little effect on proliferative activity, but encouraged expression of the epithelial phenotype. A statistically significant difference in proliferation, assessed by immunocytochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, was seen with GDNF at embryonic day (E) 12. 5 after 2  div (at both 10 and 100  ng mL− 1, P  <  0. 001) and 7  div (at both 10 and 100  ng mL− 1, P  <  0. 05); at E 13. 5 after 3  div (at both 10 and 100  ng mL− 1, P  <  0. 05) and at E 14. 5 after 7  div (100  ng mL− 1, P  <  0. 01), compared with controls cultured without growth factor. In conclusion, GDNF stimulates mitosis throughout this critical developmental window. The in vitro approach used here is a useful adjunct to the knockout mouse model and has been applied to show that GDNF exerts a proliferative effect on developing mouse Sertoli cells...|$|E

However, as other brake mechanisms, EMB should be operated reliably for any operating conditions. EMB should be designed with <b>fail-safe</b> and fault-tolerant <b>control</b> concepts which require robust fault detection algorithms for various possible faults. In the design of fault detection algorithms, {{it is very difficult}} to construct faulty conditions in real EMB and thus, simulations are often used to emulate the faulty conditions.

40|$|In {{the real}} world there are three types of multivariable control systems. The first one is {{when the number of}} inputs is equal to the number of the outputs, this type of multivariable control system is defined as a squared multivariable control system and the main type of {{controller}} designed is a decoupling controller which minimizes interactions and gives good set-point tracking. The second type of multivariable control system is where the number of inputs is greater than the number of the outputs, for this type of system the main controller designed is a fail-safe controller. This controller remains stable if a sub-set of actuator fail. The third type of multivariable control system is the number of outputs is greater than the number of inputs, for this type of system the main controller designed is an override control system. This controller only controls a sub-set of outputs based on a lowest wins control strategy. All the three types of multivariable control systems are included in this thesis. In this thesis the design of multivariable decoupling control, multivariable <b>fail-safe</b> <b>control</b> and multivariable override control as considered. The invention of evolutionary computing techniques has changed the design philosophy for control system design.

Such algorithms evolve solutions using cost functions and optimization. There are a variety of system performance indicators such as integral squared error operator has been used as cost functions to design controllers using such algorithms. The design of both fail-safe and override multivariable controllers is a difficult problem and there are very few analytical design methods for such controllers. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to use the genetic algorithms to involve both fail-safe and override controller multivariable controllers, such that they perform well in the time-domain...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{practically}} important {{issues associated with}} the development of an electromechanical brake (EMB, Brake-by-wire) and its safety control in early design stage. ^ The first issue is the development of an analytical dynamic model which should have all relevant degrees of freedom without being unnecessarily complex so as to be useful in PC simulation environment. This objective is achieved through the analytical model development of all relevant hardware components of EMB and modal analysis of its linearized approximation for model reduction. This model fulfills the need arising due to the nonexistence of an analytical model for EMB. The developed model has six degrees of freedom (DOF) and includes essential nonlinearities such as gear backlashes, Coulomb frictions, and disk air gap clearance. ^ The second issue is concerned with the safety control of EMB, either in case of force sensor failure or without using expensive force sensor for cost-saving purposes. To establish a force feedback structure without using force sensor, two simplified models are developed for contacting phase and non-contacting phase respectively, and a novel model based edge detection method is proposed and evaluated. Various parameter estimations are then performed to find realistic ways to obtain accurate and reliable estimates of key system parameters on-line to deal with the large operating ranges and changing working conditions of EMB. In addition, to deal with various nonlinearities and uncertain system parameters associated with an EMB, an advanced indirect adaptive robust controller (IARC) incorporated with the air gap management is designed for the entire brake operation to ensure a robust control performance. Extensive simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the analytical model and the achievable control performance of the imbedded IARC design without force sensor. Simulation results reveal that, in terms of transient tracking performance for ABS cycling, the proposed IARC clamping force controller without using force sensor shows much better results than the conventional PI controller with using force sensor. Thus, aside from the benefit of providing a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>control</b> strategy for force sensor failure, a much more stringent ABS cycle than currently used can be achieved with the proposed IARC to improve the friction force between the tire and the road for a shorter stopping distance. Such a much improved clamping force control performance is also vital for future advanced vehicle control using EMB. ...|$|E

40|$|ISBN: 0769512038 Actuators {{in safety}} {{critical}} systems must {{be driven by}} fail-safe signals. Under a failure in the system, such a signal must be either correct or on the safe state (e. g. red colour in traffic control lights). To achieve the <b>fail-safe</b> property, processors <b>controlling</b> such actuators use hardware and/or software redundancy (e. g. duplicated processors, software coding techniques). Each of the signals delivered by such a system must be fail-safe individually in order to drive an actuator. To create such signals, one has to use an interface that transforms the redundant signals delivered by the <b>control</b> processor into <b>fail-safe</b> signals. This can be performed by a fail-safe interface. The present work treats the case where the inputs of the interface are delivered by a duplicated system. To avoid common mode failures the two copies of the system do not share hardware resources. Thus, they use different clocks, and the two system copies are not mutually synchronized at clock cycle level. Any attempt to synchronise them will require to share some resources and will introduce common mode failures. This work proposes a circuit that transforms two copies of non-synchronised signals into synchronised signals, {{while at the same}} time preserves the safety of the system under the introduced common mode failures...|$|R
40|$|The American {{legal system}} has proven remarkably robust {{even in the}} face of vast and often tumultuous political, social, economic, and {{technological}} change. Yet our system of law is not unlike other complex social, biological, and physical systems in exhibiting local fragility in the midst of its global robustness. Understanding how this “robust yet fragile” (RYF) dilemma operates in legal systems is important to the extent law is expected to assist in managing systemic risk—the risk of large local or even system-wide failures—in other social systems. Indeed, legal system failures have been blamed as partly responsible for disasters such as the recent financial system crisis and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. If we cannot effectively manage systemic risk within the legal system, how can we expect the legal system to manage systemic risk elsewhere? This Article employs a complexity science model of the RYF dilemma to explore why systemic risk persists in legal systems and how to manage it. Part I defines complexity in the context of the institutions and instruments that make up the legal system. Part II defines the five dimensions of robustness that support functionality of the legal system: (1) reliability, (2) efficiency, (3) scalability, (4) modularity, and (5) evolvability. Part III then defines system fragility by examining the internal and external constraints that impede legal system robustness and the <b>fail-safe</b> system <b>control</b> strategies for managing their effects. With those basic elements of the RYF dilemma model in place, Part IV defines systemic risk and explores the paradoxical role of increasingly organized complexity brought about by fail-safe strategies as a source of legal system failure. There is no way around the RYF dilemma—some degree of systemic risk is inherent in any complex adaptive system—but the balance between robustness and fragility is something we can hope to influence. To explore how, Part V applies the RYF dilemma model to a concrete systemic risk management context—oil drilling in the deep Gulf of Mexico. The legal regime governing offshore oil exploration and extraction has been blamed as contributing to the set of failures that led to the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon spill and is at the center of reform initiatives. Using this case study, I argue that the RYF dilemma model provides valuable insights into how legal systems fail and how to manage legal systemic risk...|$|R
40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) and Electrorheological (ER) fluid dampers {{provide a}} <b>fail-safe</b> {{semi-active}} <b>control</b> mechanism for suppressing vibration response of structures as these smart fluids can change their apparent viscosity immediately {{under the influence}} of magnetic and electrical fields, respectively. MR based damping devices have recently received appropriate attention as they have less power demand, provide better dynamic range and are less sensitive to the temperature and external contaminants as compared to their ER counterparts. This thesis studies physics-based modeling of MR fluid dampers and their application in seismic design of buildings. In the first part of thesis, MR damper modeling and its related subject are studied, while {{in the second part of}} the thesis, application of MR dampers in tuned mass damper and bracing system is investigated. The existing models, namely the phenomenological models for simulating the behavior of MR and ER dampers rely on various parameters determined experimentally by the manufacturers for each damper configuration. It is of interest to develop mechanistic models of these dampers which can be applied to various configurations so that their fundamental characteristics can be studied to develop flexible design solutions for smart structures. This research presents a formulation for dynamics analysis of ER and MR fluid dampers in flow and mix mode configurations under harmonic and random excitations. The procedure employs the vorticity transport equation and the regularization function to deal with the unsteady flow and nonlinear behaviour of ER/MR fluid in general motion. Using the developed approach, the damping force of ER/MR damper can be evaluated under any type of excitations. While tuned mass dampers are found to be effective in suppressing vibration in a tall building, integrating them with semi-active MR based control system enables them to perform more efficiently under varying external excitations. To study the application of MR damper in tuned mass damper, a forty-storey tall steel-frame building assumed to be located in the Pacific Coast region of Canada (Vancouver), designed according to the relevant Canadian code and standard, has been studied with and without semi-active and passive tuned mass dampers. The response of the structure has been studied under a variety of ground motions with low, medium and high frequency contents to investigate the performance of the optimally designed semi-active MR based tuned mass damper in comparison to that of a passive tuned mass damper. It has been shown that the semi-active MR based system modifies structural response more effectively than the conventional passive tuned mass damper in both mitigation of the maximum displacement and reduction of the settling time of the building. Finally, the effectiveness of MR damper in structural bracing has been examined. Two steel building structures, five and twenty-storey building designed according to Canadian national building code, have been modeled using the finite element method. These building structures have been equipped with MR dampers in different floors appropriately based on the seismic floor-shear distribution. The governing equations of motion of the structures integrated with MR dampers have been cast into the state space representation for the implementation of the full state LQR combined with clipped optimal control strategies. The response of building structures under passive on and active controlled modes have been obtained for low, medium and high frequency content seismic records and compared. ...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} is to design a small, semi-autonomous inspection satellite to observe the exterior of a 2 ̆ 2 host 2 ̆ 2 spacecraft, such as the International Space Station (ISS) or large space-based telescope, with minimal risk to the host vehicle and its crew. As NASA learned in the Columbia tragedy, the lack of external inspection capability can lead to catastrophic results. In less extreme cases, the ability to inspect any high-value spacecraft could provide early warning for impending failures or maintenance, and could reduce requirements for time-costly robot-arm operations and/or high-risk Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA). In the extreme environment of space, two of the primary risks to vehicles are orbital-debris/micrometeorite impact and leakage of pressurized resources (gases and coolant). Although the value of spacecraft inspection is well-established, virtually no current spacecraft (including ISS) possess inspection capability. We believe that recent efforts in small-sat proximity operations, combined with advances in attitude control, propulsion, and navigation, sensors, and actuators on the cube-satellite scale now {{make it possible to}} create a safe and practical inspection satellite. The UC Davis team is currently defining the operations concept, mission objectives, safety requirements, and technology hurdles involved {{in the development of a}} disposable external inspection capability. The first priority for the design of an inspection-sat is the minimization of added risk due to collision. For net risk-reduction, it is essential that the added risk of collision between inspector and host is smaller than the risk mitigated by inspection. To achieve this, in addition to redundant and <b>fail-safe</b> navigation and <b>control</b> strategies, inspector momentum must be kept small to the point of posing an insignificant risk of damage in the case of collision. Low mass enabled by current subsystem technologies, along with low-velocity inspection-paths are required to minimize inspector kinetic energy. By making the design disposable, it does not return to the host. This ensures a safe distance can be maintained at all times during and after the inspection task. Furthermore, no docking or capture mechanisms are needed; therefore modifications to the host are not required. Our design includes human-augmented control of trajectory, relative velocity, attitude, and inspection tasks via real-time video telemetry to onboard operators. Efficiency will be increased by using a control scheme with predetermined optimized paths as well as adaptive navigation methods. Relative orbital motion will be used to minimize propellant usage. Automatic and manual abort commands will also be included so that a safe escape vector is available if a failure occurs. Spatial navigation of the inspector relative to the host spacecraft will be based on computer vision techniques applied to the known external geometry of the host. Lidar/radar subsystems will enhance the relative state vector and provide backup separation sensing. Inspection-Sat control actuation will be achieved through a dynamically-optimized combination of reaction control wheels and cold gas thrusters. A precursor to the computer navigation algorithm has already entered into testing phases. The current UC Davis efforts shall lay out the mission objectives, concept of operations, high-level requirements, and system architecture...|$|R
