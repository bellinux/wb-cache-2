500|$|In the film, {{similar to}} the Brothers Grimm story, the Evil Queen is cold, cruel, and {{extremely}} vain, and obsessively desires to remain the [...] "fairest in the land". She becomes madly envious over the beauty of her stepdaughter, Princess Snow White, {{as well as the}} attentions of the Prince from another land; such love triangle element is one of Disney's changes to the story. This leads her to plot the death of Snow White and ultimately on the path to her own demise, which in the film is indirectly caused by the Seven Dwarfs. The film's version of the Queen character uses her dark magic powers to actually transform herself into an old woman instead of <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> disguise like in the Grimms' story; this appearance of hers is commonly referred to as the Wicked Witch or alternatively as the Old Hag or just the [...] Witch. The Queen dies in the film, but lives on in a variety of non-canonical Disney works.|$|E
2500|$|Although Grande drew {{criticism}} for allegedly impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014, she dismissed these reports as [...] "weird, inaccurate depictions". After considering the incidents most frequently {{mentioned in the}} press and the available evidence, PopSugar concluded that the incidents were [...] "just normal star behavior" [...] and [...] "not the most ideal situation, but ... not exactly the sign of a diva". Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> stand to not allow others to control her image." [...] In July 2015, Grande was seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying [...] "I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting", referring to a tray of doughnuts. She apologized, writing that she is [...] "extremely proud to be an American" [...] and that her comments related to American obesity. She later released a video apology for [...] "behaving poorly". The incident was parodied by The Muppets and featured in Miley Cyrus' Saturday Night Live cover of [...] "My Way", about the regrets of the summer of 2015. Grande mocked the incident herself on Saturday Night Live in 2016, saying [...] "A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught looking at a doughnut they didn't pay for." ...|$|E

2500|$|The writers {{also used}} the {{decision}} statistics from previous episodes to develop the direction of future ones. Gary Whitta, the writer of the fourth episode, specifically reviewed all the statistics from the previous three episodes to determine the general development of the episode's story. One example involved the death of Duck in the third episode. In that episode, the player must choose to either kill Duck for Kenny, or have Kenny do it himself. In the fourth episode, Whitta wrote a scene where Kenny finds a similar-looking boy, who has starved to death in an attic and come back as a walker. Again, the player is faced with the choice of whether to kill the boy themselves or have Kenny do it. They also included a third choice, in which the player would simply walk away, leaving the boy as a walker trapped in the attic, but this decision would harshly affect the disposition of the others characters towards Lee. By the first act of episode 5, there were 32 variations due to past player choices {{that they had to}} write towards. The number of possible scenarios were considered necessary to make the game feel [...] "organic" [...] to the individual player, making the player feel like they weaved their own story within the game instead of <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> specific route through the choices.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... <b>Just</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{students}} are inspired {{to start their}} own business venture after taking some courses in school or simply <b>just</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> idea and turning it into a business. The beginning process is usually most difficult in terms of establishing a functioning business, getting the right connections, and avoiding discouragement to follow through with the business. That is why many businesses fall into the categories of starting, failing along the process, or failing to get started. There is a lot to be learned from the process of starting a business venture. In addressing this issue, some of the questions this research study aims to explore and study are how people go about their new venture efforts? Second, what steps they undertake? Third, from whom do they get information? And fourth, how do they use that information? This study will seek a variety of insights that can help answer these questions and improve our understanding of why some businesses fail, succeed, or never get started...|$|R

Now, if we had reached the Spanish coast by ourselves we should have been questioned right and left, and, as I have said all along, they would soon have found that we were not Spaniards, for we could not have said where we came from, or given our past history, or said where our families lived.
