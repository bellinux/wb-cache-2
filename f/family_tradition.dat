50|$|Sometimes, <b>family</b> <b>traditions</b> are {{associated}} with practices and beliefs which are handed over {{from one generation to}} the next generation, and during this process of transmission such <b>family</b> <b>traditions</b> also acquire an aura of spirituality.

5000|$|Meaningful <b>family</b> <b>traditions</b> {{have always}} been a {{valuable}} tool for parents and elders to carry out the responsibility of raising children and inculcating into them social values and ethos. <b>Family</b> <b>traditions</b> ensure that the warmth and closeness of family bondage grow. In the modern context, maintenance of and developing <b>family</b> <b>traditions</b> continue to be as significant as they were at the earliest times. Active <b>family</b> <b>traditions</b> and meaningful participation in them help families to avoid social entropy. In physical science, the term entropy means the tendency of the physical system to lose energy and coherence over a period of time, like a gas dissipating until it is all but gone. An [...] "entropic family" [...] is one that loses its sense of emotional closeness because members neglect the family’s inner life and community ties.|$|R

5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not.

50|$|Then, as also now, several {{families}} like {{to identify a}} particular person as {{the keeper of the}} <b>family</b> <b>traditions</b> and assign a particular name to the keeper.

Head of such a family is called “Karta” (literal meaning ‘One who does’), and for all practical purposes, “Karta” was entrusted with responsibilities, among other things, to ensure observance of <b>family</b> <b>traditions.</b> Even, modern India's legal system recognizes the concept of “Karta” as the head of a Hindu joint family.|$|R
5|$|Historian Timothy Bolton has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared <b>family</b> <b>tradition</b> between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure, a brother of Thorgil Sprakling. Siward would then have been first cousin to Earl Ulf, the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister Estrith and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's. Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.|$|E

He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household.
