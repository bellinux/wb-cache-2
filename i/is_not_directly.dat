5|$|A {{sequel to}} Resurrection was planned as Joss Whedon had written an earth-set script for Alien 5, though Sigourney Weaver was not {{interested}} in this setting, but has remained open to reprise her role as Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment on the condition that she likes the story. Although more sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series became a prequel series with the 2012 film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, who stated that the film precedes the story of Alien, but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> connected to the original film's franchise, and that Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.|$|E

5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Charter of 1841 was {{amended to}} include the University Council in 1874.

5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a {{marbled electric ray}} can be severe but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the marbled electric ray as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common electric ray and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Fragments of Him {{is based}} on {{the life and death of}} Will, a man who dies early in the game. The player controls four characters throughout the game; Will, his ex-girlfriend, his boyfriend at the time when he died, and his grandmother. As the game progresses, it becomes apparent that the story is not only based on Will's life, but also on those of the other characters, and how they cope with his death. The game relies heavily on its narrative which, although the player controls the game in the first-person, is described by the developer as being viewed in a second-person perspective, i.e. where the player <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> controlling a character but instead indicates what the characters should interact with next.|$|E

Cadman Plaza East, the short one-block street outside the Red Cross Place exit, was previously called Washington Street; the Washington Street moniker still applies to the road north of Prospect Street. High Street <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> accessible from the station, as the short one-block street is interrupted by a parking lot. However, Red Cross Place, which was once a part of High Street, is directly accessible.|$|E
5|$|Norway had {{experienced}} {{a long period of}} peace during the reign of Magnus' father, Olaf. Magnus may have been present when Olaf died in Rånrike, Båhuslen (southeastern Norway) in September 1093 and was probably proclaimed king at the Borgarting, the thing (assembly) of the adjacent region of Viken later that month. When Magnus became king, he already had a network of support among the Norwegian aristocracy. Although sources are unclear about the first year of his reign, it is apparent that Magnus' focus was on the west (towards the British Isles). Since conditions were chaotic in Norse-dominated parts of the British Isles since the death of Thorfinn the Mighty, this provided Magnus an opportunity to intervene in local power struggles. According to some accounts, he made his first expedition west in 1093–94 (or 1091–92), helping Scottish king Donald Bane to conquer Edinburgh and the Scottish throne and possibly gaining control of the Southern Isles (Suðreyjar) in return. It is unclear if this early expedition took place, since it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> referenced in early reliable sources or the sagas.|$|E

There are, in addition, many place names and personal names, mostly originating from Arabic-speaking countries, Albania, or China, that have a Q without a U. The most familiar of these are the countries of Iraq and Qatar, along with the derived words Iraqi and Qatari. Iqaluit, the capital of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, also has a Q which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> followed by a U. Qaqortoq, in Greenland, is notable for having three such Qs. Other proper names and acronyms that have attained the status of English words include: Compaq (a computer company), Nasdaq (a US electronic stock market), Qantas (an Australian airline), and QinetiQ (a British technology company). Zaqqum (a tree mentioned in the Qur'an) and Saqqara (an ancient burial ground in Egypt) are proper nouns notable for their use of a double Q.|$|E
5|$|Some of Antarctica {{has been}} warming up; {{particularly}} strong warming {{has been noted}} on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted {{for the first time}} that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.|$|E
5|$|The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL) is {{operated}} as a corporation and {{is owned by}} the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league. The current chairman is Sir Dave Richards, who was appointed in April 1999, and the chief executive is Richard Scudamore, appointed in November 1999. The former chairman and chief executive, John Quinton and Peter Leaver, were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance. The Football Association <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.|$|E

5|$|Pressure {{readings}} from John's peak are not consistently available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John {{one of the}} most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both Hurricane Emilia and Hurricane Gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central Pacific earlier in the 1994 season, but with lower wind speeds. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> linked to wind speeds). John was also only the fourth Category5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994), and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175mph (280km/h). Since 1994, only one Category5 hurricane, Hurricane Ioke, has formed in or entered into the Central Pacific; Ioke, like Emilia and Gilma, had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than John. However, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph; there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175mph, so it could have been stronger than Emilia, Gilma or Ioke. John was the first Eastern Pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon, a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014.|$|E
