40|$|Sedimentation {{is one of}} the {{consequences}} of hydropower plant construction. Such structures not only have an influence on reservoir morphology, but also have great impact on both upstream and downstream river morphology. This study focuses on fluvial morphological changes in between two hydropower plants on the Drava River, Austria. The influence of both reservoir management methods (flushing) and human intervention (groynes) have been investigated. The first stage started with validating an unsteady Delft 3 D morphodynamic model of the meandering reach. This validation shows the importance of spatial grain size distribution in predicting bed load transport. Analysis of the flushing method includes investigation of the duration of gate-opening before and after peak flood. The results show that the duration of lowering the water level at the hydropower plant (by opening the gate) before starting the peak flood will not have a big influence on the river morphology upstream of the reservoir. However, the duration of maintaining the low water level after the peak flood has a large influence on both the river morphology in the upstream portion of the reservoir and on the sediment transport toward the reservoir In the second part of this study, hydraulic structural groynes were applied in the river reach. The objective was to design a groyne field that will minimize sediment transport to the reservoir. Both emerged and submerged groynes were investigated. In addition, the influences of both <b>groyne</b> <b>head</b> shape and the distribution of sediment grain size in the groyne zone were examined. This study shows that under an unsteady simulation, when the groynes are submerged by 1 m at normal flow, the sediment supply to the groyne zone decreases compared to the emerged case. However, if the groynes are submerged by 0. 5 m, the sediment supply to the groyne zone will be greater than the emerged case for an aspect ratio in between (0. 5 - 2). Finally, applying L-head groynes produces less erosion in the main stream and a higher sediment supply compared to straight groynes...|$|R
50|$|Bincleaves Groyne {{features}} the C Pier Head Battery {{on the southern}} tip. The arm is an Admiralty extension to the earlier breakwater built by the Great Western Railway and known as the Bincleaves <b>Groyne.</b> The <b>head</b> is 100ft in diameter. The battery was opened in 1901 and was armed with two 12-pounder quick-firing (QF) guns for anti-torpedo craft defence. By the First World War the 12-pounder guns had been removed and replaced with a 6-inch breech-loading (BL) Mk. VII gun. The 6-inch gun was removed in 1924 and in 1934 two 12-pounder guns were transferred across from the recently decommissioned B Pier Head. In 1944 emplacements were constructed for two 6-pounder guns, but the guns were not mounted {{for a number of}} years. During the Second World War the battery was manned by 107 Battery of 522 Coast Regiment. A field visit in 1983 found the structure to be extant.|$|R

The dysfunctional distribution system has been turned on its <b>head</b> as <b>distributors</b> have wrested control of the strategic prerogatives of manufacturers in order to capture {{a disproportionate share of}} the value of the supplying company’s products. Mega distributors like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc. end up profiting at the expense of their vendors, and manufacturers earn little or nothing on the sale of their own innovated products. The mega distributors not only control the delivery of their products to consumers but also wield tremendous power over their internal processes, further reducing the value of the innovation. There is some hope: if done right, manufacturers still possess the ability to directly influence what happens to their innovations products once they enter the distribution chain, but, this window is rapidly closing. innovation management; sales and distribution strategy; direct marketing; channel control. ...|$|R

With the highly precise measurement of the seed, the crop yield can be strongly improved.

Because of the touching piezoelectric measuring principle, the mounting contact mode of the sensor is either in the <b>distributor</b> <b>head</b> or {{in each of the}} seed hoses of the seed drill. Up to 15 thousand grains must be counted per second. For the detection of these high grain frequencies, a novel design of the sensor element was developed.

50|$|Our Gang {{was very}} {{successful}} during the 1920s and the early 1930s. However, by 1934, many movie theater owners were increasingly dropping two-reel (20-minute) comedies like Our Gang and the Laurel & Hardy series from their bills and running double feature programs instead. The Laurel & Hardy series went from film shorts to features exclusively in mid 1935. By 1936, Hal Roach began debating plans to discontinue Our Gang until Louis B. Mayer, <b>head</b> of Roach's <b>distributor</b> MGM, persuaded Roach to keep the popular series in production. Roach agreed, producing shorter, one-reel Our Gang comedies (ten minutes in length instead of twenty).

50|$|Historically part of Christchurch, Mudeford Spit {{was sold}} to Bournemouth Borough Council in 1935. It is {{the larger of the}} two features, the other being the Haven, that almost {{encloses}} Christchurch Harbour, leaving the water within to exit through a narrow channel known as The Run. Formed by sand and shingle brought around Hengistbury Head by longshore drift and pushed towards the shore by waves from the east, the spit is the most mobile of Dorset's geographical features. Prior to the construction of the long <b>groyne</b> at Hengistbury <b>Head</b> in 1938, it tended to grow steadily in a north-easterly direction and on occasion stretched as far as Steamer Point and Highcliffe Castle; most notably in 1880. It has been breached a number of times naturally; 1883, 1911, 1924, 1935 and once deliberately in the 17th century when an attempt was made to construct another entrance to the harbour. After the last breaching in 1935, the end of the spit broke off and drifted towards the beach at Friars Cliff where it formed a lagoon. The groyne built in 1938 to protect Hengistbury Head from erosion had an adverse effect on the spit as it prevented movement of material around it. The spit began to erode due to wave action from the east and many attempts have been made since to stabilise the situation. Small seawalls were constructed on the spit in the 1960s and a large number of rubble groynes were put down during the 1980s.|$|R

The Production Code section on abortion was revised in December 1956 and Schwartz once again appealed to Shurlock. Shurlock responded later that month, re-affirming the denial on the basis of the light treatment of the subject matter. Following this denial Schwartz dropped his pursuit of the seal.|$|R
