In addition, the findings indicate that taxable income and net <b>income</b> <b>after</b> <b>tax</b> each has the same ability to measure firm performance. These results provide a useful contribution to the literature because it strengthens the evidence that both taxable income and net <b>income</b> <b>after</b> <b>tax</b> have same ability to measure firm performance.

Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship and join CBS.
