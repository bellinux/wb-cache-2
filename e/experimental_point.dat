40|$|Abstract. The {{response}} surface method was proposed {{as a collection}} of statistical and mathematical techniques that are useful for modeling and analyzing a system which is influenced by several input variables. This method gives an explicit approximation of the implicit limit state function of the structure through a number of deterministic structural analyses. However, the position of the <b>experimental</b> <b>points</b> is very important to improve the accuracy of the evaluation of failure probability. In the paper, the <b>experimental</b> <b>points</b> are obtained by using Givens transformation in such way these <b>experimental</b> <b>points</b> nearly close to limit state function. A Numerical example is presented to demonstrate the improved accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to the classical {{response surface}} method. As seen from the result of the example, the proposed method leads to a better approximation of the limit state function over a large region of the design space, and the number of <b>experimental</b> <b>points</b> using the proposed method is less than that of classical response surface method...|$|R

30|$|For {{a further}} {{constructive}} discussion, {{it stands to}} mention an important peculiarity of the obtained experimental results. In regions I and III, the function Q(F) has a linear character with insignificant scatter of the <b>experimental</b> <b>points,</b> thereby testifying to sufficiently advanced methods employed for TDS studies. In turn, this permits us to state that the scatter of the <b>experimental</b> <b>points</b> observed in region II is not caused by procedural errors {{in the performance of}} the experiment.|$|R
50|$|The {{buffer line}} {{can be used to}} predict the result of varying the PCO2 within a range close to the {{experimentally}} determined points. Additionally, for each <b>experimental</b> <b>point,</b> a titration experiment can be performed in which pH is varied while PCO2 is held constant, and titration curves can be generated for each of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Fig. 7). In the Davenport Diagram, these titration curves are called isopleths, because they are generated at a fixed partial pressure of carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|The formal {{definition}} of proper time involves describing the path through spacetime {{that represents a}} clock, observer, or test particle, and the metric structure of that spacetime. Proper time is the pseudo-Riemannian arc length of world lines in four-dimensional spacetime. From the mathematical point of view, coordinate time {{is assumed to be}} predefined and we require an expression for proper time as a function of coordinate time. From the <b>experimental</b> <b>point</b> of view, proper time is what is measured experimentally and then coordinate time is calculated from the proper time of some inertial clocks.|$|E

50|$|Twenty {{four years}} later, in 1987, a {{beautiful}} demonstration of quantum collapse and revival {{was observed in}} a one-atom maser by Rempe, Walther, and Klein.Before that time, research groups were unable to build experimental setups capable of enhancing the coupling of an atom with a single field mode, simultaneously suppressing other modes. Experimentally, the quality factor of the cavity must be high enough to consider {{the dynamics of the}} system as equivalent to the dynamics of a single mode field. With the advent of one-atom masers it was possible to study the interaction of a single atom (usually a Rydberg atom) with a single resonant mode of the electromagnetic field in a cavity from an <b>experimental</b> <b>point</b> of view,and study different aspects of the JCM.|$|E
5000|$|In non-clinical {{assessment}} NOAEL (no-observed-adverse-effect level) plays {{a pivotal}} role. It is determined or proposed by qualified personnel (pharmacologist, toxicologist) {{depending on the}} study, drug indications and its pharmacological therapeutics side/adverse effects. NOAEL could be defined as [...] "the highest <b>experimental</b> <b>point</b> that is without adverse effect". It either does not provide the effects of drug with respect to duration and dose, or it {{does not address the}} interpretation of risk based on toxicologically relevant effects.The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) denotes the level of exposure of an organism, found by experiment or observation, at which there is no biologically or statistically significant (e.g. alteration of morphology, functional capacity, growth, development or life span) increase in the frequency or severity of any adverse effects in the exposed population when compared to its appropriate control.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} of non-sequential ionization (NSI) of atoms exposed to intense laser fields {{has been a}} subject of many theoretical and experimental studies since 1983. The pioneering work began with the observation of a “knee” structure on the Xe2+ ion signal versus intensity curve by L’Huillier et al. From the <b>experimental</b> <b>point</b> of view, the NS double ionization refers to processes which somehow enhance the rate of production of doubly charged ions by a huge factor at intensities below the saturation intensity of the singly charged ion. Many, on the other hand, prefer to define the NSI as a process by which two electrons are ionized nearly simultaneously. This definition implies that apart from the sequential channel [...] there is another channel [...] which is the main contribution {{to the production of}} doubly charged ions at lower intensities. The first observation of triple NSI in argon interacting with a 1 µm laser was reported by Augst et al. Later, systematically studying the NSI of all rare gas atoms, the quadruple NSI of Xe was observed. The most important conclusion of this study was the observation of the following relation between the rate of NSI to any charge state and the rate of tunnel ionization (predicted by the ADK formula) to the previous charge states; ...|$|E

50|$|The Block III {{version of}} the missile was {{successfully}} test-fired by India on 2 December 2010 from Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur off the Orissa coast. Block III had advanced guidance and upgraded software, incorporating high manoeuvres at multiple points and steep dive from high altitude. The steep dive capability of the Block III enables it to hit targets hidden behind a mountain range. It will be deployed in Arunachal Pradesh. It can engage ground targets from an altitude as low as 10 meters for surgical strikes with out any collateral damage. It is capable of being launched from multiple platforms like submarines, ships, aircraft and land based Mobile Autonomous Launchers (MAL). On 12 August 2011, it was test-fired by ground forces and met all mission parameters. It was test-fired by an Indian Army unit on 4 March 2012 at the Pokharan range in Rajasthan to operationalise the second regiment of the weapon system in the army. The test was attended by senior Army officials including Vice Chief Lt. Gen. Shri Krishna Singh and Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Lt. Gen. A K Chaudhary. With this test, the second BrahMos unit of the Indian Army became operational.Another development test was conducted on 29 July 2012 from ITR. This was the 32nd test of the missile. The test was deemed successful from an <b>experimental</b> <b>point</b> of view, but did not meet all mission parameters. This test was done to evaluate more than 25 sub-systems of the missile which were produced by the Indian industry, like the power systems, materials for air frame components, guidance scheme and various electric systems. The test data was sent for analysis and used for large-scale indigenous production of the missile. The analysis revealed that except for one subsystem, all other subsystems and components had performed as per the requirement. The malfunction of one subsystem resulted in increase in velocity of the missile, which crossed the limit and the mission was aborted. The defect was rectified and further development flight tests were announced to develop self-reliance.|$|E
