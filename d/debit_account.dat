5000|$|The {{credit card}} issuing bank {{receives}} the authorization request, verifies the credit or debit available and then sends a response {{back to the}} processor (via the same process as the request for authorization) with a response code (I.e.:: approved, denied). In addition to communicating {{the fate of the}} authorization request, the response code is also used to define the reason why the transaction failed (I.e.: insufficient funds, or bank link not available). Meanwhile, the credit card issuer holds an authorization associated with that merchant and consumer for the approved amount. This can impact the consumer's ability to spend further ( [...] because it reduces the line of credit available or it puts a hold on a portion of the funds in a <b>debit</b> <b>account).</b>|$|E
50|$|A Continuous Payment Authority (CPA) {{is a type}} {{of regular}} {{automatic}} payment where an individual gives a vendor permission to take money from a credit or <b>debit</b> <b>account</b> whenever the vendor feels money is owed. They are often used by payday lenders, porn websites and subscription sites such as those for magazines. Continuous Payment Authorities {{should not be confused with}} Direct Debit arrangements or standing orders. Often there is no written record of them, and the payer (whose credit or debit card the CPA is linked to) can cancel them by contacting the vendor or their bank. Concerns have been raised about abuse of CPAs by companies to withdrawn money from the accounts of unsuspecting customers, who often do not realise the terms and conditions associated with use of the service.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years in Vietnam, the {{financial}} system in general and the banking system in particular had been transferred from a monopoly system into a diversified system which allows all participants to compete fairly and effectively. Within these past years, the banking system in Vietnam did gradually developed in number of banking institutions, size of the banking sector in the economy, amount of credits for the economy, and amount of other banking services as well. Along with the development of the banking system in number, size, asset value, deposit, credit and <b>debit</b> <b>account,</b> ATM/POS, interest rates, etc. which attracted more and more customers using the banking’ services; the efficiency of the banking system also has been increasing. So far, there is still a lack of research on the efficiency of the banking sector in Vietnam over the decades. Several researches were conducted, however, due to the data limitation, these researches were just small steps at the big front gate. This paper, which focuses on evaluating the efficiency of bigger sample size of Vietnamese commercial banks in the year of 2008, tends to make a contribution to this progress. The DEA approach allows this paper to evaluate the efficiency of 22 Vietnamese commercial banks in using their inputs in 2008 (these banks were ranked top in the banking industry in Vietnam – VNR 500 in 2009). After analyzing, the research comes to a conclusion that although the efficiency of these banks is averagely high, however, there is still an opportunity to improve this indicator. ...|$|E
