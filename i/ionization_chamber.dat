5|$|In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan {{produced}} plutonium-239 {{through the}} bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed {{the creation of}} neptunium, element 93, which then underwent beta-decay {{to form a new}} element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium. He used mica sliced razor thin to produce a window to count alpha particle emissions, and <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the neptunium from alpha particles from the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Americium {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1944 {{by the group}} of Glenn T.

Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> smoke detectors, as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber,</b> an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E
25|$|Americium is a {{synthetic}} element {{that has the}} symbol Am and atomic number 95.

25|$|The americium-241 in {{ionizing}} {{smoke detectors}} poses a potential environmental hazard, albeit {{a very small}} one. Disposal regulations and recommendations for smoke detectors vary from region to region. The amount of radioactive material contained in ionizing smoke detectors is very small and thus doesn't represent a significant radiological hazard. If the americium is left in the <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> of the alarm the radiological risk is insignificant because the chamber acts as a shield to the alpha radiation. A person would have to open the sealed chamber and ingest or inhale the americium for the risk to be significant. The radiation risk of exposure to an ionic smoke detector is much smaller than natural background radiation under normal operation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E

25|$|John R. Dunning, {{professor}} of physics at Columbia, closely followed the work of Ernest Lawrence on the cyclotron. Dunning wanted a more powerful neutron source and the cyclotron appeared as an attractive tool to achieve this end. During 1935 and 1936, he was able to construct a cyclotron using many salvaged parts to reduce costs and funding from industrial and private donations. The cyclotron design and building project began as Anderson was completing his engineering degree. At the suggestion of Professor Dana Mitchell, Dunning offered Anderson a teaching assistant position if he would also help with the design and building of the cyclotron. While working on his doctorate, Anderson made two major contributions to the project. The first was to design a high frequency filament supply, rather than the commonly used direct current version. This fostered longer filament life in the high magnetic field environment of a cyclotron. The second and more important contribution was the use of a pair of concentric lines to feed the cyclotron dees (cyclotron electrodes {{in the shape of a}} “D”), rather than the usual induction system. This refinement resulted in greater cyclotron efficiency and thereafter became a regular feature in cyclotron design. Others assisting Anderson in the construction of the cyclotron were Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, Hugh Glassford, and, of course, professor Dunning. In anticipation of conducting experiments with the cyclotron, Anderson also built an <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> and a linear amplifier in late 1938.|$|E
25|$|News {{spread quickly}} {{of the new}} discovery, which was {{correctly}} seen as an entirely novel physical effect with great scientific—and potentially practical—possibilities. Meitner's and Frisch's interpretation {{of the discovery of}} Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University. I.I. Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Enrico Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. Bohr soon thereafter went from Princeton to Columbia to see Fermi. Not finding Fermi in his office, Bohr went down to the cyclotron area and found Herbert L. Anderson. Bohr grabbed him by the shoulder and said: “Young man, let me explain to you about something new and exciting in physics.” It was clear to a number of scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment. On 25 January 1939, a Columbia University team conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States, which was done in the basement of Pupin Hall; the members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, Enrico Fermi, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The experiment involved placing uranium oxide inside of an <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> and irradiating it with neutrons, and measuring the energy thus released. The results confirmed that fission was occurring and hinted strongly that it was the isotope uranium 235 in particular that was fissioning. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of the George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.|$|E

A simple Geiger counter is a contamination meter and not a dose rate meter.
