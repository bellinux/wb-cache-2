In the trust-management system SPKI/SDSI, the security policy is given by a set <b>of</b> <b>certificates,</b> and proofs <b>of</b> authorization take the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> chains. The certificate-chain-discovery {{problem is to}} discover a proof of authorization for a given request. Although certificate-chain-discovery algorithms for SPKI/SDSI have been investigated by several researchers, previous work did not address how to perform certificatechain discovery in distributed environments. We address the certificate-chain-discovery problem where the certificates are distributed {{over a number of}} sites, which then have to cooperate to identify the proof of authorization for a given request. We propose two protocols for this purpose. These protocols can also handle cases where certificates are labeled with weights and where multiple certificate chains must be combined to <b>form</b> a proof <b>of</b> authorization. We have implemented these protocols in a prototype and report preliminary results of our evaluation. 1...|$|R
