The <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> fatigue of uncoated and coated tools can be effectively assessed by the repetitive impact test. Cemented carbide inserts of various grain size, surface roughness, coating and heat treatment were investigated by applying repetitive impacts close to the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> for detecting its {{fatigue strength}}. Complementary FEM simulations of the impact test, at various distances from the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> provided insights on the developed stress fields. The impact distance from the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> was corroborated to have a dominant effect on the tool life, while a reduction of the roughness {{and the application of}} finer substrate grains led to an increase of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> fatigue strength.

40|$|Milling is {{a process}} of {{producing}} flat and complex shapes with the use of multi-tooth cutting tool, which is called a milling cutter and the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> are called teeth. The axis of rotation of the cutting tool is perpendicular to the direction of feed, either parallel or perpendicular to the machined surface. The machine tool that traditionally performs this operation is a milling machine. Milling is an <b>interrupted</b> <b>cutting</b> operation: the teeth of the milling cutter enter and exit the work during each revolution. This <b>interrupted</b> <b>cutting</b> action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material and cutter geometry must be designed to withstand these conditions. Cutting fluids are essential for most milling operations. In this Paper the design aspects of milling cutter is analyzed. The objective considered is the design and modeling of milling cutter and to analyse various stress components acting on it.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the problem of thermal and {{mechanical}} shocks, which rising during operation, mostly at interrupted cut. Here will be solved their impact on the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> tool life, the impact of coating technology on resistance to shocks and experimental determination of tool life in heating flame. Resistance of removable <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> against thermal and mechanical shock is an important indicator of quality as well as its abrasion resistance. Breach of the edge or its crumble may occur due to cyclic loading. We can observe it not only during the <b>interrupted</b> <b>cutting</b> (milling, turning areas abandoned hole or slot), but also in continuous cutting. This is due to the volatility of cutting force on cutting. Frequency of the volatility in this case depends on the type of rising chips (chip size element). For difficult-to-machine materials such as austenitic steel particularly happened at higher cutting speeds for the localization of plastic deformation in the shear plane and for the inception of separate elements substantially continuous chips. This leads to variations of cutting forces substantially greater than for other types of steel. During the uninterrupted <b>cutting</b> the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is cyclically loaded due to period oscillation of the cutting force main component. The frequency is given by the character of shaving element size [1]. Experiments have shown that during cutting of hard to machine materials with higher cutting speeds, for example austenitic steel, plastic deformation occurs in the shearing plane, in which the elements of continuous shaving are removed. This leads to large variations in the cutting force in these types of steels under the given cutting conditions. The amplitude of the main cutting force component in comparison with a different type of steel is shown on the fig. 1 to illustrate characteristics of a fatigue failure, abrasive wear and <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> crumbling away...|$|R

The rotating tool consists of multiple <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> (multipoint <b>cutting</b> tool). Normally axis of rotation of feed given to the work piece. Milling operation is distinguished from other machining operations on the basis of orientation between the tool axis and the feed direction; however, in other operations like drilling, turning, etc. the tool is fed in the direction parallel to axis of rotation. The cutting tool used in milling operation is called milling cutter, which consists of multiple edges called teeth. The machine tool that performs the milling operations by producing required relative motion between work piece and tool is called milling machine. It provides the required relative motion under very controlled conditions. These conditions will be discussed later in this unit as milling speed, feed rate and depth of cut.
