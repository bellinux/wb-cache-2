5|$|The {{view has}} been taken that judges may assign meaning to vague {{constitutional}} provisions or statutes {{on the basis of}} their own ideological preferences, hence disregarding Parliament's intention. This criticism arguably does not suggest the need to abandon interpretation by reference to the legislature's intention, but serves to highlight the importance of the need to use the power of interpretation <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> manner.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E

5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2014 season, the Phillies signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus might prefer to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>appropriate</b> role, rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E
