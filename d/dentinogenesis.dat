5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of dentin {{is known as}} <b>dentinogenesis.</b> The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E

50|$|Amelogenesis is the {{formation}} of enamel on teeth and begins when the crown is forming during the advanced bell stage of tooth development after <b>dentinogenesis,</b> forms a first layer of dentine. Although dentin must be present for enamel to be formed, ameloblasts must also be for <b>dentinogenesis</b> to continue. A message is sent from the newly differentiated odontoblasts to the inner enamel epithelium (IEE), causing the epithelial cells to further differentiate into active secretory ameloblasts. <b>Dentinogenesis</b> is in turn dependent on signals from the differentiating IEE {{in order for the}} process to continue. This prerequisite {{is an example of the}} biological concept known as reciprocal induction, in this instance between mesenchymal and epithelial cells.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dentinogenesis</b> is the {{formation}} of dentin, a substance that forms the majority of teeth. <b>Dentinogenesis</b> is performed by odontoblasts, which are a special type of biological cell on the outer wall of dental pulps, and it begins at the late bell stage of a tooth development. The different stages of dentin formation after differentiation of the cell result in different types of dentin: mantle dentin, primary dentin, secondary dentin, and tertiary dentin.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta is {{a defect}} of dentin formation, and the teeth may be {{discolored}} yellow-brown, deep amber or blue-grey with increased translucency. Dentinal dysplasia is another disorder of dentin.|$|E
50|$|Type I: Type of <b>dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta {{with similar}} dental {{abnormalities}} usually an autosomal dominant trait with variable expressivity {{but can be}} recessive if the associated osteogenesis imperfecta is of recessive type.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta (DI) is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} of tooth development. This condition {{is a type}} of dentin dysplasia that causes teeth to be discolored (most often a blue-gray or yellow-brown color) and translucent giving teeth an opalescent sheen. Teeth are also weaker than normal, making them prone to rapid wear, breakage, and loss. These problems can affect both primary (deciduous) teeth and permanent teeth. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. <b>Dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta affects an estimated 1 in 6,000 to 8,000 people.|$|E
50|$|However, certain {{patients}} with <b>dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta will suffer from multiple periapical abscesses apparently resulting from pulpal strangulation secondary to pulpal obliteration or from pulp exposure due to extensive coronal wear.

50|$|In vertebrates, an {{odontoblast}} is a cell {{of neural}} crest origin {{that is part}} of the outer surface of the dental pulp, and whose biological function is <b>dentinogenesis,</b> which is the formation of dentin, the substance beneath the tooth enamel on the crown and the cementum on the root.|$|E

50|$|This gene encodes the nonamelogenin enamel {{matrix protein}} ameloblastin. The encoded protein may be {{important}} in enamel matrix formation and mineralization. This gene {{is located in the}} calcium-binding phosphoprotein gene cluster on chromosome 4. Mutations in this gene may be associated with <b>dentinogenesis</b> imperfect and autosomal dominant amylogenesis imperfect. by RefSeq, Aug 2011.|$|E
50|$|Newly {{secreted}} dentin is unmineralised and {{is called}} predentin. It is easily identified in haematoxylin and eosin stained sections since it stains less intensely than dentin. It is usually 10-47 micrometer and lines the innermost {{region of the}} dentin. It is unmineralized and consists of collagen, glycoproteins and proteoglycans. It is similar to osteoid in bone and is thickest when <b>dentinogenesis</b> is occurring.|$|E
50|$|The {{differentiation}} {{phase of}} the Induction stage is initiated {{by the presence of}} newly formed predentin. The IEE cells then elongate and become preameloblasts. There is a shift in polarity. Each preameloblast elongates and becomes an postmitotic, polarized, secretory ameloblast. However, there are no Tomes' process yet. It is at this stage that a signal is sent from the newly differentiated ameloblasts back across the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) to stimulate <b>dentinogenesis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A tooth is {{the toughest}} known {{substance}} in the body exceeding bones in density and strength. Tooth enamel lends great strength to the tooth structure. The formation of a developing tooth includes the process of dentin formation, (see: <b>Dentinogenesis)</b> and enamel formation, (see: amelogenesis). The tooth breaks through the gum into the mouth in a process called eruption. The formation of teeth begins in early fetal development and goes through six stages: ...|$|E
50|$|An {{odontoblast}} process (also called Tomes' fibers) is {{an extension}} of a cell called an odontoblast, which forms dentin in a tooth. The odontoblast process, also called Tomes fiber, is located in dentinal tubules. It forms during <b>dentinogenesis</b> and results from a part of the odontoblast staying in its location as {{the main body of the}} odontoblast moves toward the center of the tooth's pulp. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix secreted by the odontoblasts.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of dentin, known as <b>dentinogenesis,</b> begins {{prior to the}} {{formation of}} enamel and is initiated by the odontoblasts of the pulp. Dentin is derived from the dental papilla of the tooth germ. After apposition of predentin and maturation into dentin, the cell bodies of the odontoblasts remain in the pulp inside the tooth, along its outer wall. Unlike enamel, dentin continues to form throughout life and can be initiated in response to stimuli, such as tooth decay or attrition.|$|E
50|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of dentin {{is known as}} <b>dentinogenesis.</b> The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E
50|$|Whereas mantle dentin forms {{from the}} preexisting ground {{substance}} of the dental papilla, primary dentin forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause collagen to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as lipids, phosphoproteins, and phospholipids) are also secreted. There is some dispute about the control of mineralization during <b>dentinogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Formation of dentin. At this {{critical}} juncture {{a group of}} investigators at the University of Oulu Dental School, Oulu, Finland. Tjaderhane, L. et al., (1994) discovered that the parotid hormone not only regulates the flow of dentinal fluid but also {{is involved in the}} formation of dentin—dentinogenesis. They also found that a high sucrose diet in young rats suppressed primary <b>dentinogenesis.</b> The injection of carbamyl phosphate significantly reversed the effect of sucrose—but only in intact rats. Furthermore, carbamyl phosphate prevented the atrophy of the parotid glands associated with the ingestion of sucrose.|$|E
50|$|Dentin sialophosphoprotein is {{produced}} by odontoblasts and in smaller quantities by osteoblasts and osteocytes. It is a non-collagenous SIBLING protein that is later cleaved into three functional proteins: dentin phosphoprotein (also known as phosphophoryn), taken from the C-terminal end, dentin sialoprotein from the N-terminal end, and dentin glycoprotein {{from the middle of}} the molecule. Their distribution in the collagen matrix of the forming dentin suggests these proteins play an important role in the regulation of mineral deposition. Additional evidence for this correlation is phenotypically manifested in patients with mutant forms of dentin sialophosphoprotein. Such patients suffer dental anomalies including type III <b>dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta.|$|E
50|$|In {{areas where}} both primary and {{secondary}} mineralization have occurred with complete crystalline fusion, these appear as lighter rounded areas on a stained section of dentin and are considered globular dentin. In contrast, the darker arclike areas in a stained section of dentin are considered interglobular dentin. In these areas, only primary mineralization has occurred within the predentin, and the globules of dentin do not fuse completely. Thus, interglobular dentin is slightly less mineralized than globular dentin. Interglobular dentin is especially evident in coronal dentin, near the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ), and in certain dental anomalies, such as in <b>dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta.|$|E
50|$|Preventive and {{restorative}} {{care are}} important {{as well as}} esthetics as a consideration. In most cases, full-coverage crowns are needed for esthetic appearance, {{as well as to}} prevent further attrition. Another treatment option is bonding, putting lighter enamel on the weakened enamel of the teeth and with lots of treatments of this bonding, the teeth appear whiter to the eye, but the teeth on the inside and under that cover are still the same. Due to the weakened condition of the teeth, many common cosmetic procedures such as braces and bridges are inappropriate for patients with <b>Dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta and are likely to cause even more damage than the situation they were intended to correct.|$|E
50|$|A special {{health care}} need patient {{can be defined}} as a person with physical, developmental, mental, sensory, behavioural, cognitive, {{emotional}} impairment which may be congenital, developmental, or acquired through disease, trauma, or environmental cause. This condition may hinder the patients’ daily routine activities. It may impact their oral and general health. The example of special health care need patients are individuals suffering from compromised immunity such as Leukemia, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, cardiac conditions associated with Endocarditis. Furthermore, individuals with the disorders of orofacial complex such as Amelogenesis imperfecta, <b>Dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta, Cleft lip/palate, oral cancer and a like, are also considered as special health care need patients. These individuals need special oral health care which is required for their disease management.|$|E
5000|$|Dentin {{dysplasia}} is {{a genetic}} disorder of teeth, commonly exhibiting an autosomal dominant inheritance. It {{is characterized by}} presence of normal enamel but atypical dentin with abnormal pulpal morphology. There are two types. Type I is the radicular type, and type II is the coronal type. In the radicular type, the roots of teeth are shorter than normal and the pulp chamber may be nearly gone. The teeth shows extreme mobility and are exfoliated prematurely because of their short roots. The pulp chamber is sometimes described as having a [...] "crescent shaped" [...] appearance. In the coronal type, the pulps are enlarged and are described as having a [...] "thistle tube" [...] appearance, in permanent dentition. In the deciduous dentition, coronal dentin dysplasia bears a resemblance to <b>Dentinogenesis</b> Imperfecta type II.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta is a {{congenital}} dentin dysplasia {{that occurs}} either isolated or {{associated with a}} genetic disorder known as osteogenesis imperfecta. <b>Dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Clinically the teeth color of both dentitions varies from brown to a translucent gray with an opalescent sheen. Shields et al. (1973) proposed a classification of <b>Dentinogenesis</b> imperfecta into three types: type I, associated with osteogenesis imperfecta; type II, hereditary opalescent dentin; type III Brandywine-type.
