The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked <b>galactan</b> main chains, with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and galactose (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica green coffee bean, a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans, the content of free glucose was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free galactose 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively.

The main classification of these <b>galactans</b> is made in carrageenans, when the B unit belongs to the D-series, and agarans, when the B unit is in the L-configuration (Figure 1). Carrageenans cover a broad dispersion of structures that have been grouped into three major types, namely kappa/iota-, mu/nu- and lambda-carrageenans, whereas agarans are not systematically classified (Duckworth & Yaphe, 1971). This clear-cut separation between carrageenans and agarans has been upset by the finding of a third group, named DL-galactan hybrids, in which the B units can have D- and L- configurations in the same molecule (Figure 1).

Time course experiments pointed to a possible bifunctional enzyme responsible for the initial synthesis of C 50 -P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-Galf, followed by immediate conversion to C 50 -P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-Galf-Galf. Thus, Rv 3782 appears to be the initiator of <b>galactan</b> synthesis, while Rv 3808 c continues with the subsequent polymerization events...|$|E
40|$|Prebiotics are non-digestible food {{ingredients}} {{that have a}} specific stimulatory effect upon selected populations of gut bacteria. The usual target microorganisms for prebiotic approaches are bifidobacteria. Numerous human feeding studies have shown the prebiotic influences that <b>galactans</b> and fructans can exert. Other candidate prebiotics are under investigation. The field is now moving towards identifying the health aspect associated with their use. Many avenues of gut related health are being researched, including reduction of diarrhoea, immune stimulation, and improved mineral bioavailability. Most current emphasis appears to be towards various parameters associated with metabolic syndrome. These include markers of insulin resistance, appetite, satiety, blood lipids and inflammatory status...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLectins {{are used}} {{extensively}} as research tools {{to detect and}} target specific oligosaccharide sequences. Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA 120) recognizes non-reducing terminal β-d-galactose (Galβ) and its specificities of interactions with neutral and sialylated oligosaccharides have been well documented. Here we use carbohydrate arrays of sulfated Galβ-containing oligosaccharide probes, prepared from marine-derived <b>galactans,</b> to investigate their interactions with RCA 120. Our results showed that RCA 120 binding to Galβ 1 – 4 was enhanced by 2 -O- or 6 -O-sulfation but abolished by 4 -O-sulfation. The results were corroborated with competition experiments. Erythrina cristagalli lectin is also a Galβ-binding protein but it cannot accommodate any sulfation on Galβ...|$|R
40|$|The polysaccharides {{extracted}} from Claviclonium ovatum were studied {{by a combination}} of compositional assays, reductive partial hydrolysis, linkage analysis, Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and C- 13, H- 1, and C- 13 /H- 1 heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The chemical and spectroscopic data showed that the alkali-modified C. ovatum polysaccharides are composed of a nearly idealized repeating unit of 62 ̆ 7 -O-methylcarrabiose 2, 42 ̆ 7 -disulfate (the repeating unit of 6 -O-methylated iota-earrageenan), although some minor components were also present. The C. ovatum <b>galactans</b> are the most highly methylated carrageenans reported. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
