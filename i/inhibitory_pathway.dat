50|$|Within {{the primary}} visual cortex, {{there are four}} pathways: the {{superior}} colliculus pathway (SC pathway), the middle temporal area pathway (MT pathway), the frontal eye fields pathway (FEF pathway), and the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway.</b> Each pathway {{is crucial to the}} development of visual attention in {{the first few months of}} life. The SC pathway is responsible for the generation of eye movements toward simple stimuli. It receives information from the retina and the visual cortex and can direct behavior toward an object. The MT pathway is involved in the smooth tracking of objects and travels between the SC pathway and the primary visual cortex. In conjunction with the SC pathway and the MT pathway, the FEF pathway allows the infant to control eye movements as well as visual attention. It also plays a part in sensory processing in the infant. Lastly, the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> regulates the activity in the superior colliculus and, later, is responsible for obligatory attention in the infant. The maturation and functionality of these pathways depends on how well the infant can make distinctions as well as focus on stimuli.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} control movement, the putamen must {{interact}} with the other structures {{that make up the}} basal ganglia. These include the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus. These two structures, along with the putamen, interact through a series of direct and indirect <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways.</b> The direct pathway consists of two <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> from the putamen to the substantia nigra and the internal region of the globus pallidus. This pathway uses the neurotransmitters dopamine, GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway consists of three <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> that go from the putamen and caudate nucleus to the external region of the globus pallidus.

[...] The co-degeneration of limbic projections along with motor projections may result {{in many of the}} psychiatric symptoms of these primarily motor illnesses. [...] In OCD, the loop may be dysfunctional, with an imbalance between the indirect and direct pathways resulting in unwanted thoughts, getting [...] "stuck".

5000|$|The {{indirect}} pathway of {{the motor}} circuit is thought to project from the cortex, to the putamen, and to the thalamus and brainstem indirectly by passing through the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN).

The indirect pathway inhibits unwanted movements by simultaneous increase in excitatory input to other GPi and SNr neurons. [...] Similar to the direct pathway, the indirect pathway is regulated by striatal dopamine. D2 dopamine receptors inhibit transmission via the indirect pathway. D2 receptors inhibit striatal neurons in the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway.</b> This inhibitory effect of dopamine on the indirect pathway serves the same function as its excitatory effects in the direct pathway in that it reduces basal ganglia output, leading to the disinhibition of motor neurons.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, it {{has been}} shown that cell-cell {{adhesion}} formation not only restricts growth and proliferation by imposing physical constraints such as cell area, but also by triggering signaling pathways that downregulate proliferation. One such pathway is the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, which is largely responsible for inhibiting cell growth in mammals. This pathway consists primarily of a phosphorylation cascade involving serine kinases and is mediated by regulatory proteins, which regulate cell growth by binding to growth-controlling genes. The serine/threonine kinase Hippo (Mst1/Mst2 in mammals) activates a secondary kinase (Lats1/Lats2), which phosphorylates YAP, a transcriptional activator of growth genes. The phosphorylation of YAP serves to export it from the nucleus and prevent it from activating growth-promoting genes; this is how the Hippo-YAP pathway inhibits cell growth. More importantly, the Hippo-YAP pathway uses upstream elements to act in response to cell-cell contact and controls density-dependent inhibition of proliferation. For example, cadherins are transmembrane proteins that form cellular junctions via homophilic binding and thus act as detectors for cell-cell contact. Cadherin-mediated activation of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> involves the transmembrane E-cadherin forming a homophilic bond in order to activate α- and β-catenin, which then stimulate downstream components of the Hippo-YAP pathway to ultimately downregulate cell growth. This is consistent with the finding that E-cadherin overexpression hinders metastasis and tumorigenesis. Because YAP is shown to be associated with mitogenic growth factor signaling and thus cell proliferation, it is likely that future studies will focus on the Hippo-YAP pathway’s role in cancer cells.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{etiology}} of neural blockrelated transient neurological sequelae following spinal anesthesia, such as transient neurological symptoms (TNS) and less serious sensory disturbances, is still unclear, previous reports have described the facilitation of ascending nociceptive pathways {{as the source of}} complications resulting from local anesthetic toxicity, needle trauma, and patient positioning. We hypothesized that, in addition to the facilitation of ascending nociceptive pathways, the intrathecal injection of local anesthetics might interrupt descending <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways,</b> leading to hypersensitivity. To test this hypothesis, changes in tail flick (TF) latency were evaluated under lidocaine blockade of descending <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> at the thoracic spinal cord level and under lumbar intrathecal lidocaine injection in rats. Furthermore, the effects of lumbar intrathecal lidocaine injection on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neurotransmitters related to nociceptive transmission were investigated. The results revealed that thoracic intrathecal lidocaine shortened TF latency immediately after injection, while lumbar intrathecal lidocaine injection initially prolonged TF latency to the cut-off point and subsequently reduced TF latency compared to the baseline. Lumbar intrathecal lidocaine caused a significant reduction in norepinephrine concentrations in the CSF. These results indicate that the reduction of TF latency following lumbar intrathecal lidocaine injection was caused by the suppression of nor adrenergic descending <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways.</b> We concluded that the enhanced activity of dorsal horn neurons due to the suppression of descending <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> by intrathecal lidocaine injection is one of the possible mechanisms of transient neurological sequelae...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{investigated}} an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> regulating a constitutively active Ca 2 +-permeable non-selective cation conductance (Icat) in rabbit ear artery smooth muscle cells. Constitutive single channel activity of Icat was recorded in cell-attached and inside-out patches with similar unitary conductance values. In inside-out patches with relatively high constitutive activity the G-protein activator GTPγS inhibited channel activity which was reversed by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine indicating a G-protein pathway inhibits channel activity via PKC. Spontaneous channel activity was also suppressed by the G-protein inhibitor GDPβS suggesting a G-protein is also involved in initiation of constitutive channel activity. Bath application of antibodies to Gαq/Gα 11 enhanced channel activity whereas anti-Gα 1 − 3 /Gαo antibodies decreased basal channel activity which suggests that Gαq/Gα 11 and Gαι/Gαo proteins initiate, respectively, the inhibitory and excitatory cascades. The phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U 73122 increased spontaneous activity which implies a role for PLC in the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway.</b> Bath application of the diacylycerol (DAG) analogue 1 -oeoyl- 2 -acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) decreased the probability of channel opening (NPo) and this was reversed by chelerythrine. Application of the PKC activator phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu) and chelerythrine, respectively, decreased and increased NPo. These data indicate that spontaneously active cation channels are inhibited by a tonic <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> involving Gαq/Gα 11 -mediated stimulation of PLC to generate DAG which activates PKC to inhibit channel opening. There were some patches with relatively low NPo and {{it was evident that}} the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> was particularly marked in these cases. Moreover in the latter patches GTPγS and OAG caused marked increases in NPo. Together with inhibitory effects of GDPβS and anti-Gα 1 − 3 /Gαo antibodies the results suggest that there is constitutive Gαi/Gαo protein activity leading to channel opening via a DAG-mediated but PKC-independent mechanism. Finally, with whole-cell recording it is shown that noradrenaline increases Icat and the noradrenaline-evoked response is markedly potentiated by PKC inhibition. This latter observation shows that PKC also limits agonist-evoked Icat in these arterial myocytes...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the corticofugal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> to the MGB. We assessed two potential circuits: 1) the cortico-colliculothalamic circuit and 2) cortico-reticulo-thalamic one. We compared intracellular responses of MGB neurons to electrical {{stimulation of}} the AC following bilateral ablation of the inferior colliculi (IC) or thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) in anesthetized guinea pigs. Cortical stimulation with intact TRN could cause strong inhibitory effects on the MGB neurons. The corticofugal inhibition remained effective after bilateral IC ablation, but it was minimized after the TRN was lesioned with kainic acid. Synchronized TRN neuronal activity and MGB inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were observed with multiple recordings. The results suggest that corticofugal inhibition traverses the corticoreticulothalamic pathway, indicating that the colliculi-geniculate <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> is probably only for feedforward inhibition.

Two questions were addressed. First, whether there is a parallel motor inhibition to motoneurons and to interneurons in reflex pathways. Second, whether the inhibition is mediated by interneurons interposed in known reflex pathways. We recorded the intracellular activity of hindlimb motoneurons in decerebrate cats and examined the effects of medullary stimulation on these neurons and on interneuronal transmission in reflex pathways to them. Stimuli (three pulses at 10 – 60 μA and 1 – 10 ms intervals) delivered to the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in α-motoneurons (n= 147) and γ-motoneurons (n= 5) with both early and late latencies. The early inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were observed in 66. 4 % of the motoneurons and had a latency of 4. 0 – 5. 5 ms with a segmental delay of more than 1. 4 ms. The late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were observed in 98. 0 % of the motoneurons and had a latency of 30 – 35 ms, with a peak latency of 50 – 60 ms. Both types of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were evoked through fibers descending in the ventrolateral quadrant. The inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were not influenced by recurrent <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways,</b> but both types were greatly attenuated by volleys in flexor reflex afferents. Conditioning medullary stimulation, which was subthreshold to evoke inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the motoneurons, neither evoked primary afferent depolarization of dorsal roots nor reduced the input resistance of the motoneurons. However, the conditioning stimulation often facilitated non-reciprocal group I <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> (Ib <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways)</b> to the motoneurons in early (< 20 ms) and late (30 – 80 ms) periods. In contrast, it attenuated test postsynaptic potentials evoked through reciprocal Ia <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways,</b> and excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> from flexor reflex afferent and recurrent <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways.</b> The <b>inhibitory</b> effects were observed in both early and late periods. The present results provide new information about a parallel inhibitory process from the medullary reticular formation that produces a generalized motor inhibition by acting on α- and γ-motoneurons, and on interneurons in reflex pathways.

Sexualizing media messages and portrayals emphasize unattainable body and appearance ideals {{as the primary}} components of sexual desirability. The internalization of these ideals is positively related to self-objectification and sexual body consciousness. In turn, self-objectification and sexual body consciousness affect adolescents’ sexual behavior, albeit in opposing directions. While objectifying self-perceptions are linked {{to higher levels of}} sexual behavior, body consciousness during physical intimacy is linked to lower levels of sexual behavior. Based on this knowledge, the present three-wave panel study of 824 Belgian, predominant heterosexual adolescents (Mage = 15. 33; SD = 1. 45) proposes a dual-pathway model that investigates two different pathways through which the internalization of media ideals may impact adolescents’ sexual behavior. An <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> links media internalization to lower levels of sexual behavior through sexual body consciousness, and a supportive pathway links media internalization to higher levels of sexual behavior through self-objectification. Structural equation analyses supported the proposed dual-pathway, showing that the impact of media internalization on adolescents’ sexual behavior proceeds through an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> and a supportive pathway. Regarding the supportive pathway, media internalization (W 1) positively predicted sexual behavior (W 3), through valuing appearance over competence (W 2).

40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLR) are transmembrane pattern {{recognition}} receptors that recognize microbial ligands and signal for production of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon in macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). Whereas TLR-induced inflammatory mediators {{are required for}} pathogen clearance, many are toxic to the host and can cause pathological inflammation when over-produced. This is demonstrated by the role of TLR-induced cytokines in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Because of the potent effects of TLR-induced cytokines, we have diverse mechanisms to dampen TLR signaling. Here, we highlight three pathways that participate in inhibition of TLR responses in macrophages and DC, and their implications in autoimmunity; A 20, encoded by the TNFAIP 3 gene, Lyp encoded by the PTPN 22 gene, and the BCAP/PI 3 K pathway. We present new findings that Lyp promotes TLR responses in primary human monocytes and that the autoimmunity risk Lyp 620 W variant is more effective at promoting TLR-induced interleukin- 6 than the non-risk Lyp 620 R protein.

The precise mechanisms linking luminance to the trigeminal nociceptive system supposed to mediate this discomfort are not known. To address this issue in healthy human subjects we modulated differentially visual cortex activity by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or flash light stimulation, and studied the effect on supraorbital pain thresholds and the nociceptive-specific blink reflex (nBR). Low frequency rTMS that inhibits the underlying cortex, significantly decreased pain thresholds, increased the 1 st nBR block ipsi- and contralaterally and potentiated habituation contralaterally. After high frequency or sham rTMS over the visual cortex, and rMS over the right greater occipital nerve we found no significant change.

40|$|A {{combined}} biochemical {{and genetic}} approach {{was used to}} show that phospholipase C in the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium is under dual regulation by the chemoattractant cyclic AMP (cAMP). This dual regulation involves stimulatory and inhibitory surface receptors and G-proteins. In wild-type cells both cAMP and guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]) stimulated phospholipase C. In contrast, mutant fgd A, lacking the G-protein alpha-subunit G alpha 2, showed no stimulation by either cAMP or GTP[S], indicating that G alpha 2 is the stimulatory G-protein. In mutant fgd C cAMP did not stimulate phospholipase C, but stimulation by GTP[S] was normal, suggesting that the defect in this mutant is upstream of the stimulatory G alpha 2. Inhibition of phospholipase C was achieved in wild-type cells by the partial antagonist 3 '-deoxy- 3 '-aminoadenosine 3 ', 5 '-phosphate (3 'NH-cAMP). This inhibition was no longer observed in transformed cell lines lacking either the surface cAMP receptor cAR 1 or the G-protein alpha-subunit G alpha 1; in these cells the agonist cAMP still activated phospholipase C.

Various studies attempted to determine the functional implication of Rim 1, {{a component of the}} vesicle release machinery. Besides to couple voltage-gated Ca(2 +) channels to the presynaptic vesicle release machinery, it was evidenced that Rim 1 also prevents voltage-dependent inactivation of the channels through a direct interaction with the ancillary β-subunits, thus facilitating neurotransmitter release. However, facilitation of synaptic activity may also be caused by a reduction of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> carried by G-protein-coupled receptors. Here, we explored the functional implication of Rim 1 in G-protein regulation of Ca(v) 2. 2 channels. Activation of μ-opioid receptors expressed in HEK- 293 cells along with Ca(v) 2. 2 channels produced a drastic current inhibition both in control and Rim 1 -expressing cells.
