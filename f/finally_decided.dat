5|$|When O'Brien <b>finally</b> <b>decided</b> {{to write}} a {{biography}} on Madonna in 2005, she wanted the book to be more about the singer's contribution to her music, rather than delving too much into her personal life, unlike other Madonna biographers. The author then interviewed dancers, choreographers, musicians, and producers who worked with Madonna. After its release, the book received a mixed response from critics. They were unanimous that the over-emphasis given on the singer's discography was unnecessary, instead more thought should have been given on exploring her personal life, which {{would have made the}} biography compelling.|$|E

5|$|A {{full-scale}} mockup of the Q-12 {{was ready}} by 7 December 1962, {{and had already}} undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA <b>finally</b> <b>decided</b> to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.|$|E

The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was {{employed}} by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground.

5|$|In 1817, Andrew Jackson invaded Florida {{to hasten}} its {{annexation}} to the United States, in {{what became known}} as the First Seminole War.

The Second Seminole War lasted from 1835 to 1842, and afterward, the US forcibly removed about 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), west of the Mississippi River. Many others died in the war. Conflict broke out again in the Third Seminole War from 1855 to 1859, when a few hundred Seminole fought off US forces from the swamps of the Everglades. The US <b>finally</b> <b>decided</b> to leave them alone, as they could not dislodge them even after this protracted and expensive warfare.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln had {{not been}} asked or {{informed}} about either Vallandigham's arrest or {{the closure of the}} Chicago Times.

5|$|Trading {{continued}} {{throughout the}} medieval period {{evidenced by the}} importance of Torksey, which was then a flourishing town, now only a small village.

Henry I had overseen the scouring of its channel, and there were inquiries in 1335, 1365 and 1518 to consider {{the state of the}} Fossdyke and to compel the inhabitants of the region to maintain it. Lincoln was a centre for the collection of business taxes, but this came at the cost of maintaining the waterways, and having <b>finally</b> <b>decided</b> it was too large a cost, James I presented the Fossdyke to the City of Lincoln.|$|E
