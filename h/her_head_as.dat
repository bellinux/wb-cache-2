5|$|Buddhist texts {{recount the}} birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of Krishnacharya's disciples, two Mahasiddha ("great perfected ones") sisters, Mekhala and Kanakhala, who cut their heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also {{appeared}} in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the Mahasiddha princess Lakshminkara, cut off <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> a punishment from the king and roamed with it in the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.|$|E

5|$|After {{the second}} chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and {{a stick of}} red {{lipstick}} bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing their feet and cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of artist Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and Jesus marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but he places his palm on <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls {{on the ground with}} a silent, anguished cry. The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's stoned to death by the crowd.|$|E

Trying to save Dr. Webber, she accidentally steps into a puddle and electrocutes herself while hitting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> she falls. Bailey moves a cancer patient in Webber's room to force some perspective and make him take the treatment. Also introduced in the tenth season was Dr. Karev's estranged father Jimmy Evans (James Remar) who tries to form a relationship with his son but fails repeatedly and ultimately dies in a botched surgery.

Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) unknowingly drops a bombshell that she is the adopted love child of Dr. Webber and the late Dr. Grey, which makes for yet another half sister of Dr. Meredith Grey. Also, Dr. Yang leaves her seat on the board to Dr. Karev while Dr. Webber all but promises the seat to Dr. Bailey. Introduced in season eleven is Dr. Nicole Herman (Geena Davis), who is Chief of Fetal Surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial. Dr. Herman mentors Arizona Robbins in a fetal surgery fellowship, and plays in a twelve episode arc before departing after episode fourteen.|$|E

Shortly after {{breaking}} out of the mall with the group, she attempts to save a frightened student trapped {{on top of a}} truck in the parking lot. She and Shimada distract the zombies long enough for the student to escape, however Asami herself becomes trapped without any more bullets. Asami shouts that she hates Kohta, although Takashi immediately recognizes and tells Kohta that she is just yelling to attract the zombies so that they can escape.

25|$|One {{possible}} scenario on how direct insemination {{evolved in}} insects {{is seen in}} scorpions. The male deposits a spermatophore on the ground, locks its claws with the female's claws and then guides her over his packet of sperm, making sure it comes in contact with her genital opening. When the early (male) insects laid their spermatophores on the ground, {{it seems likely that}} some of them used the clasping organs {{at the end of their}} body to drag the female over the package. The ancestors of Odonata evolved the habit of grabbing the female behind <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> they still do today. This action, rather than not grasping the female at all, would have increased the male's chances of spreading its genes. The chances would be further increased if they first attached their spermatophore safely on their own abdomen before they placed their abdominal claspers behind the female's head; the male would then not let the female go before her abdomen had made direct contact with his sperm storage, allowing the transfer of all sperm.|$|E
500|$|The mid 1960s brought Adkins first {{official}} release through a local micro-label, with the 45 record Chicken Walk / She's Mine. What followed were the releases {{of some of}} his most notable songs, though at the time they received little attention outside of Madison. [...] "She Said" [...] revealed his imaginative tone in writing, in which he compared the woman of a one-night stand he had to [...] "a dying can of that commodity meat." [...] "No More Hot Dogs" [...] was a song about decapitating a girlfriend and keeping <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> a wall mount.|$|E
500|$|Mom and Dad {{tells the}} story of Joan Blake (June Carlson), a young girl who falls for the pilot Jack Griffin (Bob Lowell). After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him.

500|$|The {{world premiere}} {{occurred}} on September 20, 2016, {{during the season}} two premiere of Scream Queens on FOX. Gaga also shared {{a preview of the}} video, showing her swinging a microphone over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> an ecstatic crowd cheers on. The visuals begin with her singing while driving a jeep through a desert and then finally performing in front of a crowd, aided by the producers. The video ends with Gaga rolling around alone in the desert. Jack White from the Official Charts Company noted that the editing consisted of [...] "quick, jagged camera cuts" [...] which made up majority of the visuals. In 2017, filming of the music video was included in the documentary film, [...]|$|E
500|$|Referring to the {{challenges}} faced in casting, he said that while they were canvassing local people for auditions, they were warding off rumors that they were after the people's kidneys. When placing a newspaper advertisement for the landlady's character did not seem viable, they advertised for household help instead. Upon seeing this, Urmila Dammannagari turned up for the interview with Domalpalli. Inadvertently, their conversation veered toward the film and the real motive behind the advertisement became evident. Though initially shocked {{and despite the fact}} that she had to commute [...] from her house to the location, she took up the role. Professionally Krishnamma Gundimalla, who played the role of Radhamma, carried bricks on <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> a construction worker. On the other hand, Ramachandriah Marikanti, who plays Vanaja's fisherman father, was a municipal sweeper and worked as a security guard.|$|E
500|$|Potter died on December 22, 1943, {{and left}} her home and the {{original}} illustrations for almost all of her books, including Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, to the National Trust. [...] Hilltop was opened to visitors in 1946, and displayed her original artwork there until 1985. In 1947, Frederick Warne & Co. granted Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire [...] "rights and licences to produce" [...] the Potter characters in porcelain. The next year, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle {{was one of the}} first set of ten porcelain figurines released. Between 1985 and 1999 Beswick produced five more porcelain collectibles featuring the hedgehog, including <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> a mug in 1988, a larger version of the first figurine in 1996, and a limited edition tableau showing Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle in 1999.

500|$|Following the pie {{attack on}} the archbishop, two of Allan Spear's colleagues invited Anita Bryant to come to St. Paul to {{overturn}} their three-year-old gay rights ordinance, and announced Save Our Children would be opening a branch there. Local activists did not think much of their chances; a local gay political group invited gays and lesbians in Miami to live in Minneapolisâ€”St. Paul. In an act representing Bryant's diminished national public profile, in October 1977 Bryant {{and her husband were}} in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing an upcoming concert at a press conference when Thom Higgins, an activist affiliated with organizers in Minneapolis, walked up to her in front of cameras and mashed a strawberry rhubarb pie in her face. Bryant was stunned and bowed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> she and Green held hands and prayed for Higgins. She quickly quipped [...] "At least it's a fruit pie." [...] An image of her covered with the pastry appeared {{on the front page of}} The New York Times the next day.|$|E
500|$|Sasha Geffen from MTV News noted Gaga's eyes {{rolling back}} in <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> she moshes {{with the crowd}} in the clip and [...] "at one point she almost rips the head off of [...] ". Similar {{thoughts}} were echoed in Lara Walsh's review of the clip for InStyle, where she fawned about being a [...] "big fan" [...] of Gaga's [...] "raw appearance" [...] in the video. Writing for the Idolator, Mike Wass noted that the cover artwork gives one a clear idea regarding what to expect from the video, seeing that it [...] "reinvents Gaga as a rockstar" [...] and the [...] "epilepsy induced editing brings the whole thing to life". However he missed the theatricality associated with the singer's previous videos. Caitlyn Callegari from Bustle compared the clip with that of experiencing a Gaga concert from the front row and called it [...] "appealing" [...] since it had the singer's [...] "patented stylistic melodrama while also maintaining an air of realness to it". Callegari complimented the visuals for bringing out Gaga as both a performer and singer, [...] "and this video invites us to enjoy her in her purest form".|$|E
500|$|On Mother's Day, toddler Angelica Pickles {{constructs}} a macaroni {{sculpture of}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> a present to her mother, telling the Rugrats {{the meaning of}} the holiday. After dropping off his son Chuckie, Chaz Finster gives his friend Didi Pickles a box of his wife's belongings as he fears that Chuckie will find it. Chaz does not feel he is ready to talk to Chuckie about his mother. While helping the other babies Phil and Lil DeVille and Tommy Pickles look for the perfect gifts for their mothers, Chuckie feels uncertain about how he should celebrate Mother's Day. Tommy, Phil, and Lil share their favorite memories of their mothers with Chuckie. Phil and Lil say that the best gift they gave their mom was their first laugh. Tommy reminisces about his mom comforting him while he was in a neonatal intensive care unit. The babies think of a plan to find Chuckie a new mother. Their attempts to have Tommy's dog Spike and Lil act as his mom are unsuccessful. Angelica agrees to act as Chuckie's mother only if he completes her macaroni sculpture. Meanwhile, Didi takes her mom Minka to a spa, and Betty DeVille helps Stu Pickles with his invention to help mothers.|$|E

2500|$|So, the 'shrouded in snow' phrase may {{refer to}} the [...] "coldness and frigidity of the {{situation}} in which she is trapped"; to the white flowers that covered <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> she was being dragged off; to the covering of snow on the ground during Winter prior to the re-appearance of the flowers. The aspiration of whiteness towards 'golden' yellowness is also in play here.|$|E

Around this time tradition has it that DÃ²mhnall Cam fortified himself on a [...] high promontory of jagged rock on the sea-coast near Mangursta (or Mangersta, Scottish Gaelic: Mangarstadh). Today the stack still bears his name: Stac DhÃ²mhnaill Chaim.

She is nude to the waist except for a necklace and bracelets on her arms; her legs are swathed in white- and rose-colored garments. At the left a servant woman dressed in rich blue brings accessories, and at the right Hegai, clad in bright red, offers a jewel box. Esther acknowledges neither of them, staring out of the picture to the left. Behind them is a landscape of trees and sky.|$|E
