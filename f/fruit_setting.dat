40|$|Background and Aims: <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> in {{indeterminate}} {{plant species}} largely {{depends on the}} balance between source and sink strength. Plants of these species show fluctuations in <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> during the growing season. It was tested whether differences in fruit sink strength among the cultivars explained the differences in fruit-set patterns. Methods: Capsicum was chosen as a model plant. Six cultivars with differences in <b>fruit</b> <b>set,</b> <b>fruit</b> size and plant growth were evaluated in a greenhouse experiment. Fruit-set patterns, generative and vegetative sink strength, source strength and the source : sink ratio at <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> were determined. Sink strength was quantified as potential growth rate. <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> was related to total fruit sink strength and the source : sink ratio. The effect of differences observed in above-mentioned parameters on fruit-set patterns was examined using a simple simulation model. Key Results: Sink strengths of individual fruits differed greatly among cultivars. Week-to-week <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> in large-fruited cultivars fluctuated due to large fluctuations in total fruit sink strength, but in small-fruited cultivars, total fruit sink strength and <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> were relatively constant. Large variations in week-to-week <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> were correlated with a low fruit-set percentage. The source : sink threshold for <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> was higher in large-fruited cultivars. Simulations showed that {{within the range of}} parameter values found in the experiment, fruit sink strength and source : sink threshold for <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> had the largest impact on fruit set: an increase in these parameters decreased the average percentage <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and increased variation in weekly <b>fruit</b> <b>set.</b> Both were needed to explain the fruit-set patterns observed. The differences observed in the other parameters (e. g. source strength) had a lower effect on <b>fruit</b> <b>set.</b> Conclusions: Both individual fruit sink strength and the source : sink threshold for <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> were needed to explain the differences observed between fruit-set patterns of the six cultivar...|$|R
40|$|Tropical trees {{may show}} {{positive}} density dependence in <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and maturation due to pollen limitation in low-density populations. However, pollen from closely related {{individuals in the}} local neighbourhood might reduce <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> or increase <b>fruit</b> abortion in self-incompatible tree species. We investigated the role of neighbourhood density and genetic relatedness on individual <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and abortion in the neotropical tree Jacaranda copaia in a large forest plot in central Panama. Using nested neighbourhood models, we found a strong positive effect of increased conspecific density on <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and maturation. However, high neighbourhood genetic relatedness interacted with density to reduce total <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and increase the proportion of aborted fruit. Our results imply a fitness advantage for individuals growing in high densities as measured by <b>fruit</b> <b>set,</b> but realized <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> is lowered by increased neighbourhood relatedness. We hypothesize that the mechanism involved is increased visitation by density-dependent invertebrate pollinators in high-density populations, which increases pollen quantity and carry-over and increases <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and maturation, coupled with self-incompatibility at early and late stages due to biparental inbreeding that lowers <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and increases <b>fruit</b> abortion.

40|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> and yield {{patterns}} were studied {{in detail in}} six pepper cultivars. <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> differed largely between the cultivars: cultivars with small fruits (fruit fresh weight 20 to 40 g) showed higher <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> (50 %) than cultivars with large fruits (fruit fresh weight 120 to 200 g; 11 % to 19 %). The former showed continuous <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> (four to five fruits/plant/week), whereas the latter showed fluctuations in <b>fruit</b> <b>set.</b> Fluctuations in weekly <b>fruit</b> <b>set,</b> expressed as the ratio between standard deviation of weekly <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and the mean of weekly <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> (CV), were much lower for the cultivars with small fruits (0. 44 to 0. 49) than for the cultivars with large fruits (1. 1 to 1. 6). Fluctuations in weekly fruit yield varied between 0. 51 and 0. 77 for cultivars with small fruits and between 1. 04 and 1. 45 for cultivars with large fruits. Fluctuations in fruit yield were significantly positively correlated (Pearson R = 0. 87) with fluctuations in <b>fruit</b> <b>set.</b> The correlation between <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and <b>fruit</b> yield patterns was highest with a lag time of 8 weeks for the cultivars with small fruits and 9 to 10 weeks for the cultivars with large fruits. This corresponds with the expected lag time based on the average fruit growth duration. The cultivars produced {{the same amount of}} biomass, implying that source strength was more or less similar.

5000|$|Girdling is {{also used}} as a {{technique}} to force a fruit-bearing plant to bear larger fruit. A farmer would place a girdle (bark removal) at base of a large branch or at the trunk. Thus, all sugars manufactured by the leaves have no sinks but the fruit, which grows to above the normal size. For grapes girdling or cincturing is {{used to make the}} grapes large and sweeter on the grape canopy and are sold as girdled grapes. Flowering and <b>fruit</b> <b>setting</b> is a problem on some trees; girdling may improve yield in the same way. The [...] "damage" [...] done by girdling restricts the movement of nutrients to the roots, thus the carbohydrates produced in the leaves do not go to the roots for storage. Girdling temporarily stops tree growth. Root pruning, an ancient Asian practice, and other controlled damaging, such as driving nails into the trunk or beating the branches and trunk, produce results that are similar to girdling. Girdling is commonly used on grape, avocado, apple, litchi, mango, citrus and other trees. Girdling is normally only done to healthy trees that did not yield well the previous year. Care must be used not to damage sapwood that may kill the tree or vine. Trees normally heal in four to five weeks after cincturing. Painting the cut can protect against fungus and pests.|$|E
40|$|In Iris fulva, the apical flower on an {{inflorescence}} opens first, and {{the flowering}} sequence then {{proceeds from the}} most basal flower upward to the apex (acropetally). Flowering order and flower position are thus partially decoupled, and this provides an opportunity to separately investigate {{the effects of these}} two factors upon fruit formation. We recorded natural patterns of <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and seed production, and found that <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> patterns were determined by {{what appears to be a}} form of apical dominance. The first, apical flower had the highest <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and seed production. <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> decreased towards the base of the inflorescence, with later-opening flowers having a higher <b>fruit</b> <b>set.</b> This is contrary to the pattern usually observed in other acropetally flowering plants, which is a higher <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> for basal, early flowers. By performing additional hand pollinations and counting pollen grains on naturally pollinated flowers, we found that pollen deposition was not a major factor limiting <b>fruit</b> <b>set,</b> and that it could not explain the large difference in <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> between the apical and basal flowers. Removing the first flower after it had wilted increased <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> in the remaining flowers, but mainly in the more apical flowers. only by removing the two topmost flowers could we obtain an increase in <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> for the basal flower.

40|$|Abstract Specialization of a {{plant on}} a {{particular}} polli-nator may not evolve if co-pollinators are effective and abundant. This is particularly evident if <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> is re-source limited and cannot be increased above the levels produced {{by the actions of}} co-pollinators. The pollinat-ing seed-consuming interaction between senita cacti and senita moths in the Sonoran Desert presents a paradox because it exhibits many traits resembling those of the highly specialized yucca/yucca moth system, but also in-volves co-pollinators. For 6 years, we studied how con-tributions of nocturnal senita moths and diurnal co-polli-nating bees to <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> depended on resource and pollen limitation, time of flower closing, and the onset and phe-nology of flowering. <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> was typically resource lim-ited. <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> of flowers exposed only to senita moths was not different from resource-limited <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> of con-trol flowers. When only co-pollinating bees were al-lowed to visit flowers, however, <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> became pollen limited. Only in one year when <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> was pollen limit-ed were bees able to increase <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> beyond the level resulting from senita moth pollination. High tempera-tures commonly induced flowers to close before sunrise so that diurnal bees were unable to visit flowers. This was particularly important from 1998 to 2000, when flowering did not begin until late in spring when temper-atures were already high enough to induce flowers to close before sunrise. Bees were typically functionally re-dundant with senita moths; excluding bees from visiting flowers did not alter <b>fruit</b> <b>set.</b> Nevertheless, extreme spe-cialization of floral traits to exclude co-pollinators has not evolved in senita, possibly because there are times when bees do increase <b>fruit</b> <b>set.</b> This can occur when se-nita moths are rare, <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> is pollen limited, cool tem-peratures prevent flowers from closing before sunrise, and flowering begins early in spring...|$|R

40|$|Recently, it was {{hypothesized}} that pollinator selectivity for large inflorescences has led to the evolution of monocarpic reproduction in agaves. To test this hypothesis, <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and stalk length data were collected for six species of paniculate agaves and two species of spicate agaves. Regression results, for all of the paniculate species and for one species of the spicate agaves, showed no significant correlation between <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and stalk length. These results do not support the pollinator selectivity hypothesis. The validity of the assumptions was then examined, utilizing the results from hand pollination, pruning, and tie down experiments. These results imply that factors other than pollinator availability might be important in determining <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> in agaves. In an effort to determine the relative importance of resource and pollinator limitation to <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> in Agave chrysantha, three treatments were applied to entire plants: (1) natural pollination, (2) natural and hand pollination, and (3) hand pollination. When fruits were collected, {{there were no significant differences}} between percent <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> for the three treatments, implying that <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> is not limited by the availability of pollinators. When additional plants were pruned to reduce the total number of flowers by approximately one-half, thereby doubling the amount of resources available to each flower, the percent <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> was twice that for control plants, implying that percent <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> is energy limited. It is common for plants that exhibit resource limited <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> to have relatively low fruit-to-flower ratios.

Four hypotheses explaining the <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> in Agave mckelveyana are tested. Results from pruning, bagging, and hand pollination experiments indicate that the apparently "excess flowers" do not contribute to fruit production (female fitness).

We measured the natural level of <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and pollinator limitation (calculated as the difference in <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> between hand cross-pollinated and naturally pollinated flowers). Our results demonstrate that there was a higher level of pollinator limitation and hence lower levels of natural <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> in self-incompatible species as compared to self-compatible species. However, the hand cross-pollinated flowers in SC and SI species produced similar levels of fruit set,further indicating that lower <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> was due to pollinator limitation and not due to lack of cross-compatible individuals in the fragments. There was no significant relation between number of flowering individuals and the levels of natural <b>fruit</b> <b>set,</b> except for two species Derris ovalifolia, Ixora pavetta. In these species the natural <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> decreased with increasing population size, again indicating pollinator limitation. The adult and sapling densities in self-compatible species were significantly higher than inself-incompatible species. These findings indicate that the low reproductive output in self-incompatible species may eventually lead to lower population sizes. Restoration of pollinator services along with plant species in fragmented habitats is important for the long-term conservation of biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} of <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> within inflorescences may {{be controlled by}} pollination, nutrient allocation,or inflorescence architecture. Generally, flowers that have spatial and/or temporal precedence {{are more likely to}} <b>set</b> <b>fruits.</b> We sought to separate these factors by comparing {{patterns of}} <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> on inflorescences of two species of Telopea (Proteaceae); one that flowers from the tip {{to the base of the}} rachis, the other from base to tip. In both species, most <b>fruits</b> were <b>set</b> at the top of the inflorescence (the last flowers to open for T. speciosissima) and this was extreme for T. mongaensis, where the top flowers open first. <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> was not generally limited by inadequate pollination for either T. mongaensis or T. speciosissima, as hand pollinations did not increase <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and many abscised flowers contained pollen tubes. In T. speciosissima, we tested whether removal of developing topmost fruits would those that had initiated but not yet aborted lower down. There was no significant effect. Plant hormones can increase the degree to which a developing fruit is a sink for nutrients, so we applied cytokinin to the developing lower fruits on some inflorescences. There was no significant effect of the hormone treatment. We conclude that temporal precedence may contribute to the skewed pattern of <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> in T. mongaensis, because there was an extreme concentration of <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> on the distal part of the inflorescences, but it cannot explain this pattern of <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> in T. speciosissima, where the distal flowers are the last to open. Some other process must therefore constrain <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> to the topmost flowers in an inflorescence. While cytokinin application had no significant effect, the power of this experiment was low and we consider that the hypothesis of hormonal control is worth further exploration...|$|R
40|$|Realizaram-se contagens de frutos novos de café logo após o florescimento, em novembro, e de frutos completamente desenvolvidos, em fevereiro do ano seguinte, a fim de {{calcular}} as porcentagens de "pegamento" dos frutos, em alguns canteiros de um. ensaio de adubação, que haviam recebido combinações de adubo mineral e orgânico. As determinações foram feitas para as posições alta, média e inferior de cada planta, e o resultado médio foi correlacionado com os elementos usados na adubação e também com a produção das plantas. Os resultados obtidos indicaram que o fósforo, combinado com o estêrco, contribuiu para aumentar 3, 5 % à porcentagem de pegamento em relação à adubação sòmente com estêrco, e que o potássio também contribuiu com um aumento de 8, 1 % em relação às plantas que não receberam êste elemento. O pegamento dos frutos na. parte superior das plantas mostrou-se maior do que nas partes média e inferior. Verificou-se, ainda, que a porcentagem de pegamento geral, a qual é de cerca de 50 %, é independente da produtividade das plantas. Determinations of <b>fruit</b> <b>setting</b> {{were made}} in a fertilizer trial that is being carried out at the Estação Experimental de Ribeirão Prêto. This experiment is a factorial 2 (4) with four replications, the basic treatments being 10 kg of "estêrco" (e), 0. 2 kg of ammonium sulphate (n), 0. 2 kg of bone meal (p) and 0. 1 kg of potassium chloride (k). Fruits were counted in November of 1953 and 1954, soon after flowering, and also in February of the following years, when the fruits were already well developed. By <b>fruit</b> <b>setting</b> it is meant the ratio between fruit numbers in November and February, although counting was made at 15 -day intervals between these two dates. In 1953 / 54 the percentage of <b>fruit</b> <b>setting</b> was determined for one plant {{in each of the}} four replications of treatments e, en, ep and ek. One plant in each replication of treatments np, en, enk and enpk was studied in 1954 / 55. For each plant in both seasons, six flowering branches were used, two at the higher part of the coffee plant, two at the base and two in intermediate positions. From the results obtained it is concluded that chemical fertilizers may contribute significantly to increase the percentage of <b>fruit</b> <b>setting.</b> Together with "estêrco" (stable manure), phosphorus showed a 3. 5 per cent increase over "estêrco" alone. Comparing treatments with and without potash an increase of 8. 1 per cent was found for plots receiving this fertilizer in 1954 / 55. It is also concluded that significant differences were observed in <b>fruit</b> <b>setting</b> at different levels of the plant, in favor of the higher branches. <b>Fruit</b> <b>setting</b> showed no correlation with total yield of ripened fruits...|$|E

40|$|Light {{interception}} by {{the orange}} tree canopy during flower bud differentiation and subsequent flowering and <b>fruit</b> <b>setting</b> has been monitored by continuous data recording from 48 silicon cells distributed in different canopy zones. Two experimental conditions have been tested: trees artificially shaded {{by a black}} nylon net cage, and non-shaded trees. Observations were made on the total radiation accumulated in the different canopy zones, and they were related to photosynthetic activity, stomatal conductance) flowering and fruiting pattern, and fruit quality. The different light distribution affected both photosyntesis and stomatal conductance: in fact, they were both drastically reduced in shaded trees, and a significant decrease was also found in both shaded and unshaded trees in relation to different canopy zones. A significant decrease of flowering and <b>fruit</b> <b>setting</b> was found {{from the top of}} the canopy to the bottom and from outside to inside, in relation to the different amount of radiant energy availability. Finally significant differences were found on fruit quality...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} natural {{rates of}} floral abortion in four common mangrove species from nor-them Australia and subsequently manipulated pollination experimentally. Sonneratia alba J. Smith exhibited {{the highest rate}} of <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> of the four species (23 %), indicating this mangrove was best able to utilise the natural pollination opportunities provided. <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> in S. alba appeared, however, to be pollinator limited, as large increases in <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> occurred after manual cross-pollination of flowers. Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh. had {{the highest rate of}} natural pollination, but <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> was lower (15 %) and appeared to be impeded by resource limitations. Although a range of insects visited Ceriops australis (C. T. White) Ballment, T. J. Sur & Stoddart, the rate of <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> was low (3 %) and the capacity for flower fertilisation limited. despite evidence of autogamy in this species. There was an indication of both resource and pollinator limitation in C. australis. Rhizophora stylosa Griff. exhibited limited <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> (0. 5 %), possibly due to limiting maternal resources and the lack of adaptation of flowers to either animal or wind pollination. Large increases in <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> were recorded after manual cross-pollination of R. stylosa flowers. R. stylosa and C. australis, characterised by resource rich propagules with long periods of development, both aborted a large proportion of propagules during the fruit maturation process...|$|R

40|$|Under {{controlled}} temperature conditions <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> and the effective pollination period (EPP) of pear cv. Doyenné du Comice and apple cv. Golden Delicious were studied at 4 temperature regimes, i. e. 13 °(bloom) - 13 °C (post-bloom), 13 – 17, 17 – 17, and 17 – 13. The post-bloom temperature was applied from 1 {{day after the}} end of bloom. <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> was determined 3 and 6 weeks after bloom. <b>Fruit</b> <b>set</b> at 3 weeks was very high in pear and apple. There were hardly any differences between the various temperature regimes. A severe fruit drop occurred between 3 and 6 weeks after bloom when post-bloom temperature was high. The effect of bloom temperature on <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> was very small. The data for pear indicate that the EPP is extended somewhat at the high bloom temperature. In apple the EPP was about the same in all treatments. The data suggest that final <b>fruit</b> <b>set</b> in Doyenné du Comice as well as in Golden Delicious is mainly determined by the post-bloom temperature. Bloom temperature is not relevant as long as pollination and the EPP do not limit <b>fruit</b> <b>set...</b>|$|R
