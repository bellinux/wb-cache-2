This {{was followed by a}} period where EU member states tried to maximize control, with little systematic project appraisal and a focus on a small number of large projects. Since 1994 more systematic, co-ordinated and complex methods of allocating resources start to be introduced. For example, most funds within the 2004-06 <b>Integrated</b> Regional <b>Operational</b> <b>Programme</b> (IROP), and its 2007-13 successor (ROP), are allocated through largely need-based project-selection mechanisms. Regions with low GDP receive more funds. However, within these regions, more funds go to relatively rich local areas [...] with the best institutions. It has been argued that part of this {{can be explained by the}} frequent need to co-fund projects, and the needed capacity to prepare applications.|$|R

40|$|The Czech Republic {{has earned}} {{worldwide}} recognition for its remarkable {{results in the}} area of cultural heritage preservation. However, digitisation and digital preservation are significantly hindered by a lack of resources. This results in a relatively slow pace of digitisation. Furthermore, it leads to serious delays in dealing with, and solving, current digital preservation issues. This paper explores a “National Digital Library ” project, which has been accepted by the Ministry of Culture as a candidate for European funding under the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Programme.</b> The National Library of the Czech Republic, along with the Moravian State Library in Brno, have prepared an ambitious project with two main goals – 1) to accelerate the digitisation; 2) to establish a trusted long-term preservation repository. 1. 2 million documents should be digitised within the next 20 years.

40|$|Poland’s {{membership}} in the European Monetary Union is still a relatively distant event. However if one considers {{the slow pace of}} structural change in regional development the exciting differences in this field in Poland could amount to a major obstacle in the smooth transition to the single currency even if this takes more years to come. The transition period to the market economy (1989 / 90 - 2004) did not eliminate existing sharp differences in the development level of the Polish regions. They still exist despite the investment outlays considerably augmented owning to EU pre-accession aid and the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Programme</b> of Regional Development for the years 2004 - 2006. In order to obtain satisfactory results from structural Funds forseen for the period 2007 - 2013 it is necessary to better coordinate investment projects stemming from different sectoral programmes with the 16 regional ones (in order to get higher spill-over effects or value added). More attention should be paid to investment in human capital. Simultaneously the territorial and social mobility of labour in Poland should be increased and greater wage elasticity introduced in order to better prepare the economy for a unified monetary policy and possible external shocks. Hence, the current concept of regional development policy should be revised substantially...|$|E

The paper is aimed both at evaluation of strategy being already implemented within National Development Plan (NDP) 2004 - 2006 and presentation of social, academic and political discourse that has recently been formed around proposal of National Development Plan covering next programming period 2007 - 2013. Two out of four dimensions of Lisbon strategy were chosen as a subject to academic scrutiny that are entrepreneurship development and building innovative, knowledge based economy in Europe. Measures related to these areas can be easily found in most of member state strategies of management the EU structural funds and as such they present a good basis for comparative research.

40|$|The six {{founders of}} the European Economic Community, later the European Union, did not differ {{substantially}} {{in terms of an}} economic level. Therefore the issue of policy and the problems connected with a regional development started to be discussed along with the development of the economic integration and the enlargement of Communities with another countries, which were much different economically from the founders. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) was established at the Copenhagen summit in 1975 and the resources were distributed into member states. The subsequent enlargement of the Community in 1986 with Spain and Portugal contributed to signing the Single European Act (SEA), which created the basis for a new structural policy and its reform in 1988, and the binding rules were additionally enlarged in the European Union Treaty from Maastricht. The EU Treaty signed on 07. 02. 1992 in Maastricht in the Netherlands established the European Union and came into force on 01. 11. 1993. Poland, after entering the European Union on 01. 05. 2004, taking into consideration the experience from the absorption of the pre-accession funds for ten years, i. e. since 1994, since the first days after the accession used well the EU resources and the Lubuskie Voivodship led the way within this range in Poland. Therefore the regional development was supported by the structural funds orientated first of all to infrastructure and the protection of natural environment. The assistance programme of the European Union for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe – Phare had its edition since 1994 in the Lubuskie Voivodship as Phare Cross Border Cooperation CBC – the Programme of Poland – Germany Cross Border Cooperation was mainly used for the implementation of investment projects on the Polish-German borderland. This experience was implemented in the effective use of the support within the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Programme</b> of Regional Development in 2004 – 2006. Over 80 million euros granted for the Lubuskie Voivodship were orientated mainly to road, council and social infrastructure and the cross border cooperation was financed by the Community Initiative Interreg III A, whose objective was to support the integrated and sustainable development in the economic, social and cultural area on the Polish-German borderland...|$|E

40|$|The {{doctoral}} dissertation {{focuses on the}} principle partnership, implemen ted {{in the framework of}} the regional development policy In Poland. The p artnership, one of the key principles of the EU regional policy, is conc eptualised as a policy network, understood as stable patterns of interac tion among public and non-public actors forming around policies and prog rammes. Such partnership should lead to a high level of coordination and complementarily of the policy activities as well as to strengthening tr usts among political and social actors. The hypothesis formulated for th e research is that the policy networks do not exist or emerge with diffi culty in the Polish regional policy. The {{reason for this is that}} there i s limited public sphere and a weak predisposition for cooperation among the various social actors. That weakness of the public sphere is the mai n legacy of the socialist period and of the more remote history of Polan d. The research project has applied the qualitative methodology. It has use d an extensive empirical material collected in three purposefully select ed Polish regions (Silesia, Wielkopolska, Lubelskie). The research has produced several discoveries. Above all, it was reveale d that policy networks have been established at all stages of the policy process, from formulation to implementation. At the stage of formulatio n (the writing of the regional development strategies), the regions inve stigated were equipped with a large scope of liberty as fro the design o f their regional institutional systems. This produced a great variety of partnerships in the regions. At the stage of policy implementatio n, the regions were obliged to adopt identical institutional solutions, established by the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Programme</b> of Regional Developm ent. Despite the fact that Regional Steering Committees, embodying the p rinciple of partnership, operated in each region, the competitive projec t selection procedures generated a strong rivalry and conflict in the pr ocess of regional policy implementation. The competitive project selecti on procedures seriously reduced the positive effects of the principle of partnership, in a manner similar in all three regions investigated. The prime conclusion of the of the research project is that the partners hip structures implemented in the Polish regional development policy hav e not thus far produced a high level of activity coordination, complemen tarity and synergy. Similarly, there are limited effects in terms of gro wing trust. The main reason for is to be seen in the competitive project selection procedures, which push social actors to self-interested behav iour. The research results also show that the historical legacy plays a role in the design and operations of the regional policy institutional s ystem in Poland. But is it only one factor, among others, such as the ac tors interests, territorial and socio-economic profiles, and systemic s olutions. Further research should focus on the modifications of the regional polic y system in the 2007 - 2013 period, specific subfield of the regional poli cy (ex. Local development, innovation policy), as well as the creation o f the civic society at the regional level the consolidation of the socia l capital.
