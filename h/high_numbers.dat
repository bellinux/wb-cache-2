5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in <b>high</b> <b>numbers,</b> certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature.

This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E

By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably <b>high</b> <b>numbers</b> of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E

5|$|Waxwings {{can be very}} tame in winter, {{entering}} {{towns and}} gardens in search of food, rowan berries being a particular favourite. They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit, but can still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Other hazards include predation by birds of prey, infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows. The Bohemian waxwing's <b>high</b> <b>numbers</b> and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|All four {{species have}} {{extensive}} ranges and large populations, {{and the increasing}} use of artificial nest sites has enabled range expansion. The rock martin often breeds in lowland and desert towns, the Eurasian crag martin's range is expanding in Austria, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and the dusky crag martin is spreading northeastwards into Guangxi, south into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed <b>high</b> <b>numbers</b> mean that none of the crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its <b>high</b> <b>numbers</b> and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E

5|$|Although this species' {{population}} {{now appears}} to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its <b>high</b> <b>numbers,</b> this petrel is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.|$|E
5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making <b>high</b> <b>numbers</b> of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E

In recent years, breed numbers have decreased, and estimates place the breed at somewhere between 2,300 and 1,000 in population in the 21st century.

5|$|In Birmingham, 60.4% of the {{population}} was aged between 16-74, compared to 66.7% in England as a whole.

Females represented 51.6% of {{the population}} whilst men represented 48.4%. The differences are most marked in the oldest age group reflecting greater female longevity, where more women were 70 or over. The bulge around the early-20s is due largely to students coming to the city's universities. Children around age ten are a relatively small group, reflecting the decline in birth rates {{around the turn of the}} century.

5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in <b>high</b> <b>numbers,</b> at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely <b>high</b> <b>numbers</b> (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E
