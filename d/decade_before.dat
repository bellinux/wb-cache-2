5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the vicinity of Apple River Fort, probably miners, likely arrived more than a <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> the fort's construction. The miners settled the site and built log cabins around and near the Kellogg's Trail, a route from Galena to Dixon's Ferry; they obtained fresh water from a nearby spring.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} of the {{invasion}} of the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi into the Brisbane Ranges National Park in Victoria in 1971 indicated that Epacris impressa was moderately susceptible to the pathogen. Inoculation of seedlings confirmed this. Fieldwork in the Brisbane Ranges National Park in 1985 showed that there was some evidence that E. impressa seedlings were able to recolonise areas that had been infested with P. cinnamomi a <b>decade</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a <b>decade,</b> <b>before</b> stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1361 of William de Cambuslang, Bishop of Dunblane, Walter {{was elected by}} the Dunblane cathedral chapter {{to be the new}} bishop. On his election, Walter possessed no benefices in the diocese, and had had none since giving up his Abernethy prebend a <b>decade</b> <b>before.</b> However, it was {{probably}} the diocese of his birth, and he had almost become archdeacon of the diocese in 1345.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, a <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> the tunnel was {{actually}} constructed, a rumor circulated {{that such a}} passageway already existed connecting the White House to the Treasury Building. According to one account, the rumor started as a joke among journalists covering the White House, but gained serious traction, with some accounts even suggesting that Ogden L. Mills was secretly accessing the White House via the purported passage to meet with President Herbert Hoover.|$|E

5|$|The embassy {{building}} was severely damaged by fire. It {{was more than}} a <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> the British and Iranian governments came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair the damage to the embassy in London and Iran would pay for repairs to the British embassy in Tehran, which had been damaged during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iranian diplomats began working from 16 Princes Gate again in December 1993.|$|E

Doug Naylor confirmed that the BBC decided not to renew the series as they preferred to work on other projects.

5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> the state could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, and extend US1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Born {{near the}} eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no {{education}} apart from the Bible and, through his interpretations of scripture, believed the Earth was flat. A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.|$|E
5|$|Condor served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of her career, first in German East Africa in the 1890s, followed by a stint in the South Seas Station in the Pacific Ocean in the 1900s. She was present in East Africa amid rising tensions with Britain during the Second Boer War in 1899, and frequently suppressed uprisings in Germany's Pacific island holdings in the <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> the outbreak of World War I. Badly worn out, she returned to Germany in March 1914 and was removed from service. In 1916, she was converted into a storage hulk for mines. After the end of World War I, she was discarded and broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Examples of Beonna's coins {{are known}} from two {{separate}} hoards, {{as well as}} from a number of individual finds. Until 1968, only five of his coins were known. Several more coins came to light over the next <b>decade,</b> <b>before</b> a hoard of sceattas and other coins were discovered in 1980 at Middle Harling, north-east of Thetford and close to the border between the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. In all, fifty-eight coins have been excavated from Middle Harling, fourteen were found at Burrow Hill (Suffolk) and thirty-five from other places in East Anglia and elsewhere. Over a hundred 'Beonnas' are now known: most of them have been acquired by the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Gustav Vasa, 16th-century King of Sweden. Nearly a <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> his death, he had {{expressed}} a {{wish to be}} buried in the cathedral. He is buried with his three wives, although only two are depicted on the sarcophagus designed by Willem Boy. The king and his wives are interred in what was once the Chapel of the Virgin Mary. The only remaining indication of the original intention of the chapel are the painted yellow stars against a blue background on its vaulted ceiling, symbols of Saint Mary in Catholic tradition.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, after Galveston {{was struck}} by a devastating hurricane, efforts to make Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated. The {{following}} year, the discovery of oil at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1-million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a <b>decade</b> <b>before.</b> African Americans formed {{a large part of the}} city's population, numbering 23,929 people, which was nearly one-third of the residents.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, trust {{companies}} were booming; in the <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> 1907, their assets had grown by 244%. During the same period, national bank assets grew by 97%, while state banks in New York increased by 82%. The {{leaders of the}} high-flying trusts were mainly prominent members of New York's financial and social circles. One {{of the most respected}} was Charles T. Barney, whose late father-in-law William Collins Whitney was a famous financier. Barney's Knickerbocker Trust Company was the third-largest trust in New York.|$|E
5|$|Pope was a {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy in 1842. He served in the Mexican-American War and had numerous assignments as a topographical engineer and surveyor in Florida, New Mexico, and Minnesota. He spent much of the last <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> the Civil War surveying possible southern routes for the proposed First Transcontinental Railroad. He was an early appointee as a Union brigadier general of volunteers and served initially under Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont. He achieved initial success against Brig. Gen. Sterling Price in Missouri, then led a successful campaign that captured Island No. 10 on the Mississippi River. This inspired the Lincoln administration to bring him to the Eastern Theater to lead the newly formed Army of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Roberto Guerro is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted: Golden Abyss voiced and motion-captured by actor JB Blanc. A <b>decade</b> <b>before</b> Golden Abyss, Roberto Guerro was the military dictator of Panama before being overthrown by a coup d'état. He escaped execution by the new regime and, accompanied by loyalists, formed a revolutionary army to hound government forces and eventually regain power. However, Guerro quickly realised that without {{a good source of}} funds he would be unable to compete with the military strength of a new government, so he indulged in abductions and drug running to build up the cash.|$|E
