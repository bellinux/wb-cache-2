We report our preliminary experience from clinical trials designed {{to evaluate the}} safety and feasibility of a novel, extracorporeal HIFU device {{for the treatment of}} liver and <b>kidney</b> <b>tumours</b> in a Western population. The extracorporeal, ultrasound-guided Model-JC Tumor Therapy System (HAIFU Technology Company, China) has been used to treat 30 patients according to four trial protocols. Patients with hepatic or renal tumours underwent a single therapeutic HIFU session under general anaesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging 12 days after treatment provided assessment of response. The patients were subdivided into those followed up with further imaging alone or those undergoing surgical resection of their tumours, which enabled both radiological and histological assessment. HIFU exposure resulted in discrete zones of ablation in 25 of 27 evaluable patients (93 %). Ablation of liver tumours was achieved more consistently than for <b>kidney</b> <b>tumours</b> (100 vs 67 %, assessed radiologically). The adverse event profile was favourable when compared to more invasive techniques. HIFU treatment of liver and <b>kidney</b> <b>tumours</b> in a Western population is both safe and feasible.

40|$|A {{benign tumour}} is a non - {{cancerous}} growth {{that does not}} spread (metastasize) {{to other parts of}} the body and is not usually life - threatening. Many researchers believe that most of the following types of <b>kidney</b> <b>tumours</b> are benign. However, others feel that some of these tumours have the potential to develop into renal cell carcinoma. There are no diagnostic tests that can confirm if a benign tumour has the potential to become cancerous. Benign tumours are sometimes found along with renal cell carcinoma when a removed kidney is examined by a pathologist. For these reasons, benign <b>kidney</b> <b>tumours</b> are treated like malignant tumours.

40|$|Haptoglobin is {{an acute}} phase protein {{known to be}} highly {{expressed}} in the liver. Recently, we showed increased local arterial haptoglobin expression after flow-induced arterial remodelling and found that haptoglobin is involved in cell migration and arterial restructuring probably through accumulation of a temporary gelatin matrix. Since cell migration and matrix turnover are important features in the pathology of arthritis and cancer, we hypothesized that haptoglobin is also locally expressed in arthritic and oncological tissues. In this study, we investigated local haptoglobin expression in arthritic rats (n = 12) using semi-quantitative PCR and Western blotting, and we studied haptoglobin mRNA localization in human <b>kidney</b> <b>tumours</b> (n = 3) using in situ hybridization. The arthritic rats demonstrated an increase of haptoglobin mRNA (2. 5 -fold, P < 0. 001) and protein (2. 6 -fold, P < 0. 001) in the arthritic Achilles tendon. Haptoglobin protein was also increased in the arthritic ankle (2. 6 -fold, P < 0. 001) {{but not in the}} non-arthritic knee. In human <b>kidney</b> <b>tumours,</b> tumour and stromal cells produced haptoglobin mRNA. This study shows that the liver protein haptoglobin is, in addition to the artery, also expressed in arthritic and oncological tissues that are recognized for enhanced cell migration and matrix turnover...|$|R

40|$|Summary. -Wistar rats {{were treated}} with a single dose of 30 mg/kg of DMN or with single doses of 100, 200 or 300 mg/kg of EMS. <b>Tumours</b> of the <b>kidney</b> {{developed}} in a few animals receiving EMS and in 33 %o of the male and 63 % of the female rats treated with DMN alone. In the animals receiving DMN and, 8 hours later, a single dose of 100, 200 or 300 mg/kg of EMS, an additive effect was observed in the induction of <b>kidney</b> <b>tumours.</b> This additive effect was more pronounced in female than in male rats.

40|$|Abstract. Laparoscopic {{ultrasound}} (US) {{is often}} used during partial nephrectomy surgeries to identify tumour boundaries within the kidney. However, visual identification is challenging as tumour appearance varies across patients and US images exhibit significant noise levels. To address these challenges, we present the first fully automatic method for detect-ing the presence of <b>kidney</b> <b>tumour</b> in free-hand laparoscopic ultrasound sequences in near real-time. Our novel approach predicts the probabil-ity that a frame contains tumourous tissue using random forests and encodes this probability combined with a regularization term within a graph. Using Dijkstra’s algorithm we find a globally optimal labelling (tumour vs. non-tumour) of each frame. We validate our method on a challenging clinical dataset composed of five patients, {{with a total of}} 2025 2 D ultrasound frames, and demonstrate the ability to detect the presence of <b>kidney</b> <b>tumour</b> with a sensitivity and specificity of 0. 774 and 0. 916, respectively. ...|$|E

Urinary calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentrations were repeatedly measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and assessed according to renal function parameters. Urinary concentrations of calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin increased significantly after ischaemia/reperfusion injury, whereas concentrations remained unchanged after nephron sparing surgery without ischaemia/reperfusion injury and after kidney donation. Calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels were significantly increased 2 and 8 hours, respectively, post-ischaemia. Both proteins reached maximal concentrations after 48 hours, followed by a subsequent persistent decrease. Maximal neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and calprotectin concentrations were 9 -fold and 69 -fold higher than their respective baseline values. The glomerular filtration rate was only transiently impaired at the first post-operative day after ischaemia/reperfusion injury (p = 0. 049).
