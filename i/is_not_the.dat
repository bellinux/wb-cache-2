5|$|Corals' {{many colors}} give it appeal for {{necklaces}} and other jewelry. Intensely red coral is prized as a gemstone. Sometimes called fire coral, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same as fire coral. Red coral {{is very rare}} because of overharvesting.|$|E
30|$|Some {{observers}} believe that practitioners overweight {{the importance of}} the novelty of venture ideas and underweight the value of effective execution.
