25|$|As World War <b>I</b> <b>approached,</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} was hotly discussed in Italy {{as to which}} side to be on. Officially, Italy was still in an alliance with Germany and Austria–Hungary. However, in the Tirol, {{an integral part of}} Austria which was mostly German-speaking, the southern part, the province of Trento, was exclusively Italian-speaking. The clergy of Bologna was not totally free from nationalistic fervor either. Therefore, in his capacity as Archbishop, on the outbreak of World War I, della Chiesa made a speech on the Church's position and duties, emphasizing the need for neutrality, promoting peace and the easing of suffering.|$|E
500|$|Playing {{the harp}} (clarsach) was {{especially}} popular with medieval Scots – {{half a century}} after Gerald's writing, King Alexander III kept a royal harpist at his court. Of the three medieval harps that survive, two come from Scotland (Perthshire), and one from Ireland. Singers also had a royal function. For instance, when the king of Scotland passed through the territory of Strathearn, it was the custom that he be greeted by seven female singers, who would sing to him. When Edward <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> borders of Strathearn {{in the summer of}} 1296, he was met by these seven women, [...] "who accompanied the King on the road between Gask and Ogilvie, singing to him, as was the custom in the time of the late Alexander kings of Scots".|$|E

500|$|Pyramid Head {{makes an}} {{appearance}} in the 2006 film adaptation of Silent Hill as [...] "Red Pyramid", and is portrayed by Roberto Campanella. In the film, the psyches of the female characters shaped the character's physical appearance. Gans claimed that replicating the character's head exactly and having the actor move while wearing {{it proved to be}} impractical; he noted that, despite the name, Pyramid Head actually wore [...] "a basin" [...] instead of a triangle-shaped head. Red Pyramid's sword and head were constructed out of lightweight material painted to appear heavy. For the role, Campanella wore a [...] "five-part prosthetic"; it took two-and-a-half to three hours to get him into costume and make-up. His boots had a hidden [...] sole which made him just under [...] tall. Patrick Tatopoulos, who worked on the make-up effects and monsters, enjoyed the project of designing the character. According to him, Red Pyramid serves {{as a symbol of the}} town's darkness and harbinger of its changed character. Gans considered the monsters of the film [...] "a mockery of human beings", and commented: [...] "The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> film, I knew that it was impossible to represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Open Christmas Letter was {{a public}} message for peace {{addressed}} [...] "To the Women of Germany and Austria", signed {{by a group of}} 101 British women suffragists at the end of 1914 as the first Christmas of World War <b>I</b> <b>approached.</b> <b>The</b> Open Christmas Letter was written in acknowledgment of the mounting horror of modern war and as a direct response to letters written to American feminist Carrie Chapman Catt, the president of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA), by a small group of German women's rights activists. Published in January 1915 in Jus Suffragii, the journal of the IWSA, the Open Christmas Letter was answered two months later by a group of 155 prominent German and Austrian women who were pacifists. The exchange of letters between women of nations at war helped promote the aims of peace, and helped prevent the fracturing of the unity which lay in the common goal they shared: suffrage for women.|$|E
2500|$|Gans {{described}} {{the concept of}} the town's connection to the child Alessa and the cult: [...] "It's a town of people trapped in dark dreams, and she inflicts onto the town what those people did to her body. That is, to me, the meaning of the darkness. The appearance of the town is corrupted in the way that her own flesh was wounded." [...] He furthers expands on Alessa's connection to the alternate reality seen in the film, saying that the alternate reality is [...] "in [...] head". [...] "It's interesting because the town itself mirrors this fractured psychology—different dimensions, different doubles of the same person." [...] In speaking about the creatures in Silent Hill, Gans said that [...] "these monsters are , with the poetic direction of the term: they are a little like the Japanese phantoms, i.e. residues of forgotten feelings as strong as hatred or [...]" [...] "The monsters in the game are not really monsters, but rather a mockery of human beings. The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> film, I knew {{that it was impossible to}} represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you." ...|$|E

2500|$|My next {{visit was}} to Pohick Church, in the {{vicinity}} of Mt. Vernon, the seat of General Washington. It was still raining when <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> house, and found no one there. The wide open doors invited me to enter, as they do invite, day and night through the year, not only the passing traveller, but every beast of the field and fowl of the air. These latter however seemed to have reverenced the house of God, since few marks of their pollution were to be seen throughout it. The interior of the house, having been well built, is still good. The chancel, Communion table and tables of the law [...] are still there and in good order. The roof only is decaying; and at the time I was there the rain was dropping on these sacred places and on other parts of the house. On the doors of the pews, in gilt letters, are still to be seen the names of the principal Families which once occupied them. How could I, while {{for at least an hour}} traversing those long aisles, ascending the lofty pulpit, entering the sacred chancel, forbear to ask, And is this the House of God which was built by the Washingtons, the Mc.Cartys, the Lewises, the Fairfaxes?-the house in which they used to worship the God of our fathers according to the venerable forms of the Episcopal Church, and some of whose names are still to be seen on the doors of those now deserted pews? Is this also destined to moulder piecemeal away, or, when some signal is given, to become the prey of spoilers, and to be carried hither and thither and applied to every purpose under heaven? ...|$|E
