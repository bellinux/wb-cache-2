5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Like the Council, {{from time}} to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior {{military}} officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members. Such {{was the case in the}} lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E

Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E
5|$|The woman wakes, sits up, {{looks at}} Sigurd, {{and the two}} {{converse}} in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a horn of mead to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen prayer in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named Sigrdr√≠fa and {{that she is a}} valkyrie.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the wig after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E

25|$|According to Shia Muslims, {{one of the}} {{lingering}} problems in estimating Shia population is that unless Shia form a significant minority in a Muslim country, the entire population is often listed as Sunni.

For example, the 1926 rise of the House of Saud in Arabia brought official discrimination against Shia.
