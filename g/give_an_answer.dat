5|$|A {{fighter pilot}} based at Andrews Air Force Base, Billy Hutchison, claims that {{while in the}} air he spotted Flight 93 on his scope and planned to first fire his {{training}} rounds into the engine and cockpit, and then ram the airplane with his own jet. His account was published in Lynn Spencer's book Touching History. John Farmer, Senior Counsel to the 9/11 commission, pointed out that this account would have been impossible, as Hutchison's Air Andrews Squadron {{was not in the}} air until 10:38, almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 had crashed. When the 9/11 commission asked Hutchison why he gave this false claim he stormed {{out of the room and}} refused to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 census, 59.4% of the {{population}} of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were Muslim, while 3.7% of {{the population}} belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has been since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier in Gaelic and Roman times. This Celtic Church was gradually joined to the Catholic hierarchy following the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by StAugustine. The established church of England is the Church of England, which left communion with Rome in the 1530s when HenryVIII was unable to annul his divorce to the aunt of the king of Spain. The church regards itself as both Catholic and Protestant.|$|E
25|$|During a quiz bowl game, {{two or more}} {{teams of}} usually up to four or five players are read {{questions}} by a moderator. In most forms of quiz bowl, {{there are two basic}} types of questions: toss-ups and bonuses. Toss-ups are questions that any individual player can attempt to answer, and players are generally not allowed to confer with each other. Each player usually has a signaling device, also called a buzzer, to signal in {{at any time during the}} question to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> If the answer given is incorrect, then no other member of that team may <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> If a toss-up is successfully answered, the correctly answering team is given an opportunity to answer a bonus. Bonuses are usually worth a total of 30 points, and consist of three individual questions worth ten points each. Team members are generally permitted to confer with each other on these questions.|$|E

The champion stopped the clock by hitting a buzzer, which was a cue for the band to stop playing, and could either <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> or pass if he/she was not sure. Once all seven tunes were played, the champion went back to play the passed tunes if there were any.|$|E

25|$|Darin Barney {{has written}} about technology's impact on {{practices}} of citizenship and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions, including {{the question of what}} a good life consists in, nearly impossible, because they already <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.|$|E
25|$|In {{an online}} survey carried out among over 75,000 Yougov panel {{participants}} in Britain, 90.9% identified as heterosexual, 5.8% as gay, lesbian or bisexual, 1.3% {{opted not to}} <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> and 2.1% gave other reasons. The sample was recruited to closely match the overall British population on demographic variables such as age, gender, employment status and socio-economic classification. Ethnic minorities {{were less likely to}} identify as gay or lesbian than Whites (1.4% vs. 3.5%) but were more likely to prefer not to disclose their sexual orientation (7.5% vs 0.9%). More LGB than heterosexual respondents indicated they {{would be less likely to}} disclose their true sexual orientation in a face-to-face interview than in a self-administered, online survey.|$|E
25|$|According to {{classical}} rabbinical literature, {{in order for}} the Urim and Thummim to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> it was first necessary for the individual to stand facing the fully dressed high priest, and vocalise the question briefly and in a simple way, though it was not necessary for it to be loud enough for anyone else to hear it. The Talmudic rabbis argued that Urim and Thummim were words written on the sacred breastplate. Most of the Talmudic rabbis, and Josephus, following the belief that Urim meant lights, argued that divination by Urim and Thummim involved questions being answered by great rays of light shining out of certain jewels on the breastplate; each jewel was taken to represent different letters, and the sequence of lighting thus would spell out an answer (though there were 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and only 12 jewels on the breastplate); two Talmudic rabbis, however, argued that the jewels themselves moved {{in a way that made}} them stand out from the rest, or even moved themselves into groups to form words.|$|E

500|$|The treaty gave offence to {{the other}} Maratha leaders, who deemed that the system of {{subsidiary}} alliances with the British was an unwarranted interference into their affairs and fatal to the independent Maratha states. The Maratha leaders refused {{to submit to the}} Peshwa's authority and tensions were raised further when Holkar raided into Hyderabad in May, claiming that the Nizam of Hyderabad (a British ally) owed him money. Mornington consequently engaged the various Maratha chieftains in negotiations. Lieutenant Colonel John Collins was sent to Scindia's camp to discuss his objections and propose a defensive alliance. However, Scindia had formed a military alliance with the Rajah of Berar with a view to bringing the Maratha leaders into a coalition against the British, and had begun to mass his forces on the Nizam's border. Wellesley, who had been given control over the Company's military and political affairs in central India in June, demanded Scindia declare his intentions and withdraw his forces or face the prospect of war. After a protracted period of negotiations, Collins reported to Wellesley on 3 August that Scindia refused to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> and would not withdraw his troops. Wellesley's response was to declare war on Scindia and Berar [...] "in order to secure the interests of the British government and its allies".|$|E
500|$|At Fastlane, after The Authority (Big Show, Seth Rollins, and Kane) {{defeated}} Dolph Ziggler, Erick Rowan and Ryback, Orton {{returned and}} saved Ziggler, Rowan and Ryback from a post-match beatdown. He later gave an RKO to Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury (J Security) and Kane. The next night on Raw, The Authority {{tried to convince}} Orton {{to come back to}} the [...] "family", but Orton did not <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> straight away until he saw them backstage. During a tag team match later that night, Orton became frustrated and upset after Rollins tagged himself into the match. After the match, Orton made his way towards Rollins in the ring, but was briefly interrupted by Jamie Noble who got an RKO for his troubles. Then Orton, much to Rollins' surprise, picked him up and only patted him on the shoulder, leaving his alignment at the time in question. On the March 9 edition of Raw, Orton insulted several members of The Authority, only to pass it off as a joke. During a 2-on-1 handicap match in which he teamed with Seth Rollins against Roman Reigns, he abandoned Rollins, allowing Reigns to get the victory. Following this, Orton viciously beat Rollins, eventually executing an RKO through the broadcast table. On the March 16 episode of Raw, a match between the two was made official for WrestleMania 31 on the condition that Orton would meet Rollins later on that same night in the ring. The bout never took place as every member of The Authority made their way to the ring to attack Orton. Their attempt to avenge Rollins was thwarted by Sting, who aided Orton in holding them off. Orton defeated Rollins at the event. After the loss, Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. With Rollins as the new champion, Orton defeated Roman Reigns and Ryback in a triple threat match on the April 6 episode of Raw to become the #1 contender to face Rollins at Extreme Rules, but he failed to win the title from Rollins in a steel cage match that saw per the stipulation his RKO banned and Kane as the gatekeeper. At Payback, Orton failed to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship when he was defeated by Rollins in a fatal four-way match that also included Dean Ambrose and Reigns.|$|E

2500|$|These {{rules were}} {{roughly the same}} as those of Match Game PM with both contestants given three chances apiece to match each {{panelist}} once. The lone noticeable difference was in the tie-breaker. Four answers to a Super Match-like statement (example: [...] "_____, New Jersey") were secretly shown to the contestants (examples: [...] "Atlantic City", [...] "Hoboken", [...] "Newark", [...] "Trenton"). They each chose one by number. Then, {{as was the case in}} Match Game PM, the host polled the celebrities for verbal responses, and the first panelist to <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> selected by one of the contestants won the game for that contestant.
