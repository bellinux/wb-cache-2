40|$|Abstract: This paper {{compares the}} {{wastewater}} treatment technologies at Blantyre and Soche {{wastewater treatment works}} (WWTW) in Malawi with technologies of a similar case according to the ED-WAVE tool to determine if existing cases in the tool can be invoked and appropriately modified {{to arrive at a}} particular design alternative. The ED-WAVE tool is a shareware PC based package for imparting training on wastewater treatment technologies. The system consists of four modules viz. Reference Library, Process Builder, Case Study Manager, and Treatment Adviser. The paper also compares the reduction in the levels of BOD 5, COD, and TSS at the three respective treatment works. The study established that there is a similarity in the sequencing of treatment units of Municipal Case 6 in the ED-WAVE tool and the sequencing of treatment units at Blantyre and Soche WWTW, respectively. All the three plants incorporate screening, grit removal, aerobic biological treatment, and sedimentation. Soche and Blantyre WWTW use hand-raked inclined bar screens and constant velocity <b>grit</b> <b>channels,</b> where longitudinal flow velocity is hydraulically controlled. Rotary mechanically-raked bar screens and mechanically stirred grit chambers are used in the ED-WAVE tool. In addition, Municipal Case 6 uses oxidation ditches for aerobic biological treatment while Blantyre and Soche WWTW use trickling filters. BOD 5 removal efficiency at Soche WWTW at 95 % and 96 % for dry season and wet season, respectively, is comparable to the removal efficiency at Municipal Case 6 (95 %). The dry season BOD 5 removal efficiency at Blantyre WWTW at 87 % is slightly lower than the removal efficiency at Municipal Case 6. TSS removal efficiency at Soche WWTW is at 80 % in the we...|$|R

50|$|Far {{above the}} old town, at the Kartause's <b>grit</b> <b>channel,</b> a watergate directs {{water from the}} Dreisam into the canal. Before being moved to its present-day {{location}} in 1852, this water conduit was located below the Sandfangbrücke. Up {{until the beginning of}} the 21st century, this watergate had to be operated manually. It was as recently as 2009 that an automatic inlet construction was put into operation. The canal fills a mining tunnel {{at the bottom of the}} Schlossberg. This roughly 400 meter (around 1130 feet) long tunnel was partly bricked and partly sculpted into rock. Memorial stones for master builders, master-workmans and mayors of Freiburg can be found there.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{study was}} {{performed}} in Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, to determine the feasibility of using solar radiation to disinfect treated domestic wastewater (TDWW). The effluent from a residential development, after passing through a pre-treatment unit (bar screen and <b>grit</b> <b>channel)</b> and a septic tank, was used as supply. After the septic tank, the TDWW had mean values of 286 mg L− 1 COD, 54 mg L− 1 TSS, and 65 NTU turbidity. A square cement block reactor was constructed (located at 20 ° 45 14 S, 42 ° 52 53 W) and used to disinfect the reclaimed TDWW. Fixed depths of water (0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 15, and 0. 20 m) were tested at different exposure times from November 2004 to May 2005. Solar UV disinfection (SODIS) was effective in reducing mean concentration of indicator microorganisms, i. e., total coliform (TC) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), after 8 h of exposure to direct sunlight. Statistical analysis showed that the inactivation rates of E. coli did not significantly vary due to turbidity or dissolved oxygen. A model was developed to estimate the surviving E. coli population after SODIS from its initial population, depth of water treated, and solar energy received. The model indicated that, for a fluence accumulated of 32. 91 MJ m− 2, a 4 log reduction of E. coli population was achieved with a wastewater depth of 0. 05 m in the SODIS reactor...|$|E

50|$|Walker, Texas Ranger is an American action {{television}} series created by Leslie Greif and Paul Haggis. It {{was inspired by}} the film Lone Wolf McQuade, with both this series and that film starring Chuck Norris {{as a member of the}} Texas Ranger Division. The show aired on CBS in the spring of 1993, with the first season consisting of three pilot episodes. Eight full seasons followed with new episodes airing from September 25, 1993, to May 19, 2001, and reruns continuing on CBS until July 28, 2001. It has been broadcast in over 100 countries and has since spawned a 2005 made-for-television movie entitled Trial By Fire. The movie ended on a cliffhanger, which was never resolved. DVD sets of all seasons have been released (with the three pilots packaged with the first regular season). At various times since 1997, reruns of the show have aired, in syndication, on the USA Network and Action in Canada. Reruns can currently be seen on CBS Action, WGN America, INSP and <b>Grit</b> and <b>Channel</b> 1, being part of Network 10 in Australia.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} has been to determine the environments of deposition of the Grindslow Shales and Kinderscout Grit in an area north of the Derbyshire Dome. These units overly the Mam Tor Sandstones and Shale Grit, which are thought to be turbidites showing increasing proximity to scource. The Grindslow Shales had been interpreted as the slope down which the turbidity currents were generated. Little was known of the depositional environment of the Kinderscout Grit, though shallow water conditions had been suggested. The sequence, {{from the base of the}} Mam Tor Sandstones to the top of the Kinderscout Grit, falls within the zone R 1 c of the Namurian. The outcrops of the Kinderscout Plateau, Derwentdale and Longendale have been mapped and numerous sections measured. In all, 17 facies have been recognised, described and interpreted in hydrodynamic terms on the basis of their internal evidence. Three silts tone facies and one of silty sandstone are thought to be largely deposited from suspension, while fine sandstone, showing ripples and cross-lamination, is interpreted as showing lower flow regime conditions. Parallel laminated fine sandstone is interpreted as an upper flow regime deposit. Facies 8, Massive Bedded Coarse Sandstone, is not, in the first instance, interpretable in hydrodynamic terms. Facies 9, Parallel Bedded Coarse Sandstone, is interpreted as an upper flow regime deposit, while Facies 10, Medium Scale Cross-Bedded Coarse Sandstone is attributed to the lower flow regime along with Facies 11, Medium Scale Cross-Bedded Fine Sandstone. Facies 12, Large Scale Cross-Bedding, consists of single tabular sets of cross-bedding up to 40 m. thick, mainly of very coarse sandstone. These are ascribed to the advance of delta-like sedimentation units into bodies of standing water. Other facies, of minor importance,are Sharp-Based Clean Sandstone Beds, Orthoconglomerates, Seat Earths and Coals, Mudstone Melange and Turbidite-like Sandstones. Three types of trace fossil have been recognised, though it is concluded that they are probably of little environmental significance. Five facies associations are recognised, in which facies succeed one another with variable predictability. The Major Channel Association involves Facies 8, 9 and 10, Massive, Parallel and Cross-Bedded Coarse Sandstones, resting in channels up to 40 m. deep. Other details of channel geometry are not clear, though widths of 300 - 400 m. have been calculated. There is a preferred upwards facies sequence within the channels of Erosion Surface → Facies 8 → Facies 9 → Pacies 10. From hydrodynamic considerations of the sequence, it is suggested that the Facies 8 Massive Bedded Sandstone was deposited by currents flowing in the upper part of the upper flow regime, the whole channel sequence representing a waning flow. The Large Scale Cross-Bedding Association involves Facies 12 and 10, the medium scale cross-bedded sandstone being separated from the underlying Large Scale set by an erosion surface. It is suggested that the Association represents delta cones which advanced into bodies of standing water, subsequent to sudden deepening. The Fluviatile Channel Association is a fining upwards sandstone sequence with a horizontal erosion surface at its base. Facies 10, Medium Scale Cross-Decided Coarse Sandstone forms the bulk of the association, though thin beds of Orthoconglomerate and mudflake conglomerate may occur above the erosion surface. In the top of the association, the cross- bedded sandstone passes into parallel or ripple laminated fine sandstone and sometimes into seat earths and coals. The association is interpreted as the result of the lateral migration of a fluviatile channel, probably of the meandering type. The Slope Association, which has limited stratigraphical position, is a broadly coarsening upwards silts tone and silty sandstone sequence. Thin turbidites occur in the base and burrows become abundant towards the top. It has occasional large channels, filled mainly with turbidites. The association is interpreted as the prograding slope of a coastline receiving abundant sediment supply. The Interdistributary Complex Association is a random sequence of predominantly fine grained facies, showing a variety of flow conditions. It is interpreted as forming in shallow water conditions, probably in interdistributary areas of a delta top. An analysis of the relationships of the facies associations throughout the area gives the following generalised sequence:- 'Gracile' Marine Band. Fluviatile Channel Association Slope or Interdistributary Complex Upper Kinderscout Grit Butterley Marine Band Fluviatile Channels and Interdistributary Complex Association Large Scale Cross-Bedding Lower Kinderscout <b>Grit</b> Major <b>Channels</b> Interdistributary Complex Association Grindslow Shales Slope Association From a consideration of this sequence, it is concluded that the Grindslow Shales represent the main southwards advance of the delta slope and delta top environments across the area. The major channels which erode into the Interdistributary Complex Association sediments of the top of the Grindslow Shales were non-migrating distributaries which underwent frequent diversion and cut-off. They had high flow regime currents and were possibly associated with a period of eustatically falling sea level. A subsequent eustatic rise led to the ponding up of sediment on the delta, top with the formation of delta cones. Above the delta cones, meandering river channels and interdistributary areas were the main features of the palaeogeography. The Butterley Marine Band and its overlying unit of Slope Association suggest a further eustatic rise of sea level. The Upper Kinderscout Grit is thought to be the deposit of laterally migrating rivers. Comparison with the succession further north gives additional evidence of eustatic changes of sea level and suggests ways in which the palaeogeography might have responded to these. It is suggested that the turbidity currents in the basin possibly originated as high flow regime traction currents in the major channels on the delta top, at times of flood. </p...|$|R
40|$|There {{are four}} major parts of {{researches}} in this study, as following: (I) The overall grit chambers study: We investigated the best measuring parameters of water quality {{in practice and}} theory, water quality of effluent, the treatment efficiency, field flow pattern, sludge volumes, etc. by sampling, lab experiment, statistical analysis, removal & theoretical calculations. (II) The settling channel study: We studied the field measurements, field flow data, field water quality data, detention time and removal efficiency, the contents and removal differences of organic and inorganic solids, etc [...] In addition, the on-site operation and management as well as effects from upstream power-station operation were explored. Also, (III) The design parameters study: We searched the related literatures & reports, the original design maps & plans, and on-site data to calculate, analyze and compare the design parameters including (A) efficiency criteria (detention time, settling velocity, mean velocity, design length, theoretical removal efficiency, etc.), (B) capacity criteria (water flow volume and sediment storage), as well as (C) inlet and outlet of subsidiary design. Finally, (IV) The mathematical simulation model study: The numerical model, SSIIM, was adopted and built with the original design data. After the boundary conditions were established by on-site design and field measuring data, this model was used not only to simulate the <b>grit</b> chamber, settling <b>channel,</b> particles motion routes, and overflow wall flow pattern, but also to verify the conclusion of result findings. And, these four part studies results will be summarized as following: (I) Overall grit chambers study: linear regression analysis of suspended solids against turbidity, yielded values of R 2  0. 991. The regression analysis ANOVA showed a P-value ( 5. 04  10  24) was smaller than  5 %, this result indicated both turbidity and suspended solids were strongly correlated. The regression equation, y 1. 2486 x 125. 32, presented that turbidity can be practically measured instead of suspended solids, i. e., its possible to proceed on-line monitoring with turbidity measurement for quick data. The removals of grit chamber for turbidity and suspended solids were 69. 12 ~ 91. 15 % (mean 81. 18 %) and 74. 11 ~ 91. 32 % (mean 83. 09 %), respectively. Simultaneously, sedimentation weir only removed turbidity 5. 56 ~ 8. 32 % (mean 6. 94 %) and suspended solids, 0. 62 ~ 8. 44 % (mean 4. 53 %). The results also showed that the removal efficiency {{in the back of}} overflow wall were obviously lower than that in the front of overflow wall. This phenomenon is due to turbulent flow occurred from overflow wall. Apparently, to improve the outlet design {{is the only way to}} ensure the function of grit chamber. According to Taiwan water body classification of water quality, the water quality of the grit chamber effluent is the fifth category of water body, which only fits the use of environmental conservation. If we hope the grit chamber effluent to be used as irrigable or industrial water sources, the water quality of outlet must be promoted to the fourth category of water body. If the effluent want to be used as public water supply, the water quality must at least meet the requirements of third category of water body. This means, that the effluent of grit chamber needs to be further treated. (II) Settling channel study: The measurement of flow rates for every settling channel showed that the detention time was similar, and surface flow rates increased toward left side. In the treatment efficiency, the removals of turbidity and suspended solids were 46. 72 ~ 80. 33 % (mean 66. 92 %) and 61. 88 ~ 81. 94 % (mean 73. 94 %), respectively. In order to understand the situations of removing organic and inorganic solids from grit chamber, the t-test analysis indicated t 1. 982 > critical value  1. 691, and P-value (one way)  0. 028 臨界值= 1. 691 ，單尾之P值= 0. 028 < 0. 05 ，結果證明二者平均值有所差異，此為紊流影響水體中部份有機及無機固體分離，使有機無機固體之去除率隨比重之不同而不相同。經比較前次正常情形下之試驗結果，本次上游電廠排砂後有上層液濁度之差異，及沉砂效果之差異。並經再確認沉砂池處理效能之結論後發現，各項結果皆相符。 沉砂池設計參數分析結果，經比較停留時間、沉降速度、平均流速及設計長度等沉砂池效能設計參數後發現，本研究沉砂池之各項設計參數符合傳統沉砂池之設計參數，介於傳統沉砂池及沉澱池之間，具備去除粒徑 0. 2 mm以上泥砂之能力。由可沉降固體之試驗結果推估沉砂池現況之理論淤積量為淤積潛能為 238810 CMD，淤積效能為 174960 CMD，淤積現況為 10022 CMD，並推得現況之清淤頻率為北岸沉砂池 0. 57 次/天，南岸沉砂池 7. 65 次/天，比較相關文獻資料後發現，研究地點沉砂池入口設計擴散角 36 。大於日本的經驗 20 。，造成入流流速及泥砂濃度分配不均。經分析出口設計參數後發現，溢流牆造成紊流將淤砂帶出池外。 數值模擬結果，由沉砂池流速分佈之模擬結果與實測結果相符合，證明進水道彎折二次造成沉砂池內流速有偏左遞增之趨勢。由沉砂溝之模擬結果發現，粒徑 2 mm之去除率無論有無設置溢流牆，其去除率皆可達 100 %，而 0. 2 mm之去除率亦很接近 100 %，其受到溢流牆之影響不甚顯著，而粒徑 0. 1 及 0. 05 mm之去除率則明顯的受到溢流牆之影響而降低去除率，另由溢流牆之模擬結果，發現溢流牆具降低去除率之效應，且顆粒越小影響越大。彎道數值模擬結果，對不同粒徑之顆粒有不同的紊動作用。以SSIIM數值模式求得沉砂池去除率之數值解，經與實測值經F檢定分析結果（α= 5 %），F= 1. 945 0. 05 ，結果無法證明二者變異數有所不同，因此以SSIIM數值模式來模擬之去除率效果良好。＊目 錄 謝誌 I 摘要 II ABSTRACT V 目錄 IX 圖目錄 XIII 表目錄 XVI 第 1 章 前言 1 第 2 章 前人研究與文獻回顧 3 2 -
