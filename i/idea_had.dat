5|$|Although {{the money}} was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally {{completed}} in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. The original <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached {{that it would be}} placed in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's preferred location. It was installed in October 1860, though it was not until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas-reliefs {{on either side of the}} pedestal.|$|E

5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. Education reform was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked his {{officers}} whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the backroads to attack Princeton. Although the <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton was indeed possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, they agreed that the best option was to attack Princeton.|$|E

5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur {{astronomer}} the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.|$|E
5|$|In a troop {{movement}} that took all {{night on a}} makeshift raft, the Texian army crossed Buffalo Bayou at Lynchburg April 19 with 930 soldiers, leaving behind 255 others as guards or for reasons of illness. The <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> been floated of leaving the Twin Sisters behind as protection, but Neill was adamant that the cannons be taken into the battle. In an April 20 skirmish {{the day before the}} main battle Neill was severely wounded, and George Hockley took command of the heavy artillery. Estimates of the Mexican army troop strength {{on the day of the}} main battle range from 1,250 to 1,500.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter's unpopularity led to {{the demise}} of many of his proposals, {{regardless}} of their merits.

The hostile legislature refused the plan and overrode Slaughter's vetoes of bills that allowed individual schools to be supported by lotteries. Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including the creation of a state library. These measures were also rejected.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the {{original}} draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer was to learn {{that he was a}} Native American, and would try to exploit it to not have to pay taxes. The <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> been going well for a few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes. When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Hergé {{sent his}} publisher, Casterman, {{the cover of}} his {{completed}} nineteenth Tintin adventure, The Red Sea Sharks, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his next story. Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, Tintin in America, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé {{came to believe that}} retracing old ground would be a step backwards. Another <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> Tintin striving to prove that Haddock's butler Nestor was framed for a crime committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, but kept the idea of an adventure with no guns or violence—the only Tintin story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus to save them from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, but kept the setting in a snowy environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the empty cenotaph, another new form of memorial, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, used the idea of burying one of the unidentified bodies from the war as a symbolic memorial {{to all of the}} lost soldiers. This <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> begun to emerge {{towards the end of the}} war, and was actively promoted by some British veterans' groups in 1919. Initially, however, it failed to gain traction with the government because of the success of the Whitehall Cenotaph, and a second memorial was felt to be unnecessary. Finally, in 1920, following lobbying by British cleric David Railton, Britain and France both decided to create a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, choosing an unknown body and creating a special memorial around it; the tombs were inaugurated on Armistice Day. The choice of location for the French tomb proved controversial, however, and it was not finalised until the following year, when the body was laid to rest under the Arc de Triumph. The concept proved popular, and encouraged similar memorials in other countries.|$|E

5|$|Many colonists, however, had {{developed}} a different conception of the empire. The colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament {{had no right to}} levy taxes upon them. This tax dispute {{was part of a larger}} divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. The orthodox British view, dating from the Glorious Revolution of 1688, was that Parliament was the supreme authority throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional. In the colonies, however, the <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> developed that the British Constitution recognized certain fundamental rights that no government could violate, not even Parliament. After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in the colonies at all. Anticipating the arrangement of the British Commonwealth, by 1774 American writers such as Samuel Adams, James Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|In 1771, {{the people}} of Chester, fearing that the {{construction}} of the Trent and Mersey Canal would divert trade away from their city to Liverpool, announced in the Press that they would be applying to build a canal between Middlewich, on the Trent and Mersey, and Chester. The city was at the time served by the River Dee, and the River Dee Company had recently spent £80,000 on improvements to the river, but they realised that without a connection to the growing canal network, there was little future for the river or the Port of Chester. The <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> first been raised three years earlier, when merchants suggested a line from the Trent and Mersey to near Runcorn. There were no objections from the Corporation of Liverpool, but the canal company was non-committal. By 1770, the plans were a little clearer, with a main line from Chester to Middlewich and a branch to Nantwich. Although the Corporation of Chester subscribed £100 towards the scheme, and the Societies and Clubs of Chester put up another £2,000, there was little enthusiasm for it. Neither the Weaver Navigation nor the Trent and Mersey were supportive, as both might have lost some trade if the canal were built, and when the Duke of Bridgewater was approached for support, he replied that provided the canal did not physically link with the Trent and Mersey at Middlewich, he would not oppose the plans. Despite attempts at flattery, the Duke would not alter his position, and so the Company promoting the bill in parliament began with a serious disadvantage.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would come forward to oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues, that he had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year. He disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an <b>idea</b> <b>had</b> merit for further consideration.|$|E
