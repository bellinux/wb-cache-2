25|$|In {{order for}} the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, {{splitting}} the seed coat. However, {{the nature of the}} seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination. The rate of <b>imbibition</b> is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of different vigor tests to assess S. commersoniana seeds physiological quality during storage. Therefore, seeds were stored in cloth bags, plastic bags and glass containers for 531 days, both at room temperature and in a cold chamber. Periodically samples were taken and the following tests were conducted: standard germination, germination speed index, first count after germination, seedlings fresh and dry matter, electrical conductivity (<b>imbibitions</b> for 2 and 24 hours) and accelerated aging, in order to monitoring the seeds physiologic quality. Data were submitted to polynomial regression analysis, {{for each of the}} combination of packaging/storage condition. The results obtained led to the following considerations: a) the speed germination index and the accelerated aging test permitted a good evaluation of the seed-lots quality; b) the first count of germination did not allow any prediction about seed lots vigor; c) seedling fresh and dry matter did not discriminate among seed lots; d) electrical conductivity test after 2 h <b>imbibitions</b> was not adequate to evaluate the seed lots vigor and e) the electric conductivity test with 24 h <b>imbibitions</b> was more adequate to differentiate among seed lots, but with little efficiency to discriminate among seed lots with intermediate vigor or with low quality differences...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{attributes}} that confer seed quality can largely be considered {{dependent on the}} coat. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the quality and hydration pattern of the seeds of four contrasting soybean genotypes for the coats characteristics; BMX Potência RR and CD 202 with yellow coats and IAC and TP with black coats. The first stage of the study consisted of seed multiplication in the 2012 / 2013 harvest. After storage for five months at a temperature of 17 ºC and a relative humidity of 50 %, the seeds were subjected to the following tests: germination, first count and seedling height, with and without immersion of the seeds, emergence in soil, emergence speed and germination index; electrical conductivity; thousand weight seeds and <b>imbibitions</b> of seeds. The design was completely randomized, with five replicates. The data was subjected to variance analysis and the means compared using the Tukey test at a 5 % level of probability. Regression analysis was used for the seeds <b>imbibitions</b> test. Genotypes with black coats (especially IAC) presented better physiological quality in relation to genotypes with yellow coats. The latter had greater thousand weight seeds. BMX Potência RR presented greater hydration than the other genotypes in the first hours of <b>imbibitions</b> and TP, the least. Genotypes with black coats emitted a radicle faster than the yellow coats genotypes...|$|R

2500|$|Water [...] is {{required}} for germination. Mature seeds are often extremely dry and need to take in significant amounts of water, relative to the dry weight of the seed, before cellular metabolism and growth can resume. Most seeds need enough water to moisten the seeds {{but not enough to}} soak them. [...] The uptake of water by seeds is called <b>imbibition,</b> which leads to the swelling and the breaking of the seed coat. When seeds are formed, most plants store a food reserve with the seed, such as starch, proteins, or oils. This food reserve provides nourishment to the growing embryo. When the seed imbibes water, hydrolytic enzymes are activated which break down these stored food resources into metabolically useful chemicals. [...] After the seedling emerges from the seed coat and starts growing roots and leaves, the seedling's food reserves are typically exhausted; at this point photosynthesis provides the energy needed for continued growth and the seedling now requires a continuous supply of water, nutrients, and light.|$|E

30|$|Surfactants are {{considered}} as good enhanced oil recovery agents since 1970 s {{because it can}} significantly lower the interfacial tensions and alter wetting properties (Healy and Reed 1974; Cayias et al. 1976). Displacement by surfactant solutions {{is one of the}} important tertiary recovery processes by chemical solutions. The addition of surfactant decreases the interfacial tension between crude oil and formation water, lowers the capillary forces, facilitates oil mobilization, and enhances oil recovery. The surfactant is dissolved in either water or oil to form microemulsion which in turn forms an oil bank (Bera et al. 2011). The formation of oil bank and subsequent maintenance of sweep efficiency and pressure gradient by injection of polymer and chase water increase the oil recovery significantly (Hill et al. 1973). The idea of injecting surfactant solution to improve <b>imbibitions</b> recovery was proposed for fractured reservoirs (Michels et al. 1996) and carbonaceous oil fields in the United States (Flumerfelt et al. 1993). The effects of capillary <b>imbibitions</b> and lowering of IFT using surfactant slug have been reported by many researchers (Keijzer and De Vries 1990).|$|R

The grouting materials that we considered are of porous nature and, if used in the presence of groundwater, have different levels of <b>imbibitions.</b> It is important to know the thermal behaviour of these materials at different water content. A first set of measurements was performed on a not-tinted material at room temperature; then the samples were led to saturation conditions by contact capillary <b>imbibitions</b> with a cotton wool layer moistened in water. The determination of thermal conductivity in these test conditions appears to be critical compared to the measurements on non-tinted sample.

Mechanical scarification provided rapid and highest <b>imbibitions,</b> germination percentage and seedling establishment, and also the highest values of early seedling growth characteristics. Embryos of L. varius could survive after boiling the seeds for 4, 6, 8 and 10 minutes and final germination percentages were 68. 3 %, 80. 0 %, 71. 7 % and 63. 3 %, respectively. Boiling treatments also improved some other germination and early seedling growth characteristics compared with untreated seeds, {{but it was not}} completely able to overcome the seed coat impermeability in any durations of boiling time.
