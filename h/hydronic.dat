5|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{taken into}} account when designing the building include the polycarbonate cladding, used for natural light and passive heating; and a <b>hydronic</b> heating and cooling system using the constant temperature of the sea water below the pontoon. As a floating structure, {{it will not be}} affected by rises in the sea level. The gabled roof design is intended to fit in with the other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which themselves are based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E
25|$|A truck trailer {{refrigerator}} {{operating from}} the waste {{heat of a}} tractor's diesel exhaust was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a <b>hydronic</b> ammonia gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.|$|E
25|$|One {{variation}} is using tubes filled with circulating hot water as heat source for warming the floor. The heating principle remains the same. Both old style electric and warm water (<b>hydronic)</b> underfloor heating systems {{embedded in the}} floor construction are slow and cannot respond to external weather changes or internal demand/lifestyle requirements.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene {{is used in}} the {{manufacturing}} piping systems; both ones concerned with high-purity and ones designed for strength and rigidity (e.g. those intended for use in potable plumbing, <b>hydronic</b> heating and cooling, and reclaimed water). This material is often chosen for its resistance to corrosion and chemical leaching, its resilience against most forms of physical damage, including impact and freezing, its environmental benefits, and its ability to be joined by heat fusion rather than gluing.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{started in}} April 2014 at Incat, a ferry {{manufacturer}} based at Prince of Wales Bay. [...] In November 2014 the partially completed structure, then weighing , was towed [...] {{down the river}} to be positioned at its final location. It is anchored to the sea-bed by cables. The structure is [...] long by [...] wide and is four levels tall. One concrete basement level sits [...] below the water's surface and includes services such as kitchen facilities, storage, toilets and <b>hydronic</b> heating and cooling systems. [...] The three above-water levels are enclosed in a semi-translucent polycarbonate cladding injected with nanogel, creating a diaphanous skin and keeping the structure as light as possible. [...] This cladding contains LED lights, which gives the pier a glowing effect in the evening.|$|E
2500|$|In all systems, a small {{supplementary}} heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts {{for a small}} reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small heat pump, which also provides air conditioning, or a central <b>hydronic</b> (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the water heater. [...] Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.|$|E
2500|$|The Terry Thomas was {{originally}} modeled {{to reduce its}} energy use by 30% to 40% {{from that of a}} typical office building with conventional air conditioning. [...] Eliminating a traditional HVAC system contributes significantly to energy savings. As part of this energy reduction, the designers increased thermal insulation. Heating is provided by highly efficient <b>hydronic</b> radiators placed along exterior walls; this allows for individual temperature control. Based upon the Department of Energy’s National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency metric, The Terry Thomas consumes 56% less energy than a typical class A office building.|$|E
2500|$|Line voltage {{thermostats}} {{are most}} commonly used for electric space heaters such as a baseboard heater or a direct-wired electric furnace. [...] If a line voltage thermostat is used, system power (in the United States, 120 or 240 volts) is directly switched by the thermostat. With switching current often exceeding 40 amperes, using a low voltage thermostat on a line voltage circuit will result {{at least in the}} failure of the thermostat and possibly a fire. [...] Line voltage thermostats are sometimes used in other applications, such as the control of fan-coil (fan powered from line voltage blowing through a coil of tubing which is either heated or cooled by a larger system) [...] units in large systems using centralized boilers and chillers, or to control circulation pumps in <b>hydronic</b> heating applications.|$|E

50|$|In the 20th century, mass-produced {{plumbing}} pipes {{were made}} from galvanized steel. As users experienced problems with the internal build-up of rust, which reduced water volume, these were replaced by copper tubing in the late 1960s. Plastic pipes with fittings using glue were used as well in later decades. Initially PEX tubing {{was the most popular}} way to transport water in <b>hydronic</b> radiant heating systems, and it was used first in <b>hydronic</b> systems from the 1960s onwards. <b>Hydronic</b> systems circulate water from a boiler or heater to places in the house needing heat, such as baseboard heaters or radiators. PEX is suitable for recirculating hot water.|$|E
50|$|Radiant cooling {{systems are}} usually <b>hydronic,</b> cooling using {{circulating}} water running in pipes in thermal {{contact with the}} surface. Typically the circulating water only needs to be 2-4 °C below the desired indoor air temperature. Once having been absorbed by the actively cooled surface, heat is removed by water flowing through a <b>hydronic</b> circuit, replacing the warmed water with cooler water.|$|E
