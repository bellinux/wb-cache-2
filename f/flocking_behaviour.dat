40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a novel {{approach}} to swarm control of small fixed-wing UAVs, which combines only two <b>flocking</b> <b>behaviours</b> with a leadership feature. In the presented approach, two fundamental rules of Reynolds flocking are applied, i. e., cohesion and repulsion, as the base of a decentralized control of self-organization of the flock. These rules are combined with a leadership feature, which is responsible for a global behaviour of guidance, as in the case of animals. Such a bio-inspired combination allows the achievement of a coherent collective flight of a flock of fixed-wing UAVs without applying formal behaviours of migration and alignment. This highly simplifies an implementation of the algorithm. The presented results include both numerical simulations and experimental flights, which validate the hardware implementation of the approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this {{research}} {{we tried to}} apply open-ended evolution to breed controllers for artificial organism which {{would be able to}} manifest <b>flocking</b> <b>behaviours.</b> In comparison to the previous work in this area the artificial world created in our system is characterized by significant diversity of organisms. Animals were equipped with double and dynamic sight, which were suggested by other authors in their works. In experiments, many different behaviours were observed, which were very similar to those in nature, for instance: the escape of herbivore from predators, making herbivores route towards plants or a pursuit of predators after herbivores. Another interesting behaviour was grouping of predators around plants, where the probability of meeting herbivore is greater than in other places. The most advanced behaviour was creation of flocks, which was the goal of experiments. The observed motion of animals looked natural. However, to the full success it was necessary to apply steered evolution. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} aspects broiler farmers {{consider}} in relation to performance and status of their flock are the activity and distribution patterns that chickens show during each day. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies allow to monitor the <b>flock</b> <b>behaviour</b> in a continuous and automated way in the house. The {{aim of this study}} is to show that by monitoring the activity and distribution of the flock, information on habits and activity patterns of broilers can be retrieved. Four top view cameras per broiler house were used in 5 growing cycles in a commercial broiler house in The Netherlands. The cameras are able to record images continuously during the light periods of every cycle and these images are translated into activity and distribution indexes per minute. Monitoring of activity and distribution indexes through successive light periods allows to evaluate how behavioral patterns of the flock, such as feeding, drinking or resting, evolve along the cycle. Performing these analyses for different cycles, regular activity patterns for each behaviour can be defined and alerts can be generated in case of deviation. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{movement}} of building façade cladding is usually {{used to control}} buildings’ exposure to environmental conditions such as direct sunlight, noise and wind. Until recently, technology and cost constraints allowed for only limited types of façade cladding movement. One of the main restrictions stemmed from the limitations that architects face in designing and controlling movement scenarios in which each façade or cladding element moves autonomously. The introduction of parametric design tools for architectural design, combined {{with the advent of}} inexpensive sensor/actuator microcontrollers, made it possible to explore ways to overcome this limitation. Autonomous {{movement of}} building façade cladding elements has several potential benefits. One of the main feasible advantages of this type of movement is that it can deal with changing external and interior local conditions {{in different parts of the}} façade by individually controlled movement, by preceding reaction or <b>flock</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Thus, it can increase significantly the performance of the building façade. This paper presents new results from an ongoing research study that is examining the potential of autonomous movement of façade cladding elements. It compares the environmental performance of centrally controlled kinetic façade elements and a prototypic façade made of autonomously controlled elements...|$|R
40|$|The 'many-wrongs principle' {{predicts that}} animal group {{cohesion}} can cause groups to navigate more accurately than singletons. Recent theoretical work using individual-based simulations and several empirical studies of bird <b>flock</b> <b>behaviour</b> support this principle. However, for real animal groups {{it remains unclear}} what key factors are involved and whether group cohesion alone can act to produce the effect. We tested model predictions using human participants in a large circular arena. They were tested alone and in groups of two, three, six and 10, in three trials. For each trial, individuals were instructed to stay together and approach a preset but unmarked target on the arena perimeter. The target instruction included a degree of directional uncertainty of 22. 5 °, 67. 5 ° or 112. 5 °. Individual directional uncertainty was equal for each group member within a trial, but differed between trials. As expected, we found that groups comprising individuals with lower directional uncertainty navigated more accurately. Group navigational accuracy increased with group size but only between singletons and groups of 10 and only when individuals had a high directional uncertainty of 112. 5 °. This study provides evidence in human groups that group cohesion can increase navigational accuracy but that this effect is restricted to larger group sizes and when individual directional uncertainty is high. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R

Dispersal throughout New Zealand and the study area are mapped. The population of the species within New Zealand appears {{to be derived from}} a northern Australian population. Behaviour, both in the flocks and territories, was studied and compared with other vanelline plovers and with the Australian population of spur-winged plovers. A previously undescribed display flight was observed similar to the song flight of the lapwing (Vanellus vanellus); differences were ascribed to differences in the morphology and ecology of the two species. The population density in the study area is low and no contact fighting was observed. Breeding success was 34. 5 %, and the average number of chicks fledged by each successful pair was 1. 6 in 1979, and 1. 7 in 1980. The breeding season extended from June to January. Mean clutch size was 3. 6, mode 4. Rapid evolution of egg size may have occurred; egg size was significantly smaller than in Southland (P < 0. 001). Territoriality, nesting, and <b>flock</b> <b>behaviour</b> were correlated with environmental factors, chiefly the level of the water table. Territories were significantly larger (P < 0. 01) than in Australia (4. 3 Ha. vs 2. 4 Ha.). Thirty eight chicks were captured and banded. In 1980 chick growth was recorded.

40|$|Implementations of multi-UAV {{systems can}} be divided mainly into two {{different}} approaches, centralised system that synchronises positions of each vehicle by a ground station and an autonomous system based on decentralised control, which offers more flexibility and independence. Decentralisation of multi-UAV control entails the need for information sharing between all vehicles, what in some cases could be problematic due to {{a significant amount of}} data to be sent over the wireless network. To improve the reliability and the throughput of information sharing inside the formation of UAVs, this paper proposes an approach that combines virtual structure with a leader and two <b>flocking</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Each UAV has assigned different virtual migration point referenced to the leader's position which is simultaneously the origin of a formation reference frame. All migration points create together a virtual rigid structure. Each vehicle uses local behaviours of cohesion and repulsion respectively, to track its own assigned point in the structure and to avoid a collision with the previous UAV in the structure. To calculate parameters of local behaviours, each UAV should know position and attitude of the leader to define the formation reference frame and also the actual position of the previous UAV in the structure. Hence, information sharing can be based on a chain of local peer-to-peer communication between two consecutive vehicles in the structure. In such solution, the information about the leader could be sequentially transmitted from one UAV to another. Numerical simulations were prepared and carried out to verify the effectiveness of the presented approach. Trajectories recorded during those simulations show collective, coherence and collision-free flights of the formation created with five UAVs...|$|R
