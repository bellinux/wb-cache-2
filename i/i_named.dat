5|$|After an {{extended}} campaign putting down Sogdian resistance and founding military outposts manned by his Macedonian veterans, Alexander united Sogdiana with Bactria into one satrapy. The Sogdian nobleman and warlord Spitamenes (370–328 BC), allied with Scythian tribes, led an uprising against Alexander's forces. This revolt was put down by Alexander and his generals Amyntas, Craterus, and Coenus, {{with the aid}} of native Bactrian and Sogdian troops. With the Scythian and Sogdian rebels defeated, Spitamenes was allegedly betrayed by his own wife and beheaded. Pursuant with his own marriage to Roxana, Alexander encouraged his men to marry Sogdian women in order to discourage further revolt. This included Apama, daughter of the rebel Spitamenes, who wed Seleucus I Nicator and bore him a son and future heir to the Seleucid throne. According to the Roman historian Appian, Seleucus <b>I</b> <b>named</b> three new Hellenistic cities in Asia after her (see Apamea).|$|E

Those two elements are like soap and water. It was a deep cleansing, almost like being reborn." [...] The artwork of the album was also designed by Shakira and shows a close-up {{of the back of}} a blonde-haired Shakira; a star {{and the name of the}} album are seen tattooed on her arm.|$|E
500|$|The {{reign of}} Mislav's {{successor}} Trpimir I, is significant for spreading Christianity {{in the medieval}} Croatian state, {{and for the first}} mention of the name [...] "Croats" [...] in domestic documents. On 4 March, in 852, Trpimir I issued a [...] "Charter in Biaći" [...] (...) in Latin, confirming Mislav's donations to the Archbishopric in Split. In this document Trpimir <b>I</b> <b>named</b> himself; [...] "By the mercy of God, Duke of Croats" [...] (...) , and his realm as the [...] "Realm of the Croats" [...] (...) [...] In the same document Trpimir I mentioned Klis as his property— seat. Under Klis, in Rižinice, the duke Trpimir built a church and the first Benedictine monastery in Croatia, which is known from the discovery of a stone fragment on a gable arch from an altar screen, inscribed with the duke's name and title.|$|E
500|$|Witherspoon owned a {{production}} company called Type A Films, which the media believed was a moniker honoring her childhood nickname [...] "Little Miss Type A." [...] However, {{when asked about}} the company by Interview magazine, she clarified the name's origin: [...] "...people think <b>I</b> <b>named</b> it after myself... It was actually an in-joke with my family because at [...] 7 I understood complicated medical terms, such as the difference between type A and type B personalities. But I just wished I'd named the company Dogfood Films or Fork or something. You carry that baggage all your life." [...] In March 2012, Witherspoon merged Type A Films with producer Bruna Papandrea's Make Movies banner to create a new production company entitled Pacific Standard. In 2016, Witherspoon and Papandrea split up, with Witherspoon gaining full control over the company.|$|E

[...] "Castleers" [...] is a short vocal track and tribute to Raphael and D'wayne's Castlemont High School chorus group, Castleers Choir, in which they sang as students. Raphael said of its inspiration, [...] "The high school choir was all about that classic R & B harmony, so <b>I</b> <b>named</b> the song after the choir.

On the compilation's title, Aguilera said: [...] "I'm looking forward to the next 10 years, which is partly why <b>I</b> <b>named</b> the album, Keeps Gettin' Better, 'cause it does".

500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the good movie, Showboat, came out and <b>I</b> <b>named</b> the little yellow colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up and turned around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E

500|$|Wings for My Flight {{was first}} {{published}} in 1991 in hardcover by Addison-Wesley. Houle later wrote a short story titled [...] "Albert" [...] that was adapted from Wings for My Flight, focusing on Albert and Leopold's first attempts at flying. The story was published in the May 1996 issue of the children's magazine Cricket. Wings for My Flight was republished, this time in paperback, in 1999 by Pruett Publishing. This edition included a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. In 2014, the book was updated and republished again by University of New Mexico Press. The updated edition contained photographs of the Chimney Rock landscape, as well as a preface by Houle that addressed the recovery of the peregrine falcon population since the book {{was first published}} in 1991. Houle highlighted the 1972 agricultural prohibition of DDT, which was the chemical primarily responsible for the peregrine decline; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which allowed the pursuit of wildlife conservation to take precedence over land issues; and successful attempts to raise peregrines in captivity and later release them to the wild. While writing the book, Houle changed the names of various people and places, explaining the choice by saying [...] "I felt more comfortable changing the names because I worked for so long with those people, it was impossible to be honest about them if <b>I</b> <b>named</b> them".|$|E
