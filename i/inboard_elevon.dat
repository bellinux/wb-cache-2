40|$|Experimental {{aerodynamic}} investigations {{were conducted}} in NASA/Langley 8 -Foot transonic pressure tunnel on a sting mounted 0. 010 -scale outer mold line model of 104 A/B configuration of the Rockwell International space shuttle vehicle. Component aerodynamic force and moment data and base and balance cavity pressures were recorded over an angle of attack range of - 10 deg to + 10 deg at Mach numbers of 0. 6, 0. 8, 0. 9, 0. 98, 1. 13, and 1. 2. Selected configurations were tested at sideslip angles from - 10 deg to + 10 deg. For all configurations involving the orbit, wing bending and torsion were measured on the right wing. <b>Inboard</b> <b>elevon</b> setting of 0 deg, + 4 deg and + 8 deg and outboard settings of 0 deg, + 4 deg and + 8 deg were tested...|$|E
40|$|In {{the event}} of a control surface failure, the purpose of a {{reconfigurable}} control system is to redistribute the control effort among the remaining working surfaces such that satisfactory stability and performance are retained. An Off-line Nonlinear General Constrained Optimization (ONCO) approach was used for the reconfigurable X- 33 control design method. Three example failures are shown using a high fidelity 6 DOF simulation (case I ascent with a left body flap jammed at 25 deg.; case 2 entry with a right <b>inboard</b> <b>elevon</b> jam at 25 deg.; and case 3, landing (TAEM) with a left rudder jam at - 30 deg.) Failure comparisons between responses with the nominal controller and reconfigurable controllers show the benefits of reconfiguration. Single jam aerosurface failures were considered, and failure detection and identification is considered accomplished in the actuator controller. The X- 33 flight control system will incorporate reconfigurable flight control in the baseline system...|$|E
40|$|A {{reconfigurable}} {{control law}} for the full X- 33 flight envelope {{has been designed to}} accommodate a failed control surface and redistribute the control effort among the remaining working surfaces to retain satisfactory stability and performance. An offline nonlinear constrained optimization approach has been used for the X- 33 reconfigurable control design method. Using a nonlinear, six-degree-of-freedom simulation, three example failures are evaluated: ascent with a left body flap jammed at maximum deflection; entry with a right <b>inboard</b> <b>elevon</b> jammed at maximum deflection; and landing with a left rudder jammed at maximum deflection. Failure detection and identification are accomplished in the actuator controller. Failure response comparisons between the nominal control mixer and the reconfigurable control subsystem (mixer) show the benefits of reconfiguration. Single aerosurface jamming failures are considered. The cases evaluated are representative of the study conducted to prove the adequate and safe performance of the reconfigurable control mixer throughout the full flight envelope. The X- 33 flight control system incorporates reconfigurable flight control in the existing baseline system...|$|E
40|$|The phase-change paint {{technique}} {{was used to}} make heat-transfer measurements on five Space Shuttle Orbiter models with differentially-deflected elevons. The outboard elevons were deflected windward through an angle delta when the <b>inboard</b> <b>elevons</b> were deflected through an angle - 2 delta, where delta = 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 deg. The models were tested in air at Mach 6 and Mach 10 with two different flow conditions at each Mach number. Each test was run at three angles of attack; 20, 28, and 35 deg. This study was restricted to the windward side of the wing/elevons area. Multiple chord-wise streaks of high heating often occurred on the wings and sometimes extended to localized spots of high heating on the windward-deflected elevons. The extent of heating was a function of angle of attack and test conditions, but in general differential deflection of the elevons affected the wing heat-transfer coefficient {{on the order of}} 40 percent or less whereas the windward elevon heat-transfer coefficient was a function of the deflection angle and could be many times the value determined for the undeflected elevon...|$|R
50|$|The {{mid-mounted}} wings {{would have}} been swept back 23.4°, housing the stalky retractable main landing gear with <b>elevons</b> <b>inboard</b> and ailerons outboard on the trailing edge. Slots in the outboard leading edges would have improved slow speed performance and handling.|$|R
40|$|Two {{theories}} {{emerged as}} the cause of undesired oscillations at frequencies between 40 and 60 Hz in the Orbiter Vehicle <b>inboard</b> and outboard <b>elevon</b> actuation subsystems during hardware testing. Both the "hardover feedback" and "deadspace" theories were examined using continuous system modeling program simulation. Results did not support the "hardover feedback" theory but showed that deadspace in the torque feedback spring connections to the servospools must be considered to be a possible cause of the oscillations. Further investigation is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} on an 0. 010 -scale representation of the VL 70 - 000140 C Integrated Space Shuttle Launch Vehicle. The primary test objective was to obtain Reynolds number effects on orbiter elevon hinge moments and wing bending/torsional moments. Launch vehicle aerodynamic force data were also recorded. The elevon hinge moments, wing bending/torsional moments, and vehicle force data were recorded over an angle of attack range of - 6 deg to + 6 deg, an angle of sideslip range of - 6 deg to + 6 deg, at Mach numbers of 0. 6, 0. 975, 1. 05 and 1. 25. The Reynolds number was varied from a minimum of 4. 5 million/foot {{to a maximum of}} 11. 5 million/foot. The complete integrated configuration was tested with the orbiter elevons set at 0 deg and deflected to 9 deg on the outboard elevon and 10 deg on the <b>inboard</b> <b>elevon.</b> Testing was conducted in the TWT 19. 7 % porous transonic test section with the model sting mounted through the orbiter base. All aerodynamic force data were obtained from internal strain gage balance located in the orbiter...|$|E
40|$|With {{the new era}} {{of space}} {{exploration}} upon us and the Orion spacecraft currently being tested, which would replace the Space Shuttle as the orbiter that will transport humans into space once again, safety assurance is the main component for a successful mission. Aerospace materials have always played a big role {{when it comes to}} safety assurance. Having the knowledge of what materials are suitable to keep using when designing the future spacecraft that will take humans to Mars is fundamental in order to be confident that the vehicle and all that comprises it will function as envisioned. Expanding the knowledge and obtaining a better understanding on how space materials behave in extreme environments like outer space is crucial when space safety and mission assurance is the goal to accomplish. The Challenger and Columbia accidents are reminders that advancement in materials science plays an important role for the success of space exploration. While the debris from Challenger were buried in the abandoned Minuteman silos, Columbia debris has been stored in a room at the Vertical Assembly Building for the scientific community to conduct research on it with the goal of improving the designs of new spacecraft. One of the artifacts recovered from Columbia and loaned to the university to conduct scientific research on was the starboard (<b>inboard)</b> <b>elevon</b> actuator. This hydraulic powered component contains a shaft that displayed a significant amount of molten metal deposited onto it. Doing a thorough materials characterization on the deposit as well as the base metal will allow for information such as identification of deposits to be known, any thermal alterations that occurred to the base metal, and possibly, temperatures reached by surrounding metal as well as the base metal of the shaft. Since the hydraulic system that contains the shaft powers the orbiter’s aerosurfaces, the movement of the elevons throughout the breakup might be an area that can be closely investigated and may lead to new trajectory data. ...|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the <b>inboard</b> and outboard <b>elevons,</b> varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a wind tunnel test to {{determine}} the force, moment, and hinge-moment characteristics of the Configuration 2 A Space Shuttle Vehicle Orbiter at Mach numbers 5, 7 and 10 are presented. The model was an 0. 015 -scale representation of the Orbiter Configuration 2 A used in test 0 A 11 A and later tests. Six-component aerodynamic force and moment data were recorded from a 1. 50 -inch internal strain-gage balance, and base pressures were taken for axial and drag force corrections. Hinge-moment data were obtained for the rudder and the <b>inboard</b> and outboard <b>elevon</b> panels of the starboard wing...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Draken {{consisted of}} two sections, front and rear, joined by bolts. The forward section, which was integral with the intake ducts and neighbouring wing structure, accommodates the fire-control radar, cockpit, nose undercarriage, integral fuel tanks and various systems. The rear portion, which was manufactured as a single piece alongside {{the rest of the}} inner wing, contained the engine and afterburner, bag-type fuel tanks, armament, main landing gear, and other systems. The flight control surfaces consisted of a rudder, along with <b>inboard</b> and outboard <b>elevons,</b> the outer sections being fitted with mass-balance weights. Each surface was operated by a tandem hydraulic jack, which was connected to separate circuits. As a weight-saving measure, the hydraulic systems would operate at a line pressure of 2,9871b/sq, which would be greater than double the pressure used in the earlier Saab 29 Tunnan.|$|R
40|$|The {{potentials}} and {{capability for}} implementing a LAMS (load alleviation and mode suppression) {{system on the}} YF- 12 A {{for the purpose of}} flight research were evaluated. The nature of the research is to minimize the design risk in application of LAMS to future aircraft. The results of the study show that the YF- 12 A would be a suitable test bed for continuing development of LAMS technology. This was demonstrated by defining five candidate LAMS systems and analytically evaluating them with regard to performance and mechanization. Each of the five systems used a different combination of force producers. A small canard vane or a mass-reaction device mounted near the cockpit was considered as a possible LAMS force producer, together with the existing <b>inboard</b> and outboard <b>elevons.</b> It was concluded that a combination of canard vane and outboard elevons would provide the most effective system for the YF- 12 A...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} a computational study done to compute the inviscid longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of the Space Shuttle Orbiter for Mach numbers 10 and 15 at angles of attack of 40, 50, 55, and 60 degrees. These computations were done to provide limited aerodynamic data in support of the Orbiter contingency abort task. The Orbiter had all the control surfaces in the undeflected position. The unstructured grid software FELISA was used for these computations with the equilibrium air option. Normal and axial force coefficients and pitching moment coefficients were computed. The hinge moment coefficients of the body flap and the <b>inboard</b> and outboard <b>elevons</b> were also computed. These results were compared with Orbiter Air Data Book (OADB) data and those computed using GASP. The comparison with the GASP results showed very good agreement in Cm and Ca at all the points. The computed axial force coefficients were smaller than those computed by GASP. There were noticeable differences between the present results and those in the OADB at angles of attack greater than 50 degrees...|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{documented}} of an analysis {{conducted to determine}} space shuttle vehicle (SSV) subsystem margins for the reference flight profile for the first orbital flight test (OFT- 1). In general, the results show increased margins for the OFT- 1 indicators when compared to Mission 3 A resutls. The inclusion of element and wing aerodynamic variations on OFT- 1, in combination with winds and systems dispersions, resulted in the forward Z (FTO 1) attach load indicator exceeding specified limits. The <b>inboard</b> and outboard <b>elevon</b> hinge moment margins (9 percent and 3 percent, respectively) on OFT- 1 reflect values consistent with the load relief requirements dictated by elevon hinge moment variations. All other structural load indicators for OFT- 1 had margins in excess of 10 percent. The SSV first stage stagnation heating indicators for OFT- 1 were about 45 percent less than for Mission 3 A. The hydraulic systems demands for both missions were essentially the same. The results also show OFT- 1 performance requirements from the consideration of winds and dispersions to be approximately 3, 300 lbs greater than Mission 3 A...|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to: (1) determine the static stability characteristics of the Shuttle Vehicle 5 configuration; (2) determine {{the effect on the}} Vehicle 5 aerodynamic characteristics of External Tank (ET) and Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) nose shape, SRB nozzle shroud flare angle, orbiter to tank fairing, and sting location; (3) provide flow visualization using thin film oil paint; and (4) determine rudder, body flap, and <b>inboard</b> and outboard <b>elevon</b> hinge moments. The mated vehicle model was mounted in three different ways: (1) the orbiter mounted on the balance with the SRB's attached to the tank and the tank in turn attached to the orbiter; (2) the tank mounted on the balance (with the sting protruding through the tank base) with the SRB's and orbiter attached to the tank, and (3) with the tank mounted on the balance and the balance in turn supported by a forked sting entering the nozzle of each SRB, extending forward into the SRB's then crossing over to the tank to provide a balance socket.
