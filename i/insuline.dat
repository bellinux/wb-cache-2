5000|$|After graduation, de Duve's primary {{research}} was on insulin {{and its role}} in glucose metabolism. He made an initial discovery that a commercial preparation of insulin was contaminated with another pancreatic hormone, the insulin antagonist glucagon. However, laboratory supplies at Leuven were in shortage, he therefore enrolled in a programme to earn a degree in chemistry at the Cancer Institute. His research on insulin was summed up in a 400-page book titled Glucose, <b>Insuline</b> et Diabète (Glucose, Insulin and Diabetes) published in 1945, simultaneously in Brussels and Paris. The book was condensed into a technical dissertation which earned him the most advanced degree at the university level agrégation de l'enseignement supérieur (an equivalent of a doctorate - he called it [...] "a sort of glorified Ph.D.") in 1945. His thesis was followed by a number of scientific publications. He subsequently obtained a MSc in chemistry in 1946, for which he worked on the purification of penicillin. To enhance his skill in biochemistry, he trained in the laboratory of Hugo Theorell (who later won The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1955) at the Nobel Medical Institute in Stockholm for 18 months during 1946-1947. In 1947 he received a financial assistance as Rockefeller Foundation fellow and worked for six months with Carl and Gerti Cori at Washington University in St. Louis (the husband and wife were joint winners of The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947).|$|E
50|$|The {{stator core}} is built with lamination's of cold rolled {{grain-oriented}} sheet steel 0.013 in (0.033cm) thick, insulated {{from each other}} with <b>insuline.</b> The number of segments per circle is arranged so that the maximum practical percentage of core flux is {{in the direction of}} the oriented grain. The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial gas passages are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and outlet passages for the axial gas passages. Separate radial ducts feed the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each coil side of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin-impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the coil length by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of flexible copper straps, bolted and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each coil side. The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides.|$|E

In spite of side effects such as osteo arthritis, gall stone, and probably some cancers, and metabolic disorders which are collectively known as X syndrome is associated with hyperlipidosis, hypertension, hyperuremia diabetes mellitus and ischemia, each of these factors alone can lead to complications or mortality in the obeses. Since there is less studies regarding <b>insuline</b> resistance in obeses in our country we conducted a research in this regard. Hypertension due to <b>insuline</b> resistance can express the association of these metabolic disorders. Materials and Methods: Totally, 56 males and females divided in 4 groups of obeses are thin {{on the basis of}} their body mass index were collected. This study was a case control method. Fasting serum samples were drained to assay <b>insuline,</b> sugar, uric acid and lipid. The blood pressure was twice in fasting condition. The obtained data were analyzed by students non paired t-test. Results: Fasting serum <b>insuline</b> level in obese was 5. 4 ± 6. 5 µl/ml and in thin 2. 2 ± 1. 2 µl/ml (P< 0. 02).

40|$|Premio Extraordinario de Doctorado de la UAH en el año académico 2013 - 2014 Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a chronic}} multifactorial metabolic disease caused by insulin deficiency or <b>insuline</b> resistance. Diabetes is {{often associated with}} cardiovascular risk factors, and may lead to severe secondary complications, including atherosclerosis, microangiopathy, renal dysfunction and failure, cardiac abnormalities, diabetic retinopathy and ocular disorders. <b>Insuline</b> resistance is a major pathophysiological factor in the development of type 2 diabetes and it is associated not only with hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia but also with other disorders such as atherosclerosis, hypertension and abnormal lipid profile, which are known collectively referred to as Metabolic Syndrome or <b>Insuline</b> Resistance Associated Disorders. This work focused on the synthesis and biological activity of new compounds designed as inhibitors of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1 B (PTP- 1 B) and Fatty Acid Binding Proteins (FABPs). These two therapeutic targets, are involved in diseases such as obesity, diabetes or atherosclerosis. Series of dihydropyrrolo-quinoxalines, pyrrolo-quinoxalinium salts and pyridazino-pyrrolo-quinoxalinium salts were obtained and evaluated for in vitro inhibition of PTP 1 B. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) where established. Dihydropyrrolo-quinoxaline serie showed inhibition in micromolar range. Molecular modeling by docking studies of pyridazino-pyrrolo-quinoxalinium salts showed binding at the allosteric site. Series of [alfa]-, [beta]-, [gamma]- and [delta]-carboline alkanoic acids and carboxyalkyl [alfa]-, [beta]-, [gamma]- and [delta] [...] carbolinium salts were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro inhibition of TNF-[alfa] synthesis in THP- 1 cells.

40|$|A obesidade é um dos principais problemas de saúde pública da atualidade, apresentando etiologia multifatorial. Entre os determinantes fisiológicos do controle do peso e do apetite, estão fatores neuronais, endócrinos, adipocitários e intestinais. A leptina e a {{insulina}} são hormônios secretados em proporção à massa adiposa e atuam perifericamente, estimulando o catabolismo. No sistema nervoso central, a insulina e a leptina interagem com receptores hipotalâmicos, favorecendo a saciedade. Indivíduos obesos têm maiores concentrações séricas destes hormônios e apresentam resistência à sua ação.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{results from}} the loss of tolerance to insulin and alters glycemia and the glycogen content. Oxidative stress and inflammation are linked to theses alterations, especially with insulin-resistance. The therapy management of diabetes includes nutritional recommendations. Several nutrients are developed to improve glycemia, oxidative stress, inflammation and glycogen content. More interestingly, ?-GOS exhibits anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitive effects in vitro (Efstathiou and Fathi 2010) and in vivo (Boucher et al. 2003). Thus, ?-GOS is a potential functional food for the treatment of diabetes. But, less is known about the in vivo effect of ?-GOS on inflammatory, glycoxidation markers and glycogen content in diabetes. In this context, the aim of this work was to study the effect of ?-GOS developed by Sojasun technologies (from fermented soy product) compared to a synthetic ?-GOS produced by Sigma on inflammatory, glycoxidation markers and glycogen content in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model. Methods: Twenty-four male Wistar streptozotocin-diabetic rat (STZ) were divided into three group: control group, supplemented with natural ?-GOS (20 mg/kg/day) group and supplemented with synthetic ?-GOS (20 mg/kg/day). The supplementation protocol duration was 8 weeks. At the end of the protocol, blood and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) were obtained to measure glucose, insulin, fructosamine in plasma and N-(carboxymethyl) lysine, glycogen synthase activity and glycogen content, in muscle. Results-Discussion: Diabetes was confirmed with the measure of <b>insuline</b> and glucose levels. All the diabetic groups had significantly higher glucose and <b>insuline</b> levels compared to control healthy group (data not shown). <b>Insuline</b> level in plasma and storage of glycogen in muscle were increased only in both ?-GOS groups. Fructosamine, TNF?and glycogen synthase activity was also decreased in the two supplemented groups (synthetic ?-GOS and natural ?-GOS). CML remained unchanged in all groups. Natural ?-OGT and synthetic ?-OGT only differed on muscular glucose level: only natural ?-OGT induced a significant decrease in muscular glucose. To conclude, our results suggest that ?-GOS alters positively glucose level, increases the glycogen content in diabetique population, improves glycemic control in the long term and decreases the inflammatory effects in streptozotocin-diabetic rat.

Nevertheless it is not well understood whereas these mild cases of gestational diabetes could mean much rate of adverse outcomes of pregnancy and delivery, with special regard to fetal macrosomia. So we reviewed our data about fetal macrosomia between 1990 and 1998 and compared them with others in literature, to evaluate if the gestational diabetes mild cases diagnosed by the lower glycemic thresholds may be helpful for management of pregnancy. Fetal macrosomia rate was 6. 48 %, but 63. 8 % of these macrosomic babies was found in women who resulted healthy after a pathological oral 50 g glucose challenge test and normal oral 100 g glucose tolerance test (OGTT), in women affected by a gestational diabetes mellitus after a 100 g OGTT and in women who had a pregestational diabetes. We used the Carpenter and Coustan thresholds for 100 g OGTT for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus and a 1 hour 140 mg% threshold after 50 g oral glucose load test. Apart from fetal macrosomia, no other adverse outcomes of pregnancy and delivery was found. These macrosomic babies were born spontaneously, with no differences with controls.

40|$|Genetic {{transmission}} in manic {{depressive illness}} (MDI) has been explored in twins, adoption, association, and linkage studies. The X-linked transmission hypothesis {{has been tested}} by using several markers on chromosome X: Xg blood group, colour blindness, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), factor IX (haemophilia B), and DNA probes such as DXS 15, DXS 52, F 8 C, ST 14. The hypothesis of autosomal transmission has been tested by association studies with the O blood group located on chromosome 9, as well as linkage studies on chromosome 6 with the Human Leucocyte Antigens (HLA) haplotypes and on Chromosome 11 with DNA markers for the following genes: D 2 dopamine receptor, tyrosinase, C-Harvey-Ras-A (HRAS) oncogene, <b>insuline</b> (ins), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Although linkage studies support the hypothesis of a major locus for the transmission of MDI in the Xq 27 - 28 region, several factors are limiting the results, and {{are discussed in the}} present review.

40|$|Five {{years ago}} Morinaga {{reported}} that the intemal use of the thermal waters of Misasa promoted the action of <b>insuline,</b> inhibited the adrenaline hyperglycaemia and suppressed the alimentary hyperglycaemia. But the highest radon content of the waters used {{at that time was}} about 1000 × 10 (- 10) Curie units per liter. Recently a more highly radioactive spring was found in Misasa, its radon content being 3000 - 4000 ×l 0 (- 10) Curie units per liter, though very feebly mineralized (under 0. 5 g per liter) and cold. Therefore the hypoglycaemic effect of this newly discovered water was, investigated in rabbits and compared with the effects of two other thermal waters in Tottori Prefecture and of plain water as a control. Twenty cc. of ten per cent glucofoe solution in thermal waters or in plain water per kilogram of bodyweight was administered to the rabitts by stomach tube and blood sugar level was determined before, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the administration. All of the three thermal waters decreased the glycaemia significantly as compared the results with plain water control...|$|E

40|$|Proteases were {{identified}} and characterized from the culture supernatant of the C. diphtheriae and B. pertussis bacteria. the proteases were secreted {{in the media and}} detected {{at the end of the}} exponential growth phase. Activity was detected in some fluorescent substrates, based on selected protein sequences such as <b>insuline</b> beta-chain, bradykinin, and synaptobrevin. the proteases were purified by means of gel filtration chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE) analysis of the purified proteins indicated, for the main secreted proteins, an estimated molecular mass of 30 kDa in C. diphtheriae and 69 kDa in B. pertussis culture media. the proteases were stable and presented enzymatic activity at 378 degrees C. These proteases were not related to the main toxic compounds described in these two bacteria, but could represent good markers for the fermentation process when the enzyme activity was measured with the fluorescent substrates.

40|$|Non-alcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) as one entity of non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and accompanies {{the rise in}} the prevalence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia in the western world. It is not known why some patients progress in the disease and develop inflammation in the liver, whereas others remain in the stage of simple steatosis, which generally has a benign course. However, NASH can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, it is important to determine the stage of the disease in patients presenting with the metabolic syndrome and abnormal liver function tests, suggesting NAFLD. Liver biopsy is the only tool that allows for reliable detection, grading and staging of liver disease. The main strategies in the treatment of NASH are correction of risk factors (lifestyle modifications, <b>insuline</b> sensitizer) and anti-oxidants (ursodeoxycholic acid, vitamin E) which both have been shown to improve liver histology as well as liver enzymes. Patients wih alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) present the same liver histology and often also metabolic alterations similar to metabolic syndrome. Therefore, MAFLD (metabolic syndrome-associated fatty liver disease) might describe both patient populations more accurately and also describes the pathophysiological characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prevalence of type II {{diabetes}} mellitus(T 2 DM) {{is substantially}} increasing in Ethiopia {{but there are}} no studies on its drug therapy. Objective: To assess drug therapy for T 2 DM and check association between fasting blood glucose levels with patient demographics, clinical characteristics and medications. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional institution based study was conducted on T 2 DM patients over a 1 month period using patient chart review and key informant interview at the diabetes clinic of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH). Results: Of 103 patients enrolled females accounted 59. 2 %. The mean age was 52. 2 years and 96. 12 % of patients were from Addis Ababa. The mean fasting blood glucose (FBG) and body mass index (BMI) were 155. 99 mg/dl and 26. 4 kg/m 2 respectively. About 51. 45 % of the patients were overweight; and neutral protamine hagedorn <b>insuline</b> (NPH) (56. 3 %), metformin plus glibenclamide (19. 4 %) and metformin (10. 7 %) were the most common drug therapies. But there was no significant association of FBG levels of patients with either, gender, age, BMI or medications. Conclusions: The drug therapy at the diabetes clinic was in line with recommendations of International Diabetes Federation (IDF) despite lack of uniform guideline...|$|E
40|$|G protein-coupled {{receptor}} kinase 2 (GRK 2) regulates cell signaling by promoting agonist-specific desensitization of several metabolism-related GPCRs, including the b-adrenergic receptors, endothelin, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptides. The upregulation of GRK 2 and corresponding desensitization of these metabolism related GPCRs seem {{play an important}} role in the onset or progression of diseases such as heart failure, myocardial ischemia, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes and in cell cycle progression. Recent studies suggest that GRK 2 participates in the regulatory network controlling cell cycle arrest and survival in such conditions. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to altered GRK 2 levels, as well as the identification of GRK 2 inhibitors is a very active field of research. As reported in literature, two short peptides KRX 107 (GLLRrHS) and KRX 124 (GLLRrHSI), derived from HJ loop of GRK 2 / 3 (2), show a positive effect on glucose metabolism in animal models of Type 2 diabetes, increasing <b>insuline</b> sensitivity and improving glucose homeostasis and emerge as a valuable starting point for the development of a novel class of GRK 2 inhibitors. Thus, in this communication we report the preliminary results obtained with a small library of short analogues of KRX 107 and KRX 124...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{clarifying}} abnormal water balance in diabetes mellitus which assumes a very complicated character, clinical experiments were carried out in diabetes mellitus free from any complications to study phases of body fluids, renal clearance, water diuresis, and effects of various drugs on water diuresis mainly from the points of view of blood sugar levels and adrenocortical function. 1. Phases of body fluids, especially extracellular fluid, were affected in a great measure by changes in blood sugar levels. A close connection was recognized between phases of body fluids and adrenocortical function. 2. GFR was raised in diabetes mellitus. Changes in adrenocortical function and blood sugar levels had a marked effect on GFR, and a slight effect on RPF. 3. Adrenocortical function was demonstrated to be partly responsible for polyuria. 4. Water diuresis reaction depended {{to a great extent}} on the degree of hyperglycemia and adrenocortical function. 5. ACTH, predonine, cortisone and <b>insuline</b> had an action of promoting secretion of the urine in cases in which elimination of water following its ingestion was delayed, while glucose acted as an inhibitor of secretion ef the urine. The present study shows that the supraopticohypophysealadrenocortical system definitely takes part in water balance in diabetes mellitus...|$|E
