5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, across an open goal with no Albion player there to tap the ball in and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the ball in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E

He also indicated the album would be released with a bonus CD that will have all the 'Ill Mind of Hopsin' songs remastered, however this ultimately did not take place. In October 2013, Hospin confirmed that he had finished recording the album and had turned <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> Funk Volume, stating he had personally re-mastered the album 20-30 times to get the sound just right.|$|E

5|$|The {{next season}} Vanderbilt tied Navy and met rival Sewanee, {{in a battle}} of the unbeaten for the mythical crown of the South, and won using a trick double-pass play. Sewanee led 12–11 with twelve minutes to play. At McGugin's signal, the Commodores went into a freakish {{formation}} in which Stein Stone remained at center but all the other players shifted to his left. Quarterback Hugh Potts took the snap and lateraled the ball to Vaughn Blake, who lateraled it across to Bob Blake, who had lined up deep in punt formation, as Stone ran down the field. Blake completed a 35-yard pass to Stone who was inside the 5-yard line. Honus Craig ran <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> win the game. It was cited by journalist Grantland Rice as the greatest thrill he ever witnessed in his years of watching sports.|$|E

25|$|Hull kicked-off the 133rd FA Cup Final and {{dominated}} possession {{for the opening}} stages. Barely four minutes into the game, Hull won a corner that was crossed in by Stephen Quinn to find Tom Huddlestone {{on the edge of}} the penalty area; Huddlestone tried a volley that went into the path of James Chester, who tapped it in from close range to give Hull City an early lead. The high tempo with which Hull started the game overwhelmed Arsenal, and four minutes after the first goal, they scored again. Ahmed Elmohamady received a free kick and crossed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the penalty area. This caused controversy as Arsenal believed he had taken the free kick several yards in front of where the foul was committed. Nevertheless, the ball was picked up on the far edge of the penalty area by Quinn, who got past Aaron Ramsey and crossed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the goalmouth, where it was headed towards goal by centre-back Alex Bruce. Arsenal goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański parried it out to Hull captain and fellow centre-back Curtis Davies, who fired the ball into the far bottom corner of the goal. Hull almost scored a third goal moments later, when a header from Bruce was headed off the goal line by Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs. Instead, it was Arsenal who scored the next goal; in the 16th minute, they won a free kick {{on the edge of the}} Hull penalty area, which Santi Cazorla fired over the Hull wall and into the top corner of the goal. For the rest of the first half, chances were scarce and Hull maintained their lead into the half-time interval.|$|E

25|$|Rose's {{childhood}} friend and Hollywood Rose collaborator Paul Tobias {{was brought in}} to replace Gilby Clarke, whose contract with the band was not renewed. Due to creative differences with Rose and personal problems with Tobias, Slash quit the band in 1996. McKagan left soon after and Sorum was fired in 1997. Slash was replaced by Nine Inch Nails touring guitarist Robin Finck, ex-Replacements bassist Tommy Stinson replaced McKagan, and Josh Freese joined as the drummer. In early 1998, the band—which comprised Rose, Finck, Stinson, rhythm guitarist Paul Tobias, keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Chris Pitman—began recording at Rumbo Recorders, a state-of-the-art studio in the San Fernando Valley where Guns N' Roses had partially recorded parts for their debut album, Appetite for Destruction.

500|$|The {{money is}} divided into three unequal shares. The [...] "A" [...] share is 60% of the team's bank; the [...] "B" [...] share is 30%; the [...] "C" [...] share is 10%.

500|$|Initially, {{the game}} had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark {{received}} many alterations throughout the development process.

[...] However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, {{which was one of the}} first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers.

500|$|This simple tactic proved unstoppable. Soon, he had {{surpassed the}} 50-point barrier, causing arena speaker Dave Zinkoff {{to fire up}} the {{previously}} sleepy crowd. Chamberlain also kept his cool despite getting perpetually triple and quadruple-teamed by the Knicks, who did not shy away from hard fouls to distract the center. McGuire was irate and demanded that the referees call more fouls, but Chamberlain could not be stopped. He scored another 28 points to lift his Warriors to a commanding 125–106 lead {{by the end of}} the third quarter. His own total stood at 69, nine shy of his previous scoring record. The Knicks' third center, Dave Budd, who alternated with the foul-troubled Imhoff at pivot, later stated that resistance was futile: [...] "You couldn't play [...] conventionally because he was so big. The only thing you could attempt to do was either front him, and in that case they'd try to lob <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> him, or beat him down the floor and set up where he wanted to get and force him out a couple of extra steps.

500|$|The two papers, {{one on the}} proton–proton cycle, co-authored with Critchfield, and {{the other}} on the carbon-oxygen-nitrogen (CNO) cycle, were sent to the Physical Review for publication. After Kristallnacht, Bethe's mother had become afraid to remain in Germany. Taking {{advantage}} of her Strasbourg origin, she was able to emigrate to the United States in June 1939 on the French quota, rather than the German one, which was full. Bethe's graduate student Robert Marshak noted that the New York Academy of Sciences was offering a $500 prize for the best unpublished paper on the topic of solar and stellar energy. So Bethe, in need of $250 to release his mother's furniture, [...] withdrew the CNO cycle paper and sent <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the New York Academy of Sciences. It won the prize, and Bethe gave Marshak $50 finder's fee and used $250 to release his mother's furniture. The paper was subsequently published in the Physical Review in March. It was a breakthrough in the understanding of the stars, and would win Bethe the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967. In 2002, at age 96, Bethe sent a handwritten note to John N. Bahcall congratulating him on the use of solar neutrino observations to show that the CNO cycle accounts for about 7% of the Sun's energy; the neutrino observations had started with Raymond Davis Jr., whose experiment was based on Bahcall's calculations and encouragement, and led to Davis's receiving a share of the 2002 Nobel Prize.|$|E
