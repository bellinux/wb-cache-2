2500|$|Because pole {{stiffness}} and length are important factors to a vaulter's performance, {{it is not}} uncommon for an elite vaulter to carry as many as ten poles to a competition. The effective properties of a pole can be changed by <b>gripping</b> the <b>pole</b> higher or lower in relation to the top of the pole. The left and right handgrips are typically a bit more than shoulder width apart. Poles are manufactured for people of all skill levels and body sizes, with sizes as short as [...] to as long as , with a wide range of weight ratings.

40|$|To {{compare the}} axial loading of three nordic ski <b>pole</b> <b>grips</b> a data {{acquisition}} system was developed. The portable system recorded one or two channels of strain gage signals to analog tape. This system {{may be used in}} later research requiring the measurement of poling forces during actual skiing. Poling forces were monitored and recorded using the SWIX TX-R, Exel Ergo and Standard grips. Each grip was tested several times with maximal double-poling effort, similar to a mass start or sprint situation. The recorded signals were analyzed using SoundEdit on a Macintosh IIci. Impact loads were measured and compared for each grip. These results demonstrate a higher level of loading at impact, though insignificant, with the SWIX TX-R grip. The Ergo grip provides thrust over a longer period, resulting in higher total load. From this analysis and background theory of human musculature and biomechanics, a new grip was designed in an attempt to maximize pole loading...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate neurobehavioral and neurochemical effects of ATR in C 57 BL/ 6 mouse offspring and dams exposed to a relatively low (3 mg/l, estimated intake 1. 4 mg/kg/day) concentration of ATR via the drinking water (DW) from gestational day 6 to postnatal day (PND) 23. Behavioral tests included open field, <b>pole,</b> <b>grip</b> strength, novel object recognition (NOR), forced swim, and marble burying tests. Maternal weight gain and offspring (PND 21, 35, and 70) body or brain weights were not affected by ATR. However, ATR-treated dams exhibited decreased NOR performance and a trend toward hyperactivity. Juvenile offspring (PND 35) from ATR-exposed dams were hyperactive (both sexes), spent less time swimming (males), and buried more marbles (females). In adult offspring (PND 70), the only behavioral change was a sex-specific (females) decreased NOR performance by ATR. Neurochemically, a trend toward increased striatal dopamine (DA) in dams and a significant increase in juvenile offspring (both sexes) was observed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and explains}} {{the changes in}} kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, elastic energy, and muscular work during a pole vault. Measurements of a skilled pole vaulter show that the height cleared by the athlete increases linearly with increasing run-up velocity and that this height increase is achieved {{through a combination of}} a higher <b>grip</b> on the <b>pole</b> and a greater push height above the pole. The athlete has a net energy gain during the vault. Although the energy lost during the take-off increases with increasing run-up velocity, this loss is not sufficient to negate the increase in run-up kinetic energy and the work done by the athlete during the pole support phase. 1 Pole vaulting The pole vault is a physically and technically demanding event that requires consid-erable ability in sprinting, jumping, and gymnastics (Figure 1). In mechanical terms the aim of the athlete is to generate kinetic energy in the run-up and then use a long flexible pole to help convert as much of this energy as possible into the grav...|$|R
50|$|Poles come in {{a variety}} of {{materials}} and coatings where each material possesses its own properties, advantages and disadvantages. The materials poles are made of are brass, titanium - gold, stainless steel and chrome. The brass and titanium - gold poles are gold in colour and are used to enhance the <b>grip</b> between the <b>pole</b> and the dancer, these poles are normally used by more advanced dancers. The stainless steel poles aren’t as popular as the other types as they do not have the finest grip however, they are used by dancers who have sensitive skin. The chrome poles are silver in colour and are most popular amongst beginners. The finishes some dance poles may possess are silicone sleeves and powder coatings. Silicone sleeves can provide maximum grip, however, there are safety precautions dancers must take and consider before using silicone sleeves. These measures can include a great amount of clothing to be worn by the dancer and only static moves can be performed. Poles that are coated in powder can provide the best friction and maximum grip for dancers.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{investigations into}} {{the development of a}} versatile scansorial mobile robot and real-time realisation of a control system for different configurations of the robot namely climbing mode, walking mode and steering mode. The mobile robot comprises of a hybrid leg and wheel mechanism with innovative design that enables it to interchange its configuration to perform the specific tasks of pole climbing in climbing mode, walking and step climbing in walking mode, and skid steering and inclined slope climbing in steering mode. The motivation of this research is due to the surrounding environment which is not always structured for exploration or navigation missions, and thus poses significant difficulty for the robot to manoeuvre and accomplish the intended task. Hence, the development of versatile scansorial robot with a flexible and interchangeable configuration can provide a broad range of applications and locomotion system and to achieve the mission objective successfully. The robot design consists of four arms/legs with wheel attached at each end-effector and has two link manipulation capability. In climbing mode, the arms are configured as grippers to <b>grip</b> the <b>pole</b> and wheels accelerate to ascend or descend. The climbing angle is monitored to retain the level of the robot while climbing. However, in walking mode, the arms are configured as legs and the wheels are disabled. By implementing a periodic walking gait, the robot is capable of performing stable walking and step climbing. In steering mode, the arms are configured as suspension and the wheels are used for manoeuvring. In this mode, the skid steering system is used to enable the robot perform the turn. The versatile scansorial robot’s configurations and locomotion capabilities are assessed experimentally in real time implementation using the physical prototype. The experiments provided demonstrate the versatility of the robot and successfully fulfill the aims and objectives of the research...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} {{the influence of}} the assistive pole, seat configuration, and upper-body and trunk strength on seated-throwing performance in athletes with a spinal-cord injury (SCI). Methods: Ten Paralympic athletes competing in wheelchair rugby, basketball, or athletics (seated throws) participated in 2 randomized sessions: seated throwing and strength tests. Participants threw a club from a custom-built throwing chair, with and without a pole. 3 D kinematic data were collected (150 Hz) for both conditions using standardized and self-selected seat configurations. Dominant and nondominant grip strength were measured using a dynamometer, and upper-body and trunk strength were measured using isometric contractions against a load cell. Results: Seated throwing with an assistive pole resulted in significantly higher hand speed at release than throwing without a pole (pole = 6. 0 +/- 1. 5 m/s, no pole = 5. 3 +/- 1. 5 m/s; P =. 02). There {{was no significant difference in}} hand speed at release between standardized and self-selected seating configurations during seated throwing with or without an assistive <b>pole.</b> <b>Grip</b> strength (r =. 59 -. 77), push/pull synergy (r =. 81 -. 84), and trunk-flexion (r =. 50 -. 58) strength measures showed large and significant correlations with hand speed at release during seated throwing with and without an assistive pole. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated the importance of the pole for SCI athletes in seated throwing and defined the relationship between strength and seated-throwing performance, allowing us to better understand the activity of seated throws and provide measures for assessing strength that may be valid for evidence-based classification...|$|R
40|$|The {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{multiple system}} atrophy (MSA) {{is characterized by}} autonomic failure, cerebellar ataxia and parkinsonism in any combination associated with predominantly oligodendroglial alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) aggregates (glial cytoplasmic inclusions = GCls). To date, there is no effective disease modifying therapy. Previous experiments {{have shown that the}} aggregation inhibitor anle 138 b reduces neurodegeneration, as well as behavioral deficits in both transgenic and toxin mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we analyzed whether anle 138 b improves motor skills and reduces neuronal loss, as well as oligodendroglial alpha-syn aggregation in the PLP-alpha-syn transgenic mouse challenged with the mitochondria' toxin 3 -nitropropionic acid (3 -NP) to model full-blown MSA. Following 1 month of treatment with anle 138 b, MSA mice showed signs of motor improvement affecting stride length, but not <b>pole,</b> <b>grip</b> strength, and beam test performance. Loss of dopaminergic nigral neurons and Purkinje cells was not attenuated and GCI density remained unchanged. These data suggest that the pathology in transgenic PLP-alpha-syn mice receiving 3 -NP might be too advanced to detect significant effects of anle 138 b treatment on neuronal loss and intracytoplasmic alpha-syn inclusion bodies. However, the partial motor amelioration may indicate potential efficacy of anle 138 b treatment that may be mediated by its actions on alpha-syn oligomers or may reflect improvement of neuronal dysfunction in neural at risk populations. Further studies are required to address the efficacy of anle 138 b in transgenic alpha-syn models of early-stage MSA {{and in the absence of}} additional toxin application...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine the}} pole vault kinematics parameters at Croatian vaulter in junior category, and to determine the relationship between kinematics parameters and maximum accomplished vault’s altitude. Further on, the goal was to gain an insight in stability and technique quality in vaulting. To that purpose, kinematics parameters of the vaults were registered (totally 13 out of 24 vaults performed on three separate trainings). The style and conditions of vaults were the same (the same <b>pole,</b> <b>grip</b> height and approach length was used). Received results of the analysis of kinematics parameters emphasised certain constancy of vault performing, therefore higher discrepancy in values of kinematics parameters between vaults was not detected. The exceptions were two vaults where difference was more than obvious. The accomplished values of kinematics parameters in this research were different and lower than those done by the world’s best junior vaulters. Further on, the best competitive results lagged behind the best young vaulters. According to these facts, it was clear that examinee vaulter lagged behind in the development of basic and specific motoric as well as in level of adopted technique. Results of regression analysis showed that only one parameter (MPB-maximum pole bending) positively influenced on variable (MABA-maximum accomplished body altitude). The speed of second to last and last step (SSLS and SLS) had relatively high regression coefficients, but those coefficients weren’t statistically important. The research gives entire new approach toward entire kinematics description of vault techniques which determines: stability of technique realisation i. e. its adaptation by multiplying the vaults of one vaulter, comparison with the technique of the most qualitative world’s vaulters, and quality assurance of the technique of the same vaulter in time function connected to development of basic and specific motoric abilities...|$|R
40|$|Ruptures of the ulnar {{collateral}} ligament of {{the thumb}} {{are one of}} the more common soft tissue ligamentous injuries of the hand. Historically called a Gamekeeper’s Thumb, this injury is now more commonly referred to as a Skier’s Thumb because it is so common in conjunction with falls during skiing. The ulnar collateral ligament spans the MP joint of the thumb. It originates at the distal portion of the thumb metacarpal and inserts on the proximal phalanx of the thumb. The function of the ulnar collateral ligament is to prevent abnormal motion of the thumb in a radial direction. The ligament becomes very important for stabilizing the thumb for any pinching type activity. Forceful grasping when the ligament is not functional can be difficult to do as well as painful. The most common mechanism for injury of the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb is a fall onto the outstretched thumb which forces the thumb in a radial direction. This can occur with almost any sport. The propensity of this liga-ment to rupture with skiing injuries is caused by one of two factors. Some skiers will hold the strap between the thumb and <b>grip</b> of the <b>pole</b> when they are skiing and then when they fall it forces the thumb into a radial deviated position. There have been some poles that were designed in theory to help avoid this position. However, newer poles fail to prevent the injury because the skier can also rupture the UCL as the thumb hits the slope during a fall. In this case, the thumb will sometimes act like a rudder as the skier falls down the mountain. Careful examination is the hallmark of making the correc...|$|R
