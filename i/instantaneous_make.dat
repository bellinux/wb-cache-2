40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: We {{describe}} a fast and effective procedure for {{the preparation of}} high efficiency hybrid photoanodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), based on nanocrystalline TiO 2 with limited addition of multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The mixing process between CNTs and TiO 2 nanoparticles is almost <b>instantaneous,</b> which <b>makes</b> it feasible for large-scale fabrication. Enhanced electron lifetime and reduced charge recombination lead to highly increased short circuit current density and overall photoconversion efficiency (from 13. 6 mA cm− 2 to 16. 0 mA cm− 2 and from 7. 0 % to 9. 0 %, respectively, considering the bare TiO 2 and the optimum CNTs concentration, which is 0. 010 wt %), while the small reduction in open circuit photovoltage does not significantly affect cell performances. This result is remarkable since a standard dye molecule (N 719) was used and no chemical treatments of the photoanodes prior to cell fabrication were applied (i. e., soaking in TiCl 4 to boost open circuit photovoltage) ...|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. We {{report a}} cubic to {{amorphous}} transformation of selenium in silica xerogel prepared through a sol–gel route. The crystalline {{nature of the}} nanoparticles examined from the SAED pattern and HRTEM revealed an α-cubic structure. The band gap energies calculated from the UV-vis absorption measurements showed a higher band gap of 3. 5 eV for the cubic form compared to 2. 4 eV for the amorphous form. The ultrafast optical nonlinearity of the samples was investigated by an open aperture Z-scan at 800 nm using 100 fs laser pulses. Although doping with cubic Se did not improve the optical limiting efficiency of silica xerogels, doping with amorphous Se results in substantial enhancement. Numerical analysis of the Z-scan data attributed the nonlinearity to two-photon and three-photon absorption and two-photon induced free carrier absorption.

40|$|The {{actual value}} of the quantum vacuum energy density is {{generally}} regarded as irrelevant in non-gravitational physics. However, this paper gives a non-gravitational system where this value does have physical significance. The system is a mirror with an internal degree of freedom which interacts with a scalar field. We find that the force exerted on the mirror by the field vacuum undergoes wild fluctuations with a magnitude proportional to the {{value of the}} vacuum energy density, which is mathematically infinite. This infinite fluctuating force gives infinite instantaneous acceleration of the mirror. We show that this infinite fluctuating force and infinite <b>instantaneous</b> acceleration <b>make</b> sense because they will not result in infinite fluctuation of the mirror's position. On the contrary, the mirror's fluctuating motion will be confined in a small region due to two special properties of the quantum vacuum: (1) the vacuum friction which resists the mirror's motion and (2) the strong anti-correlation of vacuum fluctuations which constantly changes the direction of the mirror's infinite instantaneous acceleration and thus cancels the effect of infinities to make the fluctuation of the mirror's position finite.

A 50 m glass flume has been adapted with several lateral connections (with a range of diameters, angles, intrusions, cracks), supplied by a 1 m 3 tank. Placed just below the free surface on a rotating (to scan the wet section) and translating (along the main axes of the flume) structure, velocity profiles have been recorded and accurately positioned along the reach (with data from three laser distance meters and a 3 Mpix camera) : a 3 D cloud of raw velocities is created. After raw data pretreatment (deduction of translation velocity, Nyquist jumps correction), a five step-interpolation (adapted from [16]) method has been implemented and tested: i) data filtering, ii) transformation to flume coordinates velocities, iii) isotropic gridding, iv) anisotropic gridding and v) continuity correction.

30|$|In this paper, {{a scheme}} based on WF {{algorithm}} is proposed for decentralized control of DR-enabled/flexible appliances including EVs at a distribution transformer and a home level. In contrast to the previous work, this paper focuses on restraining the instantaneous demand at the distribution transformer by controlling the responsive DR-enable appliances during stress conditions. Transformer management program (TMP) is implemented at the distribution transformer, whereas to control responsive loads, household appliances controller (HAC) is implemented at the home level. When the instantaneous demand at the transformer exceeds its rated capacity, TMP coordinates with the HAC of each home to assign demand curtailment limit (DCL). The convenience factor of each home (CF_home,i) is calculated for the allocation of DCL using WF algorithm. HAC controls the flexible appliances to <b>make</b> <b>instantaneous</b> demand of a home equal to its DCL limit and simultaneously mitigates consumer convenience level violations.

The effects of skill differences were evident in the second- and third-order state-transition diagrams for these two attractors. Our results suggest that abrupt switching between attractors is related to the diverse continuous movements resulting from quick responses to sudden changes in the environment. This abrupt-switching-quick-response behavior is characterized by a joint action syntax. The resulting hybrid dynamical system is composed of a higher module with discrete dynamics and a lower module with continuous dynamics.

Combined with birth and death of individuals, these temporal constraints affect the spread of infections in a non-trivial way and are dependent on the particular contact dynamics. We propose a stochastic model to generate temporal networks where vertices <b>make</b> <b>instantaneous</b> contacts following heterogeneous inter-event times, and leave and enter the system at fixed rates. We study how these temporal properties affect the prevalence of an infection and estimate R 0, the number of secondary infections, by modeling simulated infections (SIR, SI and SIS) co-evolving with the network structure. We find that heterogeneous contact patterns cause earlier and larger epidemics on the SIR model in comparison to homogeneous scenarios. In case of SI and SIS, the epidemics is faster {{in the early stages}} (up to 90 % of prevalence) followed by a slowdown in the asymptotic limit in case of heterogeneous patterns. In the presence of birth and death, heterogeneous patterns always cause higher prevalence in comparison to homogeneous scenarios with same average inter-event times. Our results suggest that R 0 may be underestimated if temporal heterogeneities are not taken into account in the modeling of epidemics. Comment: 5 figures + supplementary informatio...|$|R
