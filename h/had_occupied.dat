5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn.

5|$|Despite {{the end of}} Melissenos's revolt, it left a {{profound}} legacy: although Melissenos himself submitted to Alexios Komnenos, the towns he <b>had</b> <b>occupied</b> and garrisoned with Turkish soldiers in Ionia, Phrygia, Galatia, and Bithynia remained in their hands. Thus, by becoming involved in the Byzantine civil wars as mercenaries and allies – especially through their use by Botaneiates and Melissenos during their respective revolts to hold down various cities for them – the Turks completed their relatively peaceful take-over of central and western Asia Minor.|$|E

The Allies invaded Italy in September 1943 {{and by the end of}} the year <b>had</b> <b>occupied</b> most of the south of the country. Thirty-eight divisions were deployed across the Mediterranean theatre, mostly in Italy with some in North Africa.|$|E
