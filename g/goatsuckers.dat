60|$|Again, {{there are}} many {{families}} of birds which spread over the whole world, temperate and tropical, and among these the tropical species rarely present any exceptional brilliancy of colour. Such are the thrushes, <b>goatsuckers,</b> hawks, plovers, and ducks; and in the last-named group it is the temperate and arctic zones that afford the most brilliant coloration.|$|E
60|$|Nocturnal animals supply us with equally good illustrations. Mice, rats, bats, and moles {{possess the}} least {{conspicuous}} of hues, {{and must be}} quite invisible at times when any light colour would be instantly seen. Owls and <b>goatsuckers</b> are of those dark mottled tints that will assimilate with bark and lichen, and thus protect them during the day, {{and at the same}} time be inconspicuous in the dusk.|$|E
60|$|The {{theory of}} warning colours is an {{excellent}} one, {{but it has been}} pushed too far. We have seen {{that one of the most}} common fireflies is diurnal in habits, or, at any rate, that it performs all the important business of its life by day, when it has neither bright colour nor light to warn its bird enemies; and out of every hundred species of insect-eating birds at least ninety-nine are diurnal. Raptorial insects, as I have said, feed freely on fireflies, so that the supposed warning is not for them, and it would be hard to believe that the magnificent display made by luminous insects is useful only in preventing accidental injuries to them from a few crepuscular bats and <b>goatsuckers.</b> And to believe even this we should first have to assume that bats and <b>goatsuckers</b> are differently constituted from all other creatures; for in other animals--insects, birds, and mammalians--the appearance of fire by night seems to confuse and frighten, but it certainly cannot be said to warn, in the sense in which that word is used when we speak of the brilliant colours of some butterflies, or even of the gestures of some venomous snakes, and of the sounds they emit.|$|E

5000|$|Opening with [...] "The <b>Goatsucker</b> Mystery," [...] Radford {{introduced}} the essential {{portions of the}} chupacabra legend and its different versions, comparing the creatures' characteristics with another, Bigfoot, which he writes is known for leaving large footprints.

60|$|But {{even these}} fifty-three species {{by no means}} fairly {{represent}} the amount of resemblance between Britain and {398} Japan as regards birds; for there are also thrushes, robins, stonechats, wrens, hedge-sparrows, sedge-warblers, jays, starlings, swifts, <b>goatsuckers,</b> and some others, which, though distinct species from our own, have the same general appearance, and give a familiar aspect to the ornithology. There remains, however, a considerable body of Chinese and Siberian species, which link the islands to the neighbouring parts of the continent; {{and there are also}} a few which are Malayan or Himalayan rather than Chinese, and thus afford us an interesting problem in distribution.|$|E
6000|$|The desert {{birds are}} still more remarkably {{protected}} by their assimilative hues. The stonechats, the larks, the quails, the <b>goatsuckers</b> and the grouse, which abound in the North African and Asiatic deserts, are all tinted and mottled {{so as to}} resemble with wonderful accuracy the average colour and aspect of the soil in the district they inhabit. The Rev. H. Tristram, in {{his account of the}} ornithology of North Africa in the 1st volume of the [...] "Ibis," [...] says: [...] "In the desert, where neither trees, brush-wood, nor even undulation of the surface afford the slightest protection to its foes, a modification of colour which shall be assimilated to that of the surrounding country, is absolutely necessary. Hence without exception the upper plumage of every bird, whether lark, chat, sylvain, or sand-grouse, and also the fur of all the smaller mammals, and the skin of all the snakes and lizards, is of one uniform isabelline or sand colour." [...] After the testimony of so able an observer it is unnecessary to adduce further examples of the protective colours of desert animals.|$|E
60|$|Among {{the higher}} animals it {{is a very}} general fact that the males fight {{together}} for the possession of the females. This leads, in polygamous animals especially, to the stronger or better armed males becoming the parents of the next generation, which inherits the peculiarities of the parents; and thus vigour and offensive weapons are continually increased in the males, resulting in the strength and horns of the bull, the tusks of the boar, the antlers of the stag, and the spurs and fighting instinct of the gamecock. But almost all male animals fight together, though not specially armed; even hares, moles, squirrels, and beavers fight to the death, and are often found to be scarred and wounded. The same rule applies to almost all male birds; and these battles have been observed in such different groups as humming-birds, finches, <b>goatsuckers,</b> woodpeckers, ducks, and waders. Among reptiles, battles of the males are known to occur in the cases of crocodiles, lizards, and tortoises; among fishes, in those of salmon and sticklebats. Even among insects the same law prevails; and male spiders, beetles of many groups, crickets, and butterflies often fight together.|$|E
60|$|Among birds, the ptarmigan, already mentioned, must be {{considered}} a remarkable case of special adaptation. Another is a South-American <b>goatsucker</b> (Caprimulgus rupestris) which rests in the bright sunshine on little bare rocky islets in the Upper Rio Negro, where its unusually light colours so closely resemble those of the rock and sand, that it can scarcely be detected till trodden upon.|$|R
5000|$|The common {{nighthawk}} {{is sometimes called}} a [...] "bull-bat", due to its perceived [...] "bat-like" [...] flight, and the [...] "bull-like" [...] boom made by its wings as it pulls from a dive. Another name is [...] "goatsucker" [...] (the Latin for <b>goatsucker</b> is Caprimulgus), from an archaic, erroneous idea that the birds would fly into barns at night and suck dry the teats of goats.|$|R
60|$|The {{setting of}} the sun was glorious; the valleys being black, whilst the snowy peaks of the Andes yet {{retained}} a ruby tint. When it was dark, we made a fire beneath a little arbour of bamboos, fried our charqui (or dried slips of beef), took our mat√©, and were quite comfortable. There is an inexpressible charm in thus living in the open air. The evening was calm and still;--the shrill noise of the mountain bizcacha, and the faint cry of a <b>goatsucker,</b> were occasionally to be heard. Besides these, few birds, or even insects, frequent these dry, parched mountains.|$|R
6000|$|It is very suggestive {{that similar}} strange {{movements}} are performed by many birds which have no ornamental plumage to display. <b>Goatsuckers,</b> geese, carrion vultures, {{and many other}} birds of plain plumage have been observed to dance, spread their wings or tails, and perform strange love-antics. The courtship of the great albatross, a most unwieldy and dull coloured bird, has been thus described by Professor Moseley: [...] "The male, standing by the female on the nest, raises his wings, spreads his tail and elevates it, throws up his head with the bill in the air, or stretches it straight out, or forwards, {{as far as he}} can, and then utters a curious cry."[127] Mr. Jenner Weir informs me that [...] "the male blackbird is full of action, spreads out his glossy wing and tail, turns his rich golden beak towards the female, and chuckles with delight," [...] while he has never seen the more plain coloured thrush demonstrative to the female. The linnet distends his rosy breast, and slightly expands his brown wings and tail; while the various gay coloured Australian finches adopt such attitudes and postures as, in every case, to show off their variously coloured plumage to the best advantage.[128] ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the desert}} {{regions of the}} earth we find an even more general {{accordance}} of colour with surroundings. The lion, the camel, and all the desert antelopes have {{more or less the}} colour of the sand or rock among which they live. The Egyptian cat and the Pampas cat are sandy or earth coloured. The Australian kangaroos are of similar tints, and the original colour of the wild horse is supposed to have been sandy or clay coloured. Birds are equally well protected by assimilative hues; the larks, quails, <b>goatsuckers,</b> and grouse which abound in the North African and Asiatic deserts are all tinted or mottled so as closely to resemble the average colour of the soil in the districts they inhabit. Canon Tristram, who knows these regions and their natural history so well, says, in an often quoted passage: [...] "In the desert, where neither trees, brushwood, nor even undulations of the surface afford the slightest protection to its foes, a modification of colour which shall be assimilated to that of the surrounding country is absolutely necessary. Hence, without exception, the upper plumage of every bird, whether lark, chat, sylvain, or sand-grouse, and also the fur of all the smaller mammals, and the skin of all the snakes and lizards, is of one uniform isabelline or sand colour." ...|$|E
60|$|If I {{am right}} in {{thinking}} {{that it is the}} human note in the voices of some passerine birds that gives a peculiar and very great charm to their songs, so that an inferior singer shall please us more than one that ranks high, according to the accepted standard, it remains to ask why it should be so. Why, I mean, should the mere likeness to a human tone in a little singing-bird impart so great a pleasure to the mind, when the undoubtedly human-like voices of many non-passerine species do not as a rule affect us in the same way? As a matter of fact, we find in the multitude of species that resemble us in their voices a few, outside of the order of singers, that do give us a pleasure similar to that imparted by the willow wren, swallow, and tree-pipit. Thus, among British birds we have the wood-pigeon, and the stock-dove; the green woodpecker, with his laugh-like cry; the cuckoo, a universal favourite on account of his double fluty call; and (to those who are not inclined to be superstitious) the wood-owl, a most musical night-singer; and the curlew, with, in a less degree, various other shore birds. But in a majority of the larger birds of all orders the effect produced is different, and often the reverse of pleasant. Or if such sounds delight us, the feeling differs in character from that produced by the melodious singer, and is mainly due to that wildness with which we are in sympathy expressed by such sounds. Human-like voices are found among the auks, loons, and grebes; eagles and falcons; cuckoos, pigeons, <b>goatsuckers,</b> owls, crows, rails, ducks, waders, and gallinaceous birds. The cries and shrieks of some among these, particularly when heard in the dark hours, in deep woods and marshes and other solitary places, profoundly impress and even startle the mind, and have given rise all the world over to numberless superstitious beliefs. Such sounds are supposed to proceed from devils, or from demons inhabiting woods and waters and all desert places; from night-wandering witches; spirits sent to prophesy death or disaster; ghosts of dead men and women wandering by night about the world in search of a way out of it; and sometimes human beings who, burdened with dreadful crimes or irremediable griefs, have been changed into birds. The three British species best known on account of their supernatural character have very remarkable voices with a human sound in them: the raven with his angry, barking cry, and deep, solemn croak; the booming bittern; and the white or church owl, with his funereal screech.|$|E
60|$|But where, {{during the}} days when the vociferous cuckoo, with hoarse chuckle and dissyllabic call and wild {{bubbling}} cry was so much with us--where, in this period of many pleasant noises was the cuckoo's mate, or maid, or messenger, the quaint and beautiful wryneck? There are few British birds, perhaps not one--not even the crafty black and white magpie, or mysterious moth-like <b>goatsucker,</b> or tropical kingfisher--more interesting to watch. At twilight I had lingered at the woodside, also in other likely places, and the <b>goatsucker</b> had failed to appear, gliding and zig-zagging hither and thither on his dusky-mottled noiseless wings, and now this still heavier disappointment was mine. I could not find the wryneck. Those quiet grassy orchards, shut in by straggling hedges, should have had him as a favoured summer guest. Creeper and nuthatch, and starling and gem-like blue tit, found holes enough in the old trunks to breed in. And yet I knew that, albeit not common, he was there; I could not exactly say where, but somewhere {{on the other side of}} the next hedge or field or orchard; for I heard his unmistakable cry, now on this hand, now on that. Day after day I followed the voice, sometimes in my eagerness forcing my way through a brambly hedge to emerge with scratched hands and clothes torn, like one that had been set upon and mauled by some savage animal of the cat kind; and still the quaint figure eluded my vision.|$|R
60|$|There are, however, {{many other}} birds which lay their white eggs in open nests; and these afford some very {{interesting}} examples of the varied modes by which concealment may be obtained. All the duck tribe, the grebes, and the pheasants belong to this class; but these birds all have the habit of covering their eggs with dead leaves or other material whenever they leave the nest, so as effectually to conceal them. Other birds, as the short-eared owl, the <b>goatsucker,</b> the partridge, {{and some of the}} Australian ground pigeons, lay their white or pale eggs on the bare soil; but in these cases the birds themselves are protectively coloured, so that, when sitting, they are almost invisible; and they have the habit of sitting close and almost continuously, thus effectually concealing their eggs.|$|R
500|$|Chapter 17 {{argues that}} bird plumage has [...] "many devices" [...] {{to conceal the}} animals' outlines. Even the [...] "enormously {{developed}} feather-appendages" [...] of the birds of paradise are argued to provide camouflage in this way. Sexual display is mentioned but dismissed as not being the sole reason for the colours, outlines and patterns of the male birds. Chapter 18 briefly discusses mimicry, before returning to [...] "the evident paramount importance of the obliterative function", {{this time of the}} [...] "brilliant, flowerlike" [...] heads of hummingbirds. The one case that Thayer admits is mimetic is the <b>goatsucker</b> of Trinidad, a plant mimic that perches [...] "by day and night" [...] on a tree stump or branch, where the purpose of the mimicry is crypsis. Chapter 19 concludes the description of bird plumage, claiming that birds from the tropical forests to the [...] "snowy north", including woodpeckers and the blue jay are all [...] "colored for inconspicuousness".|$|R
60|$|That {{these large}} kinds thrive so well {{with us is}} an {{encouraging}} fact; but the question that concerns us at present is the feasibility of importing birds of the grove, chiefly of the passerine order, and sending them forth to give a greater variety and richness to our bird life. To go with such an object to tropical countries would only be to court failure. Nature's highest types, surpassing all others in exquisite beauty of form, brilliant colouring, and perfect melody, can never be known to our woods and groves. These rarest avian gems may not be removed from their setting, and to those who desire to know them in their unimaginable lustre, {{it will always be}} necessary to cross oceans and penetrate into remote wildernesses. We must go rather to regions where the conditions of life are hard, where winters are long and often severe, where Nature is not generous in the matter of food, and the mouths are many, and the competition great. Nor even from such regions could we take any strictly migratory species with any prospect of success. Still, limiting ourselves to the resident, and consequently to the hardiest kinds, and to those possessing only a partial migration, it is surprising to find how many there are to choose from, how many are charming melodists, and how many have the bright tints in which our native species are so sadly lacking. The field from which the supply can be drawn is very extensive, and includes the continent of Europe, the countries of North Asia, a large portion of North America and Antarctic America, or South Chili and Patagonia. It would not be going too far to say that for every English species, inhabiting the garden, wood, field, stream, or waste, {{at least half a dozen}} resident species, with similar habits, might be obtained from the countries mentioned which would be superior to our own in melody (the nightingale and lark excepted), bright plumage, grace of form, or some other attractive quality. The question then arises; What reason is there for believing that these exotics, imported necessarily in small numbers, would succeed in winning a footing in our country, and become a permanent addition to its avifauna? For it has been admitted that our species are not few, in spite of the losses that have been suffered, and that the bird population does not diminish, however much its character may have altered and deteriorated from the aesthetic point of view, and probably also from the utilitarian. There are no vacant places. Thus, the streams are fished by herons, grebes, and kingfishers, while the rushy margins are worked by coots and gallinules, and, above the surface, reed and sedge-warblers, with other kinds, inhabit the reed-beds. The decaying forest tree is the province of the woodpecker, of which there are three kinds; and the trunks and branches of all trees, healthy or decaying, are quartered by the small creeper, that leaves no crevice unexplored in its search for minute insects and their eggs. He is assisted by the nuthatch; and in summer the wryneck comes (if he still lives), and deftly picks up the little active ants that are always wildly careering over the boles. The foliage is gleaned by warblers and others; and not even the highest terminal twigs are left unexamined by tits and their fellow-seekers after little things. Thrushes seek for worms in moist grounds about the woods; starlings and rooks go to the pasture lands; the lark and his relations keep to the cultivated fields; and there also dwells the larger partridge. Waste and stony grounds are occupied by the chats, and even on the barren mountain summits the ptarmigan gets his living. Wagtails run on the clean margins of streams; and littoral birds of many kinds are in possession of the entire sea-coast. Thus, the whole ground appears to be already sufficiently occupied, the habitats of distinct species overlapping each other like the scales on a fish. And when we have enumerated all these, we find that scores of others have been left out. The important fly-catcher; the wren, Nature's diligent little housekeeper, that leaves no dusty corner uncleaned; and the pigeons, that have a purely vegetable diet. The woods and thickets are also ranged by jays, cuckoos, owls, hawks, magpies, butcher-birds-- Nature's gamekeepers, with a licence to kill, which, after the manner of game-keepers, they exercise somewhat indiscriminately. Above the earth, the air is peopled by swifts and swallows in the daytime, and by <b>goatsuckers</b> at night. And, as if all these were not enough, the finches are found scattered everywhere, from the most secluded spot in nature to the noisy public thoroughfare, and are eaters of most things, from flinty seed to softest caterpillar. This being the state of things, one might imagine that experience and observation are scarcely needed to prove to us that the exotic, strange to the conditions, and where its finest instincts would perhaps be at fault, would have no chance of surviving. Nevertheless, odd as it may seem, the small stock of facts bearing on the subject which we possess point to a contrary conclusion. It might have been assumed, for instance, that the red-legged partridge would never have established itself with us, where the ground was already fully occupied by a native species, which possessed the additional advantage of a more perfect protective colouring. Yet, in spite of being thus handicapped, the stranger has conquered a place, and has spread throughout the greater part of England. Even more remarkable is the case of the pheasant, with its rich plumage, a native of a hot region; yet our cold, wet climate and its unmodified bright colours have not been fatal to it, and practically it is one of our wild birds. The large capercailzie has also been successfully introduced from Norway. Small birds would probably become naturalized much more readily than large ones; they are volatile, and can more quickly find suitable feeding-ground, and safe roosting and nesting places; their food is also more abundant and easily found; their small size, which renders them inconspicuous, gives them safety; and, finally, they are very much more adaptive than large birds.|$|E

60|$|My {{collection}} of birds, though not very rich {{in number of}} species, was yet very interesting. I got another specimen of the rare New Guinea kite (Henicopernis longicauda), a large new <b>goatsucker</b> (Podargus superciliaris), and a most curious ground-pigeon of an entirely new genus, and remarkable for its long and powerful bill. It has been named Henicophaps albifrons. I was also much pleased to obtain a fine series of a large fruit-pigeon with a protuberance on the bill (Carpophaga tumida), and to ascertain that this was not, as had been hitherto supposed, a sexual character, but was found equally in male and female birds. I collected only seventy-three species of birds in Waigiou, but twelve of them were entirely new, and many others very rare; and as I brought away with me twenty-four fine specimens of the Paradisea rubra, I did not regret my visit to the island, although it had by no means answered my expectations.|$|R
500|$|Caprimulgus {{and the old}} name [...] "goatsucker" [...] both {{refer to}} the myth, old even {{in the time of}} Aristotle, that nightjars suckled from nanny goats, which {{subsequently}} ceased to give milk or went blind. This ancient belief is reflected in nightjar names in other European languages, such as German Ziegenmelker, Polish kozod√≥j and Italian succiacapre, which also mean <b>goatsucker,</b> but despite its antiquity, it has no equivalents in Arab, Chinese or Hindu traditions. It is likely that the birds were attracted by insects around domestic animals, and, as strange nocturnal creatures, were then blamed for any misfortune that befell the beast. Another old name, [...] "puckeridge", was used to refer to both the bird and a disease of farm animals, the latter actually caused by botfly larvae under the skin. [...] "Lich fowl" [...] (corpse bird) is an old name which reflects the superstitions that surrounded this strange nocturnal bird. Like [...] "gabble ratchet" [...] (corpse hound), it may refer to the belief that the souls of unbaptised children were doomed to wander in nightjar form until Judgement Day.|$|R
500|$|Letters to Pennant {{from the}} parson-naturalist Gilbert White form {{the first part}} of White's 1789 book, The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne. It is almost certain that the men were {{introduced}} by Gilbert's brother Benjamin White, Pennant's publisher; Gilbert seized on the opportunity to correspond, as a way of overcoming the intellectual isolation of Selborne in the absence of suitable learned societies at which he could read papers and share ideas. He knew that Pennant, with little skill or inclination as a field naturalist, was gathering observations to publish in his books; he quickly determined that he would make his own use of the correspondence, and kept copies of every letter he sent to Pennant. White was more careful than Pennant, and was sometimes critical; for example, in 1769 he objected that the <b>goatsucker</b> did not only make its sound while flying as Pennant asserted, so it was wrong to suppose that the noise must be made by the air beating against its [...] "vastly extended mouth". Pennant accepted White's criticisms graciously. Unfortunately Pennant's letters to White have been lost: White's Natural History begins with 44 of White's letters to Pennant, of which the first nine were never posted; the remaining 35 letters are dated between 4 August 1767 and 30 November 1780, covering topics as varied as whether swallows hibernate or migrate (letter 10), ring ousels (letter 20), whether peacock trains are really tails (letter 35), and thunderstorms (letter 44).|$|R

40|$|The {{breeding}} bird communities along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 100 to 5, 000 metres, South of the Annapurna range, {{have been studied}} in central Nepal, from 30 May to 14 August 1977, and from 6 October to 5 November 1978. Two comparative surveys were also conducted between 2, 500 and 5, 500 m, during July and September-October 1978, in the Manang and Mustang vallevs, on the northern slope of the main Himalaya range. For 1, 892 observation periods of 20 minutes each, carried out at 31 different altitudinal levels, a total of 15, 116 birds belonging to 344 species were recorded. Birds of prey, swifts, swallows, <b>goatsuckers,</b> and birds living along water-courses {{were not included in}} the counts. A grand total of 554 species was observed during our trips. Most of the counts were made under difficult conditions, especially during the monsoon. Species richness, species diversity and population density, although remaining high throughout the elevation gradient, diminish very slowly from the tropical lowlands to the subalpine forests. This unusual fe ature apparently results from a high speciation rate of such families as the Timaliidae, the Muscicapidae, the Turdidae and the Sylviidae in the temperate and alpine zones. Community structure, and the size of the various trophic guilds, are more closely related to the availability of the various food categories than to vegetation structure per se. Frugivorous birds are prominent only in the tropical lowlands, and seed-eaters in the upper altitu dinal levels. Terrestrial insectivores and arboreal gleaners are common at all levels, but flycatchers and bark-feeders disappear in the upper Rhododendron forest, where nectarivores reach their highest density. The narrow distribution of most species, the altitudinal zonation of allopatric congeneric species, the high turnover rate of avian communities between adjacent altitudinal levels and the differences observed between similar habitats in different valleys are pointed out. These characteristics, together with sorne infraspecific differences in altitudinal distribution and habitat preferences among the localities studied, suggest a strong interspecific competition. The large number of species present at various altitudes most likely explains why "density compensation" and "competition release" were not apparent in the area studied. Sorne information is also given on the breeding periods, clutch size and altitudinal migrations of birds observed along the Annapurna transect...|$|E
