50|$|An <b>Isoteniscope</b> is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} the vapor {{pressure}} of liquids. It consists of a submerged manometer and container holding the substance whose vapor pressure is being measured. The open end of the manometer is then connected to a pressure measuring device. A vacuum pump is used to adjust the pressure of the system and purify the sample.|$|E
5000|$|Experimental {{measurement}} of vapor pressure {{is a simple}} procedure for common pressures between 1 and 200 kPa. Most accurate results are obtained near the boiling point of substances and large errors result for measurements smaller than [...] Procedures often consist of purifying the test substance, isolating it in a container, evacuating any foreign gas, then measuring the equilibrium pressure of the gaseous phase of the substance in the container at different temperatures. Better accuracy is achieved when care is taken {{to ensure that the}} entire substance and its vapor are at the prescribed temperature. This is often done, as with the use of an <b>isoteniscope,</b> by submerging the containment area in a liquid bath.|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} characterization of lactic acid esters {{on the basis}} of their physicochemical properties. Methyl, ethyl, 2 -ethylhexyl, n-propyl, isopropyl lactate were selected. These esters are biodegradable and they are therefore considered as replacement for more toxic and dangerous solvents for industrial use. Antoine equation and Hildebrand solubility parameter was calculated from vapour pressure measured by <b>isoteniscope...</b>|$|E

The values of vapor pressure at different temperatures were obtained and &# 916;vH (and &# 916;vS) were graphically determined, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The results for diethyl-ether, propanone, ethanol and n-hexane are in very good agreement with those from literature.

40|$|A {{computerized}} tensimeter {{and experimental}} procedure for {{determination of the}} thermal decomposition temperature (T sub d) of perfluoro alkylethers were developed and tested. Both the apparatus and the procedure are described in detail. Results of testing with bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate and trimethylolpropane triheptanoate demonstrate that the reciprocal of the decomposition temperature is a linear function of the logarithm of the gas volume/heated liquid volume ratio. The T sub d obtained for each compound at a gas volume/heated liquid volume ration of one {{was similar to the}} value previously reported using an <b>isoteniscope</b> technique. Results of testing with a polymer of hexafluoropropylene oxide demonstrate that this instrument and procedure can be used to determine the T sub d of perfluoro alkylethers...|$|E
40|$|The riot-control agent 2 -chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS) and its ortho-and parasubstituted benzylidenemalononitrile (BMN) analogues were {{synthesised}} and characterised by spectroscopic techniques (IR, NMR, {{and mass}} spectrometry) and microanalysis, and their structure-biological activity relationship studies {{were carried out}} to know the factors responsible for sensory irritation. Hydrophobicity of substituted BMNs were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is an important determinant of the irritancy. The vapour pressure of a compound is a physico-chemical property important for the assessment of its fate in the environment. The vapour pressures of BMNs were determined by static method by an <b>isoteniscope.</b> A systematic investigation of sensory irritation was carried out by evaluating decrease in respiratory rate (RDs,) in mice. The R. Dsi as biological parameter was correlated with physical parameters such as hydrophobicity, vapour pressure, size of molecules, and chemical reactivity of its BMNs with dimethylaminoethyl mercaptans (DEAEMs) as a simulant of protein-SH group. A biosignifkant correlation (0. 75 - 0. 80) was obtained. by correlating all the above parameters using multiple linear regression equation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{concerns}} {{the properties of}} the concentrated bittern solutions occurring as by-product from solar salt works, in relation to their potential use as liquid desiccants in cooling systems. Solutions of compositions similar to those of bitterns have been made up in the laboratory, as have concentrated mixtures of MgCl 2 –MgSO 4 –H 2 O. Measurements of vapour pressure have been carried out using an <b>isoteniscope</b> and are reported together with measurements of density and viscosity. Several theoretical models representing these properties are reviewed and compared against the experimental results; the average agreement between theory and experiment is within 5 % for vapour pressure and better for the preferred models of the other two properties. Based on these findings, an expression is provided for the equilibrium relative humidity of bitterns as a function of concentration relative to raw seawater. The vapour pressures of bittern solutions are found to be similar to those of solutions containing only magnesium chloride but having the same mass fraction of total salts. Therefore magnesium chloride solution is a reasonable model for bitterns for the purpose of developing the proposed cooling system...|$|E
