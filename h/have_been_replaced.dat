5|$|At the Leipzig {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria. The cantata was transposed from C major to E-flat major at Leipzig, where the recorders may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by transverse flutes.|$|E
5|$|For years Oldham's {{economy was}} heavily {{dependent}} on manufacturing industry, especially textiles and mechanical engineering. Since the deindustrialisation of Oldham in the mid-20th century, these industries <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by home shopping, publishing, healthcare and food processing sectors, though factory-generated employment retains a significant presence. Many of the modern sectors are low-skill and low-wage.|$|E

5|$|Maes {{stated that}} time proved Rimsky-Korsakov correct {{when it came}} to posterity's re-evaluation of Mussorgsky's work. Mussorgsky's musical style, once {{considered}} unpolished, is now admired for its originality.

5|$|The boards on the {{exterior}} of the barn are made from a mixture of oak, elm and softwoods such as pine and fir. Some are of modern or relatively modern origins; those on {{the south end of the}} barn are noticeably lighter in colour than the rest and are the result of the repairs made after the 1972 fire. Each side of the barn's roof holds 92 tile courses and a total of around 76,000 tiles, which were originally held in place by oak pegs. Many of the tiles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> over the years and the oak pegs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by galvanised peg nails due to the effects of decay.|$|E

5|$|Descendants of Wyatt Earp's cousins {{assert that}} Earp carried the pistol {{featured}} in the auction and while in Tombstone, although the grips, barrel, and cylinder <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced.</b> Only the frame is original, and its serial number has been filed off. However, X-ray testing showed an original serial number, 5686, which matches a batch of revolvers purchased by the U.S. Army in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Further {{renovation}} {{work in the}} early 1970s led to improvements in the building's structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building's fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkström. Fire protection equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before {{the end of}} the 1870s, much of the {{original}} land grant <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by tracts of 40 acre. By 1880, cattle raising <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by agriculture as the most important local industry. During the years between 1910 and 1940, most of the agricultural land <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> by homes and factories.|$|R

5|$|However, {{their larger}} sizes and very {{aggressive}} behavior also {{make them a}} serious threat to native species of skeleton shrimp. A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres was {{the first}} tyre {{manufacturer}} {{in the world to}} fully eliminate high-aromatic oils from its production process. Used as plasticising agents in tread production and to facilitate the compounding of rubber, they contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a carcinogen, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by low-aromatic oils. In 2006, Nokian Tyres received a commendation in the Finnish round of the European Business Awards for the Environment.|$|E

5|$|Several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following Caligaris release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to Caligari from Universum Film AG in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, which never materialized before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast Jean Cocteau as Cesare, and a script, believed to be written by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with a French surrealist style.|$|E
5|$|Since the deindustrialisation of {{the region}} in the mid-20th century, these {{industries}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by newer sectors and industries, although many of the civic developments that accompanied industrialisation remain in the form of public buildings; a town hall, public baths and library. The few surviving cotton mills are now occupied by warehousing and distribution companies, or used as space for light industry.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} other modes of feeding. Grimpoteuthis has a reduced or {{non-existent}} radula and swallows prey whole.
