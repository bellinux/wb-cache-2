40|$|Little use {{has been}} made of {{pressure}} <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> for the manufacture of copper or copper alloy parts {{due in large part to}} poor economics resulting from short <b>die</b> life in <b>casting</b> these high melting metals. A research program initiated in 1997 was driven by the promise of a signifi cant increase in the energy effi ciency of the induction motor by substituting high conductivity copper for aluminum in the rotor “squirrel cage ” structure. Use of high temperature materials including tungsten-, molybdenum- and nickel-base alloys was examined in an extensive series of casting trials. The importance of operating dies at elevated temperatures to minimize the cyclic temperature gradient through the die that leads to heat checking and cracking has been demonstrated by both thermal modeling and experimentation. Shot-by-shot induction melting of the copper charge has been implemented and is described. Performance of motors with <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> copper <b>rotors</b> is compared to that of the aluminum rotor.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of losses due to skewing in induction machines. Normally skewing is done in induction machines to reduce noise, torque ripples and selective harmonics on the rotor cage of the machine. Skewing also can increase the effect of inter-bar currents in the machine. Due to <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> of <b>rotor</b> bars in the rotor at high temperatures, a very low resistance path develops between rotor bars. This resistance is called inter-bar resistance. Skewing is believed to promote these inter-bar currents and increase the stray losses happening in an induction machine. The work was carried out using both measurements as well as simulations using finite element analysis. Two rotors were available at the Laboratory, one a skewed and another non-skewed rotor for a 37 kW induction machine. Locked rotor measurements were done by using both the rotors and the losses were calculated. Comprehensive measurements were done by changing different parameters such as frequency, torque, flux and current. A magnetic equivalent circuit and a multislice FEM model were also used to validate {{the results from the}} skewed machine. A small inter-bar resistance measurement set-up was also made. In the end all the data from both measurements and simulations were analyzed and conclusions were drawn...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The ideal {{squirrel}} cage motor should have a varying rotor resistance; large at standstill, and decreasing as the speed rises. Overseas - designed high impedance rotors try to fulfil these conditions - mostly used are double cage <b>rotors</b> and <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> aluminium <b>rotors.</b> However, in the South African coal-mining industry these rotors recorded high rate failures with heavy financial losses. As a result, {{the need for an}} alternative rotor type that was able to comply with basic conditions ignored before appeared on the market: • Higher reliability with extended life expectancy • Lower total ownership costs • Easy re-manufacturing with components available on the market • Specific performance stability at competitive price. Over the years, only two principles were tacitly accepted in designing {{squirrel cage}} rotors: 1. For a single cage rotor, in a circumferential direction around the rotor the squirrel cage bars are placed in the same cylindrical shell, with the same shape and same conductivity. 2. For a double cage rotor, the same rule as above applies; however, in the radial direction, the bars have different shapes and typically different conductivities. The Invention is based on a new principle, i. e. "in a circumferential direction around the squirrel cage rotor, squirrel cage bars may have different conductivities and same shapes, or different conductivities and different shapes”. Mixed Conductivity Fabricated Rotors (MCFR) are designed and manufactured based on this new principle, and are able to withstand the harsh South African mining conditions. Since patented, the invention has been materialised in a set of special rotors powering continuous miners of a reputable coal-mining house, which was spending about R 5 million annually on replacing specific imported <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> aluminium <b>rotors</b> only. Fully complying with the above-mentioned basic conditions, the patent offers a large variety of technical and economical advantages, increasing mining processes efficiency beyond expectations. The thesis describes the MCFR's design adaptability by altering the rotor design {{to meet the demands of}} a specific engineering application as a base line of drives design. The patent is part of the new South African trend of increasing processes efficiency. It offers large possibilities of designing dedicated motors with a positive impact on the South African economy. Some socio-economical advantages are worthy of considerable study: • Being locally manufactured, the MCFR may reduce the country's economical dependence. • Requiring no special expertise, the MCFR can be produced in any quantity and size without excessive investment. • The MCFR offers an alternative option (product interchangeability) on the market as well as sound competition (with export potential). • The patent ensures business sustainability conditions which diffuse financial constraints on motor manufacturers and end-users during the re-capitalisation process (very loaded in South African economic and industrial environment).
