40|$|Spatially tuned {{resonant}} nano-clusters allow high {{local field}} enhancement when excited by electromagnetic radiation. A number of phenomena {{has been described}} and subsequently applied {{for the construction of}} novel nano- and bionano-devices. Easy to manufacture, cost efficient and high throughput transducers using metal cluster resonance technology are based on surface-enhancement of metal cluster light absorption (SEA). The optical phenomenon driving SEA in metal cluster films is the so-called anomalous absorption. At a well defined nanometric distance of a cluster to a mirror the reflected electromagnetic field has the same phase at the position of the absorbing cluster as the incident fields. This feedback mechanism strongly enhances the effective cluster absorption coefficient. Such a system is characterized by a narrow reflection minimum. Based on this SEA-phenomenon (licensed to and further developed by november AG) a number of commercial products has been constructed. BrandsealingR uses the patented SEA cluster technology to produce optical codings. Cluster SEA thin film systems show a characteristic color-flip effect and are extremely robust. Both properties are vital for application as a unique security feature. The specific narrow band multi-resonance of the cluster layers allow easy authentication of the optical code. This can be achieved with a <b>hand-held</b> <b>reader</b> being developed by november AG and Siemens AG. SEA features are machine-readable which makes them superior to comparable technologies.

40|$|Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and the {{associated}} condition of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) {{are the most common}} cause of unexpected death in developed nations. DVT is an internal clot formed in one of the body's deep veins, typically in the leg. If a part of the clot breaks free and moves into the lung, it can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) which is often fatal. D-dimer is a recognised marker for the diagnosis of thrombus and is routinely used by skilled technical staff as part of an ELISA technique in hospital laboratories. Current D-dimer point-of-care tests are not sufficiently quantitative to allow them to be used to exclude DVT/PE. As a consequence, clinicians need to rely on the use of expensive Doppler ultrasound imaging (DUS), creating additional pressure on national health services. The DUS examination can take several days, during which time heparin is required to be administered to the patient. There is increasing in the development of low cost Lab-on-a-chip systems that will allow chemical and biological processing by non-specialist staff. A low cost, easy to use, portable and quantitative device for DVT/PE would be highly desirable since it would provide reliable diagnosis and aid faster treatment and recovery as well as lower healthcare provider costs. The authors report on the development of a portable system for the quantification of D-dimer in whole blood through the use of a label-free impedimetric approach for monitoring ligand-receptor (antigen-antibody) immunoassay.

40|$|IntroductionSeveral {{inflammatory}} markers {{have been}} associated with a greater likelihood of cardiovascular diseases. Of those C-reactive protein (CRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) are the most well known. The development of sensitive rapid tests for MPO and hs-CRP, together with a simple <b>hand-held</b> <b>reader</b> promises to open up the possibility of identifying high-risk patients early enough for the introduction of prophylactic therapies or the adoption of beneficial life-style changes. ObjectivesWe propose to evaluate the cardiovascular risk for 50 hypertensive and diabetic patients by rapid tests for MPO and hs-CRP and to compare with endothelial function and Framingham score. ResultsWe evaluate prospectively 50 patients without cardiovascular events, the mean age is 53 years, 78 % have mean or high CV risk according to the Framingham score and 38 % presenting endothelial dysfunction. The statistical analysis showed a significant association between the rate of hs-CRP, the Framingham score (p= 0, 02, r= 0, 424), with the metabolic syndrome (p= 0, 0001), and endothelial dysfunction (p= 0, 001). MPO level is correlated with the sex (p= 0, 002), age (p= 0, 05), as well with the Framingham score (r= 0, 345), the metabolic syndrome (p= 0, 001), the endothelial dysfunction (p= 0, 001), and also with the LDL cholesterol. (p= 0, 04; r= 0, 3). In the same way, a significant Correlation was shown between hs-CRP and MPO (p= 0, 016; r= 0, 34). The hs-CRP test showed a good specificity (85 %), and VPP (96 %), a weak VPN (27 %). However MPO test showed a low specificity (25 %) low sensitivity (25 %), VPP of (73 %) and a low VPN (5 %). ConclusionThe hs-CRP represents the inflammatory marker most relevant in the prediction of risk CV, better than the MPO. These markers reflect the clinical potential of atherothrombotic disease may allow more precise risk stratification and prognostication in high-risk populations, and perhaps earlier diagnosis and intervention in patients at risk for or with occult cardiovascular disease...|$|E

Because paper is a planar, flexible and light weight substrate, the devices can be transported and disposed easily.

On the other hand, platforms including printed electrodes can be coupled with <b>hand-held</b> <b>readers.</b> They enable electrochemical detection with improved reliability, sensitivity and selectivity compared with colorimetric assays. In this thesis, different roll-to-roll compatible printing technologies were utilized for the fabrication of low-cost paper-based sensor platforms. The platforms intended for colorimetric assays and microfluidics were fabricated by patterning the paper substrates with hydrophobic vinyl substituted polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) -based ink. Depending on the barrier properties of the substrate, the ink either penetrates into the paper structure creating e. g. microfluidic channel structures or remains on the surface creating a 2 D analog of a microplate. The printed PDMS can be cured by a roll-ro-roll compatible infrared (IR) sintering method. The performance of these platforms was studied by printing glucose oxidase-based ink on the PDMS-free reaction areas. The subsequent application of the glucose analyte changed the colour of the white reaction area to purple with the colour density and intensity depending on the concentration of the glucose solution. Printed electrochemical cell platforms were fabricated on paper substrates with appropriate barrier properties by inkjet-printing metal nanoparticle based inks and by IR sintering them into conducting electrodes. Printed PDMS arrays were used for directing the liquid analyte onto the predetermined spots on the electrodes. Various electrochemical measurements were carried out both with the bare electrodes and electrodes functionalized with e. g. self assembled monolayers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the effect of an {{electronic}} noise-monitoring device (NoiseSign) at reducing noise levels in quiet study areas in an academic library. Design/methodology/approach: Surveys and decibel-level measurements were used to measure the perceived and objective noise levels, respectively, in both an intervention and a control area of two major branch libraries. Patrons’ perception of noise was measured with a passive paper and online survey, which asked patrons to rate the current noise level and their desired noise level. The actual noise measurements were collected twice a day with a <b>hand-held</b> decibel <b>reader</b> for 60 seconds and then corroborated after the intervention with automatically logged decibel readings from the noise monitor device in the two intervention areas. The authors conducted one-way ANOVA’s to determine if the results were significant.

The surveys comments and anecdotal observation of the spaces while doing measurements did reveal that noise in the quiet study areas was not the primary source of complaints.

40|$|ICTs can now {{be found}} in the most {{unlikely}} places. In Botswana´s southern Kweneng and Kgatleng districts, they are even to {{be found in the}} stomachs of more than 135, 000 cattle. The cattle are participants in an initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture called the Livestock Identification Trace-back System (LITS), which aims to ensure that cattle in Botswana can be individually identified and traced throughout their lives. The system has been introduced to enable Botswana to comply with new regulatory procedures required by the European Union, which accounts for 80 to 90 % of Botswana´s beef exports. The regulations, imposed following the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Europe, stipulate that all imports of deboned beef must be traceable from the packing plant back to the individual farms in the country of origin. Thus, exporting countries must set up and maintain a database on the production, distribution, processing and sale of meat products. LITS employs radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to capture data on individual cattle, which is transmitted directly, error-free, to a central database. The database enables Botswana´s meat export agency to obtain EU certification for its beef exports (see elsewhere in this issue), and is a key repository of information for livestock farmers, as well as for state veterinary services and health authorities. LITS is being implemented by AST Botswana and Inala Identification and Control (South Africa). The first phase, completed in 2001, involved the development of the database and the identification of all cattle in two pilot districts. In the second phase the system is being extended, and will eventually be the world´s largest livestock tracking, monitoring and management system using RFID technology, involving an estimated 3 million head of cattle. RFID technology At the core of the system is a bolus containing a transponder that is, with the aid of an applicator, inserted into each animal´s rumen. Each bolus carries a unique ID number and other data that can be read by fixed or portable readers and relayed to the database. Fixed readers, placed at over 300 strategic locations, scan the ID numbers and relay information on, for example, new registrations and disease treatments to 46 district offices. Extension officers are equipped with <b>hand-held</b> <b>readers</b> that allow them to collect data on cattle in their ´crushes´ or kraals. The convenience, speed and accuracy of the LITS system have brought many benefits for Botswana´s livestock farmers, veterinary officers and health authorities. It can be used to locate lost or stolen cattle, and to monitor and manage disease outbreaks. The stomach bolus is safe for the animals, there are few field losses, criminal tampering is not possible, and it is easy to read because it is always in the same place. Also, the bolus is retrieved at the slaughterhouse and can be recycled, keeping costs low. It is a vast improvement on passive livestock identification systems such as ear tags, which require animals to be checked manually until the correct one is found. Locating a dozen cattle that require treatment from a herd of 200 used to be very time consuming. Now, all the animals simply file between two RFID readers, and a control gate automatically guides the required cattle into an isolation pen. New ways of working LITS has encouraged everyone involved in livestock management to be more thorough and to be creative in finding new ways of working and monitoring performance. Veterinary officers, for example, can now: rapidly isolate animals for treatment; update health records at the point of treatment; track weight gain in selected animals; correlate feeding programmes with yield; select specific bulls for breeding programmes; and track animal family trees. Livestock are not only valuable assets, they are also the start of a food supply chain with serious consequences in terms of health and profitability if the risks are not properly managed. RFID technology can make a significant contribution to the auditing of livestock lifecycles for many purposes, ranging from improving yield and optimizing feeding regimes, to ensuring conformance with EU regulations. The LITS initiative has demonstrated the direct and immediate benefits that can be achieved through the application of established and emerging technologies. In Botswana the system is helping to ensure the long-term security of its beef export market and offers an additional marketing edge, enabling the country to compete worldwide for new export orders. The same principles are now being used to assist sheep and ostrich farmers in South Africa. mailto:tinus@inala. co. za Tinus Burger is a member of the LITS implementation team.
