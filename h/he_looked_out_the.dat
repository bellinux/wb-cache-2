60|$|Harris {{opened the}} door and the Commander went out into the hall. Harris closed the door after him and then went back across the room. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window for a moment, his hands in his pockets.|$|E
6000|$|Hardly had {{the words}} passed his lips when the wagon shook; {{there was a}} sound of {{breaking}} reims and trampling hoofs. Once more <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> oxen had [...] "skrecked" [...] in a mob. There they were, running away into the night and the snow, seeking to find shelter from the cold. In a minute they had vanished utterly. There {{was nothing to be}} done, except wait for the morning.|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} the north wind dropped suddenly, {{and an hour}} later it sprang up from the south, and by midnight a torrent of rain was falling. Godfrey could hear sounds like the reports of cannon above the pattering of the rain on the skins, and knew {{that it must be}} the ice breaking. In the morning when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> whole mass of ice seemed to be moving. Black cracks showed {{everywhere}} across the white surface. The river had during the night risen another twenty feet. By mid-day the scene was a wild one indeed. No longer was the surface smooth. Hurrying along at the rate of fifteen miles an hour the great masses of ice were dashed against each other by the force of the current.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} well," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and glancing at his watch. [...] "Our rate at present is fifty-three {{and a half}} miles an hour." ...|$|R
50|$|Eighteen {{months after}} {{the events of the}} {{previous}} film, the world has fallen into chaos. In the collapsing ruins of the White House, President Gerald Fitzhugh (Louis Gossett Jr.) videotapes a confession. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window as a shadowy figure arrives in the doorway.|$|R
60|$|David {{smiled a}} little sadly as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> across <b>the</b> tree tops.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has been}} dead hours," [...] {{he said to the}} constable, [...] "six or seven hours, I should say. Let us look round. The window is open, you see. Can the murderer have entered there?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> wall was covered with ivy, and a massive stem grew close to the window. [...] "Yes," [...] he went on, [...] "an active man could have climbed that. See, there are some leaves on the ground. I think, Harpur, your best plan will be to go down and take your station there and see no one comes along or {{disturbs}} anything. See, this jewel-box on the table has been broken open and the contents are gone, and I do not see her watch anywhere. Well, that is enough to do at present; we will lock this room up again until Mr. Volkes comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|A year or {{two after}} this time, when Marco had been entirely cured of all such faults, he one day asked Forester {{to explain to him}} how he knew where he went on this memorable forenoon; and Forester willingly {{explained}} it to him. It seems that Forester's father, though a very gentle and kind-hearted man, was a very shrewd one, and having been accustomed to the discovery, {{in the course of his}} practice, of all sorts of pranks and roguery, was less disposed to place confidence in others till he knew the confidence was deserved, than Forester himself was, who had less experience. And when he knew that Forester had gone away, leaving Marco alone, he doubted a little whether he would remain industriously at his work. While he was thinking of this, he heard a slight noise which Marco made with his feet against the clapboards of the house in getting out the window. He therefore came into the study a moment afterward, and found that Marco had gone. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and saw him going off toward the other boys. Just at that moment the man came to help him prune his trees, but before he began this work he went into the house to James, called him to a window and pointed out Marco to him, and said, ...|$|E
6000|$|He rode off, leaving Steadfast with temper more determined, but mind {{not more}} at ease. The {{appointment}} of a woodward was bad news, for the copsewood and the game had been left to their fate {{for the last few}} years, and what were the rights of the landlord over them Stead did not know, so that there might be many causes of trouble, especially if the said woodward considered him a person to be specially watched. Indeed, the existence of such a person would make a renewal of what Mr. Elmwood called the prelatist assembly impossible, and with a good deal of sorrow he announced the fact on the next market day to Mrs. Lightfoot. He could not see Dr. Eales, but when next he came in, she gave him a paper on which was simply marked [...] "Ps. xxxvii, 7." [...] <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> reference and found [...] "Hold thee still in the Lord and abide patiently upon Him." [...] Stead hoped that Patience and the rest would never know what an offer had been made to him, but Master Brown, who had recommended him, and who did not at all like the prospect of a strange woodward, came to expostulate with him for throwing away such a chance for a mere whim, telling Patience she was a sensible wench and ought to persuade her brother to see what was for his own good and the good of all, holding up himself as an example.|$|E
5000|$|Happier than Paul Revere with a Cell Phone: Paul Revere who {{is inside}} {{a home in}} Concord, Massachusetts, notices a bell ringing from a church. As <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, <b>he</b> calls {{on his cell phone}} and warns that the British are coming. Afterwards, he returns to his guests and plays charades.|$|R
60|$|Standing a short {{distance}} back from <b>the</b> end window, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> between <b>the</b> crossbeams.|$|R

6000|$|I {{was told}} by the next keeper, that on the 8th of June following, a {{particularly}} clear and beautiful morning, he rose about half an hour before sunrise, and having a little time to spare, for his custom was to extinguish his lights at sunrise, walked down toward the shore to see what he might find. When he got {{to the edge of the}} bank he looked up, and, to his astonishment, saw the sun rising, and already part way above the horizon. Thinking that his clock was wrong, he made haste back, and though it was still too early by the clock, extinguished his lamps, and when he had got through and come down, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, and, to his still greater astonishment, saw the sun just where it was before, two-thirds above the horizon. He showed me where its rays fell on the wall across the room. He proceeded to make a fire, and when he had done, there was the sun still at the same height. Whereupon, not trusting to his own eyes any longer, he called up his wife to look at it, and she saw it also. There were vessels in sight on the ocean, and their crews, too, he said, must have seen it, for its rays fell on them. It remained at that height for about fifteen minutes by the clock, and then rose as usual, and nothing else extraordinary happened during that day. Though accustomed to the coast, he had never witnessed nor heard of such a phenomenon before. I suggested that there might have been a cloud in the horizon invisible to him, which rose with the sun, and his clock was only as accurate as the average; or perhaps, as he denied the possibility of this, it was such a looming of the sun as is said to occur at Lake Superior and elsewhere. Sir John Franklin, for instance, says in his Narrative, that when he was on the shore of the Polar Sea, the horizontal refraction varied so much one morning that [...] "the upper limb of the sun twice appeared at the horizon before it finally rose." ...|$|E
50|$|Andrés, Lamont's helper, drives Tom and Lamont to Glen's {{house and}} they watch his shocked {{expression}} as he opens their letters. They see him argue briefly with Fulton Bishop before they leave. The two learn that Jerry hired his friend, {{a man named}} Schilling, to shoot at Tom when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. Tom calls Sarah, but he hangs up without saying anything. He then tries to call his mother, but the phone is answered by Dr. Milton, so he hangs up again.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the end of}} his 31 October shift, Schoolcraft {{felt sick}} and intimidated. With {{permission}} from Huffman, he left the station an hour early, went home, took some Nyquil, and fell asleep. [...] At 6 PM, his father called with a warning message. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and saw police massing in the street. He stayed on the phone. After 9 PM, he heard people moving upstairs. The officers obtained a key to the apartment after telling the landlord that Schoolcraft was suicidal.|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes passed}} in silence. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window, frowning. She sat as before.|$|R

2500|$|In National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989), Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) {{reads the}} story to his {{extended}} family, but changes <b>the</b> narrative when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and sees Cousin Eddie and Eddie's kidnapped hostage (Clark's boss) approaching the house. Instead of describing the [...] "miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer", Clark describes the strange event taking place in his front yard.|$|R
5000|$|At the time, I {{remember}} being mystified by the poem. However, being properly trained in literary criticism, I {{wondered what the}} real meaning of the poem was, what it was really about. ... What is left out of Williams' poem {{is the fact that}} when he conceived that image he was sitting at the bedside of a very sick child (Williams was a medical doctor). The story goes that as he sat there, deeply concerned about the child, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, saw that image, and penned those words.|$|E
5000|$|Lum {{was also}} the unwitting {{inspiration}} for Hank’s [...] "I Saw the Light" [...] Hank, Audrey and the band, six people altogether, were crammed into a 1942 Chevy. As you can imagine, {{it was hard for}} any of them to rest comfortably. Lum raised up to change positions. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and as he lay back down, he stated [...] "We’re getting close to Montgomery. I saw the light." [...] Referring to a beacon light near town that was always a landmark for the band as they returned home from shows.|$|E
50|$|Fagan {{told the}} story of the park's origin: <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and spotted a leprechaun digging in the hole. He ran down and grabbed the leprechaun, which meant that he had earned a wish. Fagan said he wished for a park of his own, but since he had not {{specified}} the size of the park in his wish, the leprechaun gave him the hole. Over the next two decades, Fagan often featured the park and its head leprechaun in his whimsical column. Fagan claimed to be the only person who could see the head leprechaun, Patrick O'Toole.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the play, Tyltyl {{shows what}} he has learned about happiness. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window at the forest and remarks how {{beautiful}} it is. The inside of the house looks much lovelier to him than it did before. Also, he creates great happiness for another by giving his pet bird, which seems much bluer than before, to the sick child.|$|R
50|$|According to Bellecourt's first-person {{account of}} this time, he was in solitary {{confinement}} for a discipline infraction when he heard someone outside his cell singing and calling his name. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> peep-hole {{into the eyes of}} Eddie Benton Banai. Having witnessed Bellecourt's ability to organize the Indian inmates, Banai had come to persuade him to help form an Indian cultural group. After negotiation with his caseworker Donahue, Bellecourt agreed to help, on the conditions that he would be moved from solitary to what was called the Honors Dormitory, be allowed to work in the power plant, and to pursue completion of his Boiler Engineer License.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, when he {{purchased}} a DC-3, Zollner {{was the first}} to fly his players to away games. Several years later, the Minneapolis Lakers were stranded in Milwaukee after playing a game against the Milwaukee Hawks; the temperature was , and the train was running well behind schedule. Zollner sent the plane to Milwaukee to meet the players and bring them to the game, but due to a mixup, coach John Kundla was left behind. He had gone to the dining car and didn't get word. As the train pulled out the station, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and saw the other players waving to him.|$|E
50|$|Kii Kogami hates {{his normal}} {{everyday}} life and wishes for something to happen. One day {{in the middle of}} class, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and sees his teacher's head explode when a little girl hits it. He goes to the bathroom to calm himself, but when he gets back to the classroom, he finds most of his classmates killed by the same little girl.|$|R

60|$|Dawes jerked suddenly, {{as if he}} {{had been}} held on a strain. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over <b>the</b> sea, but he saw nothing.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> down at Frona. She was {{steadying}} the box, and {{her face}} was composed. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over <b>the</b> crowd and saw unbelief. Many were laughing.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> towards <b>the</b> gig wherein Grace sat, {{her face}} still {{turned in the}} {{opposite}} direction. [...] "She doesn't see us. Well, never mind: let her be." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over <b>the</b> water <b>he</b> {{saw that}} Margery had progressed {{considerably}} {{since he had}} seen her last, but she was still farther from shore than before.|$|R
6000|$|Therefore, when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> door to see Columbine swiftly {{riding up}} the trail, her fair hair flying and {{shining in the}} sunlight, he merely ejaculated, [...] "Ahuh!" ...|$|R
60|$|Another {{flash of}} lightning, but less vivid, {{interrupted}} his meditations. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> front window towards where Dick had been standing. Then {{he gave a}} cry of alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Row {{around in}} <b>the</b> creek while <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> for <b>the</b> {{stuff in the}} fair. It won't be any more'n fun, an' if you'll come over I'll take you out." ...|$|R
