On October9, winds increased to gale-force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. By October10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane-force winds roughly 15mi (25km) {{from the center of the}} storm. Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo.
