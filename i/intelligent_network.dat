40|$|Abstract. Flame image processing-based <b>intelligent</b> <b>networked</b> {{control system}} scheme of roller kiln is {{proposed}} in the paper. Flame image recognition method of simulating artificial-look-fire is proposed for the auxiliary detection of roller kiln burning zone conditions so as to improve the real-time detection accuracy of roller kiln burning zone and the control effect. The hardware and software platform of the system are also designed. The system proposed is mainly composed of six module such as key process detection module, flame process module, recognition model for burning zone, industrial control computer, network transmission module, and actuators. System software is mainly composed of five modules. In conclusion, the paper provides a kind of new method and new idea for research and design on flame image processing-based <b>intelligent</b> <b>networked</b> control system of roller kiln...|$|R
