There are 2GB (black), 4GB (black, red, blue, white or indigo) and 8GB (black) models. The case has been redesigned to look more square (including the navigation pad, which is also no longer backlit) and is constructed of higher-quality plastic, the clip is no longer removable, and the player now supports folder browsing and ReplayGain support. Transition times between tracks was reduced, but Sandisk officially declined to support gapless playback. A microSDHC card slot has been added, allowing the storage capacity of the device to be expanded by up to an additional 32GB. The Clip+ also has added features when playing slotMusic and slotRadio.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of {{discrete}} clamp stretch forming machine based on flexible holding technology was developed to improve the performance of traditional rigid clamp stretch forming machine used for double-curvature metal sheet forming, and its forming characters were illuminated simply. The FE model of flexible discrete clamp stretch forming was set up, and extensive numerical simulations of spherical parts for both the flexible <b>holding</b> <b>mode</b> and the rigid <b>holding</b> <b>mode</b> were carried out by dynamic explicit finite element analysis. The numerical {{results show that the}} distribution of stress, strain and thickness were well-proportioned in the flexible <b>holding</b> <b>mode.</b> The larger the spherical radius is, the smaller the minimum transitional length of sheet metal is. The transitional length of 60 mm is suitable for flexible discrete clamp stretch forming in the case of considering the forming quality and material utilization. Then, the stretch forming experiment proves that the flexible holding technology is feasible, and the error contrast illustrates the {{new type of}} discrete clamp stretch forming machine is practicable...|$|R

50|$|A typical {{sample and}} hold circuit stores {{electric}} charge in a capacitor and contains at least one switching device such as a FET (field effect transistor) switch and normally one operational amplifier. To sample the input signal the switch connects the capacitor to the output of a buffer amplifier. The buffer amplifier charges or discharges the capacitor so that the voltage across the capacitor is practically equal, or proportional to, input voltage. In <b>hold</b> <b>mode</b> the switch disconnects the capacitor from the buffer. The capacitor is invariably discharged by its own leakage currents and useful load currents, which makes the circuit inherently volatile, but the loss of voltage (voltage drop) within a specified hold time remains within an acceptable error margin.|$|E

40|$|Cooperative {{decision}} and control for mobile robot {{teams have been}} of great interest in the control community. A lot of effort has been put into this area. Groups of mobile robots working cooperatively lead to many advantages {{in a variety of}} critical applications. With the expectation that unmanned mobile robots can perform key roles in future civilian or military missions, the research on mobile robot control is likely to increase rapidly in the near future. The objective of this dissertation is to use model predictive control (MPC) to coordinate the motion of nonholonomic mobile robots. Specifically, we consider the formation control of a group of mobile robots and trajectory tracking and point stabilization of nonholonomic vehicles. The formation control problem is addressed by a Lyapunov-based nonlinear controller design for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and in the context of MPC for nonholonomic mobile robots. For the UAV formation problem, a two-layered hierarchical control scheme is presented. Assuming that an autopilot operating in <b>holding</b> <b>mode</b> controls the UAV dynamics at the low-layer, a simplified nonholonomic model is constructed for the high...|$|R
40|$|Track {{and hold}} {{circuits}} {{play a key}} role in mixed-signal, analog to digital interfaces. They are often used as part of the analog to digital conversion (ADC) process whereby a time-varying analog signal is sampled at the transition of a clock signal and subsequently held for a part of the conversion process. This approach is used, in part, because the remainder of the ADC conversion process is adversely affected if the input signal varies during the conversion.;Noise, and in particular thermal noise, is recognized as a major bottleneck limiting the performance of switched-capacitor circuits and it is essential that all of the major contributors to noise are appropriately considered when designing any switched-capacitor circuit. Invariably, switched-capacitor (SC) circuit designers only discuss noise generated in the track mode when reporting noise performance and correspondingly ignore noise generated in the <b>hold</b> <b>mode.</b> In particular, most authors simply use the well-known expression kT/C to represent the variance of sampled thermal noise present on a sampling capacitor [16]-[19]. The spectrum of the continuous-time sample and hold noise has been discussed as the switches capacitor circuitry field evolved [1]-[3] but the early authors didn 2 Ì 7 t discuss the relationship between the spectrum of the sample and hold noise and the sampled noise characterized with the kT/C expression. More important, noise present during the <b>hold</b> <b>mode</b> which affects subsequent sampling has not been discussed in the literature. In the thesis, the continuous noise which is generated during the second phase of a SC circuit will be compared to the S/H noise.;In chapter two of this thesis, a numerical comparison between the RMS value of the continuous-time S/H noise and the sampled kT/C noise is presented. In chapter three, thermal noise present during the <b>hold</b> <b>mode</b> for two switched-capacitor circuits which are often used in analog to digital converters are investigated and compared with the standard sampled noise expression. In chapter four, it is shown that when these switched-capacitor circuits are used in an analog to digital converter with low speed and small resolution, the continuous-time hold noise can be justifiably neglected but when the sample frequency and resolution get higher, the noise that is generated in the hold phase is not negligible and can cause significant performance degradation of the system...|$|E

40|$|By {{virtue of}} their general ability to bind (hold) translocating or {{unfolding}} polypeptides otherwise doomed to aggregate, molecular chaperones are commonly dubbed "holdases". Yet, chaperones also carry physiological functions that do not necessitate prevention of aggregation, such as altering the native states of proteins, as in the disassembly of SNARE complexes and clathrin coats. To carry such physiological functions, major members of the Hsp 70, Hsp 110, Hsp 100, and Hsp 60 /CCT chaperone families act as catalytic unfolding enzymes or unfoldases that drive iterative cycles of protein binding, unfolding/pulling, and release. One unfoldase chaperone may thus successively convert many misfolded or alternatively folded polypeptide substrates into transiently unfolded intermediates, which, once released, can spontaneously refold into low-affinity native products. Whereas during stress, a large excess of non-catalytic chaperones in <b>holding</b> <b>mode</b> may optimally prevent protein aggregation, after the stress, catalytic disaggregases and unfoldases may act as nanomachines that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to repair proteins with compromised conformations. Thus, holding and catalytic unfolding chaperones can act as primary cellular defenses against the formation of early misfolded and aggregated proteotoxic conformers in order to avert or retard the onset of degenerative protein conformational diseases...|$|R
