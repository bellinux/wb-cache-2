50|$|When {{printing}} color images {{by combining}} multiple colors of inks, the colored inks {{usually do not}} contain much image detail. The <b>key</b> <b>plate,</b> which is usually impressed using black ink, provides the lines and/or contrast of the image. However, in two-color images where neither color was black, the <b>key</b> <b>plate</b> might have been printed in the darker of the two colors. <b>Key</b> <b>plate</b> is synonymous with keystone in the same context.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea was}} refined by De La Rue in 1879 when the {{printing}} process was {{split into two}} {{through the use of}} a <b>key</b> <b>plate</b> (or head plate) for the bulk of the design and a separate duty plate for the name of the colony and the value. These are often known as <b>key</b> <b>plate</b> stamps. While key type stamps are always of one colour, <b>key</b> <b>plate</b> stamps are bi-coloured. This method has the advantage that most of the design remains the same in each of a stamp series with only the value, name and colours changing.|$|E
50|$|In 1892, <b>key</b> <b>plate</b> stamps went on sale, {{a number}} of them printed in two colours. A notable feature of this issue is the $5 stamp issued in 1898.

50|$|Baxter's {{process for}} {{producing}} colour prints combined relief and intaglio printing methods.

The <b>key</b> <b>plate</b> provided the main lines of the image {{and much of the}} tone, light and shade. It was usually printed in a neutral tone, such as light grey or terracotta. Often Baxter used more than one colour to ink the <b>key</b> <b>plate</b> - for example, to gradate the image from blue in the sky, to buff in the middle distance and to a darker colour in the foreground; i.e. inking the plate à la poupée. Usually Baxter used aquatint for landscapes and stipple to work faces and figures.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{efficient}} global zigzag theory (GZIGT) {{is developed}} for elastic laminated plates, by approximating the in-plane displacements by a cubic expansion in thickness coordinate {{along with a}} global zigzag function, which takes values 1 at successive interfaces. The deflection is approximated to account explicitly for transverse thermal strain. The displacement variables are reduced to five, the same as used in first-order shear deformation theory, by imposing the conditions on transverse shear at three a priori selected interfaces/faces. A third order theory (TOT 1) is also developed with similar expression of deflection. GZIGT and TOT 1 are assessed by comparison with exact three-dimensional solutions for simply-supported square plates for sinusoidal pressure and thermal loads, natural frequencies and buckling. In general, GZIGT yields good results for two-ply, three-ply and four-ply composite plates, but it is inaccurate for a highly inhomogeneous test <b>plate.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: <b>plates,</b> elasticity, analytical modeling, laminate mechanics, 2 D theory...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this ERIP program was to make substantial progress in further developing a process for electrolytic regeneration of acid cupric chloride etchant - a process which was initially demonstrated in in-house studies and EPA Phase I and Phase II SBIRs. Specific objectives of the work were: (1) to define optimum system operating conditions by conducting a systematic study of process parameters, (2) to develop or find a superior electrolyic cell separator material, (3) to determine an optimum activation procedure for the flow-through carbon/graphite felt electrodes which are so critical to process performance, (4) to demonstrate - on the pre-prototype scale - electrolytic compensation for oxygen ingress - which causes etchant solution growth, and (5) to begin engineering design work on a prototype-scale regeneration unit. Parametric studies looked at the effect that <b>key</b> <b>plating</b> parameters have on copper deposit quality. Parameters tested included (a) velocity past the plating cathodes, (b) copper concentration in the catholyte solution from which the copper is being plated, (c) plating current density, and (d) catholyte cupric ion concentration. The most significant effects were obtained for velocity changes. The work showed that catholyte velocities above 0. 5 ft/sec were needed to get adequate plating at 77. 5 mA/cm{sup 2 } and higher currents, and that even higher flow was better...|$|R
