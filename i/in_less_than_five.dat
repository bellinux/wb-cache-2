40|$|Background & objectives: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality especially <b>in</b> children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years, particularly <b>in</b> India. We present data on S. pneumoniae infections <b>in</b> children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years age group, with response to its serotype distribution, antibiotic resistance profile and available vaccines expected coverage. Methods: Children aged <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five,</b> who were suspected for invasive pneumococcal disease were included in the study and their sterile body fluids were investigated for the presence of S. pneumoniae. Invasive S. pneumoniae isolates from sterile body fluids were identified by bile solubility and optochin susceptibility test. Pneumococcal serotyping was performed with co-agglutination technique and reconfirmed with multiplex PCR. Results: The most common pneumococcal serotypes causing invasive infections <b>in</b> children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years of age were 14, 19 F, 5, 6 A and 6 B. Of the 114 S. pneumoniae isolates studied, 110 (96. 4 %) were non-susceptible to co-trimoxazole and 30 per cent were non-susceptible to erythromycin, 5. 2 per cent of the isolates were non-susceptible to penicillin and only 0. 8 per cent was non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Interpretation & conclusions: Our results indicate that PCV- 10 can protect against 64 per cent of serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal infections. Use of PCV- 13 in this region can provide increase in protection upto 74. 6 per cent against serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal infections. Incorporating PCV- 13 in the Universal Immunization Programme may provide incremental protection against IPD serotypes in the southern region of the country...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of rotavirus-associated severe diarrhoea {{and distribution of}} rotavirus genotypes <b>in</b> children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years of age was determined in two low-income communities in Karachi, Pakistan. Over a two-year period, 717 children met eligibility criteria for severe diarrhoea and stools were obtained from 575 (80 %) with 97 (17 %) being rotavirus positive. Adjusted annual rates of severe rotavirus diarrhoea <b>in</b> children <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>five</b> years and <b>less</b> <b>than</b> one year were respectively 5. 7 and 16. 9 per 1000 in community A, and 8. 1 and 25. 4 per 1000 child years of observation in community B. An estimated 1 in 40 infants experience a severe episode of rotavirus gastroenteritis annually in Pakistan. The most common rotavirus strains were G 9 P[8] (15 %), G 1 P[8] (13 %) and G 1 [P 4] (8. 4 %). This information will inform policy decisions about the introduction of rotavirus vaccines...|$|R
