It is known that complexity of sample and settings of IDA might prevent important compounds from being triggered. Therefore, data independent acquisition methods (DIA) should be more suitable for systematic toxicological analysis (STA). The DIA method sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra (SWATH) which uses Q 1 windows of 20 - 35 Da for data independent fragmentation, was systematically investigated for its suitability for STA. Quality of SWATH generated mass spectra were evaluated with regard to mass error, relative abundance of the fragments and library hits.

40|$|Even though {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made on the technological and bioinformatics side, plant proteomics experiments on non-model crops still remain a big challenge. Often, protein databases are of poor quality due to the absence of sequences or poorly structurally and functionally annotated accessions. Polyploidy, heterozygosis, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications pose additional challenges. To increase the identification rate we developed our own gel- and label-free shotgun proteomics workflow that combined data independent and <b>dependent</b> LC-MS <b>acquisition</b> protocols. Data independent acquisition generates quantification <b>information,</b> while data <b>dependent</b> <b>acquisition</b> results in high quality identifications. The application of this workflow on a storage experiment of 'Braeburn' apples resulted in a two-fold identification increase of significant peptides. Of all quantitatively significant peptides, only 8. 6 % or 1219 peptides were identified based on the data independent acquisition; while after combination with the data <b>dependent</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>information,</b> 2041 additional peptides were identified, in total 3260 peptides led to 287 identified protein families. While ‘Braeburn’ apple has desirable quality attributes such as a firm, crispy, juicy texture and a rich, aromatic, sweet {{and at the same time}} tart taste, it is very susceptible to the development of 'Braeburn' Browning Disorder (BBD). This disorder typically occurs during controlled atmosphere storage and is characterized by flesh browning and, in more severe cases, lens shaped cavities can develop in the tissue. The susceptibility of the fruit and the severity of the disorder depend on a wide range of pre- and postharvest factors and vary with cultivar, orchard and season. The occurrence of BBD leads to significant economic losses for Belgian apple producers, that can be as high as 40 %. When susceptible batches of apples could be commercialized before the symptoms appear, substantial financial losses might be prevented. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to timely predict the possible future occurrence of browning, for example with a biomarker. Proteins are excellent candidate biomarkers since they are closely correlated to the phenotype and can be incorporated relatively easy in cheap bioassays. Their differential expression profiles may also provide insight in the physiological changes underlying the development of BBD. The proteomics workflow approach was applied to investigate the effect of three preharvest factors – application of calcium and potassium fertilizers and triazoles containing fungicides – on the proteome of apples at harvest. Upregulated fruit ripening proteins were correlated to triazole application and an increased level of antioxidative defense enzymes was observed in apples treated with maximal calcium levels. The next experiment focused on the effect of preharvest and postharvest factors (harvest time, treatment with 1 -MCP, O 2 and CO 2 level and storage time), on the apple proteome during storage, preceding the development of browning. Those early changes are expected to be most relevant for understanding the metabolic changes leading to browning. Proteomic and statistical analysis revealed four factors that result in changes to the apple proteome: preharvest triazole application, harvest time, CO 2 level during storage, and storage time. The affected pathways were most often related to stress response and defense, ripening and senescence and energy and metabolism. In total 291 protein families were correlated to these pathways; 13 of them were also correlated to browning development and were most likely involved in BBD development. Among others, those protein families were ACC oxidase, abscisic acid stress ripening protein, heat shock protein, catalase, ferritin, aldose 1 -epimerase and phosphoglucomutase. Preharvest factors might determine whether or not fruit will be susceptible to browning development, whereas postharvest factors might determine whether this sensitivity effectively will lead to browning and to which extent the disorder will develop. Even though biological insight is most helpful, it is not a prerequisite for discovering, developing and applying biomarkers. The last shotgun proteomics experiment in this dissertation aimed to find predictive biomarkers and to identify batches of apples sensitive to browning in an early stage. Based on protein abundances at harvest, correlated with the browning index after four months of storage, a multivariate calibration model was developed. This model included 28 biomarker protein abundances and was able to predict BBD incidence after storage, with a success rate of 85 %. However, the model was not robust enough to properly predict the occurrence of browning in a validation experiment incorporating commercial 'Braeburn' samples from five different producers. The more relevant sources of variability can be taken into account in the calibration phase, the more accurate and robust the prediction model will become against future changes. Future research is required to refine the proteome biomarker selection using an extensive screening over subsequent years and multiple orchards. status: publishe...|$|R

We have reported previously(1) that while increasing only gradient time or column length can improve peak capacity, using a longer column in combination with increasing gradient time {{is the most effective}} way of obtaining higher peak capacity. In this presentation we report on how the dead volume free connections of the cHiPLC Nanoflex platform allow for the coupling of two 15 cm long chip columns for improved resolution. The proposed set-up makes it easy to switch between single and dual column mode depending on application requirements. An additional advantage of using two separate 15 cm columns rather than one 30 cm column is that sample matrix components that are not retained on the first column (e. g. salts) can be directed to waste, instead of entering the nanospray source/mass spectrometer. We have investigated the effect of increased resolution through doubling column length on the number of peptides/proteins identified in a digested cytosolic fraction of a human cell lysate using various gradient lengths. An ABSCIEX TripleTOF 5600 ™ MS was used with an <b>Information</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Acquisition</b> method consisting of a TOF MS survey scan at 30 000 resolution, followed by 20 MS/MS in a second at > 15 000 resolution. All data was processed using ProteinPilot™ Software 4. 0 with integrated false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. 1 Remco van Soest*, David W.

40|$|The use {{of hybrid}} mass spectrometric {{instruments}} {{is becoming a}} more widespread phenomenon {{in the world of}} veterinary drug residue analysis, even for targeted approaches. There, the noticeable shift towards high resolution accurate mass mass spectrometric instruments (HRMS) enables to retrospectively mine the data for allowing the identification of new unidentified designer drugs. For the detection of anabolic steroids (gestagens, androgens and estrognes) in meat, our goal was to evaluate the sensitivity of a TripleToF™ instrument, using the fast <b>Information</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Acquisition</b> (IDA), which combines a TOF-MS survey and MRM-like acquisitions at high acquisition speeds. In order to increase sensitivity of the analysis, different MRM-like experiments were compared, as well as the use of a state-of-the-art microLC system (Eskigent MicroLC 200). Afterwards, the analytical method was validated according to the performance criteria as set out in the 2002 / 657 /EC Commission Decision and acknowledged the confirmatory and quantitative strength of this newly developed method. On the other side, HRMS hybrid instruments are being more and more implemented in the field of metabolomics, where the MRM-like experiments aid in the structure elucidation of the discovered unknown metabolites. Our second goal was to use the TripleToF™ instrument for unravelling the prednisolone origin in the high frequency positive bovine urines samples gathered in light of the national control plans. Bovine urine samples collected from an in vivo study were used to characterize the metabolites that originated from exogenous prednisolone administration. By means of different software packages (i. e. MasterViewTM, MetabolitePiloteTM), several interesting potential biomarkers were detected, and tentative identification was performed. Basically, this presentation will cover the workflow and pitfalls encountered with the analysis of steroids in a targeted but also untargeted procedure on a TripleToF™ 4600...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{epidemiological}} {{models with}} <b>information</b> <b>dependent</b> vaccination functions can generate sustained oscillations via Hopf bifurcation of the endemic state. The onset of these oscillations {{depend on the}} shape of the vaccination function. A “global” approach is used to characterise the instability condition and identify classes of functions that always lead to stability/instability. The analysis allows the identification of an analytically determined “threshold vaccination function” having a simple interpretation: coverage functions lying always above the threshold always lead to oscillations, whereas coverage functions always below never lead to instability...|$|R

40|$|Among the MS-based {{quantitative}} methods using stable isotope labelling, the Isotope-Coded Protein Label (ICPL) technique {{has emerged as}} a powerful tool to identify and relatively quantify thousands of proteins within complex protein mixtures. The ICPL_ESIQuant 3. 0 software package {{is one of the key}} components of the ICPL-ESI workflow, covering data processing steps like LC-MS feature detection, ICPL doublet/triplet/quadruplet quantification as well as a merging step of LC-MS features and Mascot search results. As unique features, the software performs isotope pattern overlap corrections and utilizes additional chemical knowledge, e. g. the physico-chemical properties of the ICPL labels, to discard false positive isotope pattern, which significantly improves the quality of the final peptide and protein results. ICPL_ESIQuant is the first freeware tool on the market, which supports both the shotgun proteomics strategy using Data <b>Dependent</b> <b>Acquisition</b> (DDA) and the directed proteomics strategy using mass inclusion lists for precursor ion selection.
