5|$|Conditions {{reported}} as worsening the disease include chronic infections, stress, {{and changes in}} season and climate. Others that might worsen the condition include hot water, scratching psoriasis skin lesions, skin <b>dryness,</b> excessive alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and obesity.|$|E
5|$|The solvent {{in which}} CS is dissolved, methyl {{isobutyl}} ketone (MIBK), is classified as harmful by inhalation; irritating to the eyes and respiratory system; and repeated exposure may cause skin <b>dryness</b> or cracking.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} depth and {{consistent}} nature of the alluvium, Mummy Cave is also characterized by extreme <b>dryness.</b> The pointed shape of the cliff above prevents rain and meltwater from percolating through the rock to the cave, {{and there are no}} vertical joints in the rock above.|$|E
5|$|During this process, fungal spores {{germinate}} in the boreholes, {{a reaction}} {{caused by the}} <b>dryness</b> of the tree, creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air. The fungus breaks down the lignin, causing white rot. It moves towards the vertically aligned xylem. The vertical profile shows reddish and white streaks which run {{in the direction of}} growth.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai has a {{tropical}} climate, specifically {{a tropical}} {{wet and dry}} climate (Aw) under the Köppen climate classification, with seven months of <b>dryness</b> and peak of rains in July. The cooler season from December to February {{is followed by the}} summer season from March to June. The period from June to about the end of September constitutes the south-west monsoon season, and October and November form the post-monsoon season.|$|E
5|$|Side effects include {{increased}} skin photosensitivity, <b>dryness,</b> redness {{and occasional}} peeling. Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide {{are just as}} effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects. Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide {{does not appear to}} generate bacterial antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through <b>dryness,</b> common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight time}} of the adults or imagines begins {{in the late summer}} to early autumn, but the date depends on the region and climate. The males hatch out earlier than females and create swarms which gather around the treetops. The females seek out leks and couple with the males on the {{uppermost}} shoots. Then the females search for suitable host trees, if possible choosing weak and dry wood. They orient on monoterpene hydrocarbon compounds, which weakened trees produce. When a tree is stressed through <b>dryness</b> or exterior injuries, the compounds pervade osmotic barriers and escape from the bark.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, blurred vision, <b>dryness</b> of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E
5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of <b>dryness</b> can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E
5|$|Siberia is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} polar region, owing to the <b>dryness</b> of the winter climate and has glaciers only in the high Altai Mountains, Verkhoyansk Range, Cherskiy Range and Suntar-Khayata Range, plus possibly a few very small glaciers in the ranges near Lake Baikal, which have never been monitored and may have completely disappeared since 1989. Between the years 1952 and 2006, the glaciers found in the Aktru Basin region shrank by 7.2percent. This shrinkage has been primarily in the ablation zone of the glaciers, with recession of several hundred meters being observed for some glaciers. The Altai region has also experienced an overall temperature increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius in the last 120years {{according to a report}} from 2006, with most of that increase occurring since the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{those species}} which {{reproduce}} sexually, haploid cells bud from the spores. Depending {{on the environmental}} conditions, either a myxamoeba or a myxoflagellate buds from the spore. Myxamoebae move like amoebae – that is, crawling on the substrate – and are produced in dry conditions. Myxoflagellates, which are peritrichous and can swim, develop in moist to wet environments. Myxoflagellates almost always have two flagella; one is generally shorter than the other and sometimes only vestigial. The flagella are used for locomotion and to help to move food particles closer. If the humidity changes, cells can switch between the two manifestations. Neither form has a cell wall. This developmental stage (and the next one) serves as a nourishment provider and {{is also known as}} the first trophic phase (nourishment phase). In this monocellular phase, the Myxogastria consume bacteria and fungus spores, and probably dissolved substances, and they reproduce through simple cell division. If the environmental conditions change adversely in this phase, for example extreme temperature, extreme <b>dryness</b> or food shortage, the Myxogastria may switch to very long-lived, thin-shelled quiescent states – the so-called microcysts. For that to happen, the myxamoebae assume a round shape and secrete a thin cell wall. In this state they can easily survive one year or longer. If living conditions improve, they become active again.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric <b>dryness,</b> and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth Helitack crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|While {{the book}} was {{readable}} enough to sell, its <b>dryness</b> ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists {{and could not be}} dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E
25|$|In {{women with}} SS, vaginal <b>dryness,</b> vulvodynia and {{dyspareunia}} (painful sexual intercourse) are often reported; personal lubricants are recommended to help lessen irritation or pain {{that may result}} from <b>dryness</b> in the vaginal and vulva areas.|$|E
25|$|Eyes: The eye can be {{directly}} affected {{in the form of}} episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a <b>dryness</b> of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, <b>dryness</b> of the cornea can lead to keratitis and loss of vision. Preventive treatment of severe <b>dryness</b> with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.|$|E
25|$|Dyspareunia may {{be caused}} by {{insufficient}} lubrication (vaginal <b>dryness)</b> in women. Poor lubrication may result from insufficient excitement and stimulation, or from hormonal changes caused by menopause, pregnancy, or breast-feeding. Irritation from contraceptive creams and foams can also cause <b>dryness,</b> as can fear and anxiety about sex.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dryness</b> {{of other}} mucosae, e.g., nasal, laryngeal, and/or genital.|$|E
25|$|Llullaillaco {{is located}} in the Atacama Desert, the driest {{non-polar}} desert on Earth. The extreme <b>dryness</b> of the air is a major reason for the excellent preservation of the mummies for 500 years. <b>Dryness</b> and cold temperatures are both known to significantly reduce the decomposition rate of human remains, and the extreme environmental conditions at the summit of Llullaillaco are therefore very conducive to preservation.|$|E
25|$|Damage {{caused by}} dirt or other foreign material, disease, <b>dryness,</b> or mushy condition, hail, insects, riciness or woodiness, and sunburn.|$|E
25|$|Thorough history {{regarding}} {{frequency of}} bedwetting, any period of <b>dryness</b> in between, associated daytime symptoms, constipation, and encopresis should be sought.|$|E
25|$|Androgen therapy (and {{suppression}} of estrogen production) may cause vaginal atrophy and <b>dryness,</b> which {{may result in}} dyspareunia (painful vaginal intercourse). This can be alleviated with topical estrogen cream.|$|E
25|$|To {{minimize}} this problem, {{commercial samples}} of THF are often inhibited with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). THF {{should not be}} distilled to <b>dryness,</b> because the explosive peroxides concentrate in the residue.|$|E
25|$|Second-hand smoke {{presents}} a known health risk, to which six hundred thousand deaths were attributed in 2004. It {{also has been}} known to produce skin conditions such as freckles and <b>dryness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The grape grows best in cool climates, and matures {{relatively}} {{early with}} high sugar levels. This {{can lead to}} either a sweeter wine, or, if fermented to <b>dryness,</b> a wine high in alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Xerostomia, {{also known}} as dry mouth and dry mouth syndrome, is <b>dryness</b> in the mouth, which may be {{associated}} with a change in the composition of saliva, or reduced salivary flow, or have no identifiable cause.|$|E
25|$|Bathing once {{or more a}} day is recommended, {{usually for}} five to ten minutes in warm water. Soaps should be avoided as they tend to strip the skin of natural oils and lead to {{excessive}} <b>dryness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{red wine}} {{production}} {{the timing of}} when to press {{is one of the}} most important decisions in the wine making process since that will be the moment that maceration and phenolic extraction ceases. Some winemakers use the decreasing sugar level (such as brix measurement) scale and press once the wine has reached complete <b>dryness.</b> Often winemakers will use taste to determine if the wine has extracted enough tannins to produce a balanced wine and may press before complete <b>dryness</b> (such as at 3-8 brix). Though removing the skins by pressing often removes some solids that the wine yeast need to complete fermentation and the benefits of pressing early is often balanced by the risk of potential stuck fermentation.|$|E
25|$|Low-dose {{prescription}} vaginal estrogen {{products such}} as estrogen creams are generally a safe way to use estrogen topically, to help vaginal thinning and <b>dryness</b> problems (see vaginal atrophy) while only minimally increasing the levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{enuresis}} occurs after {{a patient}} goes through {{an extended period}} of <b>dryness</b> at night (roughly six months or more) and then reverts to nighttime wetting. Secondary enuresis can be caused by emotional stress or a medical condition, such as a bladder infection.|$|E
25|$|Conjunctivitis, when {{caused by}} an infection, is most {{commonly}} caused by a viral infection. Bacterial infections, allergies, other irritants, and <b>dryness</b> are also common causes. Both bacterial and viral infections are contagious and passed from person to person, but can also spread through contaminated objects or water.|$|E
25|$|The temperaments are {{reported}} to be {{the interaction between the}} four different element's qualities, such as the conflict between <b>dryness,</b> wetness, cold, and hot. Avicenna suggests that these qualities battle between each other until an equilibrium state is reached and this state is known as the temperaments.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A is an {{essential}} micro-nutrient for vision, reproduction, cell and tissue differentiation, and immune function. Vitamin D and calcium work together in cases of maintaining homeostasis, creating muscle contraction, transmission of nerve pulses, blood clotting, and membrane structure. A lack of vitamin A, vitamin D, or calcium can cause <b>dryness</b> and brittleness.|$|E
25|$|Drought is {{the unusual}} <b>dryness</b> of soil caused by levels of {{rainfall}} significantly below average over a prolonged period. Hot dry winds, shortage of water, high temperatures and consequent evaporation of {{moisture from the}} ground can also contribute to conditions of drought. Droughts result in crop failure and shortages of water.|$|E
25|$|Low {{temperatures}} generally {{slow down}} the activity of blow-flies and their colonization of a body. Higher temperatures in the summer favor large maggot masses on the carrion. Dry and windy environments can dehydrate a corpse, leading to mummification. <b>Dryness</b> causes cessation in bacterial growth {{since there are no}} nutrients present to feed on.|$|E
25|$|Two {{physical}} functions prevent bedwetting. The {{first is}} a hormone that reduces urine production at night. The second {{is the ability to}} wake up when the bladder is full. Children usually achieve nighttime <b>dryness</b> by developing one or both of these abilities. There appear to be some hereditary factors in how and when these develop.|$|E
