40|$|The Upper West Region of Ghana and {{especially}} the Lawra-Jirapa districts are highly vulnerable to climate variability and likely to be amongst the worst hit under climate change. Any responses to climate change affected communities cannot be considered complete unless women-specific responses are interwoven {{in a variety of}} adaptation options considered in the target area. The overall objective of this short-term research was to test tools and methodologies developed by CCAFS, FAO on analysis of gender issues in climate change, agriculture and food security. The study took place from the 1 – 4 November 2011, in the village of Doggoh in the Jirapa district of the Upper West Region of Ghana. The segment on climate analogues showed that a gender-differentiated village resource maps {{could be used as a}} tool to communicate the concept of ‘climate analogues’ and to facilitate farmer-to-farmer exchange visits to analogue sites. Both men and women groups mentioned farming practices and coping strategies as topics they would like about to learn during an exchange visit to an analogue site. On weather information, all groups (men, women and youth) indicated they receive daily weather forecasts mainly through the radio but these are mostly received by the men and male youth because they own the radio sets. Women do not generally own radio sets in the village setting and as such, receive the daily weather information through their husbands or sons when they are in the house and switch on their radio sets. All groups (men, women and the youth) had never seen the seasonal <b>forecast</b> <b>chart</b> issued by the Ghana Meteorological Services. Both daily and seasonal weather forecasts would be preferred by the community and through the medium of the radio translated, into the local dialect. The church, the chief, assemblyman (local government representative) and agricultural extension agents could publicize the forecasts. Currently some climate smart agricultural initiatives, like tree planting and agroforestry, exist at the individual and household level. The community expressed the desire to undertake any climate smart agricultural initiative. Several external institutions have in the past facilitated the formation of local women groups and promoted agricultural activities. These groups can be used as entry points for future climate smart agricultural initiatives. The gender-specific focus groups in this session on climate smart agriculture worked out well because no group had influence over the other, and each shared their experiences without intimidation. The guiding questions also helped in sourcing the responses from the discussants and gave order to the way questions were sequenced...|$|E

Increased incidence of SAH cases was consistent with daily lowest and highest air pressure (IRR 0. 87, P < 0. 001 and IRR 1. 08, P = 0. 019, respectively) and highest air temperature (IRR 0. 98, P < 0. 001). Presence of hurricanes and/or tropical storms did not influence the frequency of SAH. We found no relationship between the presence of fronts and the admissions for ischemic stroke or SAH.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{framework}} for incorporating uncertainties into economic activity forecasts for Croatia. Using the vector error correction model (VECM) proposed by Rukelj (2010) as the benchmark model, we forecast densities of the variable of interest using stochastic simulations for incorporating future and parameter uncertainty. We exploit the use of parametric and non-parametric approaches in generating random shocks as in Garrat et al. (2003). Finally we evaluate the results by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling test of probability integral transforms. The main fi ndings are: (1) the parametric and the non-parametric approach yield similar results; (2) the incorporation of parameter uncertainty results in much wider probability forecast; and (3) evaluation of density forecasts indicates better performance when only future uncertainties are considered and parameter uncertainties are excluded. economic forecasting, density <b>forecasting,</b> fan <b>chart,</b> stochastic simulations, uncertainty, Croatia...|$|R
40|$|This review {{concentrates}} {{on the role of}} information asymmetry in financial markets in the amplification and propagation of short-run output fluctuations. We find that the financial accelerator effect, as it is known, provides a consistent, first principle based, theoretical framework for the analysis of the relationship between financial markets and short-run output fluctuations. It also provides a plausible explanation of the proximate causes of the recent crisis, and first principle-based theoretical background for the credit policy measures taken during this crisis by many central banks and fiscal authorities. Despite the theoretical plausibility, the empirical evidence about the economic importance of the financial accelerator effect is still relatively weak. We also suggest two new aspects to expand existing concept of the financial accelerator effect, which call for further research. economic forecasting, density <b>forecasting,</b> fan <b>chart,</b> stochastic simulations, uncertainty, Croatia...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of severe weather events {{is a key}} Met Office goal. As cyclonic systems {{are responsible for the}} vast majority of these events, accurate cyclone prediction is also high priority. Although huge strides have been made in numerical weather prediction (NWP) in recent years, cyclonic systems continue to pose problems for numerical models. Three ‘exceptional’ depressions in the Christmas periods of 1997 and 1999, and another in early December 1999 were all poorly forecast by most of the world’s operational models, indicating that there is plenty of scope for improvement. The rationale for constructing a cyclone database (previously called the ‘Frontal Wave Database’) is described in detail in Hewson (1998 b). The main motivation was the identification and representation of systematic model biases in new formats which, from most practical perspectives, represent a notable improvement on more traditional r. m. s. errorbased statistics. Several other possible uses have arisen in the intervening period; these are detailed at the end of this report. Evidently improved knowledge of cyclone forecast characteristics will be valuable not only to the NWP community, but also to forecasting, in part because operational practice now involves using ‘Field Modification’ software to prepare <b>forecast</b> <b>charts</b> (Carroll, 1997), which can be used to correct for known biases. The purpose of this report is to describe changes to the project since Hewson (1998 b) (section 1. 1), to outline the processing stages used to update the database (section 1. 2), to describe database structure and list the current set of stored diagnostics (section 2), to pinpoint major problems encountered during the project (section 3), and indeed overall to provide sufficient information for interested parties to comprehend what the database includes and how it can be utilised.

This finding builds on previous analysis in which they showed that, relative to naïve inflation forecasts, economic activity variables seem to have additional explanatory power for inflation in recessions, but not in other periods. 1 They propose a new unemployment gap measure that rises in recessions and is flat in booms and show that this leads to a stable Phillips-curve-based inflation <b>forecasting</b> model. <b>Chart</b> 2 of the Stock-Watson (SW) pape...|$|R

An important, though unsurprising, conclusion is that a good fit to historical data does not guarantee sensible forecasts. We also discuss the issue of model risk, common to many modelling situations in demography and elsewhere. We find that even for those models satisfying our qualitative criteria, there are significant differences among central forecasts of mortality rates at different ages and among the distributions surrounding those central <b>forecasts.</b> Plausibility Fan <b>charts</b> Model risk <b>Forecasting</b> Model selection criteria...|$|R
40|$|General {{aviation}} pilots need {{different types}} of flight information in order to follow events and the changes related to the aircraft environment while flying. However, general aviation cockpits have some limitations as space to install flight displays to provide flight information beyond the basics to the pilot. Additionally, more sophisticated instrumentation is often expensive to install and maintain. With {{the development of the}} tablet-based software applications (such as ForeFlight, WingX Pro 7 or Garmin Pilot applications for iPad), general aviation pilots have started to use them instead of paper documentation. These software applications provide essential flight information such as weather <b>forecast,</b> aviation <b>charts,</b> flight documents, etc. Unfortunately, the expectations for their capabilities are changing with the increased demand and popularity of these software applications. Therefore, these flight planning software applications are compared to find what is missing and what have not met the expectation of pilots. First, how the software applications support their decision-making process was described and demonstrated to choose the appropriate flight parameters to change flight path while handling with the other cockpit responsibilities. Finally, these design requirements were validated via HITL tests in a part-task flight simulator. The results provided that the suggested design requirements are found highly useful for both novice and expert general aviation pilots. Specifically, novice general aviation pilots {{might be able to get}} visualization to compare real-time weather and weather forecast, and then they might gain experience to improve their success for a in-flight re-planning.

50|$|Northern Light reached Boston Light on May 29, 1853, after 76 days, 5 hours, {{arriving}} in Boston an hour later, two days ahead of Contest′s arrival in New York. It was the shortest {{run on the}} 15000 mi San Francisco-to-Boston passage on record. It also beat previous around-Cape-Horn speed records of 84 days and 85 days held by the New York-based Comet and Flying Dutchman respectively. The Boston Post noted that Northern Light carried no cargo during the passage. The San Francisco-to-Boston sailing record by Northern Light still stands for a single-hull vessel; that feat, accomplished in a time with no electricity, and few navigation aids, no plastics, no synthetic materials for sails or lines, and neither accurate television or radio weather <b>forecasts</b> nor accurate <b>charts</b> and Global Positioning System navigation to demonstrate precise location, is unlikely ever to be repeated. Nevertheless, in 1993 the multi-hull 53 ft trimaran Great American II broke the record and completed the passage in 69 days, 19 hours; she had capsized off San Francisco on an initial attempt.|$|R
