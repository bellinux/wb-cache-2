5|$|Yes {{had started}} their career being a covers band, {{performing}} radical re-arrangements of hit songs, and {{their first two}} albums included covers <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein.</b> However, The Yes Album {{was the first to}} feature group-written material in its entirety. Some familiar elements remained; Anderson, Howe and Squire sang three-part vocal harmony throughout the record, while Squire's melodic bass and Bill Bruford's spacious drumming made up their unique rhythm section.|$|E
5|$|His one-day form {{also began}} to suffer, scoring only 11 runs in three ODIs in New Zealand and 13 {{in the first two}} matches of the VB Series. He was rested for two games and {{returned}} to form against Sri Lanka on 29 January 2006 on his home ground, the WACA, hitting 116 runs off 105 balls to lead Australia to victory. He continued <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> with the fastest ever century by an Australian in just 67 balls against Sri Lanka at the Gabba, ending with 122 as Australia won the deciding third final by nine wickets. After a slow start, he ended the series with 432 runs at 48.00.|$|E
50|$|Continuing <b>in</b> <b>this</b> pamphleteering <b>vein,</b> Groulx made 24 heures ou plus, {{a veritable}} call to revolution, which was censored by the NFB. Shot {{at the end}} of 1971, the film was not officially {{released}} until 1977.|$|R

5|$|The artistic {{community}} appreciated {{his work}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> and Rodin {{was invited to}} Paris Salons by such friends as writer Léon Cladel. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy; in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament {{for which he is}} better known. French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including , the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs, now 18, {{returned}} to the reserves {{for much of the}} following season. Watford's first-team struggled, failing to win any of their first nine league games. Although his first start of the season ended in an 2–0 defeat to Queens Park Rangers, Gibbs retained his place for 10 of the remaining 11 matches, experiencing only one further defeat. Continuing <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> 1985–86 saw Gibbs establish himself as the team's first choice right-back. He missed only two games all season, both of which resulted in defeat for Watford. His first goal came on 5 April 1986 in a 4–1 home victory over Newcastle United, while he also played in a 5–1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge {{on the final day of}} the season. Gibbs' consistency helped him to third place in the voting for the club's Player of the Season award.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation {{in a time of war}} would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to complement each other, and <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
5000|$|Scientific {{research}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area, {{for example}} that by Stelarc, {{can be considered}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> artistic <b>vein.</b> A special case of the body art strategies {{is the absence of}} body. Some artists who performed the [...] "absence" [...] of body through their artworks were:, Davor Džalto, Anthony Gormley, and Andy Warhol.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, he toured 30 American cities—largely in the Midwest—in a twelve-ton {{truck with}} his own Steinway pianos and piano tuner. It was the {{expression}} of a lifelong conviction that classical music belonged to the ordinary American. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> same <b>vein,</b> he was an ardent fan of the Detroit Tigers baseball team.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{after the}} early 1930s, the {{influence}} of Rationalist architecture and of Le Corbusier became dominant among local architects, among whom Alberto Prebisch and Amancio Williams stand out <b>in</b> <b>this</b> new <b>vein.</b> The construction of skyscrapers proliferated in Buenos Aires after 1950, though a new generation started rejecting their [...] "brutality," [...] and tried to find an architectonic identity.|$|R
5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} working {{very much in the}} shadow of Tennyson, {{producing}} weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> into {{the early years of the}} 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many of his}} predecessors, James VI {{actively}} despised Gaelic culture. However, in the 1580s and 1590s he strongly {{promoted the}} literature of the country of his birth in Scots. His treatise, Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody, published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, to which he applied Renaissance principles. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, later called the Castalian Band, which included William Fowler (c. 1560–1612), John Stewart of Baldynneis (c. 1545–c. 1605), and Alexander Montgomerie (c. 1550–98). They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms, including sonnets and short sonnets, for narrative, nature description, satire and meditations on love. Later poets that followed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> included William Alexander (c. 1567–1640), Alexander Craig (c. 1567–1627) and Robert Ayton (1570–1627). By the late 1590s the king's championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne.|$|E
25|$|Kundera also ventures often into musical matters, {{analyzing}} Czech folk music, {{quoting from}} Leoš Janáček and Bartók. Further <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> he interpolates musical excerpts into the text (for example, in The Joke), or discusses Schoenberg and atonality.|$|E
5000|$|Record Hospital has {{continued}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> same <b>vein</b> and plays {{a variety of}} punk, hardcore, indie pop, noise, psychedelic, no wave, {{and other forms of}} music with an underground, experimental or DIY aesthetic. In 1999 the show went global when WHRB began streaming over the Internet, and in 2009 released content to iPhone users via the WHRB [...] "app".|$|R

50|$|Veins not visible, {{or not at}} all clear; if unspecified, {{then not}} visible with the naked eye. e.g. Berberis gagnepainii. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> Berberis, the <b>veins</b> are only obscure on the undersurface.|$|R
25|$|The {{next year}} he devoted himself to Armenian subject matter, in {{particular}} using modes distinctive to Armenian music, and continued <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> for several years, achieving some renown {{and the support of}} other musicians, including radical experimentalist composer John Cage and choreographer Martha Graham, all the while continuing as church organist.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> that in 1872 {{he painted}} his first large scale portrait, Kathrin, {{in which the}} subject, Kathrin Crowell, is seen in dim light, playing with a kitten. In 1874 Eakins and Crowell became engaged; they were still engaged five years later, when Crowell died of {{meningitis}} in 1879.|$|E
25|$|C. V. Raman Pillai was {{a pioneer}} in prose dramas. He had a {{particular}} knack for writing dramas in a lighter vein. His Kurupillakalari of 1909 marks {{the appearance of the}} first original Malayalam prose drama. It is a satirical drama intended to ridicule the Malayali official classes who started imitating Western fashion and etiquette. There were other authors, less well-known, who wrote <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein.</b>|$|E
60|$|The room rang {{with her}} {{reminiscent}} laughter, Bill supplying a bass accompaniment. Bill was delighted. He had never hoped {{that it would}} be granted to him to become so rapidly intimate with Claire's hostess. Why, he had only to keep the conversation <b>in</b> <b>this</b> chummy <b>vein</b> for a little while longer and she would give him the run of the house.|$|R

50|$|Working under Eucken, Lutz was in {{the inner}} circle of the ordoliberal Freiburg School of {{economics}} and law, where Eucken, Hans Großmann-Doerth and Franz Böhm were abandoning the traditional German historical and descriptive approach and were beginning work on the basic theoretical issues surrounding a market economy and what makes for a competitive economy. After leaving Freiburg, Lutz continued <b>in</b> <b>this</b> same <b>vein</b> at Princeton.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time, however, McChesney, unlike early thinkers <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> is {{interested}} in mobilizing popular resistance against this domination. He continues: “the democratic solution to this problem, is to increase informed public participation in media policy making” (p.7). McChesney is well known as an outspoken advocate for this public participation, engaging in speaking tours {{around the country and}} lobbying against corporate control of the media.|$|E
25|$|In the Diet, {{he stood}} against the government's {{suppression}} {{of the freedom of}} speech and its pressure for the conformity of all parliamentarians. However, his efforts <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein</b> were largely unsuccessful, and he spent much of the war outside of the Diet, touring Manchuria and China, visiting prisons around the country, and cheering those on the home front. He advocated war extension. During the war he flew a squadron bomber to Rome and met Mussolini.|$|E
25|$|He {{recorded}} three albums <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> Free Form (Jazzland 1960), Abstract (Columbia (UK) 1962) and Movement (Columbia (UK) 1963). Abstract {{received a}} five star review from Harvey Pekar in Down Beat, {{the first such}} honour for a British Jazz record. Free Form and Abstract together formed a perfect pair of cohesive, trailblazing free jazz sessions. The next album, Movement, featured {{some of his most}} fiercely abstract compositions, but these were tempered by some other, more straight-ahead pieces.|$|E
5000|$|Workers for Freedom's spring 1990 showing {{featured}} more styles <b>in</b> <b>this</b> feminine <b>vein,</b> including: [...] "flounced skirts, ribbon-trimmed {{jackets and}} shirts in suede {{as well as}} wool". However, there were fewer buyers in London due to retailing problems worldwide. Katharine Hamnett and John Galliano had chosen to show in Paris, while Rifat Ozbek screened a video rather than a holding a full catwalk show.|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> {{discussion}} {{we consider}} {{why it is}} important to estimate causal effect parameters well even they are not identified, propose a partially identified approach for causal inference in the presence of colliders, point out an under-appreciated advantage of double robustness, discuss the relative difficulty of independence testing versus regression, and finally commend Häggström for her exploration of causal inference with high-dimensional confounding, while making a call for further research <b>in</b> <b>this</b> same <b>vein...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Glen Miller at AllMusic gave Lee Aaron {{three stars}} out of five, {{describing}} it as [...] "refreshing, showcasing the best songwriting and strongest music of Aaron's career", {{and that she}} [...] "succeeds <b>in</b> <b>this</b> softer, commercial <b>vein</b> with mature subject matter." ...|$|R
25|$|He warns in {{his recent}} presentations and in his autobiography, that {{humanity}} faces a crisis of consciousness and {{that much of the}} enthusiasm and caring for the Earth especially among young people, is being channelled into collusion with undemocratic corporate power structures in the banking world. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> he argues in Chill that mitigation of climate change is a delusion and that resources need to be channelled into adaptation and the creation of resilient human communities and a robust biodiversity.|$|E
25|$|Following more {{experimentation}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide ("New {{experiments with}} the vacuum"), which detailed basic rules describing {{to what degree}} various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by Récit de la grande expérience de l’équilibre des liqueurs ("Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids") published in 1648.|$|E
25|$|The goal of full {{employment}} was of most importance to Petty, having recognised that labour {{was one of}} the major sources of wealth for individuals and 'the greatest Wealth and Strength of the Kingdom'. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>vein,</b> he extended the cloth-wine argument above, arguing that it is better to employ men and burn their product or to engage in extravagant public works projects, than to have indolent 'supernumeraries' in an economy – hence his famous example of relocating Stonehenge across the plains of Salisbury.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} many other {{descriptive}} terms, often with very specialised usage and confined to specific taxonomic groups. The conspicuousness of veins {{depends on a}} number of features. These include the width of the veins, their prominence in relation to the lamina surface and the degree of opacity of the surface, which may hide finer <b>veins.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> regard, <b>veins</b> are called obscure and the order of veins that are obscured and whether upper, lower or both surfaces, further specified.|$|R
50|$|A teacher by profession, Casona {{expressed}} a strong educational vocation, {{inspired by the}} ideals of the Free Institution of Education, and his defense of progressive values in diverse cultural outreach projects such as Pedagogical Missions, created during the Second Spanish Republic. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> same <b>vein,</b> he made many excellent adaptations of classic plays and narratives, both for adults and youth. Furthermore, in all his original dramatic creations he knew how to convey messages in a deep and clear social commitment without relinquishing his undeniable poetic inspiration.|$|R
50|$|Video games {{also use}} this same motif, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} horror-Western games being SilverLoad for the PlayStation. The game has a variety of classic horror tropes in it, ranging from werewolves and vampires, to Satanic cults, that the player must contend with nothing more than a trusty six-gun at his hip. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> same <b>vein</b> is the modern PS2/Xbox first-person shooter, Darkwatch, in which the protagonist is himself a vampire, fighting through the west for either his own redemption, or furthering his own damnation.|$|R
