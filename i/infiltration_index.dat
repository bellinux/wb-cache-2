40|$|Ecosystem {{monitoring}} and assessment are often based on functional indicators, which provide integrated and yet simple and affordable measures of key ecosystem functions. The landscape function analysis (LFA) assesses ecosystem functioning through three indices that represent basic soil functions: surface stability, infiltration, and nutrient cycling. Given the high scale-dependency of hydrological and erosion processes in semiarid ecosystems, the validation of the stability and infiltration indices requires a multi-scale approach, {{which has not been}} applied by previous works. Using records from a four-year monitoring of a semiarid landscape in SE Spain, we evaluated the LFA infiltration and stability indices against quantitative measurements of water and sediment flows at multiple scales. At the finest scale, the indices correctly reflected the higher infiltration and lower sediment production of plant patches as compared with bare-soil interpatches. The <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> also captured the spatial variation in the infiltration capacity of bare-soil interpatches. At the hillslope scale, total runoff was inversely related to the average <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> for bare-soil interpatches, but it was not related to the global <b>infiltration</b> <b>index,</b> which combines the values from both bare-soil interpatches and plant patches. These results suggest that the hydrological response of semiarid hillslopes depends mainly on the variation in the functioning of bare-soil interpatches. Total sediment yield from the hillslope plots was not related to the stability index. At the catchment scale, both the bare-soil interpatch and the global infiltration indices correctly captured the variability in total runoff produced by three micro-catchments of comparable size. The bare-soil <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> predicted bare-soil infiltration rate and hillslope runoff better than common simple indicators of soil functioning such as soil organic carbon, stone cover, crusted bare-soil cover, bulk-density and plant cover, and exhibited a similarly high indicatory potential that a variety of plant spatial-pattern indicators. In contrast to the multi-scale validation of the <b>infiltration</b> <b>index,</b> the indicatory potential of the stability index was only proved for the most contrasting soil conditions in the study site, pointing to a lower sensitivity of this latter index...|$|E

Instruments are called infiltrometers. They can be devided in to three groups: ring (cylinder), tension and sprinkler infiltrometers. Mini disk infiltrometer is a tension infiltrometer. The objective of this study is to theoretically describe the process of infiltration and factors it is dependent on, to give appropriate management options for improving soil properties, to evaluate the usefulness of mini disk infiltrometer and compare it with standard double ring infiltrometer. Series of measurements were made with mini disk infiltrometer for three different soil types and two different most common land uses on the Glinščica watershed.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging metrics of peritumoral edema {{can be used}} to differentiate intra- from extraaxial lesions, metastatic lesions from gliomas, and high- from low-grade gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, diffusion-tensor MR imaging was performed preoperatively in 40 patients with intracranial neoplasms, including meningiomas, metastatic lesions, glioblastomas multiforme, and low-grade gliomas. Histograms of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were used to analyze both the tumor and the associated T 2 signal intensity abnormality. An additional metric, the tumor <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> (TII), was evaluated. The TII {{is a measure of the}} change in FA presumably caused by tumor cells infiltrating the peritumoral edema. Student t test and least-squares linear regression analyses were performed.

The presence of several Ek-binding motifs within p 2340 prompted us to examine whether this peptide can stimulate a T-cell response and elicit experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) in AKR/J (H- 2 k) mice. The peptide {{was found to be}} immunogenic at the T-cell level since it induced specific proliferative responses as well as interleukin- 2 and interferon-γ secretion in secondary cultures of peptide-primed lymph node cells (LNC). The p 2340 -specific proliferation was blocked almost completely by an Ek-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) but was unaffected by a control Ak-specific mAb. Peptide-primed LNC did not respond to intact hTg and conversely, LNC primed in vivo with hTg did not respond to p 2340 in culture, suggesting that p 2340 contains non-dominant T-cell epitope(s). Direct subcutanaeous challenge of AKR/J mice (n = 9) with p 2340 in adjuvant, elicited mild to moderate EAT (<b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> of 1 – 2) and strong p 2340 -specific immunoglobulin G responses in all mice tested.

C 57 BL/ 6 mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA group). A control group received saline using the same protocol. Twenty-four hours after the last challenge, groups were further randomized into subgroups to receive saline, BMMCs (2 × 106) or MSCs (1 × 105) intratracheally. BMMC and MSC administration decreased cell <b>infiltration,</b> bronchoconstriction <b>index,</b> alveolar collapse, collagen fiber content in the alveolar septa, and interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 13, transforming growth factor (TGF) -β and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels compared to OVA-SAL.

The present study examined the effect of NF-KB inhibitor and antioxidant, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) on experimental ulcerative colitis in rats. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups, each consisting of 6 animals; normal control group, acetic acid group, PDTC-treated group and sulfasalazine-treated group as a positive control group. Induction of colitis by intracolonic administration of 3 % acetic acid produced severe macroscopic inflammation in the colon 24 h after acetic acid administration as assessed by the colonic damage score. Microscopically, colonic tissues showed ulceration, oedema and inflammatory cells infiltration. Biochemical studies revealed increased serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and nitrite/nitrate and colonic concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and the neutrophil <b>infiltration</b> <b>index,</b> myeloperoxidase (MPO). Oxidative stress was indicated by elevated lipid peroxides formation and depleted reduced glutathione concentrations (GSH) in colonic tissues. Immunohistochemical studies of colonic sections revealed upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Pretreatment with PDTC at a dose of (200 mg/kg/day, i. p.), three days before induction of colitis decreased serum LDH, nitrite/nitrate and TNF-a levels, colonic concentrations of MPO and lipid peroxides while increased colonic GSH concentration. Moreover, PDTC pretreatment attenuated colonic iNOS expression. Finally, histopathological changes were nearly restored by PDTC pretreatment.

40|$|The {{modifications}} {{applied in}} our country by human activities over natural environments in the last decades, starting from the second world war, have a relevant impact on the hydrology answers of the system. Specifically the effects of anthropization are more intense around cities, where agricultural soils, which have an high <b>infiltration</b> <b>index,</b> have been modified into urban areas which are almost impermeable. This phenomena generates different answer of the basins to the same input event in terms of peak discharge and volume and in term of water recharge of the deep aquifer. The percentage change of the soil use determines a different ground water capacity, that means higher peak in downstream, and less ground water storage. This generate a depletion in base-flow, which can cause environmental problems, and an impoverishment of the water system. The study of this problem with a GIS program to change some parameters and to simulate different scenarios of anthropization can give indication for a future planning over water resource.

40|$|Background—Endothelial {{progenitor}} cells (EPCs) play {{a pivotal}} role in repair and regeneration of damaged vessels. We investigated the role of mobilized EPCs in the healing process after intravascular radiation therapy. Methods and Results—One iliac artery of hypercholesterolemic rabbits was subjected to balloon injury and intravascular radiation with a Re- 188 balloon and the contralateral iliac artery to balloon injury only. Rabbits received granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (recombinant human GM-CSF) (60 g/d subcutaneously) daily for 1 week, either 7 days before the angioplasty or at the time of angioplasty. Control rabbits received human albumin. GM-CSF significantly increased the double-positive (CD 31 and KDR) fraction in peripheral blood monocytes and showed a higher number of EPCs than albumin after culture and, furthermore, enhanced migration and incorporation of EPCs. In the albumin group, intravascular radiation therapy reduced neointimal hyperplasia but delayed reendothelialization and aggravated monocyte infiltration. GM-CSF treatment significantly accelerated the reendothelialization and inhibited monocyte <b>infiltration</b> (reendothelialization <b>index,</b> 8113 % in the GM-CSF radiation [n 7] versus 3011 % in the control radiation [n 9] at 2 weeks, P 0. 01).

To isolate the PCF cores for the <b>infiltration</b> of low <b>index</b> liquids, a pulsed CO 2 laser cleaving technique has been developed which seals only the very ends of the cladding holes, thus minimizing degradation of the guiding properties at the coupling region. The efficiency of this integration method has been verified via strong cascaded Raman scattering in both toluene (high index) core capillaries and ethanol (low index) core HCPCFs, for power thresholds up to six orders of magnitude lower than previous results.

To determine if prostaglandins are involved, we administered human recombinant IL- 1 beta and measured rectal PGE 2 production in rabbits with formalin-immune complex colitis. IL- 1 beta (0. 3 micrograms/kg) administered 24 h before induction of colitis increased PGE 2 (231 +/- 36 to 1, 299 +/- 572 pg/ml, P less than 0. 01) and reduced subsequent inflammatory cell <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> (from 2. 8 +/- 0. 3 to 1. 4 +/- 0. 3, P less than 0. 02) and edema (from 2. 5 +/- 0. 3 to 1. 3 +/- 0. 3, P less than 0. 01) compared with vehicle-matched animals. Administration of ibuprofen (10 mg/kg i. v.) together with IL- 1 beta prevented the stimulation of PGE 2 and the reduction in inflammation. Colonic PGE 2 production correlated inversely with subsequent severity of inflammation (P less than 0. 02, r = - 0. 39) and edema (P less than 0. 04, r = - 0. 35).

Soil infiltration capacity plays a vital role in determining the inputs from precipitation and enhancing water storage, which are important for the maintenance and survival of vegetation patches in arid and semi-arid areas. Our study investigated the effects of different artificial grasslands on soil physical properties and soil infiltration capacity. The artificial grasslands were Medicago sativa, Astragalus adsurgens, Agropyron mongolicum, Lespedeza davurica, Bromus inermis, Hedysarum scoparium, A. mongolicum + Artemisia desertorum, A. adsurgens + A. desertorum and M. sativa + B. inermis. The soil <b>infiltration</b> capacity <b>index</b> (SICI), which was based on the average infiltration rate of stage I (AIRSI) and the average infiltration rate of stage III (AIRS III), was higher (indicating that the infiltration capacity was greater) under the artificial grasslands than that of the bare soil. The SICI of the A. adsurgens + A. desertorum grassland had the highest value (1. 48) and bare soil (0. 59) had the lowest value. It was evident that artificial grassland could improve soil infiltration capacity. We also used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine that the main factors that affected SICI were the soil water content at a depth of 20 cm (SWC 20), the below-ground root biomasses at depths of 10 and 30 cm (BGB 10, BGB 30), the capillary porosity at a depth of 10 cm (CP 10) and the noncapillary porosity at a depth of 20 cm (NCP 20). Our study suggests that the use of Legume-poaceae mixtures and Legume-shrub mixtures to create grasslands provided an effective ecological restoration approach to improve soil infiltration properties due to their greater root biomasses.

However, {{the efficacy of}} hypercapnic acidosis in sepsis, the commonest cause of clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome, is not known. We investigated whether hypercapnic acidosis—induced by adding CO 2 to inspired gas—would be protective against endotoxin-induced lung injury in an in vivo rat model. Prophylactic institution of hypercapnic acidosis (i. e., induction before endotoxin instillation) attenuated the decrement in arterial oxygenation, improved lung compliance, and attenuated alveolar neutrophil infiltration compared with control conditions. Therapeutic institution of hypercapnic acidosis, that is, induction after endotoxin instillation, attenuated the decrement in oxygenation, improved lung compliance, and reduced alveolar neutrophil <b>infiltration</b> and histologic <b>indices</b> of lung injury. Therapeutic hypercapnic acidosis attenuated the endotoxin-induced increase in the higher oxides of nitrogen and nitrosothiols in the lung tissue and epithelial lining fluid. Lung epithelial lining fluid nitrotyrosine concentrations were increased with hypercapnic acidosis. We conclude that hypercapnic acidosis attenuates acute endotoxin-induced lung injury, and is efficacious both prophylactically and therapeutically.

40|$|The {{effects of}} grazing by {{livestock}} on soil surface features, bulk density and chemical properties were {{studied at the}} completion of a 4 -year grazing experiment carried out in Sadoré, Niger. Grazing treatments were a factorial arrangement of two stocking rates (62. 5 and 125 kg live weight/ha) and four sheep:goat ratios (0 : 6, 2 : 4, 4 : 2 and 6 : 0 animals per pasture), with two pastures per treatment and two ungrazed controls. Observations were also made in a fallow subjected to 9 years of intense and uncontrolled mixing grazing, and in a site that had been protected from grazing for 15 years. The topsoil was sampled (at depths of 0 - 2, 2 - 6, 6 - 14 and 14 - 30 cm) below shrub canopy in herbaceous vegetation and in bare soil patches within each of 20 paddocks for determination of pH, organic C, and total N and P concentrations. Soil bulk density was measured in a subset of soil profiles. The areal extent of different types of soil crusts and other soil surface features was assessed in one-half of the paddocks. Grazing resulted in a reduction (p is less than 0. 01) and fragmentation of the area of crusted soils. However, this trend was partially compensated for by an increase of newly formed crusts. As a result, the soil <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> slightly increased with moderate grazing, but decreased at higher stocking rates. Compaction due to trampling was observed in the topsoil beneath the shrub canopy and also in vegetated patches, but only under intense grazing pressure. Soil bulk density was not affected by grazing except for an increase observed below 10 cm depth at the understorey of shrubs which is therefore unlikely due to trampling. When compared to the ungrazed control, pH, organic C and N concentrations, and to lesser extent P concentration, decreased after 4 years of grazing. Soil P and pH further decreased after 9 years of very high grazing pressure. However, neither H nor organic C decreased further. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: A {{realistic}} way {{for obtaining}} local tissue regeneration is by local application of cells, known as cell therapy. Embryonic stem cells (ES) are often considered for this. As a basic step towards cell therapy, we evaluated the infiltrative behavior of murine and {{human embryonic stem}} cells in two known in vitro assays, the PHF (precultured heart fragment) assay and the Coll I (Collagen I) assay. Two different application strategies were investigated: multicellular spheroids, {{as a model for}} cell patch applications and single cells, as a model for local cell injections. Materials and methods: The B 6 D 2 mES cell line and the H 1 hES cell line were used. The PHF assay consists of precultured chick embryonic heart fragments and is a general accepted model for studying tumor invasion in a 3 D setting. The Coll I assay consists of a native Collagen I gel, a model for evaluating infiltration in the extracellular matrix. Analysis was done by light microscopy. A two-sided Students t-test (99, 9 %) was used for calculating significant differences in infiltration. Results and discussion: In the PHF assay, the mES spheroids showed a gradual infiltration of the mES cells and massive expansion, resulting in a reduction {{in the size of the}} original PHF. The hES spheroids showed a non infiltrative behavior and did not interact with the host tissue. The mES single cells were infiltrative and expansive, but did not reduce the size of the original PHF. The hES single cells were infiltrative, but didn’t show expansive behavior. These results were confirmed by the Coll I assay. mES spheroids had a <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> of 62 %, hES spheroids of 32 %, mES single cells of 51 % and hES single cells of 25 % (significant difference). As indicated by these results, mES cells can’t be used as a model system for hES cell infiltration. The use of hES cells as a tissue patch for local application seems dangerous. The use of single hES cells for injection shows good infiltration and is a viable option for cell therapy. In conclusion, these two models are an easy screening tool for the infiltration capacity of different cell types...|$|E

In rabbits with immune complex-induced colitis, IL- 1 alpha and beta mRNA levels were detectable at 4 h, peaked at 12 but were absent at 96 h after the induction of colitis. Colonic IL- 1 tissue levels were measured by specific radioimmunoassays. IL- 1 alpha was significantly elevated at 4 h (9. 4 +/- 1. 5 ng/g colon), progressively increased at 48 h (31 +/- 5. 8 ng/g) and then decreased by 96 h (11. 5 +/- 3. 4 ng/g). IL- 1 beta levels were 2. 0 +/- 0. 5 ng/g colon at 4 h, 5. 0 +/- 1. 6 ng/g at 48 h and undetectable by 96 h. By comparison, colonic levels of PGE 2 and LTB 4 were unchanged during the first 12 h and did not become elevated until 24 h. IL- 1 alpha levels were highly correlated with inflammation (r = 0. 885, P less than 0. 0001), edema (r = 0. 789, P less than 0. 0001) and necrosis (r = 0. 752, P less than 0. 0005). Treatment with a specific IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 ra) {{before and during the}} first 33 h after the administration of immune complexes markedly reduced inflammatory cell <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> (from 3. 2 +/- 0. 4 to 1. 4 +/- 0. 3, P less than 0. 02), edema (from 2. 2 +/- 0. 4 to 0. 6 +/- 0. 3, P less than 0. 01) and necrosis (from 43 +/- 10 % to 6. 6 +/- 3. 2 %, P less than 0. 03) compared to vehicle-matched colitis animals. These studies demonstrate that (a) IL- 1 gene expression and synthesis occur early in the course of immune complex-induced colitis; (b) are significantly elevated for 12 h before the appearance of PGE 2 and LTB 4; (c) tissue levels of IL- 1 correlate with the degree of tissue inflammation and; (d) specific blockade of IL- 1 receptors reduces the inflammatory responses associated with experimental colitis...|$|E
40|$|Macrophage {{infiltration}} {{contributes to}} the pathogenesis of diabetic renal injury. However, the regulatory mechanisms between macrophage infiltration and epithelial cell activation are still unclear. Our previous study found that C 66, a novel curcumin analog, was able to inhibit inflammatory cytokine expression in vitro and in vivo. This study further elucidated whether C 66 can prevent glucose-induced renal epithelial activation and inflammatory macrophage infiltration by a MAPK/ NF-kB medicated mechanism. Our data show that pretreatment with C 66 not only significantly reduced high glucose (HG) -induced over-expressions of VCAM- 1, ICAM- 1 and MCP- 1, but also remarkably inhibited NF-kB activation, MAPKs phosphorylation, and subsequently macrophage adhesion in renal epithelial NRK- 52 E cells. Furthermore, we find that MAPKs, especially JNK, play important roles in HG-induced NF-kB activation, which regulates the over-expression of adhesion molecules in HG-stimulated NRK- 52 E cells. A molecular docking predicted that C 66 may target JNK 2, which leads to its anti-inflammatory actions. In vivo, administration of C 66 or JNK special inhibitor SP 600125 at 5 mg/kg markedly decreased diabetes-induced renal adhesion molecule expression, NF-kB activation, inflammatory cell <b>infiltration,</b> and pathological <b>indexes</b> in the kidneys of diabetic mice.

40|$|Objective: The {{prevalence}} of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has markedly increased. Insulin resistance has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of NAFLD. This study was aimed at observing the relationship between insulin resistance and NAFLD, and evaluating the role of pioglitazone (PGZ) acting as insulin-sensitizing agents in the prevention and treatment of rat fatty liver induced by high fat feeding. Methods: The rats were separated randomly into 6 groups: model group I were fed high fat diet for 8 weeks, PGZ prevention group were given PGZ 4 mg/(kg·d) simultaneously, while control group I were fed normal food for 8 weeks; model group II were fed high fat diet for 16 weeks, PGZ treatment group were given PGZ 4 mg/(kg·d) orally simultaneous with high fat diet for 8 weeks after high fat feeding for 8 weeks, control group II were fed normal food for 16 weeks. The rats were sacrificed after 8 weeks and 16 weeks respectively. Liver weight, body weight, serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting plasma insulin (FINS), HOMA (homeostasis model assessment) insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and the liver histology of rats of all groups were assayed. Results: After 8 weeks, the liver in model group I showed typical steatosis, accompanied with mild to moderate lobular inflammatory cell <b>infiltration,</b> liver <b>indexes</b> and serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, TNF-α were significantly increased (P< 0. 05) compared with control group I. Whereas, the degree of hepatic injury was attenuated in PGZ prevention group, liver indexes and serum levels of ALT, ALP were significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) compared with model group I. After 16 weeks, notable steatosis, and lobular inflammation were observed in model group II rat liver, while the degree of hepatic injury was attenuated in the PGZ treatment group. Liver index, serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, FINS and HOMA-IR were significantly increased (P< 0. 05) in model group II compared with control group II. Whereas, in PGZ treatment group, serum levels of AST and FINS showed decreasing tendency, liver indexes, serum levels of ALT, ALP, TNF-α and HOMA-IR were significantly decreased compared with model group II.

40|$|Maternal {{nutrition}} {{during the}} period of early organ development can modulate the offspring's ability to metabolise excess fat as young adults when exposed to an obesogenic environment. This study examined the hypothesis that exposing offspring to nutrient restriction coincident with early hepatogenesis would result in endocrine and metabolic adaptations that subsequently lead to increased ectopic lipid accumulation within the liver. Pregnant sheep were fed either 50 or 100 % of total metabolisable energy requirements from 30 to 80 days gestation and 100 % thereafter. At weaning, offspring were made obese, and at ∼ 1 year of age livers were sampled. Lipid <b>infiltration</b> and molecular <b>indices</b> of gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function were measured. Although hepatic triglyceride accumulation was not affected by obesity per se, it was nearly doubled in obese offspring born to nutrient-restricted mothers. This adaptation was accompanied by elevated gene expression for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG) and its co-activator PGC 1 α, which may be indicative of changes in the rate of hepatic fatty acid oxidation. In contrast, maternal diet had no influence on the stimulatory effect of obesity on gene expression for a range of proteins involved in glucose metabolism and energy balance including glucokinase, glucocorticoid receptors and uncoupling protein 2. Similarly, although gene expressions for the insulin and IGF 1 receptors were suppressed by obesity they were not influenced by the prenatal nutritional environment. In conclusion, excess hepatic lipid accumulation with juvenile obesity is promoted by suboptimal nutrition coincident with early development of the fetal liver...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction In acute lung injury (ALI), {{elevation}} of procollagen type III (PC III) occurs early {{and has an}} adverse impact on outcome. We examined whether different high-inflation strategies of mechanical ventilation (MV) in oleic acid (OA) ALI alter regional expression of PC III. Methods We designed an experimental, randomized, and controlled protocol in which rats were allocated to two control groups (no injury, recruited [alveolar recruitment maneuver after tracheotomy without MV; n = 4 rats] and control [n = 5 rats]) or four injured groups (one exposed to OA only [n = 10 rats] and three OA-injured and ventilated). The three OA-injured groups were ventilated for 1 hour according to the following strategies: LVHP-S (low volume-high positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], supine; n = 10 rats, tidal volume [VT] = 8 ml/kg, PEEP = 12 cm H 2 O), HVLP-S (high volume-low PEEP, supine; n = 10 rats, VT = 20 ml/kg, PEEP = 5 cm H 2 O), and HVLP-P (high volume-low PEEP, prone; n = 10 rats). Northern blot analysis for PC III and interleukin- 1 -beta (IL- 1 β) and polymorphonuclear <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> (PMI) counting were performed in nondependent and dependent regions. Regional differences between groups were assessed by two-way analysis of variance after logarithmic transformation and post hoc tests. Results A significant interaction for group and region effects was observed for PC III (p = 0. 012) with higher expression in the nondependent region for HVLP-S and LVHP-S, intermediate for OA and HVLP-P, and lower for control (group effect, p < 0. 00001, partial η 2 = 0. 767; region effect, p = 0. 0007, partial η 2 = 0. 091). We found high expression of IL- 1 β (group effect, p < 0. 00001, partial η 2 = 0. 944) in the OA, HVLP-S, and HVLP-P groups without regional differences (p = 0. 16). PMI behaved similarly (group effect, p < 0. 00001, partial η 2 = 0. 832). Conclusion PC III expression is higher in nondependent regions and in ventilatory strategies that caused overdistension.

40|$|The Minerals and Petroleum Resources Act (MRPDA) No 28 of 2002 of South Africa {{states that}} the holder of a mining permit remains liable for {{environmental}} consequences until a closure certificate has been issued, but does not stipulate the environmental standards required to obtain such a certificate. Monitoring of surface mining environments requires a consistent, repeatable and efficient method of monitoring that can be applicable to heterogeneous landscapes on large properties. To this end, this study forms a component towards the development and local testing of an internationally accepted, monitoring toolkit to monitor mine rehabilitation. Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) is a technique to rapidly determine broad biogeochemical processes occurring at the soil surface in heterogeneous landscapes. However, LFA is time consuming. Hyperspectral remote sensing (HSRS) is an alternative technique for monitoring large landscapes and is sensitive to both plant response to stress and soil minerals. The {{aim of this study}} is to derive LFA indices from HSRS (i. e. surface reflectance) data acquired with a hand-held spectrometer in order to predict landscape condition on deep-level gold mining surface environments in the Highveld region. The first objective was to test the potential of Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) modelling to predict LFA indices from the spectral data. The second objective was to test the potential for using Vegetation Indices (VI), calculated from hyperspectral data, to predict LFA indices. Twenty-three VIs, covering plant pigments (i. e. chlorophyll, carotenoids and anthocyanins), plant structural components (cellulose and lignin) and plant water content, were tested. The study was carried out in winter (dry season) as this is the season when disturbance is most visible, and both seasonal (deciduous) vegetation growth and annual species are absent. The study was carried out at two gold and uranium mining operations in the Highveld grassland biome: West Wits Operations near Carletonville (Gauteng Province) and Vaal River Operations near Klerksdorp (North West Province). At Vaal River, data was collected from high and low disturbance sites replicated three times, in each of four of the dominant vegetation types: wet grasslands, non-rocky grasslands, rocky grasslands and woody shrub sites representing increasing structural complexity. At West Wits Operations (n = 6 sampling plots), only non-rocky grasslands were sampled. Twenty five circular quadrats of 50 cm diameter were evenly distributed on five gradsects within each plot (Total quadrats = 750). Paired data acquired from each quadrat were reflectance data (44 cm field of view), LFA data (50 cm circular quadrat), and a photograph for later allocation of the remaining LFA data. Time constraints collecting LFA data reduced the total number of quadrats sampled in the field from 750 quadrats to 150 quadrats. Difficulties in accurately pairing the LFA and HSRS data further reduced the number of quadrats I used for statistical analyses to 105. The results of ranking the three LFA indices showed that stability was above the threshold value for sustainability, while infiltration was below threshold and nutrient cycling was close to threshold for all vegetation types and disturbance levels combined. These results suggest that soils were crusted and promoting run-off, and that disturbance was mainly impacting the vegetation component, rather than the soil component of the landscape. A comparison of non-rocky grasslands between the two mining regions showed that West Wits had higher LFA indices for infiltration and nutrient cycling (t-test, P ≤ 0. 01, DF = 36. 8 and 26. 4 respectively) than Vaal River. All three LFA indices: stability, infiltration and nutrient cycling, differed between vegetation types (One-way ANOVA, P < 0. 05, DF = 3, 101) with wet grasslands having consistently higher LFA indices than the other three vegetation types. Disturbance levels, combining vegetation types and mining region, also differed (t-tests, P < 0. 01, DF = 81. 8, 102. 3 and 100. 08 for stability, infiltration and nutrient cycling respectively), with high disturbance quadrats having lower LFA indices than low disturbance quadrats. When comparing LFA indices between disturbance levels within each vegetation type, low disturbance sites generally still had higher LFA indices than high disturbance sites (P < 0. 05). These findings support the initial selection of distinct vegetation types and disturbance levels, with exceptions to this pattern believed to be a result of low replication (n = 5) for these vegetation types. The twenty-three VIs were not useful for predicting LFA indices from HSRS data under my experimental conditions. All the VIs had generally low indices as expected (in the case of chlorophyll and plant water-based VIs) for winter senesced Highveld grasses. All linear regressions between LFA indices and VIs had very weak coefficients of determination (r 2 < 26 %). The lignin index (NDLI) had the strongest coefficient of determination for both the stability (r 2 = 25 %, P < 0. 01) and the nutrient cycling indices (r 2 = 25 %, P < 0. 01). The <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> had the strongest coefficient of determination with the standard normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r 2 = 16 %, P < 0. 01). VIs had generally very low indices due to the winter senesced state of the Highveld vegetation. PLSR modelling produced much stronger regression coefficients of determination than did the VIs. The best PLSR model was a 15 -component model to predict nutrient cycling (r 2 = 54 %, P < 0. 01). A 13 -component model predicting stability had an r 2 = 38 % (P < 0. 01), while a 17 -component model was derived for infiltration (r 2 = 32 %, P < 0. 01). In all three cases, these models were able to account for more than 90 % of the spectral variability within the first two components. However, more than 16 components were required to account for 90 % of the variability in the LFA measurements. It may be possible to reduce the number of components required for the PLSR modelling of the latter with a more standardised approach to the LFA data collection, i. e. having one observer who acquires all the LFA data in the field, and increased replication...|$|E

À la fin des simulations, l’analyse statistique des sorties permet d’apprécier l’étendue de la variabilité de la réponse du bassin aux événements pluvieux et de caractériser les débits et les temps de pointe. Un total de 44  simulations ont été menées pour chacun des 15  événements observés pour un petit bassin versant situé en Tunisie centrale. L’analyse des hydrogrammes générés a montré une assez faible dispersion des débits de pointe, d’une simulation à l’autre, pour un événement donné, et a mis en évidence la dissymétrie des distributions des débits et temps de pointe. L’exploitation des résultats de l’ensemble des simulations {{permet de}} dégager des relations empiriques caractérisant le comportement du bassin selon les débits de pointe, les temps de pointe, les temps de base et les volumes écoulés. The predetermination of peak discharges and flood volumes of ungauged basins {{is an important}} aspect of the management of surface waters, protection against floods, water supply, etc. In this study, a method is proposed for the predetermination of discharges from rainfall data. The method associates effective rainfall obtained from Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) with a unit hydrograph based on geomorphology. The unit hydrograph (UH) based on geomorphology is selected knowing that the parameters can be obtained from topographic charts, soil charts and ground occupation charts, as well as from soil data. The UH used was produced from the Nash cascade model in which the scale and shape parameters were taken from the literature. These parameters depend on the hydrographical network, the Horton ratios and the average peak flow velocity, which is assumed to be constant throughout the network and with respect to time. The average peak flow velocity can be expressed as a function of 1) geomorphologic parameters such as the total surface area of the basin, the slope of the highest order stream, the Manning-Strickler coefficient, the width of the channel, the kinematic wave parameter of the highest order stream and the length of the main channel, and 2) the effective rainfall intensity and duration. With respect to effective rainfall intensities, the idea is to consider the effective rainfall as a vector of the parameters of the hydrological model, and then to use the MCS method to generate the corresponding components. The proposed simulation framework includes: 1)  the specification of the data for which the geomorphologic parameters and the time increments are fixed for all simulations, whereas the duration of the total rainfall and the effective rainfall volume vary from one event to another, and constitute constraints determining whether or not simulations should be rejected, 2)  the random drawing of effective rainfall intensities and durations, 3)  the computation of resulting hydrographs and 4)  the analysis of the simulated hydrographs, where the hydrographs are first simulated for each event and then simulated in their entirety to highlight indicators to characterize outputs. In order to statistically interpret the simulated hydrographs, the generated peak discharges were classified for each event, and their 25 th, 50 th and 75 th percentiles were analyzed. The same treatment was applied to the simulated times to attain peak values. The use of the 25 th and 75 th percentiles makes it possible to evaluate the extent of the 50 % interval of the simulated discharges, whereas the median and the mode make it possible to position values representative of the distribution of the generated discharges. The hydrographs are assumed have the same “recurrence” as their peak discharge. Hydrograph generation by the MCS method is a two step process: 1) the generation of effective rainfall intensities {{based on the assumption that}} the total volume is observed, and 2) the convolution of the unit hydrograph resulting from each interval of effective rainfall. The study site, Saddine 1, is a small catchment with a surface area of 384 hectares. It is located adjacent to Makthar in Tunisia (northern latitude 35 ° 48 ’ 06 ’’ and longitude 9 ° 04 ’ 09 ’’) in a mountainous zone. The catchment is controlled by a small headwater dam and was monitored from 1992 to 1999. Observed over periods of five minutes, the maximum rainfall intensity was 324  mm/h and the minimal intensity was 10  mm/h. The maximum total rainfall recorded for an event was of 106  mm. The longest duration for an event was of approximately 5  hours (299  min) and shortest was 12  minutes. A great disparity in the volumes was also noted: the maximum volume observed was 67, 200  m 3 whereas the minimum was 1, 275  m 3. The peak discharges of the recorded hydrographs were very variable with a minimum/maximum ratio of about 1 / 1370. Indeed the maximum discharge observed was 85. 6  m 3 /s, and the minimum discharge only 0. 062  m 3 /s. The time to attain peak flows for the rainfall events varied from 10 to 120  minutes. The effective rainfall intensities were calculated using the <b>infiltration</b> <b>index</b> method, ϕ, which remains a method still largely used in spite of its rudimentary character. The effective rainfalls estimated for each event varied from 0. 3  mm with 17. 5  mm. Before using the MCS, the model was calibrated. The results of the calibration analysis showed that the calculated hydrographs were reasonable comparable to the observed hydrographs. In addition to the shape, the peak discharge and the peak time reconstitutions were satisfactory. A total of 44  simulations were carried out for each of the 15  events observed, of which 13 allowed for the identification of the distributions of effective rainfall intensities and durations. The remaining two events were used for the validation of the approach. The analysis of the generated hydrographs showed a rather weak dispersion of the peak output from one simulation to another, for a given event. Moreover, the discharges and times to attain peak discharge resulting from the generated hydrographs followed a dissymmetrical distribution. The observed values of the peak discharges and times to attain peak discharge represent realisations of output simulations with different probabilities of occurrence. In order to capitalize on the model, relationships between simulated peak discharges, times to peak discharge, base times and volumes were constructed...|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{connectivity}} {{relates to}} the transfer of sediments from sources to sinks via runoff and in channel transport. It is highly dependent on spatial variability of landscape properties such as differences in morphology, land use and infiltration/runoff characteristics but may also vary in time {{due to differences in}} rainfall amount/intensity and changes in vegetation cover throughout the year. In the Loire river basin, we found that sediment fluxes displayed strong variations in space but also at the interannual and seasonnal time scales (Gay et al. 2013). In this context, our goal is to better understand and quantify hillslope sediment redistributions within this lowland area thanks to the use of semi distributed connectivity approach. To this aim, Borselli's index of connectivity (IC, Borselli et al., 2008) is selected to assess hillslope connectivity at annual and seasonal time scales. Several improvements are proposed {{to take into account the}} coupling of the structural landscape connectivity and its hydrosedimentary response.

This study aimed to evaluate the structure and function of a semi-steppe rangeland using Landscape Function Analysis technique (LFA) in different land conditions in western Isfahan province, Iran. For this purpose, 4, 3 and 7 sites in different rangeland condition classes including very poor, poor, and moderate were selected respectively. In each site, a 30 -meter transect was established and all kinds of patches and inter patches were identified and their lengths and widths were recorded. Also, in each ecological patch, 11 indicators of soil surface characteristics with three replications were measured, and their status was scored according to LFA method. The functionality indices of all the sites including soil stability, infiltration and nutrient cycling were measured. According to the statistical analysis results, most of the structural characteristics (number of patches, patch length, patch area index, landscape organization index) and functional <b>indices</b> (<b>infiltration,</b> stability and nutrient cycling status) varied significantly (α= 5 %) between rangeland sites with moderate and very poor condition.

40|$|Abstract Background Leukocyte {{infiltration}} {{plays an}} important role in the pathogenesis and progression of myositis, and is highly associated with disease severity. Currently, there is a lack of: efficacious therapies for myositis; understanding of the molecular features important for disease pathogenesis; and potential molecular biomarkers for characterizing inflammatory myopathies to aid in clinical development. Methods In this study, we developed a simple model and predicted that 1) leukocyte-specific transcripts (including both protein-coding transcripts and microRNAs) should be coherently overexpressed in myositis muscle and 2) the level of over-expression of these transcripts should be correlated with leukocyte infiltration. We applied this model to assess immune cell infiltration in myositis by examining mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in muscle biopsies from 31 myositis patients and 5 normal controls. Results Several gene signatures, including a leukocyte index, type 1 interferon (IFN), MHC class I, and immunoglobulin signature, were developed to characterize myositis patients at the molecular level. The leukocyte index, consisting of genes predominantly associated with immune function, displayed strong concordance with pathological assessment of immune cell <b>infiltration.</b> This leukocyte <b>index</b> was subsequently utilized to differentiate transcriptional changes due to leukocyte infiltration from other alterations in myositis muscle. Results from this differentiation revealed biologically relevant differences in the relationship between the type 1 IFN pathway, miR- 146 a, and leukocyte infiltration within various myositis subtypes. Conclusions Results indicate that a likely interaction between miR- 146 a expression and the type 1 IFN pathway is confounded by the level of leukocyte infiltration into muscle tissue. Although the role of miR- 146 a in myositis remains uncertain, our results highlight the potential benefit of deconvoluting the source of transcriptional changes in myositis muscle or other heterogeneous tissue samples. Taken together, the leukocyte index and other gene signatures developed in this study may be potential molecular biomarkers to help to further characterize inflammatory myopathies and aid in clinical development. These hypotheses need to be confirmed in separate and sufficiently powered clinical trials. </p...|$|R
