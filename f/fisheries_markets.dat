50|$|The Constitution {{provides}} for a three-fold distribution of legislative subjects between the Union andthe states, viz., List-I (the Union List), List-II (the State List) and List-III (the Concurrent List) in theSeventh Schedule:(i) The Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws with respect {{to any of the}} mattersenumerated in the Union List. This list has at present 100 subjects (originally 97 subjects)like defence, banking, foreign affairs, currency, atomic energy, insurance, communication,inter-state trade and commerce, census, audit and so on.(ii) The state legislature has “in normal circumstances” exclusive powers to make laws withrespect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List. This has at present 61 subjects(originally 66 subjects) like public order, police, public health and sanitation, agriculture,prisons, local government, <b>fisheries,</b> <b>markets,</b> theaters, gambling and so on.(iii) Both, the Parliament and state legislature can make laws with respect to any of the mattersenumerated in the Concurrent List. This list has at present 52 subjects (originally 47 subjects)like criminal law and procedure, civil procedure, marriage and divorce, population controland family planning, electricity, labour wel-fare, economic and social planning, drugs,newspapers, books and printing press, and others. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976transferred five subjects to Concurrent List from State List, that is, (a) education, (b) forests,(c) weights and measures, (d) protection of wild animals and birds, and (e) administration ofjustice; constitu-tion and organisation of all courts except the Supreme Court and the highcourts.The power to make laws with respect to residuary subjects (i.e., the matters which are notenumerated in any of the three lists) is vested in the Parliament. This residuary power of legisla-tionincludes the power to levy residuary taxes.From the above scheme, {{it is clear that the}} matters of national importance and the matters whichrequires uniformity of legislation nationwide are included in the Union List. The matters of regionaland local importance and the matters which permits diversity of interest are specified in the StateList. The matters on which uniformity of legislation throughout the country is desirable but notessential are enumerated in the concurrent list. Thus, it permits diversity along with uniformity.In US, only the powers of the Federal Government are enumerated in the Constitution and theresiduary powers are left to the states. The Australian Constitution followed the American pattern ofsingle enumeration of powers. In Canada, on the other hand, there is a double enumeration—Federaland Provincial, and the residuary powers are vested in the Centre.The Government of India (GoI) Act of 1935 provided for a three-fold emumenration, viz., federal,provincial and concurrent. The present Constitution follows the scheme of this act but with onedifference, that is, under this act, the residuary powers were given neither to the federal legislaturenor to the provincial legislature but to the governor-general of India. In this respect, India follows theCanadian precedent.The Constitution expressly secure the predominance of the Union List over the State List and theConcurrent List and that of the Concurrent List over the State List. Thus, in case of overlappingbetween the Union List and the State List, the former should prevail. In case of overlapping betweenthe Union List and the Concurrent List, it is again the former which should prevail. Where there is aconflict between the Concurrent List and the State List, it is the former that should prevail.In case of a conflict between the Central law and the state law on a subject enumerated in theConcurrent List, the Central law prevails over the state law. But, there is an exception. If the state lawhas been reserved for the consideration of the president and has received his assent, then the state lawprevails in that state. But, it would still be competent for the Parliament to override such a law bysubsequently making a law on the same matter.''''3. Parliamentary Legislation in the State Field''''''The above scheme of distribution of legislative powers between the Centre and the states is to bemaintained in normal times. But, in abnormal times, the scheme of distribution is either modified orsuspended. In other words, the Constitution empowers the Parliament to make laws on any matterenumerated in the State List under the following five extraordinary circumstances:When Rajya Sabha Passes a Resolution If the Rajya Sabha declares that it is necessary in thenational interest that Parliament should make laws on a matter in the State List, then the Parliamentbecomes competent to make laws on that matter. Such a resolution must be supported by two-thirds ofthe members present and voting. The resolution remains in force for one year; it can be renewed anynumber of times but not exceeding one year at a time. The laws cease to have effect on the expirationof six months after the resolution has ceased to be in force.This provision does not restrict the power of a state legislature to make laws on the same matter. But,in case of inconsistency between a state law and a parliamentary law, the latter is to prevail.During a National Emergency The Parliament acquires the power to legislate with respect tomatters in the State List, while a proclamation of national emergency is in operation. The lawsbecome inoperative on the expiration of six months after the emergency has ceased to operate.Here also, the power of a state legislature to make laws on the same matter is not restricted. But, incase of repugnancy between a state law and a parliamentary law, the latter is to prevail.When States Make a Request When the legislatures of two or more states pass resolutionsrequesting the Parliament to enact laws on a matter in the State List, then the Parliament can makelaws for regulating that matter. A law so enacted applies only to those states which have passed theresolutions. However, any other state may adopt it afterwards by passing a resolution to that effect inits legislature. Such a law can be amended or repealed only by the Parliament and not by thelegislatures of the concerned states.The effect of passing a resolution under the above provision is that the Parliament becomes entitled tolegislate with respect to a matter for which it has no power to make a law. On the other hand, the statelegislature ceases to have the power to make a law with respect to that matter. The resolutionoperates as abdication or surrender of the power of the state legislature with respect to that matterand it is placed entirely in the hands of Parliament which alone can then legislate with respect to it.Some examples of laws passed under the above provision are Prize Competition Act, 1955; WildLife (Protection) Act, 1972; Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; Urban Land(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976; and Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994.To Implement International Agreements The Parliament can make laws on any matter in the StateList for implementing the international treaties, agreements or conventions. This provision enables theCentral government to fulfil its international obligations and commitments.Some examples of laws enacted under the above provision are United Nations (Privileges andImmunities) Act, 1947; Geneva Convention Act, 1960; Anti-Hijacking Act, 1982 and legislationsrelating to environment and TRIPS.During President’s Rule When the President’s rule is imposed in a state, the Parliament becomesempowered to make laws with respect to any matter in the State List in relation to that state. A lawmade so by the Parliament continues to be operative even after the president’s rule. This means thatthe period for which such a law remains in force is not co-terminus with the duration of thePresident’s rule. But, such a law can be repealed or altered or re-enacted by the state legislature.4. Centre’s Control Over State LegislationBesides the Parliament’s power to legislate directly on the state subjects under the exceptionalsituations, the Constitution empowers the Centre to exercise control over the state’s legislativematters in the following ways:(i) The governor can reserve certain types of bills passed by the state legislature for theconsideration of the President. The president enjoys absolute veto over them.(ii) Bills on certain matters enumerated in the State List can be introduced in the state legislatureonly with the previous sanction of the president. (For example, the bills imposing restrictionson the freedom of trade and commerce).(iii) The President can direct the states to reserve money bills and other financial bills passed bythe state legislature for his consideration during a financial emergency.From the above, it is clear that the Constitution has assigned a position of superiority to the Centre inthe legislative sphere. In this context, the Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations (1983-87)observed: “The rule of federal supremacy is a technique to avoid absurdity, resolve conflict andensure harmony between the Union and state laws. If this principle of union supremacy is excluded, itis not difficult to imagine its deleterious results. There will be every possibility of our two-tierpolitical system being stultified by interference, strife, legal chaos and confusion caused by a host ofconflicting laws, much to the bewilderment of the common citizen. Integrated legislative policy anduniformity on basic issues of common Union-state concern will be stymied. The federal principle ofunity in diversity will be very much a casualty. This rule of federal supremacy, therefore, isindispensable for the successful functioning of the federal system”.|$|E

In this regard, the main problem to be studied is the involvement of marketing bodies in marketing the products quickly and efficiently. Considering that the fish is a vulnerable commodity, like other agricultural commodities, the fishermen as the producers, then, have a weak position and lower bargaining power in the marketplace, and hence, it makes the market structures compete imperfectly. Moreover, this study is intended to know the efficiency level of <b>fishery</b> <b>marketing</b> system based on the governmental policy in providing proper facilities for the purposes, such as: the place for fishermen port, the place for fishery auction, and the center for <b>fishery</b> <b>marketing,</b> which all can provide a proper benefit for the fishermen by selling their products through the marketing system operated in the Region of Fish Market Base of Muara Baru.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the {{marketing}} of fish has {{recognized the importance of}} quality. Yet empirical analysis of market transactions could give us little insight into the value of different qualities of fish because market data are typically aggregated. We exploit a dataset on the auction price of tuna sold in Hawaii to estimate a hedonic model. The model provides empirical estimates of price increments due to species, quality of the fish such as size or fat content, method of handling, and market conditions. The empirical results are also used to estimate price flexibilities for landings in Hawaii. Key words: fish prices, fish quality, hedonic models, tuna. Recent analyses of <b>fisheries</b> <b>markets</b> have be-gun to devote more attention to the quality attributes of fish. This is partly attributed to better availability of data; however, the in-creased concern for managing fisheries (Blomo et al., Wang and Kellogg) and the expansion of controlled production through aquaculture (Anderson and Kusakabe) may also be factors. Harvesters and fishery man-agers have an interest in learning about the costs and prices of fish characteristics. Con-joint analysis is the most prevalent approach of learning about consumer preferences for fish. This method relies on answers to hypo-thetical responses to survey questions from market participants regarding their prefer-ences for seafood with differing characteris...|$|E
40|$|Catch share {{programs}} {{implemented in}} U. S. fisheries provide {{an alternative to}} traditional fishing practices and a means to deter overfishing and overcapitalization in <b>fisheries</b> <b>markets.</b> Research suggests that catch share programs are responsible tools for sustainable fishing, {{but there are still}} open questions concerning their impact on fishing behavior. Catch share programs, more specifically Individual Fishing Quotas, give fishermen a greater window of opportunity in the season, as well as their own quota share of the total annual catch; this defeats the race to fish in the beginning of seasons that ultimately leads to overcapitalization. Fishermen may be less likely to oversaturate the market and less likely to freeze fish to sell at a later time. With more fresh fish in the market {{as a result of a}} catch share program implementation, it may be the case that market prices of fish increase as the pattern of landings become smoother and more consistent. This paper examines these hypotheses using data of landings and landings value from 10 U. S. catch share programs. This data is then analyzed as a time series using local polynomial smoothing and testing for structural breaks in the variance and the mean. The results of this study were not conclusive, as most species did not show a smoother time trend as a result of a catch share program introduction. The results do leave room for further analysis to better examine all the variables and underlying trends...|$|E

40|$|Surveys of {{commercial}} markets combined with molecular taxonomy (i. e. molecular monitoring) {{provide a means}} to detect products from illegal, unregulated and/or unreported (IUU) exploitation, including the sale of fisheries bycatch and wild meat (bushmeat). Capture-recapture analyses of market products using DNA profiling {{have the potential to}} estimate the total number of individuals entering the market. However, these analyses are not directly analogous to those of living individuals because a ‘market individual’ does not die suddenly but, instead, remains available for a time in decreasing quantities, rather like the exponential decay of a radioactive isotope. Here we use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and microsatellite genotypes to individually identify products from North Pacific minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata ssp.) purchased in 12 surveys of markets in the Republic of (South) Korea from 1999 to 2003. By applying a novel capture-recapture model with a decay rate parameter to the 205 unique DNA profiles found among 289 products, we estimated that the total number of whales entering trade across the five-year survey period was 827 (SE, 164; CV, 0. 20) and that the average ‘half-life’ of products from an individual whale on the market was 1. 82 months (SE, 0. 24; CV, 0. 13). Our estimate of whales in trade (reflecting the true numbers killed) was significantly greater than the officially reported bycatch of 458 whales for this period. This unregulated exploitation has serious implications for the survival of this genetically distinct coastal population. Although our capture-recapture model was developed for specific application to the Korean whale-meat markets, the exponential decay function could be modified to improve the estimates of trade in other wildmeat or <b>fisheries</b> <b>markets</b> or abundance of living populations by noninvasive genotyping...|$|E

40|$|WP 08 / 14; This paper {{would be}} {{a review of the}} {{literature}} of the main and innovative methodologies of evaluation of real investments: the real option approach (ROA). In particular, the aim of this work is to define an optimal methodology and to select the main drivers that permit to make a more accurate evaluation of the investments in the <b>fishery</b> <b>market.</b> ROA methodology comes from the need to overtake the traditional theory of the net present value (NPV) and from the need for the management of a fishery enterprise to adapt to the future market conditions and to the competitive behavior in the changes of the fishery techniques. ROA was born from the theory of Dixit & Pyndick (1994) that started to use the models of the financial option theories in order to evaluate investments in other sectors like oil, energy, ICT, manufacturing. From a theoretical point of view, indeed, real investments are characterized by “irreversibility” and “possibility of delay” since a manager can defer, expand, abandon an initial project in different years of its own operational life. In this context, despite of the financial option models ROA has a real investment as underlying asset. If the enterprise decides to invest in a real investment it means that the enterprise exercises an option and this decision is irreversible. In the context of the Ritmare project, we would use the same methodological approach by using the evaluation of the investments in the <b>fishery</b> <b>market.</b> Our first step is to provide a review of the main papers that focus on ROA in the fishery with some empirical applications. Finally, we also try to underline the main drivers or variables of the literature that permits to use the ROA and to present a possible scheme of work to apply to the <b>fishery</b> <b>market,</b> by using data at regional or municipal leve...|$|R
