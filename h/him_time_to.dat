5|$|Despite those players' {{performance}}s, {{the game}} was decided in the running game {{and the performance of}} the two teams' offensive and defensive lines. Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh was praised for adjusting his team's strategy at halftime, allowing it to succeed in the second half. Stanford's rushing offense accounted for 247 yards, while its defensive line limited Virginia Tech to just 67 yards rushing. The Stanford defense also sacked Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor eight times, denying <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> pass the ball accurately.|$|E
5|$|From 1921 to 1923 Wilson taught {{music at}} Bedales School, an {{appointment}} that left <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> take singing engagements {{all over the}} United Kingdom. In 1924 he left the English Singers and furthered his singing studies abroad, first in Nice with Jean de Reszke (1924–25), with whom he learned the roles of Otello, Parsifal and Tristan; he then took lessons with Sir George Henschel (1925–28), and studied 17th- and 18th-century music with Wanda Landowska in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Had Napoleon {{succeeded in}} {{destroying}} the existing coalition forces south of Brussels {{before they were}} reinforced, {{he might have been}} able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war.

5|$|In Zürich, Vermigli succeeded Konrad Pellikan as {{the chair}} of Hebrew, a {{position}} he would hold until his death. He married his second wife, Catarina Merenda of Brescia, Italy, in 1559. Vermigli was able to share his teaching duties with fellow Hebraist Theodor Bibliander, allowing <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> study and prepare the notes from his previous lectures for publication. He began lecturing on the books of Samuel and Kings. While in Zürich, Vermigli declined invitations to desirable positions in Geneva, Heidelberg, and England.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Miller had the {{upcoming}} Test series against England in 1946–47 {{to look forward}} to. He therefore approached his employers for two months leave {{so that he could}} travel to the United States to marry Wagner, which would allow <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> return in preparation for the international series. Vacuum Oil refused, so, with the comfort of job security in England, Miller resigned.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{announced}} his candidacy on January 18, 1971, during a televised speech {{from the studios}} of KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. At the time of his announcement, McGovern ranked fifth among Democrats in a presidential preference Gallup Poll. The earliest such entry since Andrew Jackson was designed to give <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> overcome the large lead of the front-runner, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. Nevertheless, by January 1972, McGovern had only 3percent national support among Democrats in the Gallup Poll and had not attracted significant press coverage.|$|E

5|$|Trumble {{joined the}} National Bank of Australasia in 1887 {{to begin a}} career in banking. While the bank often allowed <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> practice, his {{frequent}} absences with cricket meant his career progression was slow; after each of his five tours of England he returned to find junior bank officers promoted over him. Nevertheless, he was appointed accountant at the Richmond branch in 1903 and after his retirement from cricket in 1908, manager of the Kew branch.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gardens}} thrived {{in their early}} years, by 1842 Jennison was in {{financial}} difficulties, and on 13December bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Jennison's problems were caused by his failure to sell the Strawberry Gardens property, competition from the recently opened Manchester Zoological Gardens, and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway track cutting through the land Jennison had leased in December 1836, restricting access to the gardens. Jennison twice tried unsuccessfully to sell Belle Vue, after which his creditors allowed <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make a success of the gardens; {{by the end of}} the 1843 season Jennison was able to repay his debts. The railway that had been a thorn in his side eventually proved to be an asset when Longsight railway station was re-sited closer to Belle Vue in 1842, making it easier for visitors to reach the gardens.|$|E
5|$|The loan {{was twice}} {{extended}} {{for a further}} month, and on 11 November 2002 Gill left Birmingham permanently, signing for Northampton {{until the end of}} the season. His season proceeded successfully– a new two-year contract had been discussed, and he finished as runner-up for the club's Player of the Year award– until with two games remaining he damaged his anterior cruciate ligament and was expected to be out for several months. Northampton were prepared to give him a six-month contract, albeit on reduced wages, to allow <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover and prove his fitness. Birmingham City allowed him to use their facilities for his rehabilitation, and he recovered sufficiently to play a couple of reserve games for Northampton, but by that time new manager Colin Calderwood had other players in Gill's position and he was not offered another contract.|$|E

5|$|To {{supplement}} {{his income}} and {{help pay for}} his legal training, Druitt worked as an assistant schoolmaster at George Valentine's boarding school, 9 Eliot Place, Blackheath, London, from 1880. The school had a long and distinguished history; Benjamin Disraeli had been a pupil there in the 1810s, and boys from the school had been playmates of a younger son of Queen Victoria, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, who as a boy in the 1860s had lived nearby at Greenwich Park. Druitt's post came with accommodation in Eliot Place, and the long school holidays gave <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> study the law and to pursue his interest in cricket.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two Tests, Hutton shared three {{consecutive}} century opening partnerships with Cyril Washbrook. A four-hour 94 in the first innings was followed by 76 in the second. Press opinion was divided over Hutton's performance; some critics, including the Australian bowlers, detected insecurity against fast bowling, particularly the bouncers with which Ray Lindwall and Miller targeted him. Hutton's preferred tactic of ducking under the ball reinforced {{the impression that he}} was afraid. In the final Test, Hutton scored a century, batting through the first day to score 122 not out, his first Test century in Australia, despite another barrage from Lindwall and Miller. The Sydney Morning Herald criticised the high number of short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, bowled at Hutton as often as three times per over. After the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with tonsillitis, missed the remainder of the match and flew home soon after. In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38, while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12; he topped both sets of averages. Wisden noted that it took <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health. Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself reasonably well.|$|E

25|$|At UMNO's general {{assembly}} in 2002, Mahathir {{announced that he}} would resign as prime minister, only for supporters to rush to the stage and convince him tearfully to remain.

Having spent over 22 years in office, Mahathir was the world's longest-serving elected leader when he retired. He remains Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister.|$|E

He kept writing short fiction but found it impossible to get published.|$|E
25|$|In January 1684, Edmond Halley, Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke had a {{conversation}} in which Hooke claimed to not only have derived the inverse-square law, but also all the laws of planetary motion. Wren was unconvinced, Hooke did not produce the claimed derivation although the others gave <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do it, and Halley, who could derive the inverse-square law for the restricted circular case (by substituting Kepler's relation into Huygens' formula for the centrifugal force) but failed to derive the relation generally, resolved to ask Newton.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} from the band's 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986.

Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow <b>him</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recuperate. Garcia reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight. He also became a vegetarian.|$|E
