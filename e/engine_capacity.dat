5|$|For 1966, the <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> {{limit in}} Formula One was doubled from 1.5litres (92cuin) to 3litres (183cuin). It was not {{feasible}} to enlarge existing 1.5-litre engines {{to take full}} advantage of the higher limit and Climax chose not to develop a new 3-litre motor, leaving many teams without a viable engine for 1966.|$|E
5|$|The W427's name is {{the result}} of a {{combination}} of factors. W is to honour the founder of HSV, Tom Walkinshaw. The 427 is simply the <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> in cubic inches, but it is also a nod to the HRT 427C, which won the 2002 and 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour motor races.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} conceived in 1965 for a 1.5-litre (92-cubic inch) Coventry Climax engine, but never raced in this form. For the 1966 Formula One season the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) doubled the limit on <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> to 3litres (183cuin). Australian company Repco {{developed a new}} V8 engine for Brabham's use in 1966, but a disagreement between Brabham and Tauranac over the latter's role in the racing team left no time {{to develop a new}} car to handle it. Instead, the existing BT19 chassis was modified for the job.|$|E

5|$|The FIA {{doubled the}} Formula One <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> limit to 3litres for the 1966 season and {{suitable}} engines were scarce. Brabham used engines from Australian engineering firm Repco, {{which had never}} produced a Formula One engine before, based on aluminium V8 engine blocks from the defunct American Oldsmobile F85 road car project, and other off-the-shelf parts. Consulting and design engineer Phil Irving (of Vincent Motorcycle fame) was the project engineer responsible for producing the initial version of the engine. Few expected the Brabham-Repcos to be competitive, but the light and reliable cars ran at the front {{from the start of}} the season. At the French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux, Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in a car bearing his own name. Only his former teammate, Bruce McLaren, has since matched the achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. Brabham won his third title in 1966, becoming the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car carrying his own name (cf Surtees, Hill and Fittipaldi Automotive). In 1967, the title went to Brabham's teammate, New Zealander Denny Hulme. Hulme had better reliability through the year, possibly due to Brabham's desire to try new parts first. The Brabham team took the Constructors' World Championship in both years.|$|E
5|$|For 1966 the Formula One <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> limit was {{increased}} to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 litre limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the internals under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 litre form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the reduced capacity version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow power band and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with the gearbox it weighed nearly as much as rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 litre V8 engine for some of the races. This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and five-speed ZF transaxle gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E
25|$|The Sidecar {{race was}} re-introduced from the 1954 event for Sidecars not {{exceeding}} 500cc <b>engine</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{run on the}} Clypse Course. A non-championship 750cc class for sidecars was introduced at the 1968 event. For the 1976 event the race was held over two-legs. From 1975, the previous 500cc and 750cc classes for Sidecars were replaced by a 1000cc <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> class.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} V70 {{was available}} {{with a wide}} variety of engines, gearboxes and equipment. Standard configuration was front-wheel drive, an all-wheel drive version badged as V70 AWD was available. For some markets Volvo offered a diesel version badged as V70 TDI. In countries with high taxes on cars with more than 2.0L <b>engine</b> <b>capacity,</b> such as Italy, special petrol models with a 2000cc <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> were offered. This included a 2.0T and a 2.0L T5 version, the latter with a slightly lower power output than the 2.3L variant.|$|E
25|$|The {{propulsion}} system {{of this model}} comes from a project by Giuseppe Busso. It was different from his ancestor: it still used several components of the 3-litre engine from the 6C 3000 prototype, but as its name implied <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> was increased to 3,495cc.|$|E

25|$|Ferrari {{completely}} changed their driver line-up for the 1996 Formula One season, replacing Berger and Alesi with former Jordan driver Eddie Irvine, and two-time defending world champion (former Benetton driver) Michael Schumacher, for {{a salary of}} around $30million a year. Many members of the Benetton team's technical staff followed, namely Ross Brawn (technical director) and Rory Byrne (chief designer). New engine rules reducing <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> from 3500cc to 3000cc required Ferrari to switch to the (3.0L) V10 engine for 1996.|$|E
25|$|In the beginning, {{the formula}} was {{largely based on}} pre-World War II {{regulations}} defined by <b>engine</b> <b>capacity.</b> The regulation expected to bring a new balance between supercharged and normally aspirated cars. Non-supercharged 4.5-litre pre-war Grand Prix cars were allowed to race against the pre-war 1.5-litre supercharged 'voiturettes', while pre-war supercharged 3-litre Grand Prix cars were banned. The first race under the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix held on 1 September, the race being won by Achille Varzi in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1920s, Alfa's RL was {{considered}} too large and heavy, so {{a new development}} began. The 2-liter formula that had led to Alfa Romeo winning the Automobile World Championship in 1925, changed to 1.5 liter for the 1926 season. The 6C 1500 was introduced in 1925 at the Milan Motor Show, production started 1927, with the P2 Grand Prix car as starting point. <b>Engine</b> <b>capacity</b> was now 1487cc, against the P2's 1987cc, while supercharging was dropped. First versions were bodied by Young and Touring.|$|E
25|$|The V70 XC, also {{referred}} to as V70 AWD Cross Country, was introduced in September 1997 on the Frankfurt Auto Show for the 1998 model year as a crossover version of the V70. It featured standard all-wheel drive and was available with only two engine and gearbox choices. In the US only the 2.4L turbo engine together with an automatic gearbox was available. A 2.0L version of the V70 XC was available only for markets with high taxes on cars with more than 2000cc <b>engine</b> <b>capacity.</b> Standard ride height was increased by 2.6cm over the regular AWD model.|$|E
25|$|The coda to the DBR4's racing career came in mid-1960, {{when a car}} {{was shipped}} to Australia for local racers Lex Davison and Bib Stillwell {{to compete in the}} Australian and New Zealand {{national}} championship Formula Libre races. Fitted with a 3.0-litre engine the car performed much better than had been the case during its brief Formula One life, and Davison took second place in the 1960 Australian Grand Prix. To reflect the increase in <b>engine</b> <b>capacity</b> this car was officially known as the DBR4/300. Stillwell retained the DBR4/300 {{until the end of the}} 1962–63 season.|$|E
