Consequently, prolonged wearing of <b>high</b> heel <b>footwear</b> may increase risks of knee osteoarthritis. Although, {{many studies have}} investigated the effect of heel height on knee joint moments, most studies do {{not account for the}} confounding effect of walking speed. Three-dimensional gait analysis and inverse dynamics were used to investigate the effect of heel height and walking speed on the peak knee joint moment during stance. This found heel height affects the peak knee extension moment more significantly than walking speed. More importantly, this study shows that wearers of higher heel heights are likely to be exposed to greater knee compression forces than when walking faster...|$|R

40|$|American {{football}} {{is associated with}} a high rate of non-contact chronic injuries. Players are able to select from both high and low cut footwear. The aim of the current investigation was to examine the influence of high and low cut American football specific footwear on tibial accelerations and three-dimensional (3 D) kinematics during three sport specific movements. Twelve male American football players performed three movements, run, cut and vertical jump whilst wearing both low and <b>high</b> cut <b>footwear.</b> 3 D kinematics of the lower extremities were measured using an eight-camera motion analysis system alongside tibial acceleration parameters which were obtained using a shank mounted accelerometer. Tibial acceleration and 3 D kinematic differences between the different footwear were examined using either repeated measures or Friedman’s ANOVA. Tibial accelerations were significantly greater in the low cut footwear in comparison to the <b>high</b> cut <b>footwear</b> for the run and cut movements. In addition, peak ankle eversion and tibial internal rotation parameters were shown to be significantly greater in the low cut footwear in the running and cutting movement conditions. The current study indicates that the utilization of low cut American football footwear for training/performance may place American footballers at increased risk from chronic injuries.

We quantified vascular plant propagule pressure associated with different groups of travelers to the high-Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, and evaluated the potential of introduced seeds to germinate under the most favorable average Svalbard soil temperature (10 °C). We sampled the footwear of 259 travelers arriving by air to Svalbard {{during the summer of}} 2008, recording 1, 019 seeds: a mean of 3. 9 (± 0. 8) seeds per traveler. Assuming the seed influx is representative for the whole year, we estimate a yearly seed load of around 270, 000 by this vector alone. Seeds of 53 species were identified from 17 families, with Poaceae having both highest diversity and number of seeds. Eight of the families identified are among those most invasive worldwide, while the majority of the species identified were non-native to Svalbard. The number of seeds was <b>highest</b> on <b>footwear</b> that had been used in forested and alpine areas in the 3 months prior to traveling to Svalbard, and increased with the amount of soil affixed to footwear.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{perceived}} usability {{and use of}} custom- made footwear in diabetic patients who are at high-risk for foot ulceration, and to elucidate the determinants of usability and use. Survey. A total of 153 patients with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, prior plantar foot ulceration and newly prescribed custom-made footwear, recruited from 10 Dutch multidisciplinary foot clinics. The Questionnaire of Usability Evaluation {{was used to assess}} the patients' perception of weight, appearance, comfort, durability, donning/doffing, stability, benefit and overall appreciation of their prescription footwear (all expressed as visual analogue scores). Data on priorities for usability and footwear use (in h/day) were obtained from patient reports. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess determinants of usability and use. Median (interquartile range) score for overall appreciation was 8. 3 (7. 1 - 9. 1). Scores ranged from 6. 5 (4. 5 - 8. 6) for weight to 9. 6 (6. 3 - 9. 9) for donning/doffing. Footwear comfort was listed most often (33. 3 %) as the <b>highest</b> priority. <b>Footwear</b> use was < 60 % of daytime (where daytime was defined as 16 h out of bed) in 58 % of patients.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction Footwear is {{no longer}} just an {{accessory}} but also a protection for the musculoskeletal system, and its most important characteristic is comfort. Objectives This study aims to identify and to analyze the vertical ground reaction force in barefoot women and women with unstable shoes. Methodology Five women aged 25 ± 4 years old and mass of 50 ± 7 kg participated in this study. An AMTI force plate was used for data acquisition. The 10 trials for each situation were considered valid where the subject approached the platform with the right foot and at the speed of 4 km/h ± 5 %. The instable shoe of this study is used in the practice of physical activity. Results The results showed that the first peak force was <b>higher</b> for the <b>footwear</b> situation, about 5 % and significant differences between the barefoot and footwear situation. This significant difference was in the first and second peaks force and in the time of the second peak.

40|$|Background: Footwear {{remains a}} prime {{candidate}} for the prevention and rehabilitation of Achilles tendinopathy as it is thought to decrease tension in the tendon through elevation of the heel. However, evidence for this effect is equivocal. Purpose: This study used an acoustic transmission technique to investigate the effect of running shoes on Achilles tendon loading during barefoot and shod walking. Methods: Acoustic velocity was measured in the Achilles tendon of twelve recreationally–active males (age, 31 ± 9 years; height, 1. 78 ± 0. 06 m; weight, 81. 0 ± 16. 9 kg) during barefoot and shod walking at matched self–selected speed (3. 4 ± 0. 7 km/h). Standard running shoes incorporating a 10 – mm heel offset were used. Vertical ground reaction force and spatiotemporal parameters were determined with an instrumented treadmill. Axial acoustic velocity in the Achilles tendon was measured using a custom built ultrasonic device. All data were acquired {{at a rate of}} 100 Hz during 10 s of steady–state walking. Statistical comparisons between barefoot and shod conditions were made using paired t–tests and repeated measure ANOVAs. Results: Acoustic velocity in the Achilles tendon was highly reproducible and was typified by two maxima (P 1, P 2) and minima (M 1, M 2) during walking. Footwear resulted in a significant increase in step length, stance duration and peak vertical ground reaction force compared to barefoot walking. Peak acoustic velocity in the Achilles tendon (P 1, P 2) was significantly higher with running shoes. Conclusions: Peak acoustic velocity in the Achilles tendon was <b>higher</b> with <b>footwear,</b> suggesting that standard running shoes with a 10 –mm heel offset increase tensile load in the Achilles tendon. Although further research is required, these findings question the therapeutic role of standard running shoes in Achilles tendinopathy...|$|R
40|$|Health and well-being’ {{footwear}} positions {{itself in}} the <b>footwear</b> market between <b>high</b> street <b>footwear</b> and specialist therapeutic footwear. Manufacturers in this footwear category promote benefits when compared with standard footwear. However, the full exploration and validation of such proposed benefits requires scientific exploration {{through the application of}} footwear biomechanics concepts and techniques. The studies herein were undertaken to assess these biomechanical concepts in ‘health and well-being’ footwear, particularly in FitFlopTM footwear. The studies are experimental studies with repeated measures designs. A total of 128 individual participants volunteered, 28 of which were included in two publications. Variables were quantified using an in-shoe plantar pressure measurement system (with a bespoke insole), electromyography, 3 D motion capture, force plates, accelerometers, a modified questionnaire and a custom-made mechanical drop-test device. The research identified that ‘health and well-being’ footwear can be manipulated to increase shock absorption, namely reducing the heel-strike transient magnitude (- 19 %) compared with a flip-flop. ‘Health and well-being’ footwear does induce instability at specific phases of the gait cycle, which is specific to the outsole shape of the footwear. For example the MBT shoe increased muscle activity relating to controlling sagittal plane motion. The biomechanics of gait are also altered compared to standard footwear styles, such as reducing the frontal plane motion of the foot in stance (- 19 %) and the magnitude (- 86 %) and duration (- 98 %) of gripping with the Hallux in swing compared with a flip-flop. The tested ‘health and well-being’ footwear was subjectively rated equally as comfortable as a control shoe with increased regional pressures in the midfoot (≈ 25 %) and decreased peak pressures in the heel (- 22 %). Therefore ‘health and well-being’ footwear may influence the biomechanics of wearers however further exploration of meaningful differences and individual population differences is required. The studies emphasise the importance and relevance of testing walking, as well as running, footwear to the wider footwear biomechanics field and demonstrate how this may be integrated into research and development processes within a footwear company...|$|R

Twenty-four trained male runners {{were randomly assigned to}} either (1) Minimalist footwear transition Combined with gait-retraining over a six-week period ("Combined" group; n =  12) examined in both footwear, or (2) a gait-retraining group only with no minimalist footwear exposure ("Control"; n =  12). Participants were assessed for loading rate, impact peak, vertical, knee and ankle stiffness, and foot-strike using 3 D and kinetic analysis. Loading rate was significantly higher in the Combined group in minimal shoes in pre-tests compared to a Control (P ≤  0. 001), reduced significantly in the Combined group over time (P ≤  0. 001), and was not different to the Control group in post-tests (P =  0. 16). The impact peak (P =  0. 056) and ankle stiffness reduced in both groups (P =  0. 006). Loading rate and vertical stiffness was <b>higher</b> in minimalist <b>footwear</b> than conventional running shoes both pre (P ≤  0. 001) and post (P =  0. 046) the intervention.

This study used general linear mixed-effects models to explore both intra- and inter-individual variations in foot strike pattern among 48 Kalenjin-speaking participants from Kenya who varied in age, sex, body mass, height, running history, and habitual use of <b>footwear.</b> <b>High</b> speed video {{was used to measure}} lower extremity kinematics at ground contact in the sagittal plane while participants ran down 13 meter-long tracks with three variables independently controlled: speed, track stiffness, and step frequency. 72 % of the habitually barefoot and 32 % of the habitually shod participants used multiple strike types, with significantly higher levels of foot strike variation among individuals who ran less frequently and who used lower step frequencies. There was no effect of sex, age, height or weight on foot strike angle, but individuals were more likely to midfoot or forefoot strike when they ran on a stiff surface, had a high preferred stride frequency, were habitually barefoot, and had more experience running. It is hypothesized that strike type variation during running, including a more frequent use of forefoot and midfoot strikes, used to be greater before the introduction of cushioned shoes and paved surfaces...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore, identify and describe the main issues surrounding the footwear experiences of people with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. Methods: A qualitative manifest content analysis of open-ended survey responses concerning footwear experiences was conducted from a national footwear survey of people with chronic musculoskeletal diseases in New Zealand. Eighty-five respondents submitted usable responses. Specific statements in the text were identified as ‘units of analysis’ prior to coding and organisation of these units into emerging mutually-exclusive categories. Content analysis was independently undertaken by three researchers and final categories and coding was achieved through consensus. Frequencies of assigned units of analysis were calculated in order to obtain a quantitative description for each category. Results: Four categories encompassing a total of nine subcategories related to the footwear experiences of respondents emerged from the qualitative data content analysis including: 1) difficulties in finding appropriate footwear; 2) dissatisfaction with therapeutic footwear provision and foot care access; 3) <b>high</b> costs of <b>footwear,</b> foot care and self-care; and 4) satisfaction with therapeutic footwear and foot care.

It reveals the prevalence and trends of contact sensitization in the community, thereby {{paving the way for}} better standard series. There is paucity of large series of patch-tested patients from India. Aim: To report the 9 -year patch-test data from a single general dermatology centre in North India. Methods: Consecutive patients presenting with signs/symptoms of suspected ACD were patch tested from May 1997 to April 2006. The Indian Standard Series was used. Parthenium was tested only in selected patients and cetrimide and chloroxylenol were added to the series. Results: In total, records of 1000 patients (566 male, 434 female) were analyzed, yielding 1155 positive reactions in 590 (59 &#x 0025;) patients. Footwear dermatitis was the commonest suspected diagnosis, followed by ACD to medicaments, cosmetic dermatitis and plant dermatitis. Out of the allergens that were tested in all the patients, positivity to nickel was the commonest (12. 9 &#x 0025;), followed by potassium dichromate (11. 1 &#x 0025;) neomycin (7 &#x 0025;), mercaptobenzthiazole (6. 6 &#x 0025;), nitrofurazone (6 &#x 0025;), colophony (5. 7 &#x 0025;), fragrance mix (5. 5 &#x 0025;) and cobalt chloride (5. 4 &#x 0025;). However, parthenium was the commonest allergen based on the proportion of patients tested with it (14. 5 &#x 0025;).

40|$|Rapid {{manufacturing}} is {{a family}} of technologies that employ additive layer deposition techniques to construct parts from computer based design models. [2] These parts can then be used as prototypes or finished goods. One type of rapid manufacturing technology, Selective Laser Sintering, only allows for a point-by-point sintering process to construct the 3 D representations of CAD models. This makes for long processing periods and is ineffective for high volume manufacturing. However, a new process called high-speed sintering uses infrared energy to 'flash' the polymer powder at multiple points making the layer deposition process much more time efficient. In effect each infusion of energy results in an entire layer being constructed rather than a single point. One of the first industrial applications for this technique is in performance footwear manufacturing. New Balance, a Boston based shoe and apparel company, in collaboration with Loughborough University {{has an interest in}} exploring the technology for low volume parts manufacturing as well as personalized <b>footwear.</b> <b>High</b> speed sintering has the potential to replace injection molding for specific footwear and non-footwear applications. This technology has several key advantages over injection molding including the ability to build complex geometries that would be impossible with injection molding. Also as the technology continues to evolve new materials could improve the mechanical performance of finished parts. Nevertheless, as with commercializing any new technology identifying a cost effective implementation route is a pivotal step. (cont.) This project addressed this concern by thoroughly investigating the current and potential state of high speed sintering. The manufacture of a New Balance shoe part using both high speed sintering and injection molding was directly compared.

40|$|AbstractNotwithstanding laser {{scanning}} {{technology is a}} mature technology used in widening application fields, a variety of barriers hinds its integration in robotized production lines. To face well know problems, as high-costs and not customizable solutions among others, the authors have developed a new family of {{laser scanning}} devices based on off the shelves and low cost hardware components and on a modular design that allow the customization of the device according to the specific application requirements. High accuracy is guaranteed through a computationally efficient non-parametric calibration procedure. Keeping limited the overall cost of the solution provided while increasing in general the sensing capabilities of an Industrial Robot (IR) {{and in particular the}} autonomous recognition of position, orientation and furthermore shape and geometrical features of objects within the robotic workspace, can boost the penetration of IRs in typical traditional industrial sectors where SMEs productive scenario is mainly characterized by manual fabrication processes, high product variability, small batches and little capital investments. <b>High</b> added value <b>footwear</b> industry is a paradigmatic example where hard automation is limited from one side by high variability of products and huge request of autonomous adaptation to cope with different loosely structured fabrication processes and from the other side by a low propensity towards high capital investment that make difficult the penetration of industrial robots. Within the framework of the European Project ROBOFOOT (EU-FP 7 -SMP), authors have conceived and developed a new family of low cost modular and reconfigurable laser scanners and successfully applied in the footwear fabrication scenario. Various operations should be improved by actual measure of the shoe being manufactured, and among the others, the identification of the relative positioning between the last (the plastic element on top of which is built the shoe) and the gripping device is extremely critical because it is still performed manually. Positioning errors in this phase are critical since all robot part-programs depend on the correct alignment of the last with the robot end-effector. To face this problem, a procedure, based on the Iterative Closest Points (ICP) optimization method, has been developed and integrated on board of the laser scanning device that directly communicates with the robot controller to adapt and autonomously correct the part-program to align the tool nominal path with the actual shoe being manufactured. Efficacy of the proposed methods has been proved by measuring the interaction forces between the tool and the last handled by a robot during different technological operations (roughing, polishing etc) typical of the shoe fabrication cycle...|$|R
