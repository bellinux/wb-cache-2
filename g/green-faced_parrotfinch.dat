5000|$|The <b>green-faced</b> <b>parrotfinch</b> (Erythrura viridifacies) is {{a species}} of estrildid finch found in {{northern}} Philippines, around Luzon, Negros and Panay. Its local name is mayang-kawayan in Tagalog.|$|E
50|$|Number of endemic and {{threatened}} {{species of birds}} have been documented in the park, which includes the Visayan hornbill, Negros bleeding-heart, white-winged cuckooshrike, flame-templed babbler, white-throated jungle flycatcher, Visayan flowerpecker and <b>green-faced</b> <b>parrotfinch.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} by deforestation which removes its food supply (bamboo seeds). The cage-bird trade has also affected its population as large numbers of <b>green-faced</b> <b>parrotfinch</b> in many districts of Manila have been caught and exported to the United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{red-eared parrotfinch}} is {{probably}} present on every mountain in central Mindanao. It {{is a very}} unobtrusive and secretive bird. And its high-pitched call is easily overlooked. Its voice, however, is not uncommon at Kitanglad. Unlike the <b>green-faced</b> <b>parrotfinch</b> E. viridifacies, {{it does not appear}} to be strongly dependent on bamboo, and is therefore less irruptive, unpredictable and vulnerable than that species.|$|E
50|$|As a key {{biodiversity}} area, {{the park}} is home to several other threatened and restricted-range birds such as the flame-breasted fruit dove, spotted imperial pigeon, Isabela oriole, green racquet-tail, Philippine eagle-owl, whiskered pitta, Philippine duck, celestial monarch, Luzon water-redstart, ashy-breasted flycatcher, and <b>green-faced</b> <b>parrotfinch.</b> Non-bird population includes the Philippine deer, Philippine crocodile, Malay civet cat, Sierra Madre shrew-mouse, Luzon pygmy fruit bat, and Northern Luzon cloud rat.|$|E
50|$|The Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park {{is within}} the Sierra Madre Biogeographic Zone which lies along {{the eastern side of}} Central Luzon. It is {{considered}} {{as one of the most}} important protected areas system in the Philippines owing to the myriad of rare and endangered species of flora and fauna that it supports. They include the Philippine eagle, giant golden-crowned flying fox, Philippine eagle-owl, Isabela oriole, green sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, Philippine crocodile and dugong. It is also home to the <b>green-faced</b> <b>parrotfinch</b> and the Northern Sierra Madre forest monitor.|$|E
50|$|The Angat Watershed {{supports}} {{a variety of}} wildlife thanks to its location in the Sierra Madre and its rich hydrology and terrestrial ecology coated by lowland dipterocarp forests, submontane forests, grasslands, secondary bamboo and scrublands. It is home to 290 endemic species of woody and non-woody plants, including the white lauan (known locally as bagtikan), tanguile, yakal, acacia and narra. A good area for bird-watching, the Angat reserve attracts 43 different bird species, {{many of which are}} threatened or restricted. In addition to the two most visible birds in the reserve, the Luzon hornbill (known locally as kalao) and the Rufous hornbill, the reserve also attracts large flocks of spotted imperial pigeon, scale-feathered malkoha, rough-crested malkoha, grey-backed tailorbird, and Philippine eagle owl. These avian species are all endemic to the Philippines, with the Luzon hornbill and Philippine eagle-owl classified as near-threatened and vulnerable. The data-deficient Worcester's buttonquail has also been recorded in the watershed, as well as the Philippine hawk-eagle, Philippine dwarf kingfisher, green racket-tail, whiskered pitta, celestial monarch, ashy thrush, ashy-breasted flycatcher, flame-breasted fruit dove, and <b>green-faced</b> <b>parrotfinch.</b>|$|E
