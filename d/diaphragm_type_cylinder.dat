The apparatus consists of a pressure element, a source of controlled high pressure and a neon lamp circuit.

40|$|Several {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on single-cylinder test engines to determine the performance characteristics of four types of combustion chambers designed for aircraft oil engines. Two of the combustion chambers studied were bulb-type precombustion chambers, the connecting orifice of one having been designed to produce high turbulence by tangential air flow in both the precombustion chamber and the cylinder. The other two were integral combustion chambers, one being dome-shaped and the other pent-roof shaped. The injection systems used included cam and eccentric driven fuel pumps, and diaphragm and spring-loaded fuel-injection valves. A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> maximum <b>cylinder</b> pressure indicator was used in part of these investigations with which the cylinder pressures were controlled to definite valves. The performance of the engines when equipped {{with each of the}} combustion chambers is discussed. The best performance for the tests reported was obtained with a bulb-type combustion chamber designed to give a high degree of turbulence within the bulb and cylinder. (author) ...|$|R
40|$|The 'Farnboro' {{electric}} indicator was tested as {{received from the}} manufacturers, and modifications made to the instrument to improve its operation. The original design of disk valve was altered so as to reduce the mass, travel, and seat area. Changes {{were made to the}} recording mechanism, which included a new method of locating the top center position on the record. The effect of friction on the motion of the pointer while taking motoring and power cards was eliminated by providing a means of putting pressure lines on the record. The modified indicator gives a complete record of the average cyclic variation in pressure per crank degree for any set of engine operating conditions which can be held constant for the period of time required to build up the composite card. The value of the record for accurate quantitative measurement is still questioned, although the maximum indicated pressure recorded on the motoring and power cards checks the readings of the balanced <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> of maximum <b>cylinder</b> pressure indicator...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of water management and navigation structures often requires temporary works to exclude water to facilitate {{construction in the}} dry or at least under a lower water level within the construction area. The use of cellular cofferdams for both temporary and permanent earth/water retaining works is very common. A number of theories are presented that describe the failure mechanisms involved. These failure mechanisms were identified from model studies on circular type cofferdams are applied independent of cofferdam geometry. It is common to use <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdams. To asses the validity of common failure mechanisms associated with cellular cofferdams when applied to <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdams, a series of numerical modelling analyses were conducted. These were validated using field monitoring results of a large scale <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdam constructed at St. Germans, Norfolk, UK. A series of plane strain analyses of a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdam were conducted using the geometry from a critical section of cofferdam. These analyses identified the lowest factor of safety based on the drained strength of the clay on which the cofferdam was constructed. The water level within the river was increased to accommodate flooding and soil strength was reduced to identify the general failure mechanism. The structural forces were calculated using both 2 D and 3 D models for a larger width section (13 m wide) to allow comparison with wall bending moments and displacements measured in field. The 3 D analyses used actual tie spacing and membrane effects whilst reducing the lateral stiffness of the wall to accommodate the stiffness reduction due to variation in the interlock forces. To measure the bending moment in sheet piles, resistance type strain gauges were installed on a 13 m wide section of cofferdam. The cell deflection, river and cell water levels were also monitored to identify tidal river effect {{and the influence of}} cell water level on performance. Comparison of field and numerical results highlighted a number of important design and construction detail related to <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cellular cofferdams.

Here an analysis is carried out by varying the dimensions of two different diaphragm geometries, namely conventional square <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and cross-sectional beam <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The analysis is done using finite element method (FEM) technique in ANSYS software and by comparing the results, the better <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> is chosen for the required pressure range of the application for flash flood level measurement. The results show that for some pressure ranges the cross-sectional beam <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm</b> delivers a much better sensitivity than the conventional square <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm...</b>|$|R

40|$|Monitoring {{pressure}} plays a {{vital role}} in automotive safety applications. This paper reports on the deformation analysis of a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> pressure sensor. There are two kinds of <b>diaphragms,</b> square <b>type</b> and circular type have been considered for the analysis. In this sense, diaphragms with equivalent cross sectional area have been selected for the simplicity. The proposed diaphragms has been simulated to get maximum deformation for an input pressure by using COMSOL and it is compared with the theoretical analysis. In addition, stress analysis along the mid line of the square type and circular type membranes also has been obtained by using FEM simulation. Based on the deformation, circular <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is preferable than square type. Even though, the design layout costs more in fabricating circular diaphragms which indeed increases the cost of the sensor and the fabrication costs are higher compared to the square shaped diaphragm...|$|R
