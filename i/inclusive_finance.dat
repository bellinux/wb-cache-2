50|$|Financial {{inclusion}} or <b>inclusive</b> <b>financing</b> is {{the delivery}} of financial services at affordable costs to sections of disadvantaged and low-income segments of society, in contrast to financial exclusion where those services are not available or affordable. Financial refers to all types of financial services, including savings, payments and credit from all types of formal financial institutions. An estimated 2 billion working-age adults globally {{have no access to}} the types of formal financial services delivered by regulated financial institutions. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 24% of adults have a bank account even though Africa's formal financial sector has grown in recent years. It is argued that as financial services can be viewed in that are significant positive externalities when more people and firms participate. The availability of financial services that meet the specific needs of users without discrimination is a key objective of financial inclusion.|$|R

It {{is based on the}} primary data collected from a sample of 100 ‘No Frills’ accounts of two public sector bank branches. The main findings of the study are as follows: (i) majority of the ‘No Frills’ accounts are inoperative; (ii) only 17 % of households surveyed have placed a portion of their savings in these accounts, the rest of them prefer other types of investments such as purchasing gold, financing in family business, house construction, investing with private chit funds, etc.; (iii) hardly 6 % of the households had availed direct finance from banks, while 82 % availed loans from SHGs; (iv) as high as 35 % of the households continued to borrow from private financiers albeit at high rates of interest; and (iv) use of intermediaries, like business correspondents and business facilitators, assisted by technology products like bio-metric smart cards and hand-held devices permitting small overdrafts on ‘No Frills’ accounts and tagging health insurance products to these accounts would greatly improve the number and frequency of operation of these accounts...|$|R

30|$|The United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for <b>Inclusive</b> <b>Finance</b> for Development (UNSGSA) {{also uses}} <b>inclusive</b> <b>finance</b> to achieve food {{security}} and rural development (see UNSGSA 2013). The UNSGSA encourages universal access {{at a reasonable}} cost {{to a wide range}} of financial services, provided by diverse, responsible, and sustainable institutions. Through its special advocate, Her Majesty Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, UNSGSA also advocates that low-income clients and micro-, small-, and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) need a variety of providers and products, such as savings, payments, credit, and insurance, to achieve rapid and sustainable development. Similar to the basic risk that accompanies weather insurance, the high risk of client over-indebtedness accompanies financial access as a tool for achieving resilient development. The UNSGSA report notes that while greater access to financial services has been beneficial, it has given rise to a new set of challenges, such as instances of the rapid expansion of consumer credit that result in a higher risk of client over-indebtedness; this questions the potential of financial services to contribute to the welfare of households.|$|E
40|$|Like in {{many other}} countries, <b>{{inclusive}}</b> <b>finance</b> for inclusive growth has become a policy issue in Bangladesh following the global financial crisis in 2008. Over the past 10 years, intensity of financial deepening and access to financial services has increased. Both banks and microfinance institutions have contributed to higher intensity. A recent study shows that around 40 % {{of the adult population}} and 75 % of households have access to financial services in Bangladesh. Several factors may have contributed. Proactive regulatory policies and expanded financial literacy are the major determinants. In this paper, regulatory policies have been evaluated and the effect of financial literacy on financial inclusion has been examined empirically. Our analysis suggests that the regulatory agencies in Bangladesh have formulated policies for promoting financial inclusion and creating investment opportunities for micro and small firms in particular. Our empirical evidence, based on household-level data, shows that the intensity of financial literacy in Bangladesh is moderate, and it has a positive impact on <b>inclusive</b> <b>finance.</b> These findings warrant more emphasis on increasing financial literacy for access to finance and informed investment decisions...|$|E

40|$|The current pico-solar {{value chain}} {{knows a lot}} of {{challenges}} and despite the many advantages of pico-solar products, the uptake in rural Tanzania remains low. The distribution to reach the rural areas and the relatively high initial price of the products for the rural consumer are considered as the main obstacles for market adoption. Therefore, the value chain of the pico-solar sector needs to be improved {{in order to make}} the products more affordable and accessible for the rural population. Literature study and field work in three cities of Tanzania is done to investigate the possible solutions for improvement of the value chain. Both the supply side, the companies, as the demand side, the consumers, are taken into account in this report, although solely the supply side has been interviewed in the field work. The improvement of the value chain is researched through five activities of the value chain namely marketing, <b>inclusive</b> business, <b>finance,</b> distribution and after sales, discussed in perspective of both the supply and the demand side. Marketing can create awareness among the rural population about alternatives for the expensive, unhealthy energy sources they use now. Solar companies can increase their sales through marketing strategies. Inclusive business in the pico-solar sector can provide jobs and incomes for the rural population which can set development in motion. Companies can profit from the local knowledge of the rural population and market when they include local people in their value chain. Financial aspects can provide consumers with loans to buy products that would otherwise stay out of reach. For companies, the financial aspects of rural markets, with a big potential consumer base, contain many potential profit opportunities. The distribution of the products to the rural areas is important to make sure that products are available for the rural consumers to buy. For companies, distribution is important to keep the price of their products affordable and present in local shops. Finally, after sales is needed to keep the consumer satisfied after it has purchased a product. For companies it is important to create a functional after sales service, to build and maintain a loyal consumer base. These five activities of the value chain together can create business opportunities for companies to expand and grow in the rural areas. For the rural areas, these five activities can bring development through the implementation of the several abovementioned development opportunities. Moreover, they will provide pico-solar products to the rural areas. These products can bring light and therewith income opportunities for the rural households...|$|R

Bear in mind that the poverty reduction practice follows an order from easy to difficult {{because of the nature of}} poverty alleviation work, we should recognize that to liberate the remaining 56 million poverty people remains a very arduous task and that continued innovation is needed in participants and means and mode of poverty alleviation. To better achieve the goal of eliminating poverty, finance is an indispensable means. The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) of the World Bank believes that microfinance is a powerful tool for antipoverty. When the poor use financial services, they can increase revenue, build assets, and mitigate external shocks. Microfinance can make the poor families focus on the planning of the future (improve nutrition, living conditions, health, and education) rather than the daily life (CGAP 2004 a). The Chinese government also attaches great importance to the role of finance in antipoverty process. In January 2014, the State Council issued “Some Suggestions on Helping the “Three Rural” (Rural Industry, Rural Area and Rural Residents, or 3 Rs) Development by Means of Financial Services” which requires the financial institutions to better perform in poverty alleviation in rural areas. In March 2014, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) and other six ministries jointly issued a “guidance on the comprehensive work of providing financial services for poverty alleviation” which proposed the specific policies, measures, and arrangements for the work. On December 31, 2015, the State Council issued the “Development Plan of Promoting <b>Inclusive</b> <b>Finance</b> (2016 – 2020)” which puts forward that China should vigorously promote the development of <b>inclusive</b> <b>finance.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{implications}} of these results are twofold; firstly, {{the positive effect of}} input subsidies in increasing the probability of MTM adoption implies that MTM adoption takes place in the context of complementary inputs and that lowering the cost of these complementary inputs can help encourage farmers to try out new methods of production such as MTM. However, subsidies specifically targeted at MTM could also be considered, rather than assuming that MTM would indirectly benefit from fertilizer or seed subsidies. Farmers willing to comply with MTM and other environmentally beneficial farming practices could be eligible for such subsidies in recognition of the broader social benefits of these practices. Secondly, investing in agricultural extension systems by increasing the extension-personnel-to-farmer ratio is a crucial element in the success of MTM. The attention of policies for the upscaling of MTM should remain focused on the solid delivery of information through strong public and private agricultural extension services, on better access to markets and on the provision of <b>inclusive</b> <b>finance</b> as alternatives to subsidies.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFinancial {{inclusion}} plays a {{major role}} in inclusive growth of the country. It is estimated that globally over 2. 5 billion people are excluded from access to financial services of which one third is in India. The origins of the current approach to financial inclusion can be traced to the United Nations initiatives, which broadly described the main goals of <b>inclusive</b> <b>finance</b> as access to a range of financial services including savings, credit, insurance, remittance and other banking / payment services to all ‘bankable ’ households and enterprises at a reasonable cost. In India, financial inclusion first featured in 2005, when it was introduced by Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty, the Chairman of Indian Bank. Mangalam Village becomes the first village in India where all households were provided banking facilities. The availability of quality financial services in rural areas is extremely important for the growth of the economy as this will enable the large number of rural households to fund the growth of their livelihoods. The growth of the economy is dependent on the growth of the rural market in the country. Therefore greater financial inclusion in these segments is imperative. The main objective of this study is to review various papers on the how financial inclusion serves as a means of inclusive growth and to study the initiatives taken by Government and Reserve Bank of India for strengthening financial inclusion in the country. The study is based on secondary data collection. Reserve Bank of India’s vision for 2020 is to open nearly 600 million new customers ’ accounts. The government should encourage the banks to adopt financial inclusion by means of financial assistance, financial literacy, advertisement, awareness program, etc. to achieve the aim of 11 th plan of Inclusive Growth...|$|E

40|$|Microfinance {{has become}} very {{important}} for <b>inclusive</b> <b>finance</b> and micro-based economic development {{and the rise of}} Islamic finance responds to this change {{in many parts of the}} world. In Thailand, the first Islamic microfinance institution was established in the Muslim populated Pattani Province in 1987 and several others followed over the years. Yet, very few studies have been conducted to systematically document the basic aspects of this endeavour. The aim of this study is to examine the development and prospects of Islamic microfinance (IsMF) and assess the perceptions of the customers on the products, impact, performance and scope in Thailand. In doing so, this study is one the first to provide an overview of IsMF industry in Thailand and identifies factors affecting demand for IsMF services. Importantly, it will analyse the impacts of various IsMF services of the socio-economy of the Thai society. The study also evaluates outreach and sustainability of the IsMFIs. In an attempt to accomplish the aims of the study, a triangulation research method was employed. First, the questionnaire-based survey was administered to the customers of the IsMFIs in order to ascertain the factors affecting demand for products and impacts of IsMF. Secondly, a semi-structure interview was subsequently conducted with the customers in order to develop an in-depth understanding on demand for and impacts of IsMF. Thirdly, secondary data from financial reports of the IsMFIs were collected to compute relevant financial ratios, indicating outreach, sustainability, and efficiency and profitability of these IsMFIs. The findings from the survey analysis reveal that the demand for IsMF services are driven by the needs in various life cycle events, affordability, awareness and exposure of IsMF regulations and procedures. In addition, IsMF services have enhanced the well-being of the poor and financially excluded in different aspects. The levels of impacts are influenced by the emerging needs, affordability and exposure factors in varying degrees. Interestingly, IsMFIs have achieved operational sustainability, reached considerable number of the client-base, and been profitable. The findings not only provide valuable information in terms of behavioural dimensions and customer preferences, they are also useful for the microfinance providers and government in considering the future development related to Islamic microfinance programmes. ...|$|E
