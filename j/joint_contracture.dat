5000|$|Arthrogryposis {{multiplex}} congenital (AMC), {{or simply}} arthrogryposes, describes congenital <b>joint</b> <b>contracture</b> {{in two or}} more areas of the body.

Children born {{with one or more}} joint contractures have abnormal fibrosis of the muscle tissue causing muscle shortening, and therefore are unable to perform active extension and flexion in the affected joint or joints. AMC has been divided into three groups: amyoplasia, distal arthrogryposis, and syndromic. Amyoplasia is characterized by severe joint contractures and muscle weakness. Distal arthrogryposis mainly involves the hands and feet. Types of arthrogryposis with a primary neurological or muscle disease belong to the syndromic group.|$|E

50|$|The syndromes within CAPS overlap clinically, and {{patients}} may have features {{of more than}} one disorder. In a retrospective cohort of 136 CAPS patients from 16 countries, the most prevalent clinical features were fever (84% of cases, often with concurrent constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, mood disorders or failure to thrive), skin rash (either urticarial or maculopapular rash; 97% of cases) especially after cold exposure, and musculoskeletal involvement (myalgia, arthralgia, and/or arthritis, or less commonly <b>joint</b> <b>contracture,</b> patellar overgrowth, bone deformity, bone erosion and/or osteolytic lesion; 86% of cases). Less common features included ophthalmological involvement (conjunctivitis and/or uveitis, or less commonly optic nerve atrophy, cataract, glaucoma or impaired vision; 71% of cases), neurosensory hearing loss (42% of cases), neurological involvement (morning headache, papilloedema, and/or meningitis, or less commonly seizure, hydrocephalus or mental retardation; 40% of cases), and AA amyloidosis (4% of cases). Age of onset is typically in infancy or early childhood. In 57% of cases, CAPS had a chronic phenotype with symptoms present almost daily, whereas the remaining 43% of patients experienced only acute episodes. Up to 56% of patients reported a family history of CAPS. Previous studies confirm these symptoms, although the exact reported rates vary.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} and independent factors associated with joint involvement in a large population of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). METHODS: This study was cross-sectional, based on data collected on patients included in the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Scleroderma Trials and Research (EUSTAR) registry. We queried this database to extract data regarding global evaluation of patients with SSc {{and the presence of}} any clinical articular involvement: synovitis (tender and swollen joints), tendon friction rubs (rubbing sensation detected as the tendon was moved), and <b>joint</b> <b>contracture</b> (stiffness of the joints that decreased their range of motion). Overall joint involvement was defined by the occurrence of synovitis and/or <b>joint</b> <b>contracture</b> and/or tendon friction rubs. RESULTS: We recruited 7286 patients with SSc; their mean age was 56 +/- 14 years, disease duration 10 +/- 9 years, and 4210 (58 %) had a limited cutaneous disease subset. Frequencies of synovitis, tendon friction rubs, and joint contractures were 16 %, 11 %, and 31 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: <b>Joint</b> <b>contractures</b> {{are common}} {{problems}} in frail older people in nursing homes. Irrespective {{of the exact}} extent of older individuals in geriatric care settings living with <b>joint</b> <b>contractures,</b> {{they appear to be}} a relevant problem. Also, the new emphasis on the syndrome of <b>joint</b> <b>contractures,</b> e. g. by the German statutory long term care insurance, led to an increase in assessment and documentation efforts and preventive interventions in clinical care. However, more attention should be paid to the actual situation of older individuals in nursing homes with prevalent <b>joint</b> <b>contractures,</b> particularly their experience of related activity limitations and participation restrictions. Thus, the aim of this study is 1) to develop a tailored intervention to improve functioning, and especially participation and quality of life in older residents with <b>joint</b> <b>contractures</b> in nursing homes and 2) to test the feasibility of the intervention accompanied by a rigorous process evaluation. Methods: The complex intervention, which will be developed in this project follows the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) framework and integrates the perspectives of all potentially relevant user groups, from the affected individuals to clinicians and researchers. The development process will comprise a systematic literature review, reanalysis of existing data and the integration of the knowledge of the affected individuals and experts. The developed intervention including a comprehensive process evaluation will be pilot tested with residents with <b>joint</b> <b>contractures</b> in three nursing homes. Discussion: The projected study will provide a tailored intervention to improve functioning, participation and quality of life in older residents with <b>joint</b> <b>contractures</b> in nursing homes.

40|$|Background/Aim. Dupuytren’s {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} disease of the palmar and digital fascial structures, with functional limitations. There are no clear recommendations about the optimal time of surgical repair, concerning the hand impairment. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the relation between finger’s contracture degree and success of surgical treatment of the Dupuytren's disease. Methods. This prospective analysis included 60 patients operated on due to Dupuytren’s contracture. According to preoperative contracture degree of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, patients were divided into three groups: the group 1 : 30 °. All the patients underwent operation of partial palmar fasciectomy. Postoperative improvement was expressed with contracture reduction INDEX. Results. There were 60 patients with 85 fingers affected. The groups 1, 2 and 3 had 22 (37 %), 37 (62 %) and 26 (43 %) fingers with MCP contracture and 32 (37. 4 %), 24 (28. 2 %) and 29 (34. 1 %) fingers with PIP contracture, respectively. Postoperative contractures of MCP joint in these groups were 0, 0. 135 ° and 5 °, and of PIP joint 0, 2. 08 ° and 16. 89 °, respectively. After six months all MCP contractures resolved, while PIP <b>joint</b> <b>contracture</b> in the group 3 remained 13. 62 °. The reduction INDEX was 98. 85 %, 97. 62 % and 75. 52 % in the groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the INDEX value between the groups (p = 0. 0001). Conclusion. The degree of PIP <b>joint</b> <b>contracture</b> is related to the outcome of surgical treatment of Dupuytren’s disease. Optimal results are achieved when contracture degree is between 15 ° and 30 °. Surgical treatment of MCP <b>joint</b> <b>contracture</b> is successful regardless of the preoperative <b>joint</b> <b>contracture</b> degree...|$|E

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground The normal range of joint motion (ROM) is maintained by repeated daily movements.

Knee flexion contracture can be surgi-cally treated by posterior soft tissue release such as ham-string lengthening, proximal gastrocnemius release, and posterior capsule release [2]. Studies on animal muscles have shown that passive extensibility depends on the size and length of the muscle fibers and the amount and ar-rangement of connective tissue in the muscle belly [5 - 7].

40|$|Background: <b>Joint</b> <b>contracture</b> is a {{limitation}} in the passive or active {{range of motion}} (ROM) of a joint, where {{in addition to the}} mobility limiting factor the pain is also present. Repetitive pulsed Magnetic Stimulation (rPMS) appears to be an effective, non-invasive and safety solution for treating this condition. Therefore aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of rPMS in treating <b>joint</b> <b>contracture.</b> Methods: 30 subjects with <b>joint</b> <b>contracture</b> in the knee were enrolled in this study and divided respectively into Treatment and Control group. The treatment group were delivered with rPMS therapy. The control group was delivered with conventional physiotherapy method (ultrasound). The primary outcome measurements were: 1. Mobility evaluation by goniometry (ROM in degrees while performing flexion) and Patient Functional Assessment Questionnaire (PFAQ) for ability to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and 2. Pain evaluation by 10 -point Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain perception. Absence of adverse events was set as a secondary measure. Results: The results of the study show statistical difference (p< 0. 05) between the levels of improvement of all studied parameters while comparing between both groups. The results suggest greater immobility restoration and pain relieving effect of the rPMS in comparison to conventional physiotherapy method. Conclusion: rPMS an effective and safe non-invasive method for mobility restoration and pain relief in case of joint contractures.
