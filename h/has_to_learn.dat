Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E

Technically when Mary leaves the room, she would not have the ability to see or know what the color red is. A brain <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and develop how to see colors. Patterns need to form in the V4 section of the visual cortex. These patterns are formed from exposure to wavelengths of light. This exposure is needed during the early stages of brain development. In Mary's case, the identifications and categorizations of color will only be in respect to representations of black and white.|$|E

To do this he needs to solve two problems: he must capture and imprison all of the sorcerers in the kingdom and he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> magic. He creates a [...] "Brigade of Witch Hunters" [...] and calls for an {{instructor}} in magic. Only a [...] "cunning charlatan" [...] with no magical ability responds. The charlatan proves himself with a few simple tricks and begins to ask for jewellery and money to continue teaching. However, Babbitty, the king's washerwoman, laughs at the king one day as he attempts to do magic with an ordinary twig. This causes the king to demand the charlatan join him in a public demonstration of magic and warns that the charlatan will be beheaded if anyone laughs. The charlatan later witnesses Babbitty performing magic in her house. He threatens to expose her if she does not assist him. She agrees to hide and help the demonstration.|$|E

[...] "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," [...] she said. During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that {{she has a lot of}} things that have haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to go back to New York, confronting old romances. Hence [...] "Judas" [...] represented something that was not good for her, something she could not escape. Gaga said: [...] "I keep going back and forth between the darkness and the light in order to understand who I am." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1944, Rifenburg {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan. The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about Rifenburg in September 1944 that opened as follows: [...] "Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon {{in the person of}} Dick Rifenburg, 18-year-old Michigan freshman. Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver. Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating. A loose-limbed 180-pound freshman from Saginaw, Mich., Rifenberg is being boomed as the Big Ten's next 'freshman sensation.'" [...] As a freshman, he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa. In an article titled [...] "Teens and TNT," [...] Time reported on Rifenburg's performance: [...] "Of the few teams already in action, Michigan's teens rang the freshman bell loudest last week by winning their opener, 12 -to-7, against the strong Iowa Seahawks (Naval Pre-Flight); 6-ft. 4 Freshman End Dick Rifenburg caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns." ...|$|E

The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing.

Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I {{have been in the past}} about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world.

500|$|Helen Raynor, {{the writer}} of the episode, {{expressed}} an interest in writing a Toshiko-centric episode at the first script meeting for the second series of Torchwood. She wanted to write a story centred on Toshiko because she [...] "absolutely [...] Tosh as a character" [...] and wanted [...] "to take her on another step". Inspiration for the story came from a short fictional document written by James Goss for the in-universe Torchwood Institute website created by BBC Online for the first series. The document detailed a man whom Torchwood would defrost [...] "once a year, give him a day out, and then pop him back in the freezer". Series creator Russell T Davies described the episode as a [...] "love story" [...] but felt it inevitable that the story would end in tears. In creating the character of Tommy Brockless, Raynor felt that he was [...] "the perfect boyfriend" [...] for Toshiko. However, she stated that their brief relationship was not a [...] "mature relationship" [...] but [...] "a pretend relationship" [...] as Toshiko only [...] "gets him out of the box once a year". She added that what Tosh <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> is that Tommy can't be [...] "treated like a toy". In regards to the conclusion of the episode, she stated that [...] "it's a hugely painful goodbye for both of them".|$|E
500|$|Ayane's {{gameplay}} {{abilities in}} other games were regarded more variably. In the DOA Xtreme and Paradise beach volleyball games, Ayane has excellent technique and jump abilities, {{at the cost}} of poor defence, power and speed. According to Official Xbox Magazine, Ayane is [...] "not exactly who you want to spike at the net or try to blow past blocks, but she's excellent at long spikes, digging, and soft dinks." [...] As such, Ayane is most effective as a support, but she should not be paired with Kasumi due to their rivalry; to partner with each other, Ayane and Kasumi need convincing by gift-giving. In Ninja Gaiden Σ 2, Ayane's attacks (many of her Fuma Kodachi combos resemble her combos from Dead or Alive) and finishing moves are far faster than these of Ryu, but the player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to dodge much more as she has worse blocking abilities. The official guide to this game by Prima's Bryan Dawson states that Ayane's short range and limited attack power [...] "make her the worst choice of the three new characters for almost every mission" [...] and [...] "her only saving graces" [...] are a powerful ninpo spell and deadly Flash Kunai projectiles. In addition, if controlled by the console in the co-op mode, the character [...] "doesn't seem {{to know what to do}} in any situation." [...] Mitch Dyer of IGN opined that a vastly improved Ayane from Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is [...] "a damn fine addition" [...] to the game, where she is [...] "just as capable as Ryu Hayabusa" [...] with her [...] "quick and vicious" [...] melee attacks and explosive kunai projectiles, adding that she is [...] "functionally similar to Hayabusa in terms of combos and skills, complete with a screen-clearing special move." [...] Similarly, Retro Gamer described her simply as [...] "a nimbler version of Ryu." [...] David Lynch of X360 wrote all the [...] "girls" [...] of Razor's Edge (Ayane, Kasumi and Momiji) became [...] "just as deadly" [...] in it as Ryu Hayabusa has been through the Ninja Gaiden series. In Fatal Frame, unlike the protagonists of the game, Ayane can not permanently defeat ghosts and her strategy relies on evasion.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with SFX producer Phil Collinson stated that after the Doctor regenerates the [...] "initial dynamic changes because [...] <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to trust him again". Piper added that as the Doctor is incapacitated Rose consequently feels [...] "unloved", [...] "isolated" [...] and [...] "like she's lost her best friend". In the Doctor's absence Rose relies on her observations of him and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson {{felt it was important}} to resolve any mistrust between the pair {{by the end of the}} Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor's friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having [...] "come on in leaps and bounds" [...] and stated she is now [...] "a lot more proactive." [...] She felt that there is a [...] "different kind of energy" [...] between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship [...] "developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before." [...] Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is [...] "more tetchy and more possessive" [...] over him as [...] "she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want to lose him again". She cited Rose's [...] "catfight" [...] with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in [...] "School Reunion" [...] as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated [...] "You want it to happen, but at the same time you don't want it to happen". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. [...] "It's deliberate when that happens [...] ", said Davies, [...] "and they do pay the price. In [...] "Tooth and Claw", they set up the very thing— Torchwood— that separates them in the end. It's sort of their own fault." [...] Though Davies left the Doctor's response to Rose's declaration of love in [...] "Doomsday" [...] unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings. On the commentary for the episode she stated that she would [...] "confirm to the world" [...] that he was going to [...] "say it back." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{fruitful}} and contentious has been the consideration of Austen as a political writer. As critic Gary Kelly explains, [...] "Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially {{in the form of}} [...] critics see Austen's novels as neither conservative nor subversive, but complex, criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy." [...] In Jane Austen and the War of Ideas (1975), perhaps {{the most important of these}} works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was steeped in, not insulated from, the principal moral and political controversies of her time, and espoused a partisan, fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies. In a similar vein, Alistair M. Duckworth in The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the [...] "estate" [...] to symbolise all that was important about contemporary English society, which should be conserved, improved, and passed down to future generations. Duckworth argued that Austen followed Edmund Burke, who in his 1790 book Reflections on the Revolution in France had used the metaphor of an estate that represented the work of generations, and which could be only be improved, never altered, for the way that society ought to work. Duckworth noted that in Austen's books, one's ability to keep an estate going, which could only be improved, but never altered if one was to be true to the estate, is usually the measure of one's good character. Butler placed Austen in the context of the reaction against the French Revolution, where excessive emotionalism and the sentimental [...] "cult of sensibility" [...] came to be identified with sexual promiscuity, atheism, and political radicalism. Butler argued that a novel like Sense and Sensibility, where Marianne Dashwood is unable to control her emotions, is part of the conservative anti-revolutionary literature that sought to glorify old fashioned values and politics. Irvine pointed out that the identification of the [...] "cult of sensibility" [...] with republicanism was one that existed only in the minds of conservatives, and in fact the French Republic also rejected sentimentalism, so Butler's challenge is to prove Austen's call for emotional self-restraint as expressed by a character like Elinor Dashwood is in fact grounded in conservative politics. Butler wrote [...] "the characteristic recourse of the conservative...is to remind us ultimately of the insignificance of individual rights and even individual concerns when measured against the scale of 'the universe as one vast whole'". Irvine wrote that novels like Sense and Sensibility appeared to support Butler's thesis, but a novel like Pride and Prejudice does not, as Elizabeth Bennet is an individualist and a non-conformist who ridicules everything who to a certain extent <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the value of sentiment.|$|E

2500|$|Sound {{is at the}} {{beginning}} of language learning. Children have to learn to distinguish different sounds and to segment the speech stream they are exposed to into units – eventually meaningful units – in order to acquire words and sentences. Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging: When you read, there are spaces between the words. No such spaces occur between spoken words. So, if an infant hears the sound sequence “thisisacup,” it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to segment this stream into the distinct units “this”, “is”, “a”, and “cup.” Once the child is able to extract the sequence “cup” from the speech stream it has to assign a meaning to this word. Furthermore, the child {{has to be able to}} distinguish the sequence “cup” from “cub” in order to learn that these are two distinct words with different meanings. Finally, the child <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to produce these words.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Nikki Wilson {{described}} Captain Adelaide Brooke, {{played by}} actress Lindsay Duncan, as [...] "the Doctor's cleverest and most strong-minded companion yet."

2500|$|The series also {{introduces}} a new character named Singularity, a pocket universe that gains self-consciousness during [...] "Secret Wars".

[...] Wilson also stated that Singularity can act as [...] "a whole world within herself and she can also move between different worlds and dimensions like taking a walk, so she has access to all corners of the Marvel U in a way that other characters do not." [...] " [...] one of the first people we have encounter Singularity," [...] Bennett revealed. [...] "So Nico is put in charge of acclimating this character and showing her their civilization and world while trying to save it. Nico is sort of like the grounding human force and the anchor that begins to show Singularity the capacity of human beings, both for good and for evil, so Nico becomes even more invested when she starts to see her homeland through the eyes of this stranger." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Legion of Super Heroes {{animated}} series premiered on Kids' WB! (the Saturday Morning kids' {{block on}} The CW network) in September 2006. The show's {{premise is that}} the Legion travels {{back in time to}} recruit Superman in their fight against crime in the 31st century, but they go a little too far back and recruit Superman before he has had a chance to fully develop his powers. Superman, the inspiration for the Legion, now <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from them how to be a hero. Season 1 focused on a [...] "core" [...] team consisting of Bouncing Boy, Brainiac 5, Lightning Lad, Phantom Girl, Saturn Girl, Superman, and Timber Wolf, while other Legionnaires such as Cosmic Boy, Colossal Boy, Ferro Lad, Matter-Eater Lad, and Triplicate Girl appeared occasionally.

2500|$|Faith {{was brought}} {{back for the}} final season of Buffy, because, {{according}} to David Solomon, [...] "she {{had been such a}} crucial character at a very specific junction in the series {{that there would be no}} way to tie it up without her." [...] However, in season seven the dynamic between the two Slayers has changed. As Rebecca Rand Kirshner explains, [...] " [...] is no longer such a complete opposite of Buffy. And there's sort of a subtler and more complicated dynamic between them". As Buffy struggles with her unwanted position of mentor to the Potential Slayers, the writers used Faith to create an outside conflict about Buffy's leadership abilities. Although Faith is questioning Buffy and her choices she is making, she is no longer an enemy to her either. In the episode [...] "Empty Places", the Potentials lose trust in Buffy and appoint Faith as their leader instead, a decision that literally blows up in their faces. As Drew Goddard explains, [...] "Faith is like the cool aunt that everyone loves, because the cool aunt doesn't have the responsibility of raising the children. She just gets to show up and have fun. The problem is, Faith is not ready to lead. She's damaged in her own way. She's just beginning to pull herself together.
