A simple method <b>of</b> estimating the <b>Field</b> <b>of</b> View is shown and also a passive method <b>of</b> increasing the <b>Field</b> <b>of</b> View is discussed.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>of</b> {{view has}} always been a design feature {{paramount}} to helmet design, and in particular spacesuit design, where the helmet must provide an adequate <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view for a large range of activities, environments, and body positions. Historically, suited <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view has been evaluated either qualitatively in parallel with design or quantitatively using various test methods and protocols. As such, oftentimes legacy suit <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view information is either ambiguous for lack of supporting data or contradictory to other <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view tests performed with different subjects and test methods. This paper serves to document a new <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view testing method that is more reliable and repeatable than its predecessors. It borrows heavily from standard <b>field</b> <b>of</b> vision tests such as the Goldmann kinetic perimetry test, but is designed specifically for evaluating <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view of a spacesuit helmet. In this test, three suits utilizing three different helmet designs were tested for <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view. Not only do these tests provide more reliable <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view data for legacy and prototype helmet designs, they also provide insight into how helmet design impacts <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view and what this means for the Constellation Project spacesuit helmet, which must meet stringent <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view requirements that are more generous to the crewmember than legacy designs...|$|R
