6000|$|I {{did talk}} to her, but I must come to it. What is most to the point just here is an {{observation}} or two that, in the smoking-room, before going to bed, I exchanged with Ford Obert. I forbore, as I have hinted, to show all I saw, but it was lawfully open to me to judge of what other people did; and I had had before dinner my little proof that, on occasion, Obert could see as much as most. Yet I said nothing more to him for the present about Mrs. Server. The Brissendens were new to him, and his experience of every sort of facial accident, of human sign, made him just the touchstone I wanted. Nothing, naturally, was easier than to turn him {{on the question of}} the fair and the foul, type and character, weal and woe, among our fellow-visitors; so that my mention of the air of disparity in the couple I have just named came in its order and produced its effect. This effect was that of my seeing--which was all I required--that if the disparity was marked for him this <b>expert</b> <b>observer</b> could yet read it quite the wrong way. Why had so fine a young creature married a man three times her age? He was of course astounded when I told him the young creature was much nearer three times Brissenden's, and this led to some interesting talk between us as to the consequences, in general, of such association on such terms. The particular case before us, I easily granted, sinned by over-emphasis, but it was a fair, though a gross, illustration of what almost always occurred when twenty and forty, when thirty and sixty, mated or mingled, lived together in intimacy. Intimacy of course had to be postulated. Then either the high number or the low always got the upper hand, and it was usually the high that succeeded. It seemed, in other words, more possible to go back than to keep still, to grow young than to remain so. If Brissenden had been of his wife's age and his wife of Brissenden's, it would thus be he who must have redescended the hill, it would be she who would have been pushed over the brow. There was really a touching truth in it, the stuff of--what did people call such things?--an apologue or a parable. [...] "One of the pair," [...] I said, [...] "has to pay for the other. What ensues is a miracle, and miracles are expensive. What's a greater one than to have your youth twice over? It's a second wind, another 'go'--which isn't the sort of thing life mostly treats us to. Mrs. Briss had to get her new blood, her extra allowance of time and bloom, somewhere; and from whom could she so conveniently extract them as from Guy himself? She has, by an extraordinary feat of legerdemain, extracted them; and he, on his side, to supply her, has had to tap the sacred fount. But the sacred fount is like the greedy man's description of the turkey as an 'awkward' dinner dish. It may be sometimes too much for a single share, but it's not enough to go round." ...|$|E

40|$|Objective. Despite the {{availability}} of many new imaging procedures, sialography has, after decades of use, maintained its status as the imaging procedure of choice for evaluating the oral component of Sjogren syndrome (SS). In this study, the clinical value of sialography as a diagnostic tool in SS was explored by assessing its diagnostic accuracy, observer bias, and staging potential. Methods. One hundred parotid sialograms were interpreted independently {{in a blinded fashion}} by 2 trained and 2 <b>expert</b> <b>observers.</b> Sialograms were derived from a group of consecutive patients referred for diagnostics of SS. Patients were categorized as SS and non-SS by the revised European classification criteria. Results. Trained observers reached a sensitivity of 95 and a specificity of 33 % for SS by sialogram, whereas <b>expert</b> <b>observers</b> reached a sensitivity of 87 and a specificity of 84 %. There was only "fair" interobserver agreement between trained and <b>expert</b> <b>observers,</b> whereas both <b>expert</b> <b>observers</b> showed "good" agreement with one another, according to Cohen's kappa. Intraobserver agreement was "good" to "very good" for all observers. The 4 different gradations of sialectasia, ie, punctate, globular, cavitary, and destructive, showed a weak but significant correlation with the duration of oral symptoms. Conclusions. This study markedly shows that the diagnostic value of parotid sialography for diagnosing SS greatly depends on the skills of the observer, implying that sialography lacks general applicability as a diagnostic tool in SS and requires specific expertise. Nevertheless, given its potentially high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing SS as well as its useful staging potential, sialography still has its use in the evaluation of the oral component of SS...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: CT {{angiography}} (CTA) scans are {{the current}} standard for vascular analysis {{of patients with}} cerebrovascular diseases, such as acute stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. An additional CT perfusion (CTP) scan is acquired of these patients to assess the perfusion of the cerebral tissue. The {{aim of this study}} is to extend the diagnostic yield of the CTP scans to also include vascular information. METHODS: CTP scans are acquired by injecting contrast material and repeatedly scanning the head over time. Therefore, time-intensity profiles are available for each voxel in the scanned volume, resulting in a 4 D dataset. These profiles can be utilized to differentiate not only between vessels and background but also between arteries and veins. In this article, a fully automatic method is proposed for the segmentation of the intracranial arteries and veins from 4 D cerebral CTP scans. Furthermore, a vessel enhanced volume is presented, in which the vasculature is highlighted and background structures are suppressed. Combining this volume with the artery/vein segmentation results in an arteriogram and a venogram, which could serve as additional means for vascular analysis in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. The artery/vein segmentation is quantitatively evaluated by comparing the results to manual segmentations by two expert observers. RESULTS: Results (paired two-tailed t-test) show that the accuracies of the proposed artery/vein labeling are not significantly different from the accuracies of the <b>expert</b> <b>observer</b> manual labeling (ground truth). Moreover, sensitivity and specificity of the proposed artery/vein labeling, relative to both <b>expert</b> <b>observer</b> ground truths, were similar to the sensitivity and specificity of the <b>expert</b> <b>observer</b> labeling compared to each other. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method for artery/vein segmentation is shown to be very accurate for arteries and veins with normal perfusion. Combining the artery/vein segmentation with the vessel enhanced volume produces an arteriogram and a venogram, which have the potential to extend the diagnostic yield of CTP scans and replace the additional CTA scan, but could also be helpful to radiologists in addition to the CTA scan...|$|E

40|$|Bowlby's {{notion that}} client secure {{attachment}} to the therapist leads to deeper client exploration, is considered an important corner stone of the therapeutic process. Psychotherapy researchers have neglected the study of therapist contributions and observer perspectives when studying this important therapeutic phenomenon. Studies of therapeutic secure base have shown {{that there is a}} relationship between client general attachment patterns and those with therapist, as well as that this secure {{attachment to the}}rapist relates to deeper sessions. The main objectives of the present research was to extend the study of secure base in therapy to include consideration of therapist attachment processes and to improve the methodology used in attachment research by adding the <b>expert</b> <b>observer</b> perspective to operationalize session exploration. The first study explored the secure base hypothesis, the transference hypothesis and the role of therapist attachment in the process. Sixty-seven clients and therapists in-training, in short term therapy, completed the Experiences in Close Relationship Scale (ECRS), the Client Attachment to Therapist Scale (CATS), Working Alliance Inventory (WAI), and a measure of session depth; the Session Evaluation Questionnaire-Depth subscale. In line with Bowlby's (1988) secure base hypothesis, secure attachment to therapist was significantly associated with session depth. Therapist insecure adult attachment was negatively associated with client secure attachment to therapist. The second study addressed methodological limitations found in previous studies by using both client and <b>expert</b> <b>observer</b> perspectives in the operationalization of session exploration. Thirty-one clients assessed depth in the middle sessions of their short-term therapies and rated their attachment to their therapists. Raters assessed experiencing in the same sessions using the Experiencing Scale. Secure attachment to therapist was positively and significantly associated with experiencing levels. However, the two perspectives on session exploration did not converge, suggesting that each taps a distinct aspect of session exploration and underlining the importance of rater perspective in the operationalization of this construct. Taken together, the results of these two studies offer a strong support for the secure base hypothesis. Clinical and research implications are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Rationale and Objectives: The {{performance}} of a semiautomatic technique for internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis quantification of the internal carotid artery in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography was evaluated. Materials and Methods: The degree of stenosis of 52 ICAs was quantified by measuring the cross-sectional area along the center lumen line. This was performed both by 3 independent observers and the semiautomated method. The degree of stenosis {{was defined as the}} amount of cross-sectional lumen reduction. Results: Agreement between the method and observers was good (weighted-kappa, kappa(w) = 0. 89). Reproducibility of measurements of the semiautomated technique was better (kappa(w) = 0. 97) than that of the observers (kappa(w) = 0. 76), and the evaluated technique was considerably less time-consuming.

40|$|Purpose: In cardiac {{computed}} tomography (CT), important clinical indices, {{such as the}} coronary calcium score {{and the percentage of}} coronary artery stenosis, are often adversely affected by motion artifacts.

Computerized methods potentially can be used to assist in these decisions. In a previous study, an artificial neural network (ANN) regression model provided assessability (image quality) indices of calcified plaque images from the software NCAT phantom that were highly agreeable with those provided by expert observers. The method predicted assessability indices based on computer-extracted features of the plaque. In the current study, the ANN-predicted assessability indices were used to identify calcified plaque images with diagnostic calcium scores (based on mass) from a physical dynamic cardiac phantom. The basic assumption was that better quality images were associated with more accurate calcium scores...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm for the semi-automatic segmentation {{of the prostate}} from B-mode trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) images. The segmentation algorithm first uses image warping to make the prostate shape elliptical. Measurement points along the prostate boundary, obtained from an edge-detector, are then used {{to find the best}} elliptical fit to the warped prostate. The final segmentation result is obtained by applying a reverse warping algorithm to the ellip-tical fit. This algorithm was validated using manual segmentation by an <b>expert</b> <b>observer</b> on 17 midgland, pre-operative, TRUS images. Distance-based metrics between the manual and semi-automatic contours showed a mean absolute difference of 0. 67 ± 0. 18 mm, which is significantly lower than inter-observer variability. Area-based metrics showed an average sensitivity greater than 97 % and average accuracy greater than 93 %. The proposed algorithm was almost two times faster than manual seg-mentation and has potential for real-time applications. ...|$|E

30|$|An {{evaluation}} of the overall performance of RIR {{can be carried out}} subjectively and objectively. An observer identifies subjectively {{the success or failure of}} the registration result using overlaid image pairs. However, visual evaluation needs an <b>expert</b> <b>observer</b> and is not adequate for comparing the performance of different techniques on a large dataset. Therefore, objective measurement is necessary to evaluate the registration result. The performance of image registration methods can be measured by the centerline error measure [18, 26]. For each point on the vessel centerline, the distance to the nearest centerline point is found in the second image, and the median of these distances is considered a registration error. However, centerlines can be hard to detect for low-quality or unhealthy images. In practice, small difference will exist between coordinates of matched points. Therefore, accuracy of registration can be evaluated by the error in point placement as the RMSE between the transformed points and the points of reference image [5, 24]. We select 20 matched points manually using MATLAB R 2008 a and generate ground truth to evaluate the proposed approach. Points have to be distributed uniformly with an accurate localization.|$|E

The accurate segmentation {{of coronary}} arteries has become an important topic for the registration of different modalities, which allows physicians rapid access to different medical imaging information from computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper, we propose an accurate fully automatic algorithm based on Graph-cuts for vessel centerline extraction, caliber estimation, and catheter detection. Vesselness, geodesic paths, and a new multiscale edgeness map are combined to customize the Graph-cuts approach to the segmentation of tubular structures, {{by means of a}} global optimization of the Graph-cuts energy function. Moreover, a novel supervised learning methodology that integrates local and contextual information is proposed for automatic catheter detection.
