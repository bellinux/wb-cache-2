5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, <b>Japan,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E

5|$|Andean {{immigrants}} in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat, and some ethnic restaurants in major United States cities serve cuy as a delicacy. Peruvian research universities, especially La Molina National Agrarian University, began experimental {{programs in the}} 1960s {{with the intention of}} breeding larger-sized guinea pigs. Subsequent university efforts have sought to change breeding and husbandry procedures in South America, to make the raising of guinea pigs as livestock more economically sustainable. In the 1990s and 2000s, the university began exporting the larger breed guinea pigs to Europe, <b>Japan,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in the hope of increasing human consumption outside of these countries in northern South America.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 the LSO {{undertook}} {{its first}} world tour, taking in Israel, Turkey, Iran, India, Hong Kong, Korea, <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> The following year István Kertész was appointed principal conductor. Negotiations with the Corporation of the City of London {{with a view}} to establishing the LSO as the resident orchestra of the planned Barbican Centre began in the same year. In 1966 Leonard Bernstein conducted the LSO for the first time, in Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand at the Royal Albert Hall. This was another coup for Fleischmann, who had to overcome Bernstein's scorn for the inadequate rehearsal facilities endured by London orchestras. Bernstein remained associated with the LSO {{for the rest of his}} life, and was its president from 1987 to 1990.|$|E

Guest remixers of Rising material included Cibo Matto, Ween, Tricky, and Thurston Moore. In 1997, Rykodisc reissued all her solo albums on CD, from Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band through Starpeace.

5|$|The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines {{were part}} of the reserve forces for the Battle of Iwo Jima and were {{committed}} to the action five days after D-Day. Among the Marines who distinguished themselves on Iwo Jima was Private Wilson D. Watson who received the Medal of Honor. After the island was secured, the unit was sent back to Guam where they underwent training for a possible invasion of the Japanese mainland. The invasion never occurred since hostilities between <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> came to an end. The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines was sent to Camp Pendelton where, in December 1945, it was once again disbanded.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Britain was still Australia's major trading partner, {{although}} it would be overtaken by <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> by the 1960s. The two countries still had strong cultural ties, and Menzies was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the largest source of immigrants to Australia, largely because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops were fighting the communists together in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be closely integrated with those of Britain, and involved reinforcing the British forces in the Middle East and Far East.|$|E
