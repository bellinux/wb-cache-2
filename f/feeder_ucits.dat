50|$|The {{proposals}} concern areas {{other than}} those addressed by UCITS V. In summary, these are the topics raised:1. eligible assets {{and the use of}} derivatives - whether it is necessary to limit the scope of eligible derivatives of those traded on multilateral platforms and cleared by a central counterparty;2. efficient portfolio management techniques - whether the current criteria (on eligibility, liquidity and diversification for example) requires amendment;3. over-the-counter derivatives ('OTC') - how OTC derivative transactions should be dealt with when assessing UCITS limits on counterparty 4. extraordinary liquidity management rules - whether {{there is a need for}} a common framework for dealing with liquidity bottlenecks in exceptional cases or otherwise;5. depositary passport - whether a depositary passport should be introduced and how this would work in practice;6. money market funds1 - whether they present a source of systemic risk and/or do they need harmonised regulation at EU level;7. long-term investments - (a) how access can be afforded to retail investors and how this could be implemented and regulated; (b) what proportion of a fund's portfolio should be dedicated to such assets; and (c) whetherdiversification rules are necessary to secure adequate liquidity;8. improvements to the UCITS IV framework - for example Article 64(1) of the UCITS Directive requires UCITS to provide information to investors in the following two cases: (i) where an ordinary UCITS converts into a feederUCITS; and (ii) where a master UCITS changes. As it stands, this does not cover a third possible scenario, namely where a <b>feeder</b> <b>UCITS</b> converts into an ordinary UCITS. Such conversions may lead to a significantchange in the investment strategy.|$|E
