5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics, who complimented its mix of different styles and Spears's songwriting, but criticized her vocals for being distant and processed. Commercially, <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> became an international success, debuting atop the charts in France and the United States, and peaking inside {{the top ten}} in fifteen countries. In the United States, {{she became the first}} female artist to have four consecutive number-one albums.|$|E

25|$|On 29 October 1946, <b>the</b> Allied Occupation <b>Zones</b> <b>in</b> Germany already held 9.5 million {{refugees}} and expellees: 3.6 million <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British <b>zone,</b> 3.1 million <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>zone,</b> 2.7 million <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet <b>zone,</b> 100,000 <b>in</b> Berlin and 60,000 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French <b>zone.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 1966 Davis Cup was the 55th {{edition of}} the most {{important}} tournament between national teams in men's tennis. For the first time, <b>the</b> Europe <b>Zone</b> was effectively split into two <b>zones,</b> and <b>the</b> winner of each would earn a berth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Inter-Zonal <b>Zone.</b> 46 teams would enter <b>the</b> competition, 32 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Europe <b>Zone,</b> 8 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Zone,</b> and 6 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Americas <b>Zone.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Onyx Hotel Tour was {{the fifth}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It showcased her fourth studio album, <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> (2003) and visited North America and Europe. A tour to promote the album was announced in December 2003. Its original name was the <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> Tour, but Spears was sued for trademark infringement and banned from using the name.|$|E
5|$|Blackout is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer Britney Spears. It was {{released}} on October 25, 2007 through Jive Records. Opting to re-establish her music career after her fourth studio album, <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> (2003), she began planning the project in 2006. Work continued into 2007, during which time Spears' much-publicized personal struggles, including several instances of erratic behavior and her divorce from Kevin Federline overshadowed her professional endeavors.|$|E
5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} {{to testify before the}} Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report. He was criticized now for the earlier adoption of Panama's penal system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zone.</b> One major point of contention was that it did not allow for trial by jury for American citizens arrested there. They raised questions as {{to the quality of the}} judges in the territory and other issues.|$|E

On that day F Company captured Hill 284 killing 150 North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> own no car. 10.4% {{of the population of the}} zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|After Operation Maiglöckchen, the {{division}} shifted to a largely defensive posture aimed at denying the Partisans {{access to the}} security zone. Since its arrival <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> {{the division}} had been assisted in this task by local forces of varying reliability. These included four groups of Chetniks numbering 13,000, Nešad Topčić's Zeleni kadar (or Green Cadres, a Muslim nationalist militia) most of which eventually joined the Partisans, and both Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard, neither of which was effective. These same groups, along with the Partisans, had simultaneously been trying to encourage Bosnian and Croat members to defect. Between March and June 1944, these attempts were largely fruitless, producing fewer than 200 deserters.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{defeated}} Mexico <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Americas <b>Zone</b> final, India defeated Japan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Zone</b> final, Italy defeated Sweden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Europe <b>Zone</b> final. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Inter-Zonal <b>Zone,</b> <b>the</b> USA defeated Italy, {{and then}} defeated India.

5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:50, 107mm rocket fire began impacting in {{the vicinity}} of LZ Hotel. Less than 10 minutes later, the LZ also received 82mm mortar fire. As soon as the Khmer Rouge fire commenced, the controllers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> notified the Air Force forward air controllers (FACs) flying overhead in 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron OV-10s. The FACs immediately made low passes over the east bank of the Mekong, but could not spot any fire coming from known enemy positions in that location. At 10:59, the last element of 2nd Battalion 4th Marines left the zone and the last marine helicopter landed on the USS Okinawa at 12:15.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, {{topographical}} officer George W. Hughes {{reported to}} Secretary of State John M. Clayton that a railroad across the isthmus was a “feasible and practical” idea. Clayton then instructed Robert P. Letcher, the minister to Mexico, {{to negotiate a}} treaty to protect Hargous' rights. The United States' proposal gave Mexicans a 20% discount on shipping, guaranteed Mexican rights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>zone,</b> allowed the United States to send in military if necessary, and gave the United States most-favored-nation status for Mexican cargo fees. This treaty, however, was never finalized.|$|E
5|$|Polo {{was finally}} {{released}} from captivity in August 1299, {{and returned home}} to Venice, where his father and uncle in the meantime had purchased a large palazzo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> named contrada San Giovanni Crisostomo (Corte del Milion). For such a venture, the Polo family probably invested profits from trading, and even many gemstones they brought from the East. The company continued its activities and Marco soon became a wealthy merchant. Marco and his uncle Maffeo financed other expeditions, but likely never left Venetian provinces, nor returned to the Silk Road and Asia. Sometime before 1300, his father Niccolò died. In 1300, he married Donata Badoèr, the daughter of Vitale Badoèr, a merchant. They had three daughters, Fantina (married Marco Bragadin), Bellela (married Bertuccio Querini), and Moreta.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>the</b> Southwestern <b>Zone</b> was one {{original}} {{centre of}} {{power of the}} Khmer Rouge, and cadres administered it with strict discipline, random executions were relatively rare, and [...] "new people" [...] were not persecuted {{if they had a}} cooperative attitude. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Zone</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northwestern <b>Zone,</b> conditions were harsh. Starvation was general <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter <b>zone</b> because cadres sent rice to Phnom Penh rather than distributing it to <b>the</b> local population. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Northern <b>Zone</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Central <b>Zone,</b> there seem to have been more executions than there were victims of starvation. Little reliable information emerged on conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northeastern <b>Zone,</b> one of <b>the</b> most isolated parts of Cambodia.|$|R

5|$|Schumacher's {{original}} helmet sported the colours of the German {{flag and}} his sponsor's decals. On {{the top was}} a blue circle with white astroids. When Jos Verstappen was his teammate, Schumacher added four red diagonal strokes over the visor to differentiate his helmet from his teammate. After Schumacher joined Ferrari a prancing horse was added on the back. From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour {{and some of the}} white areas to red. Since 2004, the helmet sported a white diagonal line with a white vertical line <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> of the German Flag colours (originally to accommodate sponsor AMD), but then these lines remained in the Suzuka 2006 design.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{villages and}} about 40 churches were {{destroyed}} in the southwest Salmas Plain and the surrounding mountainous regions. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> of heaviest damage (bounded by the villages of Kohneh Shahr, Payajuk and Zaviehjuk) all the homes and {{all but one of}} the churches were destroyed. To the east of this area, the large village of Dilman reportedly had 1,100 casualties, but seismologists J. S. Tchalenko and M. Berberian questioned the reliability of this figure. In smaller villages, survivors provided an accurate count of those lost because they remembered the victims by name, but in a village of 18,000, survivors were unable to grasp the extent of the losses. Only two homes remained standing there, and the village was renamed Salmas and moved to a new location to the west.|$|E

The album charted at number three, below fellow new album <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> by Britney Spears (number one) and above remix album Let It Be... Naked by The Beatles (number five). Blink-182 charted highest in Canada, where it debuted at number one. The album was also {{successful}} in other countries, debuting in the top ten in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|All three regiments of the NK 2nd Division—the 4th, 17th, and 6th, in {{line from}} north to south—crossed during the night to {{the east side of}} the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector. The NK 2nd Division, {{concentrated}} in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow. The massive North Korean attack had made deep penetrations everywhere in the division sector except in the north <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> of the 38th Infantry. The NK 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry; and the NK 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near Hyongp'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector.|$|E
