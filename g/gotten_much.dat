500|$|Political writer Howard Fineman {{has said}} that, [...] "Biden {{is not an}} academic, he's not a {{theoretical}} thinker, he's a great street pol. He comes {{from a long line}} of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift." [...] Political columnist David S. Broder has viewed Biden as having grown since he came to Washington and since his failed 1988 presidential bid: [...] "He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has <b>gotten</b> <b>much</b> much better." [...] Traub concludes that [...] "Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, he {{presided over}} the sale of Jaguar Cars and Land Rover to Tata Motors, an Indian car and truck manufacturer. Mulally said he had [...] "no regrets" [...] over the sale, preferring to {{concentrate}} on the Ford brand, as then-CEO Jacques Nasser was criticized in 2001 for paying too much attention to new overseas acquisitions while letting the main Ford operations in the U.S. decline. Ford received US$2.3 billion on the sale, considerably below what they paid for it under Nasser and Donald Petersen. However, analysts said that Ford would have <b>gotten</b> <b>much</b> less or might not have found a buyer if they had tried to sell it later in 2008, as Jaguar Land Rover sales subsequently plummeted due to high oil prices in the summer, causing Tata to request a bailout from the British government. Mulally also sold off Aston Martin and Volvo Cars, and reduced Ford's stake in Mazda.|$|E
2500|$|Unterberger {{concluded}} that the song [...] "is about a relationship that’s troubled by matters of emotional and/or physical distance, but that the singer feels strongly enough about {{to keep it going}} just the same…until the chorus, at which point he decides that it’s not worth the trouble. No, it doesn’t make sense, but it’s still stirring, beautiful in its own weird way, and undeniably unforgettable. And frankly, we wouldn’t want it any other way." [...] Kevin Richardson, member of the band, explained in an interview that, [...] "Ultimately the song really doesn't make much sense." [...] Richardson also wrote that Max Martin, who co-wrote and co-produced the song, barely spoke English. [...] "His English has <b>gotten</b> <b>much</b> better, but at the time...," [...] said Richardson. [...] "There are a lot of songs out there like that don't make sense," [...] he continues, [...] "but make you feel good when you sing along to them, and that's one of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon the album's debut, the {{critical}} receptions of Whitney were mixed. Most of critics admitted the {{commercial value of}} the album, but were critical of its standard pattern followed the predecessor's winning formula and the materials failed to reveal Houston's individuality. Jon Pareles of The New York Times criticized something as formulaic on the album, stating that: [...] "Whitney plays everything safe. It uses three of the debut album's producers. [...] There are bouncy, tinkly songs aimed at teen-agers, [...] and slow tunes aimed at sentimental adults, as before. Even the album title fits in with an Arista Records custom of separating female singers—Dionne, Aretha, Carly—from their last names." [...] He was not positive of her vocals on it, commenting [...] "What's more unsettling {{is that in the}} two years since Whitney Houston was released, the singer hasn't <b>gotten</b> <b>much</b> more expressive. For too many songs, she takes the patched-together style of the debut album further [...] as if she were singing in a second language." [...] He added that [...] "For all the passionate avowals of the lyrics, Ms. Houston and her producers keep emotion at bay." ...|$|E
60|$|The sun had now <b>gotten</b> <b>much</b> higher, {{and through}} all the gaps of the hills it cast long bars of gold across that white ocean. An eagle, or some other very great bird of the mountain, came {{wheeling}} over the nearer pine-tops, and hung, poised and something sideways, as if to look abroad on that unwonted desolation, spying, perhaps with terror, for the eyries of her comrades. Then, with a long cry, she disappeared again towards Lake County and the clearer air. At length {{it seemed to me}} as if the flood were beginning to subside. The old landmarks, by whose disappearance I had measured its advance, here a crag, there a brave pine tree, now began, in the inverse order, to make their reappearance into daylight. I judged all danger of the fog was over. This was not Noah's flood; it was but a morning spring, and would now drift out seaward whence it came. So, mightily relieved, and a good deal exhilarated by the sight, I went into the house to light the fire.|$|E
