5|$|Compromised as a {{reporter}} by her personal relationship with Roosevelt, Hickok left the AP and began work as the chief <b>investigator</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), a department of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Hickok encouraged or inspired several of Eleanor Roosevelt's initiatives, including her syndicated column, her all-women press conferences, and her planned community at Arthurdale, West Virginia. As Hickok grew more demanding of the First Lady, however, the pair's initial closeness lessened. Following complications with her diabetes, Hickok resigned from FERA in 1936 and worked for three years promoting the 1939 New York World's Fair. From 1940 to 1945, she served as the executive secretary of the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee, living at the White House {{for most of this}} time. As her diabetes steadily worsened, she lived out her final years at Hyde Park to be near Roosevelt, publishing several books.|$|E
5|$|Survivors {{who took}} shelter in basements or cornfields, {{as well as}} a {{captured}} member of the paramilitary forces, later testified about the killings and identified the White Eagles as the perpetrators. In addition, the withdrawing paramilitaries left critical evidence behind, including personnel records, which confirmed that the force had been White Eagles associated with Šešelj. An American war crimes <b>investigator</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Special Agent John Cencich, corroborated the information in an interview with a high-level inside witness linking Slobodan Milošević, then president of Serbia to the killings. The ICTY charged Milošević with the deaths of 32 civilians in Voćin. Milošević was subsequently arrested and tried, but he died before his trial was completed. The ICTY also charged Šešelj with involvement in the forced deportation of non-Serb civilians from Voćin. Šešelj was ultimately acquitted of all charges.|$|E

25|$|ASU is also {{involved}} with NASA {{in the field}} of space exploration. To meet the needs of NASA programs, ASU built the LEED Gold Certified, 298,000-square-foot Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building IV (ISTB 4) at a cost of $110million in 2012. The building includes space for the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) and includes labs and other facilities for the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. One of the main projects at ISTB 4 includes the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES). Although ASU built the spectrometers aboard the Martian rovers Spirit and Opportunity, OTES will be the first major scientific instrument completely designed and built at ASU for a NASA space mission. Phil Christensen, the principal <b>investigator</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), is a Regents' Professor at ASU. He also serves as the principal <b>investigator</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Mars Odyssey THEMIS instruments, as well as co-investigator for the Mars Exploration Rovers.

25|$|Meier, in {{collaboration}} with former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and others, wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign.

Donald told his brother that O'Brien was in possession of damaging Hughes information that could destroy his campaign.
