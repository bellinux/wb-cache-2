50|$|Since all pumps require {{well-developed}} {{inlet flow}} {{to meet their}} potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller <b>failure,</b> <b>high</b> maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.|$|E
