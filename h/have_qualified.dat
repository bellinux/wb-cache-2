5|$|Qualification for European {{competitions}} {{is determined}} by a team's success in its domestic league and cup competitions from the previous season. Liverpool competed in European competitions for 21 consecutive seasons until the 1985 European Cup Final, {{the occasion of the}} Heysel Stadium disaster, following which the club was banned from European competitions for six seasons.

The Lightning have over 1,800 points in their 25 seasons, the sixth-lowest point total in the league.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{official}} {{tropical cyclone}} {{of the year}} was also previously unknown until contemporary reassessments. It exhibited some hybrid characteristics, and may <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> for subtropical cyclone status according to the modern classification scheme. On September 15, the storm formed over the central Atlantic and initially moved westward. It gradually intensified as it turned northwestward, and on September 19 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of New England. The system was subsequently absorbed by a more powerful frontal boundary approaching from the northwest.|$|E
5|$|Kerry {{was second}} in his heat of the 200m {{freestyle}} heat {{in a time of}} 1m 54.86s, but was four seconds off the pace and did not qualify for the final. His time was 2.08s behind the slowest qualifier, placing him 16th. Kerry did not get to swim in the 4200m freestyle relay. The fastest Australian in the corresponding individual event, he was rested in the qualifying round; Australia came third in their heat and ninth overall to miss the final by 1.88s after Peter Dawson swam his split in a time four seconds slower than Kerry's effort in the individual event. Had Kerry repeated his individual time in the relay in place of Dawson, Australia would <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> fifth.|$|E

50|$|Costa Rica <b>has</b> <b>qualified</b> two athletes (one {{male and}} one female) in the speed competitions. Originally the country <b>had</b> <b>qualified</b> two female {{athletes in the}} speed events, but {{ultimately}} it chose to only send one.|$|R
5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E
5|$|Rugby was {{introduced}} to France in 1872 by the British, and on New Years Day 1906 the national side played its first Test match – against New Zealand in Paris. France played sporadically against the Home Nations until they joined them to form a Five Nations tournament (now the Six Nations Championship) in 1910. France also competed in the rugby competitions at early Summer Olympics, winning {{the gold medal in}} 1900 and two silver medals in the 1920s. The national team came of age during the 1950s and 1960s, winning their first Five Nations title outright in 1959. They won their first Grand Slam in 1968. Since the inaugural World Cup in 1987, France <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> for the knock-out stage of every tournament. They have reached the final three times, losing to the All Blacks in 1987 and 2011 and to Australia in 1999. France hosted the 2007 Rugby World Cup, where, as in 2003, they were beaten in the semi-finals by England.|$|E
5|$|Scotland <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> for the FIFA World Cup {{on eight}} {{occasions}} and the UEFA European Championship twice, but have never progressed beyond {{the first group}} stage of a finals tournament. The team have achieved some noteworthy results, such as beating the 1966 FIFA World Cup winners England 3–2 at Wembley Stadium in 1967. Archie Gemmill scored what {{has been described as}} one of the greatest World Cup goals ever in a 3–2 win during the 1978 World Cup against the Netherlands, who reached the final of the tournament. In their qualifying group for UEFA Euro 2008, Scotland defeated 2006 World Cup runners-up France 1–0 in both fixtures.|$|E

5|$|Since {{they began}} playing {{football}} in 1995, the Panthers {{have been to}} four NFC Championship Games; they lost two (1996 and 2005) and won two (2003 and 2015). The Panthers have won six division championships: the NFC West championship in 1996 and the NFC South championship in 2003, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2015. They are {{the first and only}} team to win the NFC South back to back and have won the NFC South more times than any other team in the division. They have finished as runners-up in their division six times, finishing second-place in the NFC West in 1997 and 1999 and finishing second-place in the NFC South in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012. They <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> for the playoffs 7 times, most recently in 2015.|$|E
5|$|To <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> for the {{national}} team under IIHF rules, a player must have met several criteria. He must be {{a citizen of the}} nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national association. Players are allowed to change which national team they represent, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating {{for the first time in}} an IIHF event, the player was required to have played two consecutive years in {{the national}} competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may happen only once in the player's life.|$|E
5|$|Twenty nations <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> for the Cricket World Cup {{at least}} once (excluding {{qualification}} tournaments). Seven teams have competed in every finals tournament, five of which have won the title. The West Indies won the first two tournaments, Australia has won five, India has won two, while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have each won once. The West Indies (1975 and 1979) and Australia (1999, 2003 and 2007) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. Australia has played in seven of the eleven final matches (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015). England has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up three times (1979, 1987, 1992). The best result by a non-Test playing nation is the semi-final appearance by Kenya in the 2003 tournament; while the best result by a non-Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 (second round) by Ireland in 2007.|$|E

5|$|In the 2009–10 Iraqi Premier League, {{under the}} {{management}} of Radhi Shenaishil, Al-Talaba finished as the leaders of Group B {{in the first stage}} with 68 points, having won 19 matches, drew 11, and lost four. They withdrew in the twelfth round due to a ruling from the Iraqi Olympic Committee where they were set to face Baghdad that awarded the win. In the elite stage, Al-Talaba ended up in second place of Group One as the best runners-up of the three groups where they had ten points, the same amount of points as the first place, Al-Zawra'a, but they had the goals difference of +2 and Al-Talaba the goals difference of +1. If either Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya had beaten Naft Al-Janoob or Al-Shorta had beaten Najaf FC, Al-Talaba would not <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> for the semi-finals, but Jawiya drew 0–0 and Al-Shorta drew 2–2. In the semi-finals, Al-Talaba won 1–0 to Erbil in the first leg and drew with no goals in the second leg. They lost in the final to Duhok SC with a late goal in the 82nd minute.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1994–1995 NBA season, Rodman {{clashed with the}} Spurs front office. He was suspended {{for the first three}} games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19games. After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49games. Normally, he would not <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team. In the 1995 NBA Playoffs, the 62-win Spurs with reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner Robinson entered the Western Conference Finals and were considered favorites against the reigning champions Houston Rockets who had only won 47games. It was thought that Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon {{would have a hard time}} asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by sitting down on the court, could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his eighth pole position of the season, his fifth at the circuit, in a time of 1:35.825. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen, who was nine thousands of a second slower than his championship rival and battled him for grid position throughout the session. Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard qualified third, and conceded that he was not quick enough to challenge for pole position. The two Williams drivers qualified on the third row of the grid; Button ahead of Ralf Schumacher although both drivers had mixed feelings over their performance. Both Jaguar drivers took seventh and tenth and were satisifed with their pace. Frentzen reported that his car was difficult to handle but was happy to manage an qualifying position of eighth. Villeneuve took ninth despite suffering from excessive oversteer and was unable to improve his time because he changed his car in the opposite direction. Herbert who rounded out the top ten felt he could <b>have</b> <b>qualified</b> on the fourth row despite changes to his set-up. Wurz qualified eleventh and missed on qualifying in the top ten by nearly two thousands of a second. His teammate Fisichella started from twelfth position and reported his car lost performance after the morning practice sessions. Both Arrows drivers filled the seventh row of the grid–de la Rosa was faster than Verstappen–and were affected with problems on the cars limiting their running. Trulli had car handling issues and qualified 15th. Heidfeld qualified 16th, ahead of teammate Jean Alesi. Zonta had limited qualifying time because of an engine change and managed 18th overall. The tenth row of the grid was filled by both Sauber drivers; Mika Salo in front of Pedro Diniz. Salo used the spare Sauber because his race car had alternator issues. Both of Diniz's two fastest qualifying times were disallowed because of him laying oil on the circuit in the morning practice sessions. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid with Marc Gené ahead of Gastón Mazzacane.|$|E
