We derive a suboptimal scheduling policy with dynamic state-based priorities calculated at the sensors, which are then used for stateless priority queuing in the network, making it both scalable and efficient to implement on routers or multi-layer switches. These properties are beneficial towards leveraging existing IP networks for control, which will be a crucial factor for the proliferation of wide-area NCS applications. By allowing for an arbitrary number of concurrent transmissions, we are able to investigate the relationship between available bandwidth, transmission rate, and delay.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) {{which allows}} secondary users {{to identify and}} exploit instantaneous spectrum opportunities resulting from the bursty traffic of primary users. Within the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), we develop decentralized cognitive MAC protocols that allow secondary users to independently search for spectrum opportunities without a central coordinator or a <b>dedicated</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel.</b> The focus {{of this paper is}} the tradeoff between optimality and complexity of obtaining OSA protocols. We first analyze the computational complexity of designing OSA protocols within the POMDP framework and demonstrate that the complexity grows exponentially with the horizon length (ie, the spectrum access time of secondary users). By exploiting the underlying structure of the problem, we aim to develop a quantitative characterization of the fundamental tradeoff between optimality and complexity so that a systematic way of balancing these two can be obtained. Specifically, by exploiting the mixing time of the underlying Markov process of spectrum occupancy, we develop a truncated MDP formulation of OSA and reduce the computational complexity from growing exponentially to linearly with the horizon length. More importantly, this truncated MDP formulation provides a systematical way of trading off performance with complexity by choosing an appropriate truncation parameter...|$|R

This information later {{can be used to}} steal money from the user. Further, the financial outlets require a <b>dedicated</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> for user authentication. Installing these outlets is therefore an expensive operation. In this work, we are providing Secure Communication Protocol for financial services based on a smart card. By authenticating ATM, the user is ensured of the genuineness of the ATM. Hence fake ATM cannot steal the user information. After the session establishment, communication is carried out in encrypted form. This way the attacker cannot get any meaningful transaction information. Thus our approach handles security vulnerabilities in the current model.

40|$|Abstract — We propose {{decentralized}} cognitive MAC protocols {{that allow}} secondary users to independently search for spectrum opportunities without a central coordinator or a <b>dedicated</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel.</b> Recognizing hardware and energy constraints, {{we assume that}} a secondary user {{may not be able}} to perform full-spectrum sensing or may not be willing to monitor the spectrum when it has no data to transmit. We develop an analytical framework for opportunistic spectrum access based on the theory of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This decision-theoretic approach integrates the design of spectrum access protocols at the MAC layer with spectrum sensing at the physical layer and traffic statistics determined by the application layer of the primary network. It also allows easy incorporation of spectrum sensing error and constraint on the probability of colliding with the primary users. Under this POMDP framework, we propose cognitive MAC protocols that optimize the performance of secondary users while limiting the interference perceived by primary users. A suboptimal strategy with reduced complexity yet comparable performance is developed. Without additional control message exchange between the secondary transmitter and receiver, the proposed decentralized protocols ensure synchronous hopping in the spectrum between the transmitter and the receiver in the presence of collisions and spectrum sensing errors.

40|$|International audienceThe main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is the characterization of the limiting average performance of a system involving two agents who coordinate their actions which belong to a continuous set. One agent has complete and noncausal knowledge of the sequence of i. i. d. realizations of a random state X 0, which is called the system state and affects the common team payoff. For the other agent, two scenarios in terms of observation assumptions are considered: in the first scenario, the other agent has a strictly causal knowledge of the system state while in the second scenario it has no direct knowledge of the state at all. However, in both scenarios, the less informed agent can always observe a noisy and strictly causal version of the actions taken by the (most) informed agent. There exists no <b>dedicated</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> between the two agents, and thus, the informed agent can only communicate via its actions which in turn affect the common payoff, hence the term implicit communication. Thus, there is a tradeoff to be found for the informed agent between communicating information about the incoming realizations of the system state and maximizing the payoff at the current stage. We use this general framework and apply it to a specific cost function, namely the Witsenhausen cost function. Although the problem tackled differs from the famous Witsenhausen's counterexample, the authors believe interesting new connections which help to understand the corresponding open problem might be established over time.

Such {{communication is}} typically realized through direct messages between initiator and target processes. For petas-cale systems with 10, 000 s of nodes and 100, 000 s of cores, these direct messages require <b>dedicated</b> <b>communication</b> buffers and/or <b>channels,</b> {{which can lead to}} significant scalability challenges for GAS programming models. In this paper, we describe a network-friendly communication model, multinode cooperation, to enable indirect one-sided communication. Compute nodes work together to handle one-side requests through (1) request forwarding in which one node can intercept a request and forward it to a target node, and (2) request aggregation in which one node can aggregate many requests to a target node. We have implemented multinode cooperation for a popular GAS runtime library, Aggregate Remote Memory Copy Interface (ARMCI). Our experimental results on a large-scale Cray XT 5 system demonstrate that multinode coop-eration is able to greatly increase memory scalability by reducing communication buffers required on each node.

The mechanical and electrical parts of a typical genset are modeled mathematically in a digital controller (ds- 1103, dSpace) and the model is fed to a current and voltage controlled voltage source inverter (VSI) which is designed for the emulation of the generator output voltage to produce the same output power characteristics as in a real diesel engine generator. Output available power of a second source (only steady state behaviour of a HKECS) is emulated using a current controlled VSI (CCVSI); which is fed by reference signals determined by the available power flow of the water. In addition, a novel method for combination of the genset and HKECS is proposed to enforce the genset to operate in the least brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), most efficient or less emission operating points. Since no <b>dedicated</b> physical <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> is desirable and generally does not exist in real applications, yet there is a demand to communicate between two sources to keep one in a particular operating point, a modified droop control scheme is defined to communicate indirectly.
