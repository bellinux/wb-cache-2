25|$|Predators of the Asian date mussel vary {{depending}} on the native fauna of the area. In the Swan River estuary of Western Australia, for example, predation occurs mainly by boring carnivorous gastropods such as Nassarius burchardi or Bedeva paivae, which <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> the mussel's thin shell. In Mission Bay in San Diego, however, the mussel's main predators include the yellowfin croaker, spotfin croaker, sargo, willet, and the marbled godwit (three fish and two bird species respectively). Other less significant predators include carnivorous gastropods (especially Pteropurpura festiva), crustaceans, echinoderms, fish, and diving ducks. Recent research has emphasized the importance of the predation of Arcuatula senhousia by native fauna as a means of reducing the negative effects of the invasive species on ecosystems.|$|E

500|$|In 1929, Wade Dean {{formed the}} Glacier Mining Company and filed mining {{claims to the}} sulfur on Adams' [...] summit plateau. Beginning in 1932, the first {{assessment}} work was done. The initial test pits were dug by hand, but this proved to be dangerous work and an alternative was needed to <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> the up to [...] thick ice cap more safely. The answer was a diamond tipped drilling machine, but, being a heavy machine, {{it could not be}} carried up the newly completed horse and mule trail like other supplies. So it winched itself up the mountain using a series of deadman anchors. 168 pack string trips led by John Perry were made {{over the course of the}} mining activities. The crew stayed in the abandoned Forest Service lookout, a tight fit for the usual eight men and their equipment. This problem was alleviated somewhat in the later years of the project when an enclosed [...] lean-to was added to the cabin. Another smaller lean-to was added later. The conditions and weather above [...] could be incredibly variable with the highest temperature of [...] recorded 12 hours before the lowest temperature of [...] This preliminary mining continued for several years until 1937 when the last crew worked from the summit lookout. In the years following, Dean periodically attempted to restart this venture and in 1946, he and Lt. John Hodgkins made several landings by airplane on the summit ice cap. Although sulfur was found, the amount of the ore that was able to be mined in a season was only enough to make up the cost of getting it off the mountain and was not enough to be competitive. Part of this stemmed from Dean’s desire that if operations were expanded, an ore as well as passenger transport system was needed, and his desire that Adams not be significantly scarred by the operation. The project was fully abandoned in 1959. [...] Adams is the only large Cascade volcano to have its summit exploited by commercial miners.|$|E

2500|$|Another, different, bit {{also called}} an {{installer}} bit {{has a very}} long flexible shaft, typically up to [...] long, with a small twist bit at the end. The shaft is made of spring steel instead of hardened steel, {{so it can be}} flexed while drilling without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> studs from a light switch box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.|$|E
2500|$|A {{hammer drill}} has a {{specially}} designed clutch that allows it to not only spin the drill bit, but also to punch it in and out (along the axis of the bit). The actual distance the bit travels in and out and the force of its blow are both very small, and the hammering action is very rapid—thousands of [...] "BPM" [...] (blows per minute) or [...] "IPM" [...] (impacts per minute). Although each blow is of relatively low force, these thousands of blows per minute are more than adequate to break up concrete or brick, using the masonry drill bit's carbide wedge to pulverize it for the spiral flutes to whisk away. For this reason, a hammer drill drills much faster than a regular <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> concrete or brick. Holes in hard materials are needed for anchor bolts, concrete screws and wall plugs.|$|E

[...] New fittings were supplied without pre-drilled holes and the holes were drilled during installation to correctly align the engine nacelle with the wing. However, after considerable in-service experience of the boom-renewal process British Aircraft Corporation amended the procedure to allow re-use of the engine nacelle rear mount fittings. Re-use of the old fittings relied on the existing holes aligning closely with the bushes in the new inner lower booms. [...] When new inner lower booms were installed in VH-RMQ in 1958, new engine nacelle rear mount fittings were also installed but when new booms were again installed in 1964 the fittings first installed in 1958 were re-used. [...] In the wreckage of the right wing of VH-RMQ there was evidence of an initial problem while trying to align the five holes in the old fitting with the bushes in the new boom. The bores of three bushes had been scored with a drill, possibly while maintenance personnel were trying to align three of the holes sufficiently to be able to insert the attachment bolts. Running a <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> the bush at Station 143 may have disturbed the bush and initiated a sequence of actions leading to fatal damage to the wall of the hole.|$|E

Drake became {{more involved in}} the company and traveled to Titusville, Pennsylvania and the Brewer and Watson Farm in December1857. His report prompted Bissell and Eveleth to organize the Seneca Oil Company in Connecticut in March1858 and to place Drake in charge of producing petroleum. Because Drake decided that drilling in the manner of salt wells would yield more petroleum than conventional digging, he hired William A. Smith, a Tarentum blacksmith and salt-well driller, to aid in the endeavor. An engine house and derrick were constructed, and Drake purchased a , horizontal steam engine. The steam engine was used to ram the <b>drill</b> <b>through</b> the soil until it reached bedrock [...] down.
