The {{decision was made to}} give Romanoff her own comic ahead of The Avengers because Marvel felt that she [...] "remains the most enigmatic of the Avengers" [...] despite appearing in previous films. Van Lente explained the relationship between Black Widow Strikes and the films by saying, [...] "This is on the same scale as the Marvel movies. We’re working closely with Marvel Studios to have it integrate seamlessly with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once this is over, they’re welcome to use any of my ideas here for a movie." [...] Van Lente took inspiration [...] "from Joss Whedon's script for Marvel's the Avengers, which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> read.
