40|$|Abstract: Utilities employ Thermal {{instability}} <b>testing</b> (TIT) for <b>final</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> {{after the}} construction and refurbishment of turbogenerator rotors. This type of testing is performed through two methodologies namely current injection and friction/windage {{in order to assess}} the thermal sensitivity of the machine’s rotor.

There is also no definitive evidence or standards that offer a comparison of the two methods and suitability assessment thereof. The presented research investigates these two methods of TIT for a synchronous generator rotor. An experimental setup with infrared thermography is employed to investigate the thermal behaviour of the machine’s rotor for each of the test methods. Experimental results show that the thermal behavior of the generator rotor is significantly different for each methodology.

This prompts development of formal methods for software design and verification. The model based development of automotive functionality has become extremely popular especially in drive train and engine applications. The approach appears to make the development more modular, with the programming code being more reusable and easier to test. This article looks at {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of this approach. It concerns the range of tests, from first component tests through integration and system <b>tests</b> to the <b>final</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests.</b> It discusses model based development using the V model and shows some differences to code based development. The first component tests are generally divided into static tests (reviews, rule checkers, metrics, static analysis) and dynamic tests (model in the loop, software in the loop, processor in the loop). In addition, an important aspect is verification of models using non-floating point arithmetic, as this method of calculation of often used in automotive embedded computers (e. g. FPGA). The formal verification of such models is discussed. With respect to the integration tests, the article concentrates on some issues of hardware-in-the-loop testing. The system tests are also discussed, especially the structure of system information in a model based approach and the preconditions determined by hardware in the loop <b>tests.</b> In the <b>final</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests,</b> the main problems contain: formal link between the system requirements and the test methods and coordination and optimisation of the whole test process.

A small amount of effort spent on quality assurance will see good amount of cost savings in terms of detecting and eliminating the defects. The purpose of defect prevention is to identify those defects in the beginning of the life cycle and prevent them from recurring so that the defect may not surface again. Software for safety-critical systems must deal with the hazards identified by safety analysis in order to make the system safe, risk-free and fail-safe. Certain faults in critical systems can result in catastrophic consequences such as death, injury or environmental harm. The focus of this paper is an approach to software safety analysis based on a combination of two existing fault removal techniques. A comprehensive software safety analysis involving a combination of Design Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) and Design Fault Tree Analysis (DFTA) is conducted on the functions of the critical system during design phase to identify potentially hazardous design faults.
