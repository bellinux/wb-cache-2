The analysis estimates <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> that serve to assess the likely impact of CAFTA-DR on Puerto Rico and United States’ foreign trade. The estimated effects of CAFTA-DR on the US are invariably modest. For the case of Puerto Rico, the effects are of considerably larger importance, albeit still somewhat small.

50|$|The <b>Gravity</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> {{presents}} a more empirical analysis of trading patterns. The gravity model, in its basic form, predicts trade {{based on the}} distance between countries and {{the interaction of the}} countries' economic sizes. The model mimics the Newtonian law of gravity which also considers distance and physical size between two objects. The model has been shown to have significant empirical validity.|$|E
50|$|The most {{influential}} model to describe trade patterns, {{and in a}} similar way, describe human mobility is the <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> The model predicts, that the migration flow {{is proportional to the}} population of the cities/countries, and it is reciprocal in a quadratic order in the distance between them. Although, it is an intuitive description of the flows, and it is used to describe gravitational forces in physics, in terms of migration it does not perform well empirically. Moreover, the model just simply assumes the given functional form without any theoretical background.|$|E

40|$|Existing <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> {{based on}} panel data are often static, that is, they only allow for {{contemporaneous}} effects <b>of</b> regressors on <b>trade.</b> However, {{there are numerous}} economic arguments suggesting that trade is a dynamic process. Hence, we extend the static model with lagged regressors including lags <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> Using a panel of 221 annual bilateral OECD trade flows over 48 years, we find that dynamics are strongly significant, so that static models are misspecified. The resulting dynamic panel <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> leads to sensible short-term and long-term trade dynamics. We also show that the simple least squares dummy variable estimator, which is typically used in static panels, yields accurate estimates for our dynamic model and outperforms generalized method of moments...|$|R

Consequently, we test for the heterogeneity of data sets used in <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> which leads us to a conclusion that behavioural patterns of exporters and importers built in the datasets are very complicated and a single generalized specification of gravity equation can lead to bias in estimates and/or to similarly generalized conclusions that hide important robust idiosyncrasies in behavior present in some subsamples of economic agents.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of adopting a strong foreign currency as sole legal tender {{is to reduce the}} transaction costs of trade among countries using the same currency. There are at least two ways to infer this impact from data. The first is the significantly negative effect of exchange rate volatility on trade in most cases, and the second is an association between transaction costs and the need to operate with multiple currencies. Economic integration {{with the rest of the}} world becomes easier as a result of lowered transaction costs and stabler prices. Rose (2000) applied the <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> and provided empirical evidence that countries sharing a common currency engage in significantly increased trade among them, and that the benefits of currency substitution for trade may be large.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the process of}} economic integration between the Chinese province of Yunnan and its riparian areas of the Mekong region. The <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> is used to investigate the evolution of Yunnan’s international trade integration between 1988 and 1999. Although Greater Mekong Subregion cooperation efforts have had {{a positive effect on}} trade, trade has progressively decreased from an above-standard level to a normal level, according to the <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> During this process, Yunnan’s trade has increased with other countries such as Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. This evolution is in line with Yunnan’s development and indicates a progressive re-orientation of its trade toward more developed partners. The results suggest that the Mekong cooperation project has to broaden its perspective, taking into consideration Yunnan’s expanding trade relations with countries outside the Greater Mekong Subregion...|$|E
40|$|Globalization {{is one of}} {{the central}} {{concepts}} of our age. The common perception of the process is that, due to declining communication and transport costs, distance becomes less and less important. However, the distance coefficient in the <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> which grows in time, indicates that the role of distance increases rather than decreases. This, in essence, captures the notion of the globalization puzzle. Here, we show that the fractality of the international trade system (ITS) provides a simple solution for the puzzle. We argue, that the distance coefficient corresponds to the fractal dimension of ITS. We provide two independent methods, box counting method and spatial choice model, which confirm this statement. Our results allow us to conclude that the previous approaches to solving the puzzle misinterpreted the meaning of the distance coefficient in the <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

However, we find that whether outward FDI creates or replaces trade depends on the industry under scrutiny.

We find also that Japanese overseas investments substitute for imports of chemical products, and for both exports and imports of general machinery...|$|R

40|$|We {{incorporate}} {{the effects of}} culture to generalise existing <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> foreign portfolio investment (FPI). The inclusion of cultural identifiers in FPI originating and destination countries along with cultural distances between them {{is analogous to the}} inclusion of gravity and institutional strength variables for each country alongside geographical distances in standard <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> international <b>trade</b> in commodities, services and financial assets. Although intuitive, this has not been considered hitherto in <b>gravity</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> international <b>trade</b> within the international business, economics or finance literatures. We estimate our <b>models</b> <b>of</b> cross-border debt and equity FPI using panel regressions on the IMF’s CPIS survey for 174 originating and 50 destination countries from 2001 to 2007. We find that culture and cultural distance operate alongside geographic distance in determining global FPI patterns, and we find strong hitherto unreported cultural effects. Overall, our paper points to the importance of clearly separating the measurement and effects of gravity and culture- gravity always deters <b>trade,</b> but aspects <b>of</b> culture can encourage trade...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{provides}} a quantitative {{analysis of the}} Czech export with a further focus on the electrical engineering and on the electric motors and generators. The tool used for the analysis is the <b>gravity</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the international <b>trade,</b> and the estimation method employed is the PPML estimator. The novelty of the research lies in a one country export analysis, and in {{a comparison of the}} export functions on three different aggregations and for two states (the Czech Republic and France). The panel data analysis of the period between 1995 and 2013 reveals that the Czech Republic was more export-driven than France, an unanticipated fact about a dissimilarity of the total and the machinery and transport equipment export functions of the Czech Republic, and a statistically nonsignificant influence of the euro on the Czech export. The one year analyses of 1995 and 2013 reveal an increasing importance of the distance and the partner's GDP on both countries' exports, and a nonimportance of the partner's EU membership and of the geographic location in the CEE on the Czech export.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we follow recent {{developments}} of panel data studies and explicitly {{allow for the}} existence of unobserved common time-specific factors where their individual responses are also allowed to be heterogeneous across cross section units. In the context of this extended panel data framework we generalize the Hausman-Taylor estimation methodology and develop the associated econometric theory. We apply our proposed estimation technique along with the conventional panel data approaches to a comprehensive analysis of the gravity equation <b>of</b> bilateral <b>trade</b> flows amongst the 15 European countries over 1960 - 2001. Empirical results clearly demonstrate that our proposed approach fits the data reasonably well and provides much more sensible results than the conventional approach based on the fixed time dummies. These findings may highlight the importance of allowing for a certain degree of cross section dependence through unobserved heterogeneous time specific common effects, otherwise the resulting estimates would be severely biased. <b>Gravity</b> <b>Models</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trade,</b> Heterogeneous Panel Data, Hausman-Taylor Estimation, Time-specific Common Factors, Intra-EU Trade. ...|$|R
