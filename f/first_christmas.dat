5|$|Several Christmas firsts {{mark the}} post-War era {{that include the}} first White House Christmas card, the <b>first</b> <b>Christmas</b> postage stamp, the first opera {{composed}} for television (Amahl and the Night Visitors), the <b>first</b> <b>Christmas</b> Day basketball game, and the first Elvis Presley Christmas album. The era saw the production and manufacture of toys that have become classics such as Candy Land, Mr. Potato Head, and Barbie.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Amahl was colorcast. The opera {{claims the}} distinctions {{of being the}} first opera written for television, the first {{presentation}} of the teleseries Hallmark Hall of Fame, and the <b>first</b> <b>Christmas</b> television special to become an annual tradition. The opera was telecast on NBC from 1951 to 1966 with many of the original cast and crew participating.|$|E
5|$|The opera's appeal lay {{not only}} in its story about a {{crippled}} shepherd boy healed on the <b>first</b> <b>Christmas</b> Eve but in its wedding of opera and the limitations of television. The broad effects of theater were eschewed and instead an intimacy appropriate to the television studio and home viewing was cultivated. The production starred Chet Allen as Amahl and Rosemary Kuhlmann as his mother. Kuhlmann reprised her role annually for many years.|$|E

5|$|Peace on Earth is the <b>first</b> <b>Christmas</b> album by American Christian {{rock band}} Casting Crowns. Produced by Mark Hall and Mark A. Miller, it was {{released}} on October 7, 2008. Intended by Hall {{to bring out the}} worshipful aspect of Christmas, the album does not have songs relating to secular Christmas traditions, instead featuring a mix of traditional Christmas carols and original songs. As co-producer, Hall attempted to differentiate the album from their previous ones by attempting to use creative ideas they had not tried before, and he also wanted to utilize the band's female members in a broader and more visible role on the album.|$|E
