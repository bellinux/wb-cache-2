He finds Wilfred {{had come to}} help him, but is now trapped {{in one of the}} Gate's <b>isolated</b> <b>control</b> rooms that is about to be flooded by radiation. The Doctor self-sacrifices himself by stepping into the other, freeing Wilfred before the room is flooded. Though his body was able to absorb the radiation, the Doctor knows his body will soon regenerate. After dropping Wilfred back home, the Doctor visits past companions and acquaintances; Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) and Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) who have married and are working as freelance alien hunters, Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and her son Luke Smith (Tommy Knight), and Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman). He also visits Verity Newman (Jessica Hynes), the great-granddaughter of Joan Redfern who the Doctor had previously met in [...] "Human Nature". He then travels forward in time to Donna's wedding where he gives Wilfred and Sylvia Noble (Donna's mother) a lottery ticket that he had bought for Donna with money borrowed from her deceased father. Finally, the Doctor visits Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), on New Year's Day 2005, three months before she meets him as the Ninth Doctor and tells her she will have [...] "a really great year".|$|E
5000|$|The series {{ends with}} the {{awakening}} of a new megadeus, and the revelation {{that the world is}} a simulated reality. A climactic battle ensues between Big O and Big Fau, after which reality is systematically erased by the new megadeus, an incarnation of Angel, recognised as [...] "Big Venus" [...] by Dorothy. Roger implores Angel to [...] "let go of the past" [...] regardless of its existential reality, and focus only on the present and the future. In an <b>isolated</b> <b>control</b> room, the real Angel observes Roger and her past encounters with him on a series of television monitors. On the control panel lies Metropolis, a book featured prominently since the thirteenth episode, with the cover featuring an illustration of angel wings and gives the author's name as [...] "Angel Rosewater". Big Venus and Big O physically merge, causing the virtual reality to reset. A white flash subsides, and the first scenes of the first episode of the series play out. New versions of Dorothy and Angel watch Roger drive down the street as he delivers again his first speech of the series ("My name is Roger Smith. I perform a much needed job here in the City of Amnesia"), although he is a little hesitant this time. The ending title card, [...] "We have come to terms," [...] appears, and the credits roll.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe protandrous marine snail Crepidula fornicata {{has been}} a {{theoretical}} and empirical model for studies of sex change for many decades. We investigated the social conditions under which sex change occurs in this species by manipulating physical and chemical contact with conspecifics. Male snails were either in physical and chemical contact with females or in chemical contact with, but physically isolated from, females. Males were tested both with living females and with empty, sterilized shells. Males that were physically touching a living female {{were less likely to}} change sex than the <b>isolated</b> <b>controls,</b> while males in chemical (but not physical) contact with females changed sex no slower than the <b>isolated</b> <b>controls.</b> These results provide experimental evidence that the factor controlling sex change in C. fornicata is due to a contact-borne inhibitor associated with female conspecifics.

40|$|Abstract—Smart grids are {{characterized}} by a dynamic nature in which distributed energy resources (DER’s) changes internal states and availability over time. Distributed Energy Resources (DER’s) and the distributed control system will thus be required to automatically configure itself to this dynamic behavior. This paper 1 addresses communication and control challenges to achieve a plug’n’play type of DER management. A use case with Electric Vehicles is considered because of its high dynamic behavior in smart grid. In particular, the problem of making correct decisions on which controller out of many, an EV shall be operated by will be addressed.

Discrete-event piecewise affine (PWA) and discrete-event max-plus models are proposed to formulate the optimization {{problem for the}} switching sequences. Two control problems are considered: steady-state control and N-stages control. The formulated discrete-event PWA and max-plus problems are converted to be solved by linear programming (LP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In the special case when the criterion is a strictly increasing and linear function of the queue lengths, the steady-state control problem is solved analytically. I...|$|R

This semi-active base <b>isolated</b> <b>control</b> system is classified into a bilinear system, which an input {{of the system is}} proportional to both one of the state vectors and damping factor. To apply a linear control theory like LQR directly, the system has been formed into an equivalent linear system at a certain condition. Since there is some possibility of deterioration of structural performance that is not desirable from the viewpoint of a reduction of acceleration response, we apply the gain-scheduled (GS) control method by transforming the system with the semi-active MR damper to a parameter variation system and finally demonstrate the efficiency of the method successfully...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{evolution of}} the TRIUMF Central Control System is currently subject to three major influences. Most imperative {{is the need to}} replace the obsolete Nova computers that still handle much of the routine cyclotron operation. Smooth integration of a number of <b>isolated</b> <b>control</b> systems into the CCS is another focus. The third major force arises from the requirements of developing new projects in a system that has reached serious expansion constraints. The plan for phasing out the Novas, integrating the orphaned systems and allowing expansion of the CCS in a smooth fashion is discussed. This is a conservative approach, relying on the strengths of the present hardware configuration, the substantial financial investment in existing equipment, and the expertise of available personnel, while meeting the present and future requirements. Details of the modified and expanded hardware configuration are described. This review also briefly mentions new support for device access, X-window [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Optimization {{of system}} {{performance}} and minimizing of some cost functions are important control targets in dispatching centers and SCADA systems. In addition to remote measurements, monitoring and providing various reports, the automatic control section {{has an important}} role. Tracking of reference signals and meaningful curves {{is known as the}} main objectives of this section. For example, for optimizing of fuel consumption in power plants, optimal fuel curve is needed, or tracking a fixed frequency (50 or 60 Hz) reference is known as a target for load-frequency control systems. In order to achieve a desired tracking, many control methodologies have been presented over the years, which most of them are based on classical techniques. In the present paper an H∞ control methodology is used to solve the typical tracking control problems in dispatching centers. The proposed methodology is applied for the purpose of frequency regulation in an <b>isolated</b> <b>control</b> area. The research is supplemented by computer simulation results...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand to}} extend the set of services, such as network address translation, firewalls, proxies, and virtual private networks, that are {{supported}} by Internet-connected devices represents an opportunity {{to extend the}} traditional domain of Internet routers beyond simple packet forwarding. An important characteristic is the ability for end-users to install custom services on their routers. Routers with this characteristic are extensible. Due to their critical position in the Internet topology, routers must be robust—when presented with unanticipated workloads, they must allocate their resources across the services they support according to administrator-established policies to ensure that each service gets the resources it needs. By their nature, hardware-based routers with physically <b>isolated</b> <b>control</b> and data planes are robust but not readily extensible without a redesign while software-based routers may be extensible but are not robust without extensive regression testing; {{it is difficult to}} be simultaneously robust and extensible.

LHCb has chosen to equip every board with an embedded micro-controller and connecting them in a large Local Area Network. The intelligence of these devices allows complex (soft) real-time control and monitoring, required for modern powerful FPGA driven electronics.

40|$|A new small {{full bridge}} module for MMCC {{research}} is presented. Each {{full bridge converter}} cell is a single small (65 × 30 mm) multilayer PCB with two low voltage high current (22 V, 40 A) integrated half bridge ICs and the necessary <b>isolated</b> <b>control</b> signals and auxiliary power supply (2500 V isolation). All devices are surface mount, minimising cell height (4 mm) and parasitic inductance. Each converter cell can be physically stacked with PCB connectors propagating the control signals and inter-cell power connections. Many cells can be trivially stacked to create a large multilevel converter leg with isolated auxiliary power and control signals. Any of the MMCC family members is then easily formed. With a change in placement of stacking connector, a parallel connection of bridges is also possible. Operation of a nine level parallel full bridge is demonstrated at 12 V and 384 kHz switching frequency delivering a 30 W 2 kHz sinewave into a resistive load.

40|$|<b>Isolated</b> <b>control</b> of {{pressure}} in the carotid sinus was exercised bilaterally by means of pump-driven autoperfusion in anaesthetized heparinized cats breathing 100 % O 2. In cats with vagus nerves intact, a rise of intrasinus pressure resulted in a non-adapting fall in arterial blood pressure and a short-lasting depression in tidal volume and frequency of breathing that adapted fully in the steady state. Vagotomy increased the steady-state gain of the intrasinus pressure-vasodepressor relationship and resulted sometimes in a measurable sustained inhibition of breathing, following its initial adaptation, at the upper levels of intrasinus pressure tested. Pharmacological stabilization of the blood pressure {{with the use of}} guanethidine plus phenylephrine did not detectably affect the adapting character of the sinus reflex respiratory response. Denervation of the carotid sinuses abolished all responses previously evoked by shifts of intrasinus pressure. It is concluded that the reflex effects of carotid sinus autoperfusion are produced by selective activation of the baroreceptors and that the respiratory adaptation results from signal processing in the central nervous system different from the processing involved in the non-adapting vasodepressor effect...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of software development, some software developers may plagiarize source code from other projects or open source software in order to shorten development cycle. Many methods have been proposed to detect plagiarism among programs based on the program dependence graph, a graph representation of a program. However, to our best knowledge, existing works only detect similarity between programs without detecting copy direction among them. By employing extreme learning machine (ELM), we construct feature space for describing features of every two programs with possible plagiarism relationship. Such feature space could be large and time consuming, so we propose approaches to construct a small feature space by pruning <b>isolated</b> <b>control</b> statements and removable statements from each program to accelerate both training and classification time. We also analyze the features of data dependencies between any original program and its copy program, and based on it we propose a feedback framework to find a good feature space that can achieve both accuracy and efficiency. We conducted a thorough experimental study of this technique on real C programs collected from the Internet. The experimental results show the high accuracy and efficiency of our ELM-based approaches...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} whether juveniles of the nocturnal fish jundiá (Rhamdia quelen) and the diurnal fish Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) {{are able}} to chemically communicate stress to conspecifics. Groups of 8 fish were reared in tanks under recirculated water (water exchanged among all the tanks) for each species. Fish were handled in half of the tanks (stressor fish) and whole-body cortisol concentrations were compared among handled fish, non-handled fish exposed to water from the handled fish, and non-handled control fish held with no water communication. For each treatment cortisol concentrations were determined before exposure to the stressor (basal levels) and after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Basal levels of cortisol confirmed fish were unstressed {{in the beginning of}} the experiment. Cortisol was increased in the stressor fish 1 h after handling. Fish receiving water from the stressor fish increased cortisol levels later (2 h after the stressor fish were handled). As the <b>isolated</b> <b>control</b> group maintained cortisol levels unchanged throughout the experiment, we concluded that some chemical factor was released by the stressed fish in the water and thus stressed the conspecifics. This pattern was similar for both unrelated species, thus suggesting that this communication might have evolved earlier in fish and reinforcing the biological value of this kind of information...|$|E
