5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b> <b>The</b> video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E

As a sophomore, at the suggestion of his mother, Venable resumed baseball. He posted modest numbers in his first season, but in 2004, he hit for a [...]344batting average, earned All-Ivy honorable mention, and was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the fifteenth round of the draft (439th overall). Bradley felt that Major League Baseball scouts undervalued Venable because he did not participate in the Cape Cod League for college baseball players. Thus, instead of signing and giving up his amateur status, Venable returned for his senior season and posted a league leading 9home runs and runner-up [...]385 batting average while earning All-League honors. Subsequently, the Padres drafted him in the seventh round (215th overall); he was signed by the Padres' Northeast Scouting Director, Jim Bretz.|$|E

Brown came to watch the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, and was staying in the same hotel as the Rice team. He saw Humble and his wife Lorraine, whom Humble had met while in {{training}} at Southwestern, on a dance floor at the hotel. [...] "He appeared to be the sort of fellow we like to have on our team," [...] Brown said later in 1947. [...] "Then I watched him in that Tennessee game and after that made up my mind he'd be with my club if I <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> chance to make a deal for him." [...] The AAFC's Baltimore Colts selected Humble in the league's draft, but Brown got his chance in August. He engineered a trade that sent four players including quarterback Steve Nemeth and guard George Cheroke to the Colts, plus two players to be named later.|$|E
500|$|The {{season finale}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West wrote that it [...] "was hands {{down one of}} the most satisfying hours of television I have <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pleasure of watching," [...] explaining that it created [...] "entirely new dynamics" [...] for the fourth season, hit [...] "all major beats," [...] and had [...] "real story progression" [...] and heart. Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry declared that the episode was [...] "brilliantly written, acted, and well paced. It was filled with twists and turns that I didn’t see coming. And I know that it sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I’m being cliche but I don’t care. I am what I am – a full fledged Office addict who got exactly what she wanted, and in fact needed from the finale." [...] James Poniewozik of Time magazine voiced similar sentiments, believing the finale to be a [...] "good if not great season-ender, and if the conclusion didn't have the holy-crap factor of The Kiss last year, Pam’s closeup reaction to Jim’s return during her interview was–like everything Jenna Fischer does on this show–winning and sweet."

[...] Furthermore, most of the first season DVD reviews were positive towards the series as being one of the best American comedy shows. In a DVD review by Bill Treadway for DVD Verdict, he called the show [...] "the best animated American comedy since The Simpsons, it is a claim I stand behind." [...] Treadway said the show is [...] "accessible to all" [...] that [...] "adults will enjoy the witty satire and sly in-jokes subtly inserted into every episode." [...] He also mentioned that [...] "children will love the bright colors, spunky pace, and lively characters" [...] and that [...] "parents will {{not have to worry about}} violence or crude humor." [...] Jason Bovberg of DVD Talk called SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "the coolest Saturday morning cartoon since the heyday of Warner Bros." [...] In a separate review for the season's DVD release, Bovberg [...] "highly recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "I love the show so much, I can't see any way around giving this one a recommendation." [...] Bovberg was particular on the exclusion of the pilot episode [...] "Help Wanted", saying [...] "But why is 'Help Wanted' missing? I suppose I'll have to buy a [...] "theme" [...] disc down the road to secure that one. Sigh." [...] Furthermore, he described it as [...] "the only disappointment of the set." [...] Ron J. Epstein, also from DVD Talk, said that the character of SpongeBob is [...] "one of the strangest cartoon characters I have <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> pleasure to watch."

2500|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{debate over whether}} the remaining two ciphertexts are real or hoaxes. An early researcher, Carl Hammer of Sperry UNIVAC, used supercomputers of the late 1960s to analyze the ciphers and found that while the ciphers were poorly encoded, the two undeciphered ones did not show the patterns one would expect of randomly chosen numbers and probably encoded an intelligible text. Other questions remain about {{the authenticity of the}} pamphlet's account. In 1934, Dr. Clarence Williams, a researcher at the Library of Congress, said, [...] "To me, the pamphlet story has all the earmarks of a fake ... no evidence save the word of the unknown author of the pamphlet that he <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> papers." ...|$|E

The band had grievances with their manager Gerald Palmer, such as perceived lack of monies being received, and summoned him to a meeting at VHF Studios.

2500|$|Some {{critics argue}} that the {{prestige}} of the Prize in Economics derives in part from its association with the Nobel Prizes, an association that has often been a source of controversy.

He explained that [...] "Nobel despised people who cared more about profits than society's well-being", saying that [...] "There is nothing to indicate that he would have wanted such a prize", and that the association with the Nobel prizes is [...] "a PR coup by economists to improve their reputation".|$|E

Many of these have made a mockery of the soldier's oath of obedience to military orders. When it suits their purpose they say they had to obey; when confronted with Hitler's brutal crimes which are shown to have been within their general knowledge, they say they disobeyed. The truth is they actively participated in all these crimes, or sat silent and acquiescent, witnessing the commission of crimes on a scale larger and more shocking than the world has <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> misfortune to know." ...|$|E
