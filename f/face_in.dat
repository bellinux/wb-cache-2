40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} whether {{the detection of}} frontal, ¾, and profile face views differs from their categorization as <b>faces.</b> <b>In</b> Experiment 1, we compared three tasks that required observers to determine {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>face,</b> but varied <b>in</b> the extents to which participants had to search for the <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> simple displays and in small or large scenes to make this decision. Performance was equivalent for all of the <b>face</b> views <b>in</b> simple displays and small scenes, but it was notably slower for profile views when this required the search for <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> extended scene displays. This search effect was confirmed in Experiment 2, in which we compared observers’ eye movements with their response times to <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> visual scenes. These results demonstrate that the categorization of faces at fixation is dissociable from the detection of <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> space. Consequently, we suggest that face detection should be studied with extended visual displays, such as natural scenes...|$|R
