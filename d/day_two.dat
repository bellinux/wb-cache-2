5|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory {{court of}} the Diocese of Worcester issued a {{marriage}} licence on 27 November 1582. The next <b>day,</b> <b>two</b> of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once {{instead of the usual}} three times, and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.|$|E

When Gooch was last man out for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed to restrain the West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, but, with more than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, with more than a day to spare.|$|E
5|$|Indiana was {{the first}} of the country's western states to {{mobilize}} for the Civil War. When news reached Indiana of the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861, many Indiana residents were surprised, but their response was immediate. On the following <b>day,</b> <b>two</b> mass meetings were held in Indianapolis, the state capital of Indiana, and the state's position was decided: Indiana would remain in the Union and would immediately contribute men to suppress the rebellion. On April 15, Indiana's governor, Oliver P. Morton, issued a call for volunteer soldiers to meet the state's quota set by President Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|On October 18, 1952, Williams and Billie Jean Jones Eshlimar {{were married}} in Minden, Louisiana by a justice of the peace. It was the second {{marriage}} for both (each being divorced with children). The next <b>day</b> <b>two</b> public ceremonies were also held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium, where 14,000 seats were sold for each. After Williams' death, a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones Eshlimar's divorce had not become final until eleven days after she married Williams. Williams' first wife, Audrey, and his mother, Lillie Williams, were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid and pursued the matter for years. Williams had also married Audrey Sheppard before her divorce was final, on the tenth day of a required 60-day reconciliation period.|$|E
5|$|On September6, ships {{reported}} a tropical depression developing {{just off the}} west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal. The next day, a ship reported winds of 60mph (95km/h), or tropical storm status; on this basis, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on September6. However, lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real time as it moved generally westward across the Atlantic Ocean. On September10, the S.S. Commack first observed the storm about 900miles (1450km) to the east of Guadeloupe, which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship's radio. Later that <b>day,</b> <b>two</b> other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm, and the Hurricane Research Division estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18:00UTC on September10.|$|E

5|$|The Americans buried {{their dead}} and resumed the retreat, the Indians and British rangers {{pursuing}} and firing occasionally from at long range.

The Americans fell back more than , some on foot, before making camp. The next <b>day,</b> <b>two</b> American stragglers were captured and presumably killed before the Indians and rangers finally abandoned the chase. The main body of Americans reached Mingo Bottom on June 13. Many stragglers arrived in small groups for several days more. In all, about 70 Americans never returned from the expedition.|$|E
