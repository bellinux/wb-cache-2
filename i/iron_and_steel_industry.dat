5|$|However, despite Ohio's large {{presence}} in the iron and steel market, employment rates have declined in Ohio, generally attributed to weakening national economy. Between 1998 and 2005, the number of Ohio <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> workers decreased from 52,700 to 34,000. The Ohio Department of Development predicts the decreases will continue in coming years. The average annual salary for <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> workers in Ohio was $59,686, compared the national industry average of $53,352.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, the Sloss Furnaces were {{acquired}} by the U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company, and sold nearly two decades later in 1969 to the Jim Walter Corp. The Birmingham area had been suffering from a serious air pollution problem during the 1950s and 1960s due to the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> there, and Federal legislation such as the U.S. Clean Air Act encouraged the closure of older and out-of-date smelting works. Also, by the early 1960s, higher-yielding brown ores from other regions were feeding the blast furnaces.|$|E

25|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} in June 1864 that the Civil War might be coming to a close, employers attempted to cut wages. The union responded with a nationwide strike of its members, which lasted eight months. The strike ended on February 13, 1865, when the employers agreed to a wage scale based {{on the price of}} iron bars—the first time employers recognized the union, the first union contract in the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industry,</b> and what may be the first union contract of any kind in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 Edwards hit {{trouble with}} his party over its {{proposal}} to nationalise the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industry.</b> He spoke out against the proposal, based on his experience in the industry; which his local party felt was going back on election pledges to support it. In April 1948, the local party passed a resolution declaring that they had lost all confidence in him and calling on him to resign his seat. Edwards declared he would ignore the resolution. He intensified his criticism, describing the Civil service and efficiency as a contradiction in terms.|$|E
25|$|Primo de Rivera set his {{economic}} planners to building infrastructure for the country. Hydroelectric dams were constructed to provide water for irrigation {{and to bring}} electricity to some of Spain's rural regions. Spain had few cars {{when he came to}} power; by 1930, it possessed a network of automobile roads. His regime upgraded the country's railroads, helping the Spanish <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> to recover. Public works carried out in Málaga included the planning and creation of the Ciudad Jardín district and construction of the Gaitanejo reservoir (accomplished with private financing) in El Chorro.|$|E
50|$|Darkhill Ironworks, and the {{neighbouring}} Titanic Steelworks, are internationally important industrial remains {{associated with the}} development of the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industries.</b> Both are scheduled monuments.

Historically, Darkhill was sometimes written Dark Hill.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{production}} in Pennsylvania peaked in 1891, when other industries arose in Titusville. The <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industries</b> dominated {{the town in}} the early twentieth century with lumber eventually reclaiming its former cachet. Oil is still relevant, however.

50|$|Nigeria {{still holds}} large coal reserves, {{estimated}} {{to be at least}} 2 billion metric tons. The discovery of bituminous coal suitable for use in coke production for the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industries</b> opens up potential new domestic markets. With the loss of its largest domestic consumers, the NCC began exporting coal to Italy and the United Kingdom, as its low sulphur content is desirable.|$|R
25|$|The {{completion}} in 1856 of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad provided {{the impetus for}} the establishment of the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industry</b> in Newburgh by linking the mills to sources for raw materials, opening up regional markets for iron and steel, and for allowing Cleveland to serve as a transshipment center for iron ore to inland areas. That same year, the Grasselli Chemical Company opened on the Cuyahoga River (near the modern intersection of Broadway Avenue and E. 30th Street) to supply chemicals to the iron industry. Although Grasselli Chemicals was located outside the Union-Miles Park neighborhood, Czech and Polish immigrants, seeking work in the plant, began settling along Broadway Avenue nearby.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is at the}} {{junction}} of the Forth and Clyde and Union Canals, a location which proved key to it's growth as a centre of heavy industry during the Industrial Revolution. In {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, Falkirk was at the centre of the <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industry,</b> underpinned by the Carron Company in nearby Carron. The company was responsible for making carronades for the Royal Navy and later manufactured pillar boxes. Within the last fifty years, heavy industry has waned, and the economy relies increasingly on retail and tourism. Despite this, Falkirk remains the home of many international companies like Alexander Dennis; the largest bus production company in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham {{was founded}} in 1871, during the post-Civil War Reconstruction period, through the merger of three {{pre-existing}} farm towns, notably, former Elyton. It was named for Birmingham, England, the UK's second largest city and then major industrial city. The Alabama city annexed smaller neighbors and developed as an industrial and railroad transportation center, based on mining, the new <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> <b>industry,</b> and railroading. Most of the original settlers who founded Birmingham were of English ancestry. The city was developed {{as a place where}} cheap, non-unionized, and African-American labor from rural Alabama could be employed in the city's steel mills and blast furnaces, giving it a competitive advantage over unionized industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast.|$|E
50|$|During this time, {{the number}} of {{employees}} grew to approximately 4,000 people. An additional center of technology was built in Vienna and additional constructors from Austria as well as from other countries were flown in.
