5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and <b>from</b> <b>mother</b> to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E
5|$|In {{assisted}} reproductive technology, sperm washing is {{not necessary}} for males with hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk of transmission <b>from</b> <b>mother</b> to child with IVF {{is no different from}} the risk in spontaneous conception.|$|E
5|$|Syphilis is most {{commonly}} spread through sexual activity. It {{may also be}} transmitted <b>from</b> <b>mother</b> to baby during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in congenital syphilis. Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and bejel (subspecies endemicum). Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Hypothyroidism and gestational {{diabetes}} {{are common}} endocrine disorders in pregnancy. Our {{aim is to}} evaluate the outcome of newborns <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> with hypothyroidism and <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> with gestational diabetes. Patients and methods. The study analysed 216 newborns: 112 <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> with gestational diabetes and 104 <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> with hypothyroidism. For each case, we included as a control a newborn of same sex and gestational age <b>from</b> a <b>mother</b> without diabetes or thyreopathy. Results. In newborns <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> with gestational diabetes there was an increased frequency of hypoglycaemia and hypocalcaemia, of lower head circumference and of small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth or macrosomy (LGA) than controls. The newborns <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> with hypothyroidism are more frequently SGA or LGA {{and they have a}} slightly increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Conclusions. Newborns <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> with diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism have an increased risk of being SGA or LGA, and to develop a mild transient hypoglycaemia. Newborns <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> with diabetes mellitus have also an increased risk to develop hypocalcacmia and to have a lower head circumference than controls. Thus, to prevent SGA or LGA births, it is very important an early diagnosis and treatment, and a strict metabolic control of these conditions...|$|R

5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means <b>from</b> <b>mother</b> to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} via infected blood products and through organ donation. In countries such as Singapore, where dengue is endemic, the risk {{is estimated to be}} between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 transfusions. Vertical transmission (<b>from</b> <b>mother</b> to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively infrequent, despite dengue emerging in new regions in recent decades.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and <b>from</b> <b>mother</b> to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E

5|$|In {{all human}} {{cultures}} premastication/kiss-feeding or kissing {{between mother and}} infant has been observed in all with kissing {{believed to be a}} socially ritualized form of feeding premasticated food. There is high similarity in the execution of kiss-feeding and human kisses (e.g. French kiss); in the former, the tongue is used to push food <b>from</b> <b>mother</b> to child with the child receiving both the mother's food and tongue in sucking movements, and the latter simply forgoes the premasticated food. In fact, observations across various species and cultures confirms that the act of kissing and premastication have most likely evolved from the similar relationship-based feeding behaviours.|$|E
5|$|EarthBound, {{known in}} Japan as , is a {{role-playing}} video game published by Nintendo for the Super NES video game console in 1994. Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka reprised their roles <b>from</b> <b>Mother</b> as composers for the game, and {{were joined by}} assistant composers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno. In an interview with Weekly Famitsu, Keiichi Suzuki commented on how the SNES gave the composers much more freedom to compose what they wanted than the NES, which made development of the music for EarthBound much easier than for its predecessor. This freedom was partially {{a result of the}} larger memory space available, because one of the many problems the composers had in the first game was trying to get all of their music on to the cartridge. Another advantage was that the SNES could support playing eight notes at the same time, which when combined with the increased sound quality meant that he could compose music for the game in a similar fashion to how he would compose music for real life. Suzuki cited John Lennon as an influential figure to all the composers while the soundtrack was being developed, as his songs about love matched up with the feeling of the game. Critics and players have noted similarities between parts of some songs in the game to popular songs, including several suspected homages to songs by Lennon and The Beatles. Legal issues surrounding these similarities were suspected to prevent the game from being released on the Virtual Console outside of Japan, but the rumors were ultimately proved untrue.|$|E

40|$|Catecholaminergic {{polymorphic}} {{ventricular tachycardia}} (CPVT) {{is one of}} the causes of sudden cardiac death in young people and results from RYR 2 mutations in ~ 60 % of CPVT patients. The inheritance of the RYR 2 mutations follows an autosomal dominant trait, however, de novo mutations are often identified during familial analysis. In 36 symptomatic CPVT probands with RYR 2 mutations, we genotyped their parents and confirmed the origin of the respective mutation. In 26 sets of proband and both parents (trio), we identified 17 de novo mutations (65. 4 %), seven <b>from</b> their <b>mothers</b> and only two mutations were inherited from their fathers. Among nine sets of proband and mother, five mutations were inherited <b>from</b> <b>mothers.</b> Four other mutations were of unknown origin. The inheritance of RYR 2 mutations was significantly more frequent <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> (n = 12, 34. 3 %) than fathers (n = 2, 5. 7 %) (P = 0. 013). The mean ages of onset were not significantly different in probands between de novo mutations and those <b>from</b> <b>mothers.</b> Thus, half of the RYR 2 mutations in our cohort were de novo, and most of the remaining mutations were inherited <b>from</b> <b>mothers.</b> These data would be useful for family analysis and risk stratification of the disease...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the rates of}} congenital and perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection among infants born to mothers infected with HIV compared with infants born to mothers not infected with HIV from a CMV-immune, low-income population. Study design: A total of 325 newborns <b>from</b> CMV-seropositive <b>mothers</b> were enrolled and evaluated for congenital CMV infection (150 infants <b>from</b> HIV+ <b>mothers</b> and 175 infants <b>from</b> HIV- <b>mothers.</b> A total of 101 infants <b>from</b> HIV+ <b>mothers</b> and 33 infants <b>from</b> HIV- <b>mothers</b> were evaluated for perinatal CMV infection. the virus was isolated from urine by culture in human fibroblasts and was detected by polymerase chain reaction at birth and at 15 days and 12 weeks of age. Results: Only 13 of 150 HIV+ mothers (8. 7 %) had an AIDS-defining condition, and none had a late-stage HIV infection. Congenital CMV infection was detected in 4 of 150 (2. 7 %) infants <b>from</b> HIV+ <b>mothers</b> and in 5 of 175 (2. 9 %) infants <b>from</b> HIV- <b>mothers</b> (p = 1. 00). Perinatal CMV infection was diagnosed in 8 of 101 (7. 9 %) infants <b>from</b> HIV+ <b>mothers</b> and in 13 of 33 (39. 4 %) infants <b>from</b> HIV- <b>mothers</b> (p < 0. 00001). Most infants (93. 3 %) <b>from</b> HIV- <b>mothers</b> and only 5. 9 % of infants <b>from</b> HIV+ <b>mothers</b> were breastfed. Conclusions: CMV coinfection in mothers without advanced HIV disease from a CMV-immune population does not enhance the likelihood of congenital CMV infection. Perinatal CMV transmission <b>from</b> HIV-infected <b>mothers</b> may be decreased by avoiding breastfeeding. Further studies on mothers with late-stage HIV infection are needed.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} role of antibodies against both recombinant Ro (r-Ro) and La (r-La) proteins and polypeptides derived from the recombinant La protein in predicting fetal and neonatal outcome in children at risk to develop neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). All sera were obtained in the perinatal period and quantitative ELISA assays were used. We collected 41 maternal sera within 2 months of delivery {{of a child with}} NLE (21 with congenital heart disease block (CHB) and 20 with dermatologic NLE) and 19 sera from anti-Ro and/or anti-La antibody-positive mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who delivered a child without NLE. All sera were tested for anti-r-La and anti-r-Ro antibodies by ELISA, and most sera were tested for antibodies directed against La polypeptides by immunoblot. We found significantly higher anti-r-La antibody levels in the sera <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> of children with NLE compared with sera <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> of unaffected children (0. 67 +/- 0. 43 versus 0. 14 +/- 0. 30; P < 0. 0001). There was a statistically significant difference in the mean anti-r-La levels between the sera of mothers of children with CHB compared with dermatologic NLE (0. 51 +/- 0. 45 versus 0. 83 +/- 0. 37 respectively; P = 0. 0091). When we examined antibodies directed against the recombinant 52 -kD Ro protein, there was a statistically significant elevation of titres in the sera of mothers of NLE children (0. 77 +/- 0. 35) compared with non-NLE mothers (0. 29 +/- 0. 39; P < 0. 0001). There was no difference in the r-Ro levels between mothers of children with dermatologic NLE compared with CHB (0. 82 +/- 0. 37 versus 0. 71 +/- 0. 74; P = 0. 32). When we examined polypeptides derived from the recombinant La protein, the mean number of polypeptides recognized by sera <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> of children with NLE was significantly higher than the mean number of polypeptides recognized by sera <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> of unaffected children (5. 1 +/- 0. 54 versus 2. 3 +/- 0. 54 respectively; P < 0. 001). More importantly, when we examined the individual polypeptides, we found that only sera <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> of children with NLE and not <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> of unaffected children recognized a polypeptide designated DD (30 % versus 0 %, respectively). These studies indicate that the autoantibody response to the Ro/La particle can differentiate sera <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> of children with NLE and sera <b>from</b> <b>mothers</b> of unaffected children. Furthermore, there was a difference in the anti-La autoantibody response between mothers of children with CHB and dermatologic NLE. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
