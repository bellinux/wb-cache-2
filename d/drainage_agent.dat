He refused GC therapy in the postoperative period due to non-haematological adverse events, including general malaise. Alternatively, tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (S- 1) was administered for 1  year after surgery. The treatment regimen consisted of 6 -week cycles, in which 80  mg/m 2 of oral S- 1 per day was given for 4  weeks and no chemotherapy was given for the following 2  weeks. There were no adverse events associated with S- 1. The patient has been alive and without disease for 6  years after the second surgery.|$|R
40|$|Glaucoma is {{the most}} common cause of {{irreversible}} blindness worldwide. This neurodegenerative disease becomes more prevalent with aging, but predisposing genetic and environmental factors also contribute to increased risk. Emerging evidence now suggests that epigenetics may also be involved, which provides potential new therapeutic targets. These three factors work through several pathways, including TGF-β, MAP kinase, Rho kinase, BDNF, JNK, PI- 3 /Akt, PTEN, Bcl- 2, Caspase, and Calcium-Calpain signaling. Together, these pathways result in the upregulation of proapoptotic gene expression, the downregulation of neuroprotective and prosurvival factors, and the generation of fibrosis at the trabecular meshwork, which may block aqueous humor <b>drainage.</b> Novel therapeutic <b>agents</b> targeting these pathway members have shown preliminary success in animal models and even human trials, demonstrating that they may eventually be used to preserve retinal neurons and vision...|$|R

40|$|Pleural empyema is a {{frequent}} complication of bacterial pneumonia in childhood but is rare in neonates. Various modalities of treatment from intravenous antibiotics, chest tube <b>drainage,</b> intrapleural fibrinolytic <b>agent</b> installation, video-assisted thoracostomy to surgical decortication have been suggested to treat different stages of empyema in children, but management of progressive empyema in neonates is still at the stage of antimicrobial therapy and tube thoracostomy. Here, we report a 1 -month-old infant with staphy-lococcal pneumonia complicated with multiloculated empyema who was successfully treated with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after 4 days of chest tube drainage and parenteral antibiotics. The patient's condition improved rapidly after the operation and the antimicrobial therapy was continued for 3 weeks. He was asymptomatic and thriving at follow-up 1 year later. Chest radiography at 1 month was free of any lesion. This case suggests that VATS can be a safe and effective treatment for neonatal empyema...|$|R
40|$|Child’s body is very {{sensitive}} {{to the effects of}} various contagiums, toxins, chemical agents as well as psychological stress [1]. Enhanced antigenous load on the child’s body under the modern ecological, economic and social conditions changed the course of lots of diseases. Firstly nowadays the negative moments in the child’s health are high rate of combined pathologies of organs and systems, increased occurrence of firstly diagnosed allergic states, distribution of diseases associated with acute or chronic endotoxemia [2]. That is why it is of great importance to direct therapeutic and preventive efforts of pediatricians to minimize the effect of negative endogenous factors on a child’s body [1].

40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: Necrotizing {{pneumonia}} {{used to be}} rare in the postantibiotic era. Its incidence {{appears to}} be rising in our hospital {{although there is no}} clear explanation for that. Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the clinical presentation and evolution of necrotizing pneumonia in previously healthy children admitted at our hospital during two years. Results: Among 392 admissions for pneumonia in the study period, 15 patients (3, 4 – 2, 4 years; 9 boys) had evidence of lung necrosis on thoracic computed tomography. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, fever persisted for 13 – 7 days. Ten patients deve loped pneumatoceles and three lung abscesses. Twelve patients had parapneumonic pleural effusions (4 empyemas), nine of whom need closed chest <b>drainage.</b> An <b>agent</b> was isolated from pleural fluid or blood culture in 3 children (2 S. aureus and 1 Enterobacter cloacae); in two further, bacteria were seen on Gram-stained pleural fluid. Two patients had an immunodefficiency state previously unknown (IgA deficiency and hiper-IgE syndrome). Thoracotomy were performed in 9 patients: 2 pleural debridement, 6 decortication, 1 ressection of a giant pneumatocele, 1 abscess drainage and 2 lobectomies. The mean length of hospital stay was 30 – 11 days and there were no deaths. During the follow-up period (18 – 9 months) 3 patients required surgery for recurrent infection or fibrothorax. In the remaining, asymptomatic children, 2 have pleural ticknening, 1 a residual pneumatocele and 1 bronchiectasis. Conclusions: The results of this study do not explain the recent increase of the suppurative complications of community acquired-pneumonia in children. The low rate of infectious agent isolation was probably related with frequent previous antibiotic use. Although the final outcome was generally good, the clinical course was very prolonged and surgery was frequently needed. In order to clarify the reason for the increase of this kind of pneumonia complications a prospective multicenter study is warranted. REV PORT PNEUMOL 2002; VIII (1) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Image-guided {{percutaneous}} <b>drainage</b> with antimicrobial <b>agents</b> is {{the standard}} modality of treatment of liver abscess. Open surgical drainage, and lately laparoscopic drainage becomes useful in selected patients. Nigeria is awakening late to the laparoscopic surgery revolution. Public health institutions have started making enormous investments in minimal access surgery, which can augment deficient diagnostic capacities. Objective: To describe the outcomes of the patients who underwent laparoscopic liver abscess drainage at the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of the laparoscopic liver abscess drainage procedures done between the period September 2007 and December 2012 was done. Results: A total of eight patients in the study period were worked up for abscess surgical drainage based on ultrasound (seven cases) and computed tomography (one case) supported localized collection in the liver. Intraoperatively, one patient was noticed to have nodules on the liver that was later confirmed as hepatocellular carcinoma. Operating time ranged from 37 to 126 min. There was no conversion to open surgery. On the follow-up, one patient had residual abscess of 45 mm diameter size, after 6 weeks, and in whose aspirate acid-fast bacilli were identified.

40|$|Background Dominant venous sinus {{drainage}} of {{the brain}} is a common anatomic characteristic. Cortical venous partial retention that is due to slow non-dominant venous sinus drainage can increase local cerebral vein pressure, and cause related neurological impairment. This article is to investigate the diagnosis of local intracranial hypertension caused by abnormal non-dominant transverse sinus drainage {{and the effect of}} anticoagulation treatment. Methods From February 2008 to February 2016, there were 12 patients diagnosed as abnormal cerebral non-dominant transverse sinus drainage. Among these patients, 8 patients presented as dizziness and brain swelling; 2 presented as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH); one presented as cerebral cortex bleeding; 2 presented as blurred vision; 2 presented as ipsilateral pulsatile tinnitus; one presented as narcolepsy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of 2 patients were > 280 mm H 2 O. Nine patients were confirmed no abnormal characteristics by MRI. In DSA examination, 10 patients were confirmed non-dominant transverse sinus <b>drainage</b> and contrast <b>agent</b> retention on the left side, and 2 patients were confirmed on the right side. All patients were treated by anticoagulation, and 2 underwent stent implantation, 5 underwent thrombolysis through carotid artery. Results All patients were greatly improved after 7 -day treatment. They were discharged within 2 weeks and were continuously treated by anticoagulation after discharge for one year. There was no recurrence or aggravation in all patients during the follow-up period ranging from 6 to 34 months. Two patients were confirmed less contrast agent retention by DSA after 6 months.   Conclusions Abnormal non-dominant transverse sinus drainage can increase local cerebral vein pressure, and presents non-specific clinical features such as dizziness, headache or tinnitus. Anticoagulation, thrombolysis or stent implantation can promote local cerebral venous drainage, relieve potential blood stasis and edema in the brain, and improve clinical symptoms.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2016. 12. 004 </p...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{refractory}} sinusitis is {{a common}} feature in patients with primary immunodeficiencies. The efficacy of standard therapeutic strategies is questionable. In an open trial we evaluated the efficacy of azithromycin, N-acetylcysteine and topical intranasal beclomethasone (100 μg twice daily for 6 weeks) in 16 patients with primary immunodeficiencies (median age 13. 5 years, range 5 – 32 years). All patients suffered from chronic sinusitis despite regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy every 3 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed before and after 6 weeks of treatment to evaluate morphological changes in the paranasal sinuses. Nasal swabs and washings were taken for microbial analysis and measurement of inflammatory mediators (IL- 8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP)) before and post therapy. Inflammatory mediators in nasal secretions were significantly elevated in patients: IL- 8 median 2436 pg/ml (range 441 – 5435 pg/ml), TNF-α 37. 3 pg/ml (3. 75 – 524 pg/ml) and ECP 33 ng/ml (1. 5 – 250 ng/ml) versus age-matched healthy controls: IL- 8 median 212 pg/ml (99 – 825 pg/ml), TNF-α 3. 77 pg/ml (2. 8 – 10. 2 pg/ml) and ECP 1. 5 ng/ml (1. 5 – 14. 8 ng/ml) (P < 0. 0001). Inflammation of the maxillary sinuses was confirmed by MRI scans in all patients, additionally infection of the ethmoidal and frontal sinuses was recorded in five patients. Bacterial growth appeared in 11 out of 16 cultures. In spite of therapy, no improvement in sinal inflammation visualized by MRI was achieved. Moreover, no significant decrease in pathogens and levels of inflammatory mediators could be detected (IL- 8 1141 pg/ml, 426 – 4556 pg/ml; TNF-α 13. 9 pg/ml, 4. 1 – 291. 6 pg/ml; ECP 32. 3 ng/ml, 3. 7 – 58. 4 ng/ml). Our results demonstrate that conventional management of sinusitis is of little benefit in patients with chronic refractory sinusitis with an underlying immunodeficiency.

Recentemente tem-se assistido no nosso hospital ao acrÃ©scimo da incidÃªncia destas complicaÃ§Ãµes nÃ£o sendo claro o motivo que lhe estÃ¡ subjacente. Material e MÃ©todos: Estudo retrospectivo dos casos de pneumonias necrosantes em crianÃ§as com menos de 13 anos de idade e previamente saudÃ¡veis, ocorridos num perÃ­odo de 2 anos num hospital terciÃ¡rio. Carac-terizaÃ§Ã£o clÃ­nica, imagiolÃ³gica e microbiolÃ³gica e da evoluÃ§Ã£o no internamento e apÃ³s alta. Resultados: Entre as 392 crianÃ§as internadas por pneumonia no perÃ­odo do estudo, 15 crianÃ§as (3, 4 â 2, 4 anos; 9 rapazes) sem doenÃ§a prÃ©via conhecida apresentavam evidÃªncia de necrose pulmonar na TAC pulmonar. Apesar da antibioticoterapia, a febre persistiu 13 â 7 dias. Dez doentes desenvolveram pneumatocelos e 3 abcessos pulmonares. Doze doentes apresentavam derrames pleurais associados, tendo nove deles necessitado de drenagem torÃ¡cica. Foi isolado o agente infectante em 3 doentes (2 Â S. aureus e 1 Enterobacter cloacae). ConclusÃµes: Os resultados encontrados nÃ£o permitem esclarecer o aumento recente das pneumonias necrosantes. A baixa taxa de isolamento do agente infeccioso implicado poderÃ¡ estar relacionada com o frequente uso prÃ©vio de antibiÃ³ticos. As imunodeficiÃªncias primÃ¡rias deverÃ£o ser sempre pesquisadas nas pneumonias graves mesmo em crianÃ§as previamente saudÃ¡veis. Apesar da evoluÃ§Ã£o clÃ­nica arrastada e da frequente necessidade de toracotomia, o resultado final foi bom na maioria dos doentes.
