No major adverse reactions occurred after the injection of <b>iobitridol</b> 300. Excluding a heat sensation, 5 of the patients who received <b>iobitridol</b> had minor reactions consisting of nausea with vomiting and pain during the injection.

40|$|PURPOSE: The regular {{distribution}} {{in space and}} the stability in time of the hydrophilic sphere surrounding <b>iobitridol</b> were investigated. This is a novel yet important concept {{in the design of}} polyiodinated contrast agents since such a sphere is meant to hide their hydrophobic core and thus prevent hydrophobic interactions with biomacromolecules and hence chemotoxicity. METHODS: The methods used were experimental (HPLC, 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy) and computational (calculation of conformational behavior and molecular electrostatic potentials). RESULTS: <b>Iobitridol</b> exists as a mixture of stereoisomers due to hindered rotation around several bonds. High-temperature molecular dynamics established the existence between 0 and 15 kcal/mol of 238 conformers belonging to 14 classes. Most of these conformers have an inaccessible hydrophobic core, and variable temperature molecular dynamics confirmed that the hydrophilic sphere around <b>iobitridol</b> is stable against external disruption. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that <b>iobitridol</b> fulfils the physicochemical and structural criteria believed to render a polyiodinated contrast agent inert toward interacting with biomacromolecules...|$|E
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} non-inferiority of <b>iobitridol</b> 350 for coronary CT angiography (CTA) {{compared to}} higher iodine content contrast media regarding rate of patients evaluable {{for the presence}} of coronary artery stenoses. In this multicentre trial, 452 patients were randomized to receive <b>iobitridol</b> 350, iopromide 370 or iomeprol 400 and underwent coronary CTA using CT systems with 64 -detector rows or more. Two core lab readers assessed 18 coronary segments per patient regarding image quality (score 0 = non diagnostic to 4 = excellent quality), vascular attenuation, signal and contrast to noise ratio (SNR, CNR). Patients were considered evaluable if no segment had a score of 0. Per-patient, the rate of fully evaluable CT scans was 92. 1, 95. 4 and 94. 6  % for <b>iobitridol,</b> iopromide and iomeprol, respectively. Non-inferiority of <b>iobitridol</b> over the best comparator was demonstrated with a 95  % CI of the difference of [- 8. 8 to 2. 1], with a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of - 10  %. Although average attenuation increased with higher iodine concentrations, average SNR and CNR did not differ between groups. With current CT technology, <b>iobitridol</b> 350  mg iodine/ml is not inferior to contrast media with higher iodine concentrations in terms of image quality for coronary stenosis assessment. • Iodine concentration is an important parameter for image quality in coronary CTA. • Contrast enhancement must be balanced against the amount of iodine injected. • <b>Iobitridol</b> 350 is non-inferior compared to CM with higher iodine concentrations. • Higher attenuation with higher iodine concentrations, but no SNR or CNR differences...|$|E
40|$|<b>Iobitridol</b> is a tri-iodinated {{contrast}} agent, and neurotoxicologic {{studies of}} the intracisternal administration are scarce and inconclusive. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the neurotoxicity of <b>iobitridol</b> with iohexol, by intracisternal administration in Wistar rats, for a pre-clinical evaluation of its use as a myelographic agent. The animals, a total of 75, were divided into three experimental groups, <b>iobitridol,</b> iohexol and cerebral artificial fluid (control group), with 25 animals per group. Then, these were divided into five subgroups of five animals each, and given doses of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg kg- 1, while the control group received the equivalent volumes of contrast media tested. The animals were evaluated after 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min of intracisternal administration of these substances, for signs of depression and excitement, tactile palmar grasp, flexor, extensor, palpebral, papillary and pinna reflexes, surface righting and placing reactions, and with an auditory startle test. The evaluations were assessed daily for seven days with these parameters and their body weight, food, and water intake were also measured. There were no statistically significant differences between groups tested with respect to any of the evaluated parameters. In other words, in this animal model, the <b>iobitridol</b> demonstrated a low neurotoxicologic potential, comparable to that observed with iohexol. Further study with dogs and cats, as an alternative, is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Background : Contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} (CIN) is {{an acute}} complication associated with iodinated radiographic contrast agents. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant agent, {{has often been}} used to prevent CIN; however, reports of its efficacy are conflicting. In the kidney, mitochondrial dysfunction {{has been associated with}} acute and chronic ischemic and nephrotoxic injury. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of NAC on oxygen consumption in mitochondria isolated from rat kidneys exposed to a radiographic contrast agent. Methods : Four groups of Wistar rats were evaluated including a control group. The experimental groups were injected intraperitoneally with: 5 mL/kg of body weight of <b>iobitridol</b> (300 mg/mL); NAC (100 mL/kg at 24, 12 and 2 hours prior to saline infusion); and NAC prior to an infusion of 300 mg/mL of <b>iobitridol.</b> Twenty minutes after the intraperitoneal infusion of the contrast agent or saline, all the animals were sacrificed and their kidneys were collected. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically in the sediment containing principally mitochondria. Results : Mean oxygen consumption was 14. 8 % higher in the group exposed to <b>iobitridol</b> compared to the control group. Pretreatment with NAC before the <b>iobitridol</b> infusion inhibited the increase in mean oxygen consumption (p 0. 05).   Conclusion : The findings of the present study confirm a certain protective effect of NAC in rat kidneys exposed to an iodinated radiographic contrast medium. </p...|$|E

BackgroundRecent {{data support}} that iodixanol, an iso-osmolality contrast agent, is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolality contrast agents when hydration {{is the only}} prophylactic strategy used. We evaluated the nephrotoxicity of iso- and low-osmolality contrast agents with prophylactic administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) along with hydration. MethodsTwo hundred and twenty-five patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1. 5 mg/dL or an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2), referred to our institution for coronary and/or peripheral procedures, were assigned to receive low-osmolality (<b>iobitridol</b> group; N = 115) or iso-osmolality (iodixanol group; N = 110) contrast dye. In all cases prophylactic administration of 0. 45 % saline intravenously and NAC (1200 mg orally twice daily) was used. ResultsBaseline creatinine levels were similar in the 2 groups [iobitridol group = 1. 70 (IQR: 1. 54 - 1. 98) mg/dL; iodixanol group = 1. 73 (IQR: 1. 56 - 2. 00) mg/dL, P = 0. 33]. The risk score for contrast nephrotoxicity was 5. 0 ± 1. 6 in the <b>iobitridol</b> group versus 5. 0 ± 1. 8 in the iodixanol group (P = 0. 44). Increase of at least 0. 5 mg/dL of the creatinine concentration 48 hours after the procedure occurred in 4 / 115 patients (3. 5 %) in the <b>iobitridol</b> group and 3 / 110 patients (2. 7 %) in the iodixanol group (P = 1. 00; OR 0. 78; 95 % CI 0. 17 - 3. 56). Amount of contrast media administration was similar in the 2 groups (<b>iobitridol</b> group = 167 ± 90 mL; iodixanol group = 164 ± 82 mL; P = 0. 61).

40|$|A {{reliable}} assessment of relevant substance flows {{is very important}} for environmental risk assessments and efficiency analysis of measures to reduce or avoid emissions of micropollutants like drugs to water systems. Accordingly, a detailed preparation of monitoring campaigns should include an accuracy check for the sampling configuration to prove the reliability of the monitoring results and the subsequent data processing. The accuracy of substance flow analyses is expected to be particularly weak for substances having high short-term variations of concentrations in sewage. This is especially the case linked to the observation of substance flows close to source in waste water systems. The verification of a monitoring configuration in a hospital sewer in Luxembourg is in the centre of interest of the case study presented here. A tracer test in the sewer system under observation is an essential element of the suggested accuracy check and provides valuable information for an uncertainty analysis. The results illustrate the importance of accuracy checks as an essential element of the preparation of monitoring campaigns. Moreover the study shows that continuous flow proportional sampling enables a representative observation of short-term peak loads of the iodinated x-ray contrast media <b>iobitridol</b> close to source...|$|E
40|$|Near-infrared (NIR) -absorbing metal-based {{nanomaterials}} {{have shown}} tremendous potential for cancer therapy, given their facile and controllable synthesis, efficient photothermal conversion, capability of spatiotemporal-controlled drug delivery, and intrinsic imaging function. Tantalum (Ta) {{is among the}} most biocompatible metals and arouses negligible adverse biological responses in either oxidized or reduced forms, and thus Ta-derived nanomaterials represent promising candidates for biomedical applications. However, Ta-based nanomaterials by themselves have not been explored for NIR-mediated photothermal ablation therapy. In this work, an innovative Ta-based multifunctional nanoplatform composed of biocompatible tantalum sulfide (TaS 2) nanosheets (NSs) is reported for simultaneous NIR hyperthermia, drug delivery, and computed tomography (CT) imaging. The TaS 2 NSs exhibit multiple unique features including (i) efficient NIR light-to-heat conversion with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 39 %, (ii) high drug loading (177 % by weight), (iii) controlled drug release triggered by NIR light and moderate acidic pH, (iv) high tumor accumulation via heat-enhanced tumor vascular permeability, (v) complete tumor ablation and negligible side effects, and (vi) comparable CT imaging contrast efficiency to the widely clinically used agent <b>iobitridol.</b> It is expected that this multifunctional NS platform can serve as a promising candidate for imaging-guided cancer therapy and selection of cancer patients with high tumor accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Interstitial {{collagen}} {{formation and}} {{transformation of the}} fenestrated hepatic sinusoids into continuous capillaries are major ultrastructural changes that occur in liver cirrhosis and fibrosis. These modifications lead to progressive restriction of blood-liver exchanges. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the permeability changes in a model of hepatic fibrosis by using dynamic computed tomography (CT) enhanced with contrast agents of different molecular masses. Dynamic single-section CT of the liver was performed after intravenous bolus administration of a low-molecular-mass contrast agent (<b>iobitridol)</b> and an experimental high-molecular-mass agent (P 840) in normal control rabbits and in rabbits with hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic, aortic and portal venous time-density curves were fitted with a dual-input one-compartmental model to calculate the hepatic mean transit time and distribution volume of the contrast agents. In the rabbits with liver fibrosis, the mean transit time of the high-molecular-mass agent was shorter {{than that of the}} low-molecular-mass agent (10. 0 +/- 1. 8 s and 12. 0 +/- 1. 2 s respectively; P< 0. 05). The distribution volume accessible to the high-molecular-mass agent was also smaller (22. 2 +/- 4. 8 % compared with 32. 0 +/- 6. 7 %; P< 0. 01). In the normal rabbits, the mean transit times of the high- and low-molecular-mass agents did not differ significantly, and nor did their distribution volumes. Our results demonstrate decreased sinusoidal permeability for the high-molecular-mass agent P 840 in a model of hepatic fibrosis. Non-invasive assessment of permeability changes in liver fibrosis can be performed with dynamic CT and contrast agents of different molecular masses...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Solutions {{of iodine}} {{contrast}} media (CM) used for selective coronary arteriography (CA) should have minimal propensity to cause ventricular fibrillation (VF). Commonly used CM for CA are nonionic monomers or dimers. PURPOSE: To compare VF propensity of ready-to-use solutions of one nonionic dimer, iodixanol, and five nonionic monomers, <b>iobitridol,</b> iopamidol, iomeprol, iopromide, and ioversol. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty milliliters of each CM was {{injected into the}} left coronary artery (LCA) through an inflated balloon catheter (0. 5 ml/s) in 14 pigs; the longest period of injection was 40 s. If VF occurred before 40 s, the injection was stopped and the heart was defibrillated. After VF, there was a delay of 40 min before the next injection. Hemodynamic parameters and vector electrocardiography (VECG) were monitored. A CM with a lower frequency of VF and a longer period between start of injection and start of VF was considered to have a lower VF propensity. RESULTS: Following 14 injections, {{each of the five}} nonionic monomers caused 14 VF, whereas iodixanol caused three VF (P< 0. 01). When VF occurred after iodixanol, it occurred later than after the other CM (P< 0. 001). Iodixanol caused less prolongation in QRS time (P< 0. 01) and QTc time (P< 0. 05) than the other CM. Prolongations in QRS and QTc times caused by CM parallel the VF propensities of the CM. CONCLUSION: Ready-to-use solutions of the dimer iodixanol have lower VF propensity than solutions of the five monomeric CM. This is related {{to the fact that the}} solutions of the dimer iodixanol have lower osmolality, higher viscosity, and higher concentrations of NaCl and CaCl 2 than solutions of the five monomers...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of the {{nitric oxide}} {{production}} in rat renal artery smooth muscle cells culture exposed to radiocontrast agents. BackgroundRadiocontrast agents (RC), substances largely used in diagnostic procedures, present the nephrotoxicity {{as one of}} its major side effects, which could be due to an altered synthesis of vasodilators. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the nitric oxide (NO) production in rat renal artery smooth muscle cells primary culture (rVSMC) exposed to RC. MethodsThe cells were treated for 72 hours with mannitol at 10 % (MT 10; 600 mOsm/kg H 2 O) or 35 % (MT 35; 2100 mOsm/kg H 2 O), with the nonionic <b>iobitridol</b> (IBT), the low-osmolality ioxaglate (IXG), the high-osmolality ioxitalamate (IXT), the nonionic, iso-osmolar iodixanol (IDX), and with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We determined the NO and osmolality in the cell culture media and the cellular viability. ResultsBy the Griess and chemiluminescence methods, the NO was not different in MT 10 and IDX, but decreased in MT 35, IBT, IXG, and IXT when compared with the control; it was increased in LPS and also decreased in all RC+LPS when compared with LPS. MT 35, IXT, and IXT+LPS decreased the cellular viability, and the media osmolality was increased in MT 35 and IXT compared with the control. ConclusionThe RC (except IDX) significantly reduced NO in rVSMC, which was more pronounced after IXT treatment (57. 3 %). This was not related to the reduced cell viability (15. 8 %) or to its high osmolality, because in MT 35, with similar osmolality as IXT, NO decreased only 11. 0 % relatively to the control.

40|$|In {{computed}} tomography extracellular low-molecular contrast media containing iodine which are quickly excreted renally are used overwhelmingly nowadays as intravenous contrast media. The commercially available X-ray contrast media {{for clinical use}} frequently lead only to a short-term increase in contrast. A new approach for improvement {{could be seen in}} the use of blood-pool contrast media with longer dwell time in the vascular system. The basis of the experimental studies described in this paper was the hypothesis that the application of P 743 leads to increased and prolonged liver tumour contrast in comparison to injection of a conventional X-ray contrast medium (<b>iobitridol).</b> The examinations were made on two tumour models differing both in growth and in degree of malignity, on one hand the Novikoff hepatoma and on the other the CC 531 colon adenocarcinoma. The macromolecule P 743 is an innovative blood-pool contrast medium containing iodine with high molecular weight (12908) and large diameter (5 nm). This was compared with an extracellular low-molecular (molecular weight: 835, diameter: 1. 5 nm) monomer X-ray contrast medium containing iodine (<b>iobitridol,</b> Guerbet/France). The examinations of both contrast media took place each case in four different dosages (150 / 225 / 300 / 600 mg iodine/kg), on a Philips CT scanner (SR 7000). Both contrast media were applied in the same iodine dosages in each case. At a tube voltage of 100 KV and a current of 125 mAs the scans were taken at the following intervals: 30 scans every 4 seconds, then 16 scans in 5 -second intervals and the last 25 scans in a 60 -second interval. After intravenous application the macromolecule led to a longer lasting and stronger liver tumour contrast. In the case of the CC 531 colon adenocarcinoma, half-value periods up to 439 s (600 mg iodine/kg) could be measured for the macromolecule P 743 in the aorta, in comparison to 108 s (600 mg iodine/kg) for the monomer. In the Novikoff model as well, the macromolecule shows a longer dwell time in the vascular system, with 287 s (600 mg iodine/kg) compared with 58 s (600 mg iodine/kg) for the monomer. The liver tumour contrast of the colon adenocarcinoma was 75 higher (+ 159 HU) with the macromolecule in comparison to the monomer (+ 70 HU). Also for the Novikoff hepatoma a stronger liver tumour contrast (+ 102 HU) was shown for the colon adenocarcinoma with the macromolecule compared with the monomer (+ 49 HU). The macromolecule showed dose-dependent contrasting in both types of tumour. With the monomer the contrast in the colon adenocarcinoma model decreased again at 600 mg iodine/kg. In the case of the Novikoff hepatoma no dose-dependent contrasting could be found. For the macromolecule P 743 liver tumour contrast half-value periods up to 389 s (600 mg iodine/kg) could be measured for the CC 531 colon adenocarcinoma in comparison to a maximum of 98 s (225 mg iodine/kg) with the monomer. The maximum half-value periods (liver tumour contrast) for the Novikoff hepatoma were 256 s with the macromolecule (300 mg iodine/kg), compared with 76 s (600 mg iodine/kg) with the monomer. It can be stated as result that the administration of the macromolecule led to strengthened and prolonged contrasting in both tumours compared with the lower contrasting by the monomer. After intravenous application of both contrast media, the CC 531 colon adenocarcinoma shows a higher liver tumour contrast than the Novikoff hepatoma. This can be justified in that the Novikoff hepatoma grows more aggressively and higher vascular permeability leads to a stronger inflow in the tumour than for the CC 531 colon adenocarcinoma. The exact mechanism by which the macromolecule leads to strengthened and prolonged liver tumour contrasting cannot be clarified unequivocally with this study. Probably the increased dwell time in the vessel is caused by the reduced osmolarity-induced movement of extracellular fluid in the blood-pool compartment, as well as by slowed down extravasion of the macromolecule (polymer) from the vascular system. For the named reasons the macromolecule appears to be more suitable for computed tomographic display of liver tumours and can thus be viewed as a new approach for tumour diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|Aim. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use in vivo PET/CT imaging as a validation tool for a novel human colorectal carcinoma model being developed in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). For this initial pilot study a cell line modeling colon cancer was selected and imaged using [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Materials and methods. A window was made in the shell of fertilized chicken eggs and 3 x 106 SW 1222 human colorectal carcinoma cells were implanted at day 10 post-fertilization. On day 17 the shell window was enlarged to allow direct injection of FDG (12. 2 ± 4. 5 MBq/egg) into a CAM blood vessel. During injection the egg was warmed on a heating pad. A mixture of ketamine/medetomidine (50 : 1 mg/ml, 0. 2 ml/egg) was injected into the albumin in some eggs to assess the effect of anesthesia. After FDG injection the egg was returned to the incubator for a 45 min uptake period before imaging. Imaging was performed on a Siemens Focus 120 microPET with structural CT on a General Electric eXplore CT 120. A Minerve cell system allowed reproducible positioning between modalities. PET data was acquired in list mode before histogramming into a single 10 min frame for reconstruction using a 3 D maximum a posteriori (MAP) method with all corrections except scatter. A standard 100 µm (theoretical) image resolution protocol (70 kV, 50 mA, 32 ms, 220 views) was used to obtain structural CT data. Image coregistration was performed in PMOD version 3. 3. In a separate egg, the influence of added contrast on the CT data was investigated by adding iodinated contrast agent (<b>Iobitridol</b> 35 mgI/ml) to the albumin. Results. FDG uptake was clear in chick and tumor, with notably high uptake at the major joints. Tumors were identified by localization of FDG uptake on the surface of the CAM. A lack of soft tissue contrast between tumor, CAM and albumin made precise structural identification of the tumor difficult. Anesthesia was crucial to image quality in both PET and CT. CT contrast between the soft tissues of the chick and surrounding albumin/structures was improved by addition of contrast agent. Conclusion. For the first time we demonstrate successful imaging of FDG uptake in a human colorectal carcinoma chicken CAM model in ovo. Methods to improve structural data are under investigation and will be used in further studies. With such improvement, this model could be of great value to PET oncology imaging.
