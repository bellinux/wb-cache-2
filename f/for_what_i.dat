5|$|If I {{wanted to}} get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up. I think it's because it is to me the least flawed; let me put it that way. It is the most {{successful}} <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tried to do. I succeeded more completely in my view with that than with anything else.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

Of his time in Korea, Dean later said, [...] "I wouldn't have awarded myself a wooden star <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did as a commander." [...] In his autobiography, he opted instead to highlight the command decisions he regretted making and contend, [...] "There were heroes in Korea, but I was not one of them." ...|$|E

500|$|During the campaign, Keyes {{outlined}} {{an alternative}} to reparations for slavery. His specific suggestion was that, {{for a period of}} one or two generations, African-Americans who were descended from slaves would be exempt from the federal income tax (though not from the FICA tax that supports Social Security). Keyes said the experiment [...] "would become a demonstration project <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> believe needs to be done for the whole country, which is {{to get rid of the}} income tax." [...] He also called for the repeal of the 17th Amendment in order to require that U.S. Senators be appointed by state legislatures, rather than being directly elected.|$|E
500|$|Constantine {{was awarded}} a life peerage in 1969, {{becoming}} the first black man {{to sit in the}} House of Lords; there were rumours that Trinidad had prevented earlier attempts to ennoble him. He took the title of Baron Constantine of Maraval in Trinidad and Nelson in the County Palatine of Lancaster. His investiture attracted widespread media attention; Constantine stated: [...] "I think it must have been <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have endeavoured to do {{to make it possible for}} people of different colour to know each other better and live well together." [...] He sat as a crossbencher in the House, but was well enough to make only one speech in his time there.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes and Emmott Robinson, {{the senior}} {{professionals}} in the Yorkshire team, discussed tactics with Verity and his friend and teammate Bill Bowes, to analyse their errors. Bowes later wrote: [...] "To Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson... I owe most <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> learned of first-class cricket—and Hedley Verity shared my debt." [...] Verity enjoyed long technical discussions with Rhodes and, according to Hirst, took in the advice [...] "like a sponge takes water". Even successful performances were critiqued, including Verity's against Glamorgan and Hampshire. At {{the end of the}} season, critics in the press seemed convinced a successor to Rhodes had been found, and Verity was spoken of as a certainty to become an England regular.|$|E

500|$|UVA's student {{newspaper}} The Cavalier Daily described mixed reactions {{from the student}} body, stating: [...] "For some, the piece is an unfounded attack on our school; for others, it is a recognition of a harsh reality; and <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> suspect is {{a large majority of}} us, it falls somewhere in between." [...] Cavalier columnist Dani Bernstein rejected Erdely's portrayal of UVA's student body as sharing equal blame with the administration. Bernstein also said that regardless of its veracity, the Rolling Stone article underscored preexisting and recurrent complaints about the school's inadequate handling of sexual assault and their [...] "deference to Greek life". She argued that [...] "the school has been unbelievably slow to investigate Phi Kappa Psi despite many allegations of sexual assault".|$|E

In addition, three albums were also {{released}} to accommodate {{the success of the}} three singles, including a tribute to songwriter Dallas Frazier named If It Ain't Love and Other Great Dallas Frazier Songs. In November 1972, Smith announced she would depart from RCA the same week that country artist Eddy Arnold also announced his temporary departure. Smith later explained in an interview with Razor & Tie that she felt RCA showed a lack of respect for her and she felt she would have been happier recording elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Despite Booth's views {{being more}} genteel {{than that of}} most of his teammates, there was minimal {{friction}} or disconnect. Early in his state career, Booth declined to join a Melbourne Cup gambling sweep organised by captain Keith Miller. However, Miller included Booth in the event by assigning him {{to look after the}} money. Booth said [...] "That was typical of Keith. That he was able to turn something that might have been a problem into something positive, giving me a responsibility, making me feel part of the team." [...] He added [...] "The boys just accepted me <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was. If they didn't share the strength of my convictions, they were quite happy for me to hold them." [...] Simpson said that Booth never attempted to impose his worldview on his teammates and never gave any inkling that he disapproved of their behaviour.|$|E

Harrod had previously worked under Raymond Blanc at two Michelin starred restaurant Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons. He had been looking for a restaurant with rooms to purchase, having originally thought to look for one in the Chiltern Hills where they could be added. Harrod said that [...] "I went and had a look and was amazed to find that the Crown at Whitebrook ticked all the boxes <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was looking for. It had the location, the quality suppliers and I knew straight away that I had been looking in the wrong place." [...] The Crown at Whitebrook reopened the following October, and gained a new Michelin star under the new team in the 2014 list. In February 2015, the restaurant was renamed to The Whitebrook.|$|E

500|$|... "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] was the album's {{official}} lead single. It {{was chosen}} as a single by Interscope after Manson played an instrumental version of the song to their artists and repertoire department, where an employee exclaimed: [...] "This is gonna be a hit!". Manson {{is reported to have}} responded: [...] "Well, I'm glad that you have no consideration <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> [...] put on top of it." [...] A heavily censored version of the profanity-laced track, re-titled to [...] "Arma... geddon", was serviced to radio in the US from April 13. It peaked at number 37 on Billboards Mainstream Rock, becoming their lowest-peaking single on that chart in the process. A music video, directed by Los Angeles-based filmmaker and photographer Delaney Bishop, premiered on the website of British music magazine NME on May 14. Delaney had previously directed the 2005 short film The Death of Salvador Dali, which starred Manson's ex-wife, Dita Von Teese.|$|E
500|$|The Speaker {{ordered that}} Bellingham be {{transferred}} to the Serjeant-at-Arms's quarters, where MPs [...] who were also magistrates would conduct a committal hearing [...] under the chairmanship of Harvey Christian Combe. The makeshift court heard evidence from eyewitnesses to the crime, and sent messengers to search Bellingham's lodgings. The prisoner kept his composure throughout; although warned against self-incrimination, he insisted on explaining himself: [...] "I have been ill-treated... I have sought redress in vain. I am [...] a most unfortunate man and feel here"—placing hand on heart—"sufficient justification <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have done." [...] He had, he said, exhausted all proper avenues, and had made it clear to the [...] authorities that he proposed to take independent action. He had been told to do his worst: [...] "I have obeyed them. [...] I have done my worst, and I rejoice in the deed." [...] At around eight o'clock, Bellingham was formally charged with Perceval's murder, and was committed to Newgate Prison to await trial.|$|E
500|$|... "Bossy" [...] {{was written}} by Shaffer Smith, known by his stage name Ne-Yo, while {{additional}} writing and song production was done by Stargate members Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. In the beginning of May 2008, a clip of the song leaked on YouTube. As a result, Universal Motown released the full song to media outlets on May 7, 2008. In an interview with Billboard, Ne-Yo revealed that he was approached by the label to write a song for Lohan: [...] "I gotta admit, we were like ... Lindsay Lohan?' I mean, I've written for Beyoncé, Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Celine Dion and ... Lindsay Lohan? But I will say this; we gave her a quality record and she did a ridiculously fabulous job. I was so shocked I had to call her and apologize <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was thinking because she did so good. I think the world is gonna be surprised." [...] In an interview with People Magazine, he revealed the song [...] "it's basically about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it. In this case, 'Bossy' is a term that describes confidence and power." [...] "Bossy" [...] was digitally released on May 27, 2008, and it was set to appear on Lohan's third studio album.|$|E

500|$|By appearance, {{he is an}} {{overweight}} corporate head that takes the name Wilson Fisk, but in fact he is the sole person running organized crime, under the moniker of Kingpin. Kingpin is the murderer of Matt's father, and {{the man responsible for}} the hiring of Bullseye, with intention of having the Natchios family murdered. Michael Clarke Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002, though he had been attached far earlier. When Duncan was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day, and power-lifted with one or two reps a day, as well as eating whatever he wanted. Despite this, Duncan's biggest concern was that he is black, while Kingpin has always been portrayed as white. Also, Duncan provided the voice for Kingpin in [...] He spoke on the fan's loyalty to the source material by saying [...] "they watch movies to say, 'Hey, that's not like the comic book.'

500|$|The studio {{recording}} on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the {{one that}} most listeners are familiar with, yet several other versions survive from both the recording studio and the stage. It was first recorded as a demo on 31 October 1966, recorded live-in-studio at Thompson Private Recording Company. This version was used as the audio sound to the film San Francisco, which was made by a friend of Barrett's, Anthony Stern. While filmmaker Peter Whitehead and his secondhand Stern were having a discussion, the topic about Pink Floyd was brought about by Stern, to which Whitehead told him, [...] "yeah, terrible music". Stern said that [...] "they're successful now", and suggest the pair go watch Pink Floyd, at their gig at the Royal College of Art. Whitehead recalled that they [...] "went to UFO and I liked them. Not connected to pop music, a long improvisatory quality, ideal <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted." [...] Whitehead convinced Pink Floyd to record [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for a film he was working on. Before turning up at the recording studio, the band held a rehearsal, and the next day, 11 January 1967, went to Sound Techniques studios. The studio, which was originally a dairy factory, was run by engineers Geoff Frost and John Wood.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E
