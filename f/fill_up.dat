5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E

Thirty-four stations offer reserved parking, with customers purchasing permits to park in specified spaces. Three Metrorail stations (Greenbelt, Huntington, and Franconia-Springfield) have spaces reserved for multi-day parking for up to ten days. Parking fees are paid by SmarTrip card, but 19 stations also accept credit cards. Cash payments are not accepted for parking fees.|$|E

The sewer feeding into the moat was blocked up around {{the middle of the}} century, and the moat, which previously seems to have been kept clean, was allowed to gradually <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> with debris, despite complaints from the House of Lords that this put the Jewel Tower at greater risk of fire and thieves.|$|E

5|$|About 23 Ma, in the Pleistocene, {{continental}} ice sheets {{expanded from}} the polar {{regions of the}} globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold glacial periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. Snowmelt from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers that flowed into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen has a {{significant}} jazz scene that has existed for many years. It developed when a number of American jazz musicians such as Ben Webster, Thad Jones, Richard Boone, Ernie Wilkins, Kenny Drew, Ed Thigpen, Bob Rockwell, Dexter Gordon, and others such as rock guitarist Link Wray came to live in Copenhagen during the 1960s. Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as cafés and concert halls <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> with big and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. One of Europe's top jazz festivals, the annual event features around 900 concerts at 100 venues with over 200,000 guests from Denmark and around the world.|$|E

The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E

5|$|Dan {{can visit}} merchants known as 'Spivs' to buy {{additional}} ammunition and services. He {{can also get}} advice from his ghost sidekick named Winston to learn new moves or to save the player's game between longer levels. Similar to the previous game, Dan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It also depletes completely if he drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game restarts from the last known save point. Dan can refill his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which automatically refill his health if it is depleted. Whilst defeating enemies, Dan's Chalice of Souls will gradually <b>fill</b> <b>up,</b> which can then be collected and traded with Professor Kift to unlock new weapons and items.|$|E
5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Delaware General Assembly {{approved}} {{slot machines}} for the state's three racetracks, {{and the first}} racino opened in December 1995. This helped the horse racing industry in Delaware, as approximately 10 percent of all gross revenue is used to increase the purses. This drew competition away from Maryland. Rosecroft could not <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> a 12-race card for its opening night during the 1996 season. An estimated $80 million in wagering was lost in 1996 from the effect of Delaware's casinos. Throughout the years, various politicians tried to bring slot machines or table games to Rosecroft, but all were unsuccessful.|$|E

The game was released by 2K on January 29, 2015 for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Fire OS devices. The game is a free-to-play tile-matching video game, {{as well as a}} companion app to Evolve. In Evolve: Hunter Quest, players match three tokens of the same colour in order to unleash attacks on enemies, <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> energy bars to activate special Hunter abilities and earn mastery points to level up. Mastery points earned in-app can then be applied to characters in the main Evolve game on any platform. Players who download the app can also unlock unique game art and watch replays of online matches from a top-down view.|$|E
5|$|Since 1958, the Cup has {{undergone}} several minor alterations. The original collar and bowl were too brittle, and were replaced in 1963 and 1969, respectively. The modern one-piece Cup design {{was introduced in}} 1958, when the old barrel was replaced with a five-band barrel, each of which could contain 13 winning teams. Although the bands were originally designed to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> during the Cup's centennial year, {{the names of the}} 1965 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13. When the bands were all filled in 1991, the top band of the large barrel was preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was added to the bottom so the Stanley Cup would not grow further.|$|E

When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers {{could not think of}} any more spin-offs.|$|E

5|$|The main {{character}} possesses several statistics, including hit points, power, and stamina, which can all increase upon gaining an experience level. Magic spells, which expend the character's MP, {{can be used}} to heal oneself or damage enemies. These spells can only be found in certain locations or obtained from other characters at specific plot intervals. In addition, the protagonist has a power gauge that affects his attack strength—the higher the gauge, the stronger his attack will be. The speed at which it fills is directly affected by the character's will level. The gauge will slowly <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> over time, but once the {{main character}} attacks, the gauge is emptied. When the gauge is completely filled up and the main character attacks with a weapon, he will perform a special attack.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} a favourable omen {{during the night}} Pyrrhus renewed his assault. An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded. In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta. Responding to this Spartan counter-attack, Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders. However, at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly. Pyrrhus' fall threw his companions {{into a state of}} dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in a barrage of missiles. Despite this, Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp.|$|E

5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling {{to take a chance}} on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> the tower to help pay for condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction.|$|E
5|$|In September, SAS {{announced}} that if Braathens {{took the first}} step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air {{announced that}} they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two. The load factor in August was 43%, and management stated that 50% load would not be sufficient to make money. In particular, the company stated that while aircraft were full during the weekends, the company was not succeeding at garnering the necessary business ridership to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> the planes during the weekdays. To become more attractive, the company changed its fares to two classes: Business Full Flex and Saver No Flex. The company also stated that to attract more business travelers, it was looking for an international partner to conduct codesharing on international routes, and perhaps also introduce a frequent flyer program alone or in cooperation with the partner.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Competition Authority {{announced}} {{that since the}} new company would have all domestic scheduled services between primary airports, {{it was unlikely that}} the take-over would receive permission from them. However, it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs. On 20 August, the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens. Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed. The Competition Authority stated that their denial of the take-over was that the reduction of capacity would remove the airline's incentive to provide discounted tickets, because they would not have to use them to capture travelers with lower willingness to pay from the competitor, and that they would not need low-paying customers to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> the vacant seats. Instead, the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights. While Braathens also was opposed to the tax, they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company.|$|E
