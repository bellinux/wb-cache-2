An approach to storage which permits and exploits very large capacities, hierarchies of speeds, read-only storage for microprogram control, flexible storage protection, and simple program relocation. 2. An input!output system offering new degrees of concurrent operation, compatible channel operation, data rates approaching 5, 000, 000 characters/second, integrated design of hardware and software, a new low-e:ost, multiple-ehannel package sharing main-frame hardware, new provisions for device status infor-mation, and a standard channel interface between central processing unit and input/output devices. 3. A truly general-purpose machine organization offering new supervisory facilities, powerful logical pro-cessing operations, and {{a wide variety of}} data formats. 4. Strict upward and <b>downward</b> machine-language <b>compatibility</b> over a line of six models having a per-formance range factor of SO. This paper discusses in detail the objectives of the design and the rationale for the main features of the architecture. Emphasis is given to the problems raised by the need for compatibility among central process-ing units of various size and by the conflicting demands of commercial, scientific, real-time, and logical in-formation processing.

Software built using both classes and metaclasses is organized into an architecture of several (meta) levels of abstraction. Each (meta) level describes and controls the lower one, to which it is causally connected. The design and the reuse of such systems raise the problem of composition between and in the different (meta) levels. In section 2, we distinguish two different aspects associated to the metaclass composition problem. The first one [...] ...|$|R

In addition, since the year 2000, more and more banks have started to add the EMV chip to newly issued cards. By 2008, 70% of the cards issued had that chip. The new chip is capable of processing data like a small computer and can respond to requests without the entire contents being read.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Between the new {{international}} standards adopted in 2001 and {{the aging of the}} world's fleet of analog avalanche transceivers, the time is approaching when older analog transceivers will need to be retired. As beacon manufacturers worldwide convert to digital technology, <b>downward</b> <b>compatibility</b> with aging analog beacons is gaining in importance. Transmit frequency precision and tight receiver tolerances aid in digital beacon performance. But transmit frequency "drift " is characteristic of aged and traumatized analog units; many no longer meet the {{new international}} standards. Our research indicates that many of the recently introduced digital transceivers don’t reliably detect older units transmitting outside the standards—or even new units whose frequency has been altered by physical abuse. To ensure <b>downward</b> <b>compatibility</b> and decrease risk, an international standard should be created for receiver bandwidth. Users should strongly consider receiver bandwidth when selecting new transceiver fleets. Those with analog fleets should institutionalize a regular inspection program with the manufacturer—and eventual replacement of that fleet with units containing high-quality crystal transmitters and wide receiver bandwidth...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of {{the major}} {{drawbacks}} of OFDM modulation is the large envelope fluctuations which either result in an inefficient use of high power amplifiers (HPA) or decreased transmission system performance. Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is a very well known measure of the envelope fluctuations and has become the cost function used to evaluate and design OFDM systems. In this paper, we propose a PAPR reduction scheme known as adding signal method for which the principle {{is to reduce the}} PAPR of the OFDM signals by adding several artificial signals. It is an extension of the method that we have proposed in [1]. The major advantages of this technique include <b>downward</b> <b>compatibility,</b> no performance degradation and no transmission of side information. A method is said to be <b>downward</b> <b>compatibility</b> if its implementation in a transmitter does not imply modifications in the associated receiver. According to simulation results, the method outperforms the PAPRreduction performance presented in [1]. For example, at 10 − 2 of the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF), the PAPR is reduced about 3. 5 dB for 5 artificial signals addition, whereas this reduction is about 1. 5 dB for method [1] which is the case of one artificial signal addition...|$|E

As a step toward addressing this problem for libraries of reactive components we develop a theory that equips components with interface languages characterizing the interaction patterns user applications may engage in with the component. We then show how these languages {{may be used to}} build upgrade specifications from components and their interface languages. Intuitively, upgrade specifications explicitly describe requirements an (improved) implementation of a component must satisfy and are intended for use by library developers.

40|$|Succession in {{standardization}} {{is usually}} a problem. The advantages of improvements are weighed against those of compatibility. If compatibility considerations dominate, a grafting process takes place. This process need not lead to compatibility. According to our taxonomy of successor standards, there are three types of succession (outcomes). Type I, where grafting is achieved, entails compatibility between successors, technical paradigm-compliance, and continuity in the standards trajectory. In this paper, we examine issues of succession {{and focus on the}} Extensible Markup Language (XML). It was to be grafted on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a stable standard since 1988. However, XML was a profile, a subset and an extension of SGML (1988). Adaptation of SGML was needed (SGML 1999) to forge full (<b>downward)</b> <b>compatibility</b> with XML (1998). We describe the grafting efforts and analyze their outcomes. We conclude that XML largely fits the SGML paradigm. SGML was a technical exemplar for XML developers. In contrast, widespread use of HTML exemplified the desirability of simplicity in XML standardization. The latter issue and HTML's user market largely explain discontinuity in SGML-XML succession. 1...|$|E

Buildingupon SOWL (Spatio-Temporal OWL), an ontology for handling spatio-temporal information in OWL, SOWL QL supports querying over qualitative spatio-temporal information (expressed using natural language expressions such as “before”, “after”, “north of”, “south of”) {{rather than merely}} quantitative information (exact dates, times, locations). SOWL QL extends SPARQL with a powerful set of temporal and spatial operators, including temporal Allen topological, spatial directional and topological operations or combinations of the above. SOWL QL maintains simplicity of expression and also, upward and <b>downward</b> <b>compatibility</b> with SPARQL. Query translation in SOWL QL yields SPARQL queries implying that, querying spatio-temporal ontologies using SPARQL is still feasible but suffers from several drawbacks {{the most important of}} them being that, queries in SPARQL become particularly complicated and users must be familiar with the underlying spatio-temporal representation (the “N-ary relations” or the “ 4 D-fluents” approach in this work).

Starting {{at the beginning of}} September 1995 both partners agreed on the creation of an object-oriented analysis System/concept for Air Traffic Control (ATC). The first part of the project, the introduction to the problem domain ATC was done at the EEC in Bretigny-sur-Orge (France) from September ' 95 to March ' 96. Within this period, the application domain ATC was studied and a preliminary class diagram was created as an outline for a complete object-oriented analaysis, which is documented in this report. Object-orientation techniques were used to model relevant aspects of Air Traffic Control (ATC) from slot allocation to the arrival at the gate. This includes the most important actors - controllers and pilots. Starting with the preliminary class diagram, controller activities during sector hand-over were described with use cases. Object interaction was derived from these use cases, leading to a refined analysis model. For the decomposition and modularisation of complex use cases, path expressions have been introduced. The object model presented in this report forms a stable and extendable basis for the design and evaluation of new ATC functionalities in the areas air navigation, operational procedures and communication facilities.

These are due to (i) low resource settings while achieving maximal lysis (ii) high throughput of target molecules to be detected (iii) automated extraction and purification of relevant molecules such as DNA and protein from extremely small volume of sample (iv) requirement of fast, accurate and yet scalable methods (v) multifunctionality toward process monitoring and (vi) <b>downward</b> <b>compatibility</b> with already existing diagnostic protocols.

The influence of the coating thickness on the injection current densities has been analyzed.

40|$|Part of {{the number}} of Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) {{services}} specified by the Object Management Group is CORBA’s Property Service (PS), which can be used to provide CORBA objects dynamically with additional properties not declared in their static Interface Description Language (IDL) type definitions. Although the management of dynamic properties is a common requirement for several application purposes, the support offered by CORBA’s PS is very limited. One shortcoming, for example, {{is the fact that the}} PS specification considers the association between objects and properties an implementation detail, which is completely delegated to the developers of applications that require property management. Moreover, CORBA’s PS does not support the definition of properties with lifetime restrictions, i. e. it is not possible to specify properties that are only allowed to exist for a certain period of time. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing an extended version of CORBA’s PS, which provides explicit property set/object associations managed by the service and integrates the aspect of temporary properties. A primary goal in our design of the Enhanced PS was smoothness of the extensions with respect to <b>downward</b> <b>compatibility</b> with the original specification. In addition, we intended to simplify the integration of the new functionality in CORBA applications that need to utilize the enhanced features.

The content covers a basic set of academics with the intention to provide a basic curriculum for geoinformation. A fundamental concern during the development of geoinformation. net was to ensure a maximum of flexibility in terms of content combination and extensibility of the content pool. Closely connected with this point was the hope to increase the level of content reuse by reducing the content adoption barrier level. Starting from the geoinformation. net platform there are several demands to make on the functionality of the interaction tool, the LectureBuilder.

In this paper we provide some answers to this question. First, we use basic input-output theory to derive sufficient conditions on the motor and controller parameters for global boundedness of all solutions. Then, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the (nonlinear) closed loop, which interestingly enough allows for a 200 % error in the rotor resistance estimate. Finally, we give conditions on the motor and controller parameters, and the speed and rotor flux norm reference values that insure (global or local) asymptotic stability or instability of the equilibrium.
