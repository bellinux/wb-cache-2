Such a situation induces specialists (marketing specialists, managers, managers of companies) to search for new unconventional and non-standard approaches of moving of commodities and services, in particular, directly in the places of sale. Foremost, we mean marketing technologies used for designing of consumers’ behavior. Specialists say that for successful moving of commodities it is necessary to call to the emotional, subconscious sphere. The role of marketing is taken to communication with a consumer directly in the places of sale, where there is the possibility to provide the most complete immersion of a consumer in the world of brand and to stimulate spontaneous purchases. The task of marketing consists in forming of so-called indoor-environment that is the atmosphere in the places of sale. Foremost, we mean visual (color), voice (audiomarketing) and aromatic (aromamarketing) design inside a building. The essence of such technologies consists in the influence on man’s subconsciousness and in the creation of manipulation mechanism of management of consumer’s actions and behavior by complex influence on 5 organs of man’s feeling such as sight, hearing, sense of smell, touch, taste. The article generalizes the existent experience of the use of psycho-emotional methods of stimulation of sales used to influence on consumer’s behavior.

50|$|Cash {{back and}} {{reward-based}} websites operate using a marketing model known as affiliate marketing, {{which is a}} performance-based marketing tool. Affiliate marketing networks {{make it possible to}} track in detail where users come from (which website is referring the customers), what users buy (down to the product) and when. Rewards-based websites track and reconcile this information with their own user database, and pass on a proportion or even all of the commission received to the customer.

While hundreds of thousands of websites can easily use affiliate programmes to advertise products and retailers (from sports blogs, fanzines through to almost any niche website), cash back and rewards-based programmes are much fewer in number, because of the need to track, store and retrieve individual customer information {{with a high degree of}} precision.|$|R

When managers have a preference for smooth time-paths of profits – as revealed by the empirical literature on ‘income smoothing’ – manager-led firms can sustain collusive agreements at lower <b>discount</b> factors. Capped <b>bonus</b> plans and incumbency rents with termination threats make collusion supportable at any discount factor, independent of contracts’ duration. When managers have these preferences/incentives and demand fluctuates, ‘price wars during booms’ need not occur: the most collusive price may then be pro-cyclical.
