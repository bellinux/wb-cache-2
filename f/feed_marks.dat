The indentation results showed that even though the addition of Co binder could obviously improve the toughness of bulk materials, non-uniform surface plastic deformation can be induced by the varied hardness of composing phases in nanoscale, indicated by the shape of load-displacement curves at low loads. Moreover, except for the scratching grooves and <b>feed</b> <b>marks,</b> the machined WC/Co surface was covered by randomly distributed micro-pits resulted from the dislodgement of hard particles in comparison with the binderless WC.

In such cases, variation of surface properties along with the machined surface is not well understood. Therefore, this article investigates the effect of machining parameters {{on the quality of}} surface in ball end milling of thin-shaped cantilever of Inconel 718. A distinct variation is also observed in the measured values of deflection of workpiece: surface roughness and surface damage in different regions, that is, fixed end, mid portion and free end of machined surface. The experiments were conducted according to the central composite design with four factors, namely, cutting speed, feed, workpiece thickness and workpiece inclination with tool path orientation. It is observed that the process parameters have statistically significant effect on machined surface of Inconel 718. Horizontal tool path condition during milling is most favourable in all aspects of surface quality with high speed and lower feed.

40|$|Gear hobbing is well {{established}} {{and one of the}} most cost effective manufacturing methods of involute gears. In the hobbing of lead crown corrected helical gears, a well know drawback is the non-uniform systematic tooth alignment deviation that arises. This is sometimes denoted as flank twist. The inevitable tooth alignment deviation, together with other source deviations, must not exceed the specified tolerances if the gear is to be finished hobbed. To avoid trial and error when selecting manufacturing method, it would be of great industrial interest to be able to predetermine the least expected alignment deviation when the gear is to be finished hobbed. The main purpose of this study is to determine the magnitude of the systematic alignment deviations which arises for hobbed gears with lead crown correction. A simulation tool is developed where the hobbing process can be analysed, without additional errors resulting from real conditions. The results from this simulation tool show very good correlation with an experimental gear ground by a hob in industrial conditions. By elimination of <b>feed</b> <b>marks</b> on the gear tooth surface, a novel method to predetermine the least expected alignment deviation was found by an analytical analysis.

The experimental work was carried out on a CNC machining center considering roughing and finishing operations. A 25 mm diameter endmill with two cemented carbide inserts coated with TiN layer were used for end milling operation. Low carbon alloyed steel Cr-Mo forged at 1200 degrees C was used as workpiece on the tests. Two kinds of workpiece conditions were considered, i. e. cur cooled after hot forging and normalized at 950 degrees C for 2 h. The results showed that finishing operation was able to significantly decrease the roughness by at least 46 % without changing the hardness. on the other hand, roughing operation caused an increase in hardness statistically significant by about 6 %. The machined surface presented deformed regions within <b>feed</b> <b>marks,</b> which directly affected the roughness.

40|$|Every {{machining}} operation leaves characteristic {{evidence on the}} machined surface. This evidence {{takes the form of}} finely spaced micro irregularities left by the cutting tool. A two-pass technique was introduced for enhancing the surface roughness for different cutting conditions and workpiece materials based on the <b>feed</b> <b>marks</b> (pattern) left by the tool in the {{machining operation}}. An important drawback of this technique is that the time taken for its two passes represents twice the time of regular machining. Another drawback is the difficulty of adjusting the tool in the second pass with the appropriate accuracy. For solving these problems, a tool design is provided in this paper to achieve the same results of the two-pass technique in one pass. The objective of this research is to compare this technique using different methods (regular or one pass, two passes, new tool) using different cutting conditions and different workpiece materials. In addition to the surface roughness, straightness and roundness errors are measured for these methods (two passes, new tool) and compared with regular cutting. Improvement of surface roughness was shown as the straightness and roundness errors decrease by using this new technique. In practice, the new tool technique improves the surface roughness, straightness error, and roundness error by more than 58, 65, and 50 per cent respectively at the proposed cutting condition (50 m/min cutting speed, 0. 2 mm/rev feed, and 1 mm depth of cut) for all workpiece materials used.

In this study, the effects of cutting conditions and tool wear on the surface integrity of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy after high-speed dry end milling were investigated. Different cutting speeds (100 – 300 m/min) and feeds (0. 03 and 0. 06 mm/tooth) as well as TiAlN + TiN physical vapor deposition (PVD) -coated carbide tool were employed during the machining trials. Surface roughness value and sub-surface microhardness of the machined surfaces were measured, and the corresponding alterations beneath the surface were characterized through electron microscopy. Results showed that surface roughness values at different cutting speeds directly depends on the tool conditions. The use of a new tool contributed to a higher surface quality of 185 nm compared to 320 nm for the used tool at the highest investigated cutting speed. It was found that operating the end milling with the new tool at a higher feed rate significantly decreased the surface roughness of the machined surface from 415 to 225 nm at a lower cutting speed. <b>Feed</b> <b>marks</b> and material redeposition defects were detected on the surface, while plastic deformation was observed in the sub-surface of the machined surface.

40|$|AbstractOwing {{to their}} {{enhanced}} mechanical properties and improved structural functions, {{the use of}} hybrid CFRP/Ti stacks (a sandwich of both CFRP laminate and Ti alloy) has experienced an increasing trend in modern aerospace industry. The emergence of such composite-to-metal alliance, however, poses a series of new challenges to the manufacturing sectors for high-quality finishing of the material-made components. The key machining problems usually arise from the disparate natures of the stacked constituents (CFRP laminate and Ti alloy) and their correspondingly poor machinability. To study the fundamental cutting characteristics of the bi-material assembly, this paper presents an experimental study concerning the machinability evaluation of the hybrid CFRP/Ti stacks. An orthogonal cutting configuration (OCC) derived from the real manufacturing operation was adopted to finalize the CFRP/Ti cutting comprehension by using the superior polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tipped tools. The cutting trials were performed under the reasonable cutting sequence strategy of CFRP→ Ti as pointed out by most researches. The key cutting responses including cutting forces, machined surface quality and tool wear mechanisms were precisely addressed versus the utilized cutting conditions. The experimental results highlight that a parametric combination of high cutting speed (vc) and low feed rate (f) often facilitates the reduction of cutting forces and induced damage extents. The basic damage modes promoted on the machined CFRP/Ti surfaces are observed to be fiber pullout, resin loss, surface cavity, deformation of <b>feed</b> <b>marks</b> and re-deposited materials. Moreover, the key wear mechanisms governing the PCD tool cutting are confirmed to be crater wear and flank wear, while the tool failure mode is edge chipping. To ensure excellent machined surface quality, a stringent control of tool wear should be implemented when cutting hybrid CFRP/Ti stacks...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAl/SiCp Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) are the {{new class}} of {{materials}} and are rapidly replacing conventional materials in various applications industrial and aerospace applications. These materials are generally regarded as extremely difficult to machine, because of the abrasive characteristics of the reinforced particulates. It has poor machinability such as excessive tool wear and fracturing of the reinforcement particles on machined surface. It leaves behind adhered particle fragments, pits and cavities despite superior excellent engineering properties. These characteristics in machining of Al/SiCp MMCs tend to adversely affect the machined surface quality/integrity. Hence, an attempt is made to improve the machinability of Al/SiCp MMCs and surface quality by hot machining. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental research on hot machining of Al/SiCp MMCs produced by stir casting. PVD coated carbide inserts were used under dry cutting conditions. Experiments were carried out on CNC lathe. Experiments on Al/SiCp 10 % composites of two different particle size of Silicon carbide reinforcement i. e. coarse and fine (220 and 600 mesh size respectively) are performed using L 16 orthogonal array as per the Taguchi method. The study of Al/SiCp MMCs on the basis of surface integrity was tried out in order to know the machinability. The experimental study showed that feed, depth of cut and preheating temperature have a significant influence on cutting force, feed force, thrust force, surface roughness and micro-hardness variation beneath the machined surface. The micro-hardness is found to be higher near the machined surface layer and decreases with the depth of machined subsurface for all experimental conditions.
