Similar to the 1912-13 locos, they were 69 foot long and weighed 175 tons, {{with a top}} speed of 70 mph (110 km/h). The <b>hourly</b> <b>rating</b> was 2460 hp, and maximum tractive effort of almost 50,000 lb. A further 12 were supplied in 1923 and 10 in 1927; totaling 27.|$|E
50|$|Two were {{supplied}} in 1926 and 3 in 1928. Each Z-1 locomotive had two semi-permanently coupled 1-D-1 box-cab units; {{the pair}} weighed more than 371 tons with an <b>hourly</b> <b>rating</b> of 4330 hp and a {{continuous tractive effort}} of 88,500 lbs per unit (177,000 lb per pair) and a maximum starting effort of 189,000 lb. The locos had a motor-generator set with a synchronous AC motor and DC generator which supplied the Westinghouse 356-A traction motors geared to each driving axle. They were equipped for multiple-unit control and regenerative breaking. A pair of Z-1s with four units could move a 2900-ton train over the 2.2% maximum gradient of the new Cascade line.|$|E
5000|$|An initial {{order of}} 35 EP-1 {{locomotives}} were supplied 1905-1907. The design {{was similar to}} No 9 above, with two two-axle trucks and a Westinghouse gearless quill drive, which supported the motor on the truck frame and reduced the unsprung weight. The locos weighed 102 tons and were 37 ft 6½in long. They had to operate over the 12 miles of New York Central track electrified at 660 V DC third rail from Grand Central to Woodlawn, so had AC/DC series commutator motors; the four Westinghouse 130 motors had a total <b>hourly</b> <b>rating</b> of [...] The loco could change from AC to DC without stopping; power pickup was by eight third-rail shoes which could be lowered, plus two large AC pantographs and a small pantograph for DC where short sections through switches were too complicated for third-rail supply. A second order of six supplied in 1908 had design changes, including guide wheels at each end to obviate “nose” or oscillation at high speed. The highly successful class operated to 1947, although some were retired from 1936.|$|E

40|$|We analyze a client's {{choice of}} {{contract}} in auctions where Dutch law firms compete for cases. The distinguishing feature is that lawyers may submit bids with any fee arrangement they prefer: an <b>hourly</b> <b>rate,</b> a fixed fee or a "mixed fee", {{which is a}} time-capped fixed fee plus an <b>hourly</b> <b>rate</b> for any additional hours should the case take longer than expected. This format of selling legal services is unusual in that it both forces lawyers to compete directly against each other and allows clients to easily compare these dierent oers. We estimate a choice model for clients and find robust evidence that <b>hourly</b> <b>rate</b> bids are a client's least-preferred choice.

50|$|They also {{produced}} 100 petrol-electric locomotives for the War Department Light Railways. These locomotives weighed 7 tons {{and had a}} 45 hp Dorman 4JO four-cylinder petrol engine driving a 30 kW DC generator at 1000rpm. This supplied current at up to 500volts to 2 traction-motors driving the 32inch wheels via a 6.68:1 reduction gear. The motors had an <b>hourly</b> <b>rating</b> of 25 hp, allowing the locomotive to haul 100tons at 5.2 mph. The two motors were run in parallel, with speed control by altering the generator voltage, and either motor could be cut out in event of a failure. The generator also offered electric starting of the petrol engine by connecting to another locomotive, and the locomotives {{could also be used}} as mobile generators. In a parallel order 100 similarly rated locomotives were made by British Westinghouse, who were probably the original designers, though the DC generator/DC motor speed control mechanism is an early example of the application of a Ward Leonard control system (Harry Ward Leonard patented its application to vehicles in 1903). The selection of this drive system was in part because the War Department had originally considered using overhead electric as an alternative way of powering the locomotives, but it was subsequently decided this was not practical.|$|E
