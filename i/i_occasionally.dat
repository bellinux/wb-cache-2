500|$|A 1999 Christian Science Monitor review said that, {{filled with}} [...] "poignant stories" [...] that are [...] "likely to ruffle some feathers, this {{compelling}} book challenges Christians {{to become a}} genuine healing force in society". Presbyterian pastor John Buchanan, {{editor and publisher of}} The Christian Century, also reviewed What's So Amazing About Grace? that year, writing that [...] "Yancey is such a good writer and such a generous evangelical that even though <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> disagree with his conclusions, I'm glad {{to be in the same}} family with him".|$|E
2500|$|Marcel Duchamp {{began to}} view the {{manufactured}} objects of his collection as objects of art, which he called [...] "readymades". He would add signatures and titles to some, converting them into artwork that he called [...] "readymade aided" [...] or [...] "rectified readymades". Duchamp wrote: [...] "One important characteristic was the short sentence which <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> inscribed on the 'readymade.' That sentence, instead of describing the object like a title, was meant to carry {{the mind of the}} spectator towards other regions more verbal. Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called 'readymade aided.'" [...] One such example of Duchamp's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back, signed [...] "R. Mutt", titled [...] "Fountain", and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year, though it was not displayed.|$|E

5000|$|Volpone - One of {{the oldest}} foxes in the forest and Voracious' father. <b>Is</b> <b>occasionally</b> left with the unpopular task of babysitting Ghengis. Like Voracious, he looks {{different}} from the other foxes. Though unlike him, his appearance is of a brown coyote.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> {{meet her}} <b>occasionally.</b> <b>I</b> meet {{her at the}} Square Table Club, where we fight on literature. They call it the Square Table Club, because they {{disagree}} with {{the opinions of the}} most of us real literary people of the town." ...|$|R
60|$|You and I, Cousin Beeminster, seldom meet. But <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> hear of you, {{from friends}} acquainted {{with both of}} us.|$|E
6000|$|Townshead {{looked up}} from his chair. [...] "I fancy that is a {{slightly}} mistaken sentiment. Some men are better dead, and <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> feel tempted to include myself in the category." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} {{think it}} is," [...] he said, with {{a trace of}} dryness. [...] "As I pointed out once before, you {{do not seem to}} remember that <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> had Mr. Sewell and Ingleby here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have not}} settled yet, Wilfrid. I have been longer {{stationary}} here than I {{have been in}} any place since <b>I</b> left college. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>I</b> get a fit of longing {{to be back in}} London again, but it seldom lasts long. However, I suppose I shall yield to it one of these days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are just}} forty-nine {{of them in}} sight, and I should think some eight or ten more {{sleeping}} about under the logs, as <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> discover a new one raising his head.--Look, sir, does your honour see that manoeuvre?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You express {{yourself}} so disagreeably," [...] said she, [...] "one hardly {{knows how}} to answer; what I mean to say is, that <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> allow Isidore the pleasure and honour of expressing his homage by the offer of a trifle." ...|$|E
60|$|It used {{to irritate}} me when I overheard people, as <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> have done, speak of Cynthia as hard. I never found her so myself, though heaven knows she {{had enough to}} make her so, to me she was always a sympathetic, charming friend.|$|E

6000|$|... "If Mr. Ruskin {{thinks we}} have {{generally}} read his publication (sic) I {{think he is}} mistaken; all I know {{of it is that}} <b>I</b> have <b>occasionally</b> seen it quoted in newspapers, from which I gather that he holds peculiar opinions." ...|$|R
60|$|Even now, in {{the midst}} of my honeymoon, I wrote busily. Each morning {{immediately}} after breakfast I returned to my study, where the manuscript of a novel (Her Mountain Lover) was slowly growing into final shape, but in the afternoons Zulime and <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> went sleighing with Dolly and the cutter, or we worked about the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir, if {{you have}} a plan to propose," [...] he said, [...] "state it quickly. We are in a {{position}} of great danger. Those two ladies inside the shed cannot much longer endure this exposure, and I presume that the ladies in your party--although their voices, which <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> hear, do not seem to indicate it--must be in a like condition." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think this}} was a very pretty speech, for a youth of twenty; and I confess I look back upon it, even now, with complacency. If <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> betray {{weakness}} of this character, I beg the reader to recollect that I am acting in the part of an honest historian, and that it is my aim to conceal nothing that ought to be known.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't know," [...] said Corey, {{willing to}} laugh away the topic. [...] "And from what <b>I</b> read <b>occasionally</b> {{of some people}} who go about repeating their happiness, I shouldn't say that the {{intangible}} evidences were always unmistakable." ...|$|R
60|$|Why does Traddles look so {{important}} {{when he calls}} upon me this afternoon in the Commons--where <b>I</b> still <b>occasionally</b> attend, for form's sake, when I have time? The realization of my boyish day-dreams is at hand. I am going {{to take out the}} licence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, {{that you}} are coming, Uncle. You may be sure that, {{whenever}} I can get away from my duties with the general, I shall {{spend most of my}} time in your camp, though <b>I</b> must <b>occasionally</b> drop in on my own regiment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Miss Bowater! She {{is indeed}} clever; a--a {{brilliant}} young lady. The very {{life of a}} party, I assure you. And, yet, do you know, in parochial gatherings, try as I may, <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> {{find it very difficult}} to get people to mix. The little social formulas, the prejudices. Yet, surely, Miss M., religion should be the great solvent. At least, that is my view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{fortunate}} {{that it is}} the fashion of New York to walk to a dinner party," [...] said Bulstrode, as he again took my arm on our way to Crown Street; [...] "for these narrow streets must be excessively inconvenient for chariots, though <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> see one of them. As for sedan chairs, I detest them as things unfit for a man to ride in." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{this work}} the weeks {{went by and}} spring approached. In a certain sense I felt that I was gaining an {{education}} which would be of value to me but I was not earning one cent of money, and my out-go was more than five dollars per week, for <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> went to the theater, and I had also begun attendance at the Boston Symphony concerts in Music Hall.|$|E

30|$|Sometimes {{it seems}} as though the {{professionals}} … don’t really understand how difficult it is for parents to go through the EI process(es). … <b>I</b> have <b>occasionally</b> found myself frustrated by a lack of sensitivity about the realities of time constraints and psychological/emotional and financial resource limitations.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a {{suite of}} rooms there which <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> occupy," [...] Sir Timothy replied, [...] "and there are always thirty or forty {{servants}} and attendants of different sorts who have their quarters there. I suppose that my daughter and I would be there at the present moment but {{for the fact that}} we own this cottage. Both she and I, for residential purposes, prefer the atmosphere there." ...|$|E
60|$|And we {{fell back}} on the guitar-case, and the flower-painting, and the songs about never leaving off dancing, Ta ra la! and were as happy as the week was long. <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> wished I could venture to hint to Miss Lavinia, that she treated the darling of my heart {{a little too much}} like a plaything; and I {{sometimes}} awoke, as it were, wondering to find that I had fallen into the general fault, and treated her like a plaything too--but not often.|$|E
60|$|Chance {{at length}} befriended me. I had {{frequently}} in my ramblings loitered about Hempstead Hill; {{which is a}} kind of Parnassus of the metropolis. At such times <b>I</b> <b>occasionally</b> took my dinner at Jack Straw's Castle. It is a country inn so named. The very spot where that notorious rebel and his followers held their council of war. It is a favorite resort of citizens when rurally inclined, as it commands fine fresh air and {{a good view of the}} city.|$|E
50|$|The {{novel is}} set {{shortly after the}} end of World War <b>I.</b> Characters <b>occasionally</b> discuss the war.
