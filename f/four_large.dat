40|$|This article {{exploits}} a large {{panel to}} study trends in, and determinants of, the {{decisions made by}} the <b>four</b> <b>largest</b> Australian banks about whether to establish or maintain branch- and automated teller machine (ATM) -level presence in a local market between 2002 and 2013. These decisions are potentially important for competition in local banking markets. Our analysis suggests that past presence {{is the most important}} factor for explaining current presence in a particular local market. Moreover, we present evidence that the <b>four</b> <b>largest</b> banks co-locate branches. The relationship between the location of other (smaller) banks and the location of the <b>four</b> <b>largest</b> banks is less clear; there is some limited evidence that this relationship is negative for two of the <b>four</b> <b>largest</b> banks. Our results also suggest that the <b>four</b> <b>largest</b> banks displayed changed behaviour in terms of their branch location decisions after the global financial crisis and that the changes differed between banks. Our analysis of ATM location decisions reveals that the <b>four</b> <b>largest</b> banks follow different strategies. These results suggest that Australian banks did not shy away from this limited form of competition, either before or after the global financial crisis (GFC) ...|$|R

Other scientific endeavours and principles are named after Galileo including the Galileo spacecraft, the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter, the proposed Galileo global satellite navigation system, the transformation between inertial systems in classical mechanics denoted Galilean transformation and the Gal (unit), sometimes known as the Galileo, which is a non-SI unit of acceleration.|$|E
5|$|George Mason {{began to}} build his home, Gunston Hall, likely {{beginning}} in 1755. The exterior, typical of local buildings of that time, was probably based on architectural books sent from Britain to America {{for the use of}} local builders; one of these craftsmen, perhaps William Waite or James Wren, constructed Gunston Hall. Mason was proud of the gardens which still surround the house. There were outbuildings, including slave quarters, a schoolhouse, and kitchens, and beyond them <b>four</b> <b>large</b> plantations, forests, and the shops and other facilities that made Gunston Hall mostly self-sufficient.|$|E

Four R-1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried in place of the AIM-70/71 mines. With a full crew of six members the boats had an underwater endurance of 160 hours which was reduced to 96 hours if the complement numbered ten personnel (four crew members and six naval commandos).|$|E
5|$|The Masonic Hall {{sits at the}} {{southern}} end of a terrace. It has a stucco front, with two pairs of Ionic pilasters; the larger ones frame the building, and appear to support an overhanging cornice with a decorative dentil finish. The smaller pilasters are either side of a large doorway, and are topped by a pediment. The double wooden doors have six panels, and are fronted by six steps which are almost the same width as the building.

5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by <b>four</b> <b>large</b> crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and {{sedimentary rocks}} that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Mélange and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also Paleozoic to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger granitic intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks derived from the North American continent. The rocks of these two terranes are displaced and autochthonous in nature.|$|E
