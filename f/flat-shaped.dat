50|$|With both LTC and NLTC, the {{combined}} loser count {{with these two}} very weak and <b>flat-shaped</b> hands is 24 (12 losers in each hand). According to the LTC formula, there is no trick-taking potential with these hands (24-24 combined losers = 0 winning tricks). We must remember, however, that both forms of the losing-trick count are used only after the partnership knows it has an 8-card fit or better. In addition, losing-trick count predictions assume that all suits will break normally. In this example, given we possess an 8-card spade fit, and assuming the outstanding spades (trumps) split 3-2, the defenders can't prevent the (hypothetical) declarer from scoring one trump trick with these otherwise worthless hands. A losing-trick count formula that doesn't predict one winning trick with these two hands poses a theoretical concern. With NLTC we deduct the total combined losers from 25, not from 24, so the NLTC formula accurately predicts the trick-taking potential of these two hands (25-24 losers = 1 winner).|$|E

This study aimed to clarify the mechanism of hepatic fibrosis of the PCK rat {{from the viewpoint of}} the contribution of pathological cholangiocytes. In liver sections of the PCK rats, intrahepatic bile ducts were constituted by two different phenotypes: bile ducts lined by cuboidal-shaped and <b>flat-shaped</b> cholangiocytes. The <b>flat-shaped</b> cholangiocytes showed reduced immunohistochemical expression of the biliary epithelial marker cytokeratin 19 and positive immunoreactivity for vimentin and fibronectin. When cultured cholangiocytes of the PCK rat were treated with transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1, a potent inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, induction of vimentin, fibronectin, and collagen expression occurred in the PCK cholangiocytes. Although the TGF-β 1 treatment reduced cytokeratin 19 expression, the epithelial cell features characterized by the expression of E-cadherin and zonula occludens- 1 was maintained, and α-smooth muscle actin expression was not induced in the cholangiocytes. Cholangiocytes of the PCK rat may acquire mesenchymal features in response to TGF-β 1 and participate in progressive hepatic fibrosis by producing extracellular matrix molecules, which seems to be a different event from epithelial-mesenchymal transition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Weakly interacted galaxies present {{very simple}} body structure. They are either {{three-dimensional}} objects resembling ellipsoids or <b>flat-shaped</b> disks showing spiral disturbance. Elliptical galaxies present little dust and gas but spiral galaxies demonstrate arms and rings which {{are characterized by}} containing {{a huge amount of}} dust and gas. Since arms and rings are linear-shaped, the body structure of spiral galaxies may be a textured one as earth-bound materials always are. This led to the concept of rational structure which is based on proportion curves. The proportion curves for normal spiral galaxies are all equian-gular spirals which trace or cut through arms consistently. This paper demonstrates the spider-shaped proportion curves for barred spiral galaxies. It shows for the seventh galaxy (NGC 5921) that the curves do trace or cut through arms or rings consistently.

40|$|In {{direct-drive}} {{wind turbine}} systems, intermediate gearboxes are eliminated {{to increase the}} efficiency and reliability of the system. This also reduces maintenance downtimes. The direct-drives necessitate the generator to have a low rated speed. Therefore, permanent magnet machines with high number of poles are favourable for direct-drive wind turbine applications. An interior PM synchronous machine (IPMM) offers a number of advantages such as the availability of reluctance torque, extended constant power speed range. These machines also present an economic edge with the reduced use of expensive rare earth magnet materials. This makes this IPM machine a promising candidate for direct drive wind turbine application. This thesis presents a systematic approach to design an interior permanent magnet machine with concentrated windings for direct-drive wind turbine applications. The initial phase of this work investigates and compares the performances of the interior PM synchronous machine with fractional-slot concentrated winding and the distributed winding in stators and the <b>flat-shaped</b> or V-shaped magnets in the rotor respectively. The design criteria are set to achieve a low cogging torque, low torque ripple, and high efficiency. The cogging torque and the torque ripple are reduced by improving the rotor and stator geometry utilizing the Finite Element Analysis. It was found that the fractional-slot concentrated wound interior permanent magnet synchronous machine can provide comparable performance as that of a distributed wound interior permanent magnet synchronous machine and even perform better on attributes like the cogging torque, power density, torque ripple and the copper loss. The fractional-slot concentrated wound interior permanent magnet synchronous machine with <b>flat-shaped</b> magnet structure is constructed to validate the findings experimentally. This thesis is the only detailed literature so far that investigates and presents experimental validation of the performance of a fractional-slot concentrated wound interior permanent magnet synchronous machine as a generator for direct-drive wind turbine system. This thesis also analyzes the dynamic performance of the prototype machine. The result shows that the existing dynamic control strategies of the distributed wound IPM machine can be easily adopted in a concentrated wound IPMM without any significant changes. The work done in this thesis creates a strong benchmark for future work on fractional-slot concentrated wound IPM machines suitable for direct-drive wind turbine application...|$|E

Notably, this 2 i-induced phenotype was generated from conventional hiPSCs, but not human ESCs (hESCs), thus correlating with the observation of neuroectodermal SOX 1 -positive colonies in conventional hiPSCs, but not hESCs in 2 i+LIF medium.
