40|$|Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) {{that are}} {{observed}} in the Galactic halo, {{are believed to be}} accelerated to large velocities by a process of tidal disruption of binary stars passing close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) which resides {{in the center of the}} Galaxy. It is, however, still unclear, where these relatively young stars were born and which dynamical process pushed them to nearly radial orbits around the SMBH. In this paper we investigate the possibility that the young binaries originated from a thin <b>eccentric</b> <b>disc,</b> similar to the one {{observed in the}} Galactic center nowadays. By means of direct N-body simulations, we follow the dynamical evolution of an initially thin and <b>eccentric</b> <b>disc</b> of stars with a 100 % binary fraction orbiting around the SMBH. Such a configuration leads to Kozai-Lidov oscillations of orbital elements, bringing considerable amount of binaries to close vicinity of the black hole. Subsequent tidal disruption of these binaries accelerates one of their component to velocities well above the escape velocity from the SMBH while the second component becomes tightly bound to the SMBH. We describe the main kinematic properties of the escaping and tightly bound stars within our model and compare them qualitatively to the properties of the observed HVSs and S-stars, respectively. The most prominent feature is a strong anisotropy in the directions of the escaping stars which is observed for the Galactic HVSs but not explained yet. Comment: accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E

We investigate in detail the first object for which a gas disc was discovered (SDSS J 122859. 93 + 104032. 9). Therefor we perform non-LTE modelling of viscous gas discs by computing the detailed vertical structure and line spectra. The models are composed of carbon, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, calcium, and hydrogen with chemical abundances typical for Solar System asteroids. Line asymmetries are modelled by assuming spiral-arm and <b>eccentric</b> <b>disc</b> structures as suggested by hydrodynamical simulations.

40|$|We {{formulate}} a local dynamical model of an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disc</b> {{in which the}} dominant motion consists of elliptical Keplerian orbits. The model is a generalization of the well known shearing sheet, and is suitable for both analytical and computational studies of the local dynamics of eccentric discs. It is spatially homogeneous in the horizontal dimensions but has a time-dependent geometry that oscillates at the orbital frequency. We show how certain averages of the stress tensor in the local model determine the large-scale evolution of the shape and mass distribution of the disc. The simplest solutions of the local model are laminar flows consisting of a (generally nonlinear) vertical oscillation of the disc. Eccentric discs lack vertical hydrostatic equilibrium because of the variation of the vertical gravitational acceleration around the eccentric orbit, {{and in some cases}} because of the divergence of the orbital velocity field associated with an eccentricity gradient. We discuss the properties of the laminar solutions, showing that they can exhibit extreme compressional behaviour for eccentricities greater than about $ 0. 5 $, especially in discs that behave isothermally. We also derive the linear evolutionary equations for an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disc</b> that follow from the laminar flows {{in the absence of a}} shear viscosity.

40|$|We {{consider}} the precession rates of <b>eccentric</b> <b>discs</b> in close binaries, and compare theoretical predictions {{with the results}} of numerical disc simulations and with observed superhump periods. A simple dynamical model for precession is found to be inadequate. For mass ratios less than approximately 1 / 4 a linear dynamical model does provide an upper limit for disc precession rates. Theory suggests that pressure forces have a significant retrograde impact upon the precession rate (Lubow 1992). We find that the disc precession rates for three systems with accurately known mass ratios are significantly slower than predicted by the dynamical theory, and we attribute the difference to pressure forces. By assuming that pressure forces of similar magnitude occur in all superhumping systems, we obtain an improved fit to superhump observations. Comment: 6 pages to appear in MNRAS (accepted...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the growth or decay {{rate of the}} fundamental mode of even symmetry in a viscous accretion disc. This mode occurs in <b>eccentric</b> <b>discs</b> and {{is known to be}} potentially overstable. We determine the vertical structure of the disc and its modes, treating radiative energy transport in the diffusion approximation. In the limit of very long radial wavelength, an analytical criterion for viscous overstability is obtained, which involves the effective shear and bulk viscosity, the adiabatic exponent and the opacity law of the disc. This differs from the prediction of a two-dimensional model. On shorter wavelengths (a few times the disc thickness), the criterion for overstability is more difficult to satisfy because of the different vertical structure of the mode. In a low-viscosity disc a third regime of intermediate wavelengths appears, in which the overstability is suppressed as the horizontal velocity perturbations develop significant vertical shear. We suggest that this effect determines the damping rate of eccentricity in protoplanetary discs, for which the long-wavelength analysis is inapplicable and overstability is unlikely to occur on any scale. In thinner accretion discs and in decretion discs around Be stars overstability may occur only on the longest wavelengths, leading to the preferential excitation of global eccentric modes.

A single differential equation is formulated which describes the propagation, resonant excitation and viscous damping of eccentricity. The theory is first worked out in the simple case of a narrow ring and leads {{to the conclusion that the}} eccentricity distribution is locally suppressed by the presence of the resonance, creating a dip in the eccentricity at the resonant radius.

40|$|Abstract. We review some {{observational}} aspects {{and theoretical}} {{models for the}} formation of the young massive stars in the central parsec of our Galaxy. It is concluded that an in-situ star formation model provides the best description of the data. One possible guess for the initial gas configuration is one circular and another eccentric gas discs, not necessarily coeval during their short lifetimes. The circular disc probably resulted from a mass deposition event long compared with the local orbital time, whereas the <b>eccentric</b> <b>disc</b> should have formed more dynamically. Based on X-ray observations of the GC, we argue that the initial mass function (IMF) of stars formed in these discs is top-heavy. Such top-heavy IMF is most likely a result of inefficiency with which these optically thick discs fragment, and thus may be a generic result for star-forming AGN discs. We also present preliminary results of numerical simulations of star forming discs, showing that stars with a top-heavy IMF can be formed in both circular and eccentric discs.

This, combined with a previous determination of the inclination angle and mass ratio, yields a neutron star and companion mass of M_ 1 = 1. 5 +/- 1. 0 M_Sun and M_ 2 = 0. 31 +/- 0. 27 M_Sun, respectively. The mass donor is thus undermassive for the inferred spectral type indicating it is probably evolved, in agreement with previous studies. Doppler tomography of the H_alpha line shows prominent emission located on the companion and a slightly asymmetric accretion disc distribution similar to that seen in systems with precessing <b>eccentric</b> <b>discs.</b> Strong H_alpha emission from the companion can be explained by X-ray irradiation from the primary.

The main aim of these monitoring observations is to study spectral variabilities in the Be disc, on both the short (a week or so) and long (more than hundreds of days) timescales, by taking long-term frequent observations. Our four-year spectroscopic observations indicate that the V/R ratio, i. e., the relative intensity of the violet (V) peak to the red (R) one, of the double-peaked H-alpha line profile varies with a period of 500 days. The H-beta line profile also varies in phase with the H-alpha profile.

40|$|We {{classify}} {{orbits of}} stars that {{are bound to}} central black holes in galactic nuclei. The stars move under the combined gravitational influences of the black hole and the central star cluster. Within the sphere of influence of the black hole, the orbital periods of the stars are much shorter than the periods of precession. We average over the orbital motion and {{end up with a}} simpler problem and an extra integral of motion: the product of the black hole mass and the semimajor axis of the orbit. Thus the black hole enforces some degree of regularity in its neighborhood. Well within the sphere of influence, (i) planar, as well as three dimensional, axisymmetric configurations-both of which could be lopsided-are integrable, (ii) fully three dimensional clusters with no spatial symmetry whatsover must have semi-regular dynamics with two integrals of motion. Similar considerations apply to stellar orbits when the black hole grows adiabatically. We introduce a family of planar, non-axisymmetric potential perturbations, and study the orbital structure for the harmonic case in some detail. In the centered potentials there are essentially two main families of orbits: the familiar loops and lenses, which were discussed in Sridhar and Touma (1997, MNRAS, 287, L 1 -L 4).
