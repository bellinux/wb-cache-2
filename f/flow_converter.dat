40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dc-to-dc converter, which offers continuous {{input and output}} energy flow, and low input current ripple, applicable and mandatory for photovoltaic arrays, and {{maximum power point tracking}} applications. The PV array yields exponential curves for current and voltage where the maximum power occurs at the curve's mutual knee. Conventional dc-to-dc converters have a relatively high input ripple current which causes high power losses when connected to nonlinear sources like PV arrays. The proposed converter operates with low input current ripple which maximizes the power that can be sourced from the PV array, without the need of any electrolytic filtering capacitance. The effect of the ripple current on the PV array can be significant, and decreases the efficiency of the PV system.

Due to the fluctuating nature of wind power, a dynamic model of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell energy source is integrated with the wind turbine for sudden load changes to ensure reliable and efficient operation of the power system. This paper deals with simulation of a wind turbine based on a doubly-fed induction machine hybrid with fuel cell energy system used in generating mode to produce electrical energy on a power network. Among the various renewable energy sources, fuel cell is gaining more popularity due to their higher efficiency, cleanliness and cost-effective supply of power demanded by the consumers. Wind Energy is gaining interest now-a-days {{as one of the most}} important renewable sources of energy due to its eco-friendly nature.

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{technique of}} hydrodynamic torque <b>converter</b> <b>flow</b> passage was investigated. The semi-automatic model ing technique of torque <b>converter</b> <b>flow</b> passage was proposed. The flow passage model of each converter wheel is con sidered as a revolution entity sliced by two curved surfaces. In order {{to generate the}} revolution entity, a new approxima tion method, condition optimum arc approximation, was proposed. The method was used to approximate the meridional streamlines of {{the inner and outer}} wall. As a result, the three-dimensional revolution entity can be conveniently gener ated. In order to create slice surfaces, the central stream surface of flow passage was approximated with a quadric sur face. The normal vector of the quadric surface and the thickness/thickness-function of bade were used to calculate the discrete point coordinates of blade surfaces. Via the rotation transformation to the coordinates, the discrete point coordi nates of slice surfaces were obtained. A parameterized program code used for the hydrodynamic torque converter de sign and semi-automatic modeling was developed. Modeling errors were calculated and analyzed.
