5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander {{who claimed to have}} had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able to control it.|$|E
5|$|Bravely Default {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Luxendarc, which <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> balance by four {{elemental}} crystals protected by the Crystal Orthodoxy, a religious group with influence across the world. Agnès Oblige, vestal of the Wind Crystal, is forced to begin a journey to awaken the crystals after they are consumed by darkness. Allying with Tiz Arrior, the sole survivor from Norende, amnesiac Ringabel, and Eternian defector Edea Lee, Agnès sets out to awaken the crystals and confront a greater evil responsible for events.|$|E
5|$|Several {{copies of}} his death mask were made and a replica of one is still held at Moyse's Hall Museum. Artefacts from the trial, {{some of which were}} in Corder's possession, are also held at the museum. Another replica death mask <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the dungeons of Norwich Castle. Corder's skin was tanned by surgeon George Creed and used to bind an account of the murder.|$|E

5|$|The show's {{premise is}} that Meyer is a former United States Senator who runs a failed Presidential {{campaign}} before being asked to be the winning candidate's Vice President. As Vice President, her world <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> balance by her assistants: Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky) is the Vice President's chief of staff, while Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) is Meyer's grovelling personal aide. Selina also hires Dan Egan (Reid Scott), who threatens Amy's place in the staff, and Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), a press spokesman. Meyer has no significant other, and requires that her daughter Catherine, from a past marriage, make appointments to see her.|$|E
5|$|The standard's {{design is}} an exact {{copy of the}} {{national}} flag, {{with the addition of}} the Belarusian national emblem in gold. The standard's ratio of 5:6 differs from that of the national flag, making the standard almost square. The standard is bordered by a golden fringe. There are several copies of the standard; the original <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the office of the President while other copies are used on buildings, residences and vehicles to denote his presence.|$|E
5|$|The worm {{removed from}} Bear <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a jar, and another is {{recovered}} {{from one of}} the scientists' bodies. Mulder (believing that the worms are extraterrestrial) wants them kept alive, but Scully feels that they should be destroyed to prevent infection. The group check each other for black nodules and find none, although Mulder reminds Scully that the nodules disappeared from the dog over time. When Mulder finds Murphy in the freezer with his throat cut, the others (including Scully) believe that he has become infected and killed Murphy. Mulder is then locked in a storeroom.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} plant {{specimens}} to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> good condition for future reference, adequate storage conditions are needed.

5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, {{and exposure to}} oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.|$|E
5|$|After the Republic was proclaimed, the {{national}} flag was provisionally adopted as distinguishing {{flag of the}} head of state in place of the royal standard. On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag. Opportunity suggested the most natural solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms; however, under conditions of poor visibility, this could easily be mistaken for the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico, which is also that country's national flag. The standard <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the custody of the Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri, along with the war flag (assigned to Regiment in 1878).|$|E
5|$|Akane {{explains}} that Sigma, after his abduction in 2028, had his consciousness transported into his elder self's body in 2074, while his elder self's consciousness was transported into the younger Sigma's body in 2028. The {{goal of the}} AB project was to enable the elder Sigma to prevent the Radical-6 outbreak in 2028 with his future knowledge; Dio sought to stop the project. Akane makes Phi and Sigma's consciousnesses jump to 2029, after the outbreak. Sigma, as Zero Sr., spends the next 45 years developing the AB project together with Akane, while Phi <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> cold sleep. Sigma creates Kyle as a spare, in case his own body gets damaged. When they again arrive at 2074, Sigma and Phi jump back to 2028 to infiltrate the Mars mission test site.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} choice of what pages to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory (as {{distinct}} from being paged out to auxiliary storage) is important: if too many {{pages of a}} process <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory, then fewer other processes can be ready at any one time. If too few pages of a process <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory, then the page fault frequency is greatly increased {{and the number of}} active (non-suspended) processes currently executing in the system approaches zero.|$|R
50|$|One, Michael Metrinko, <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> solitary {{confinement}} for months. On two occasions, when he expressed {{his opinion of}} Ayatollah Khomeini, he was punished severely.

5|$|As well {{as having}} the {{architectural}} school named in his honour, in 1961 Laybourne Smith was awarded the Gold Medal by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, and prior to that date, in 1948, he was appointed as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Two busts of his likeness have also been commissioned. One was by Rayner Hoff, {{with whom he had}} collaborated on the design for the South Australian National War Memorial, and <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the offices of Woods Bagot. The second was unveiled in 1961, and was sculpted by South Australian artist John Dowie.

5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} at 10 to 14 months. A {{seasonal}} breeder, {{the time when}} mating occurs varies geographically. Mating may peak in the rainy season (August to September). When a female enters oestrus (which lasts for four to six days), it seeks the company of males. During courtship, the male will pursue the female, test her urine to check if she is in oestrus and lick her rump and flanks. Gestation lasts for six to seven months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from November to December in southern Africa. The newborn <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> concealment for nearly a month; the mother pays regular visits to her calf to suckle it for nearly half an hour. Males may guard their offspring from predators and keep away other males. Weaning takes place at four to five months. The oribi lives for 8 to 12 years in the wild, and for 12 to 14 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Dense gases such as xenon and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} can be breathed safely when mixed {{with at least}} 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> an unventilated space.|$|E

The set has a title page and parts for violin I and II, and continuo.|$|E
5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 <b>is</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E
