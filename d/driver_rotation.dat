5000|$|Midway through 2009, Timothy Peters joined RHR from Premier Racing with Strutmasters sponsorship, {{and earned}} his first win at Martinsville Speedway. Peters {{returned}} to the team in 2010 and scored his second win at Daytona en route to finishing 6th in points for the year. Peters {{returned to the}} team for 2011 but had Butch Hylton as crew chief. The team won at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis and finished fifth in points. For 2012, Peters stayed in the top 5 in points for the whole season scoring wins at Iowa and leading flag-to-flag at Bristol. Peters would finish 2nd in points. In 2013, Peters had a rough season, finishing 10th in points only winning at Iowa. He rebounded the following year, leading the point standings for three weeks {{in the early stages}} of the year and triumphing at Talladega Superspeedway en route to a fifth place finish in points. Taking on a leadership role within the organization in 2015 as the veteran on the team, Peters rebounded from early-season struggles to record two wins (one from the pole) and again finish fifth in points. Driving alongside a varying <b>driver</b> <b>rotation</b> in 2016, Peters qualified for the inaugural Truck Series Chase, made it to the final round, and finished fourth.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to construct and validate a conceptual model of the driving task to help evaluate measures of improving the safety of elderly drivers. Physical and perceptual therapies and driver education were the safety measures used to validate the conceptual model. Secondary objectives include evaluations of the effects of physical and perceptual therapies and driver education on the range-of-motion, visual perception, and driving knowledge of older drivers. Data were obtained from 107 older drivers ranging in age from 65 to 88 years to achieve research objectives. The conceptual model was found to be valid in terms of its ability to predict the impacts of safety measures to help elderly <b>drivers.</b> Trunk <b>rotation</b> was improved by physical therapy, visual perception was improved by perceptual therapy, and driving knowledge was improved by the driver education course. It is recommended that further research be undertaken to further validate the model and expand its uses. Further investigations on the use of physical and perceptual therapies and driver education as measures to improve safety of older drivers are also recommended. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Albatross Alpine is {{probably}} the rarest as only around 30 were made. Most were 4-seaters {{but a handful of}} 2-seaters were also built and these were alternatively called Corsairs. All resemble the other 4-seat and 2-seat models with the major difference of having a slipper stern and steering wheel on the left of the cockpit so that the weight of the <b>driver</b> counterbalanced the <b>rotation</b> of the engine which was opposite to all other Albatross boats. (The engine power take-off was {{at the rear of the}} engine, not at the [...] "front" [...] of a reversed engine.) The 4-seaters also have an additional hump in the engine cover to accommodate the Sunbeam engine.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Ballew {{signed on}} ARCA RE/MAX Series driver Kyle Krisiloff, with {{sponsorship}} from ditech. However, after conflicts with Kyle's father Steve, a famous USAC driver, Ballew would release Krisiloff and again field multiple <b>drivers.</b> The <b>rotation</b> included recently reinstated driver Kevin Grubb, Andretti, Mike Wallace, and Busch {{returned to the}} team. The best finish came for Busch, who finished second at Texas. For 2007, African-American driver Bill Lester was tapped to drive the No. 15 truck. However, with ongoing sponsorship difficulties midway through the season, Lester {{stepped out of the}} truck, handing it over to drivers Denny Hamlin, Andrew Myers, J. R. Norris and Shane Sieg. Rookie Marc Mitchell was signed to compete for Rookie of the Year in the 15 with Hyprene Ergon sponsoring for 21 races in 2008. He drove thirteen before being replaced by a variety of drivers, including Hamlin, David Stremme, Ryan Lawler, Kenny Wallace, John Andretti, James Buescher, and Jason White. For 2009, Sieg, Ickler, Aric Almirola, and Blake Feese shared the No. 15. Ted Musgrave, Steve Wallace, Johnny Benson, Nelson Piquet Jr, and Johanna Long shared the 15 in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The primary <b>driver</b> of sector <b>rotation</b> is the {{variability}} of currency values (inflationary, disinflationary, or deflationary) and interest rates. As the economy expands, demand for raw materials creates inflationary pressures, which in turn prompt higher interest rates, which increase {{the value of the}} currency, which reduces the competitiveness of a country's exports as the currency causes them to cost more to other countries. This final stage causes the economy to contract, reducing demand for raw materials, which creates deflationary pressures, which in turn prompt lower interest rates, which decrease the value of the currency, which increases the competitiveness of a country's exports—creating a new market cycle. The relative strength of commodities, bonds, currencies, and stocks shift in this changing monetary climate in a somewhat predictable manner.|$|R
40|$|Finding {{solutions}} to the problems faced by the Ukrainian education system require an adequate organizing structure for education system, enabling for transition to the principle of life-long education. The best option for this is the distance learning systems (DLS), which are considered by leading Ukrainian universities as high-performance information technologies in modern education, envisaged by the National Informatization Program, with the goals of reforming higher education in Ukraine in the context of joining the European educational area. The experience of implementing DLS “Prometheus” and Moodle and the main directions of distance learning development at the National Academy of Statistics, Accounting and Audit (NASAA) are analyzed and summed up. The emphasis is made on the need to improve the skills of teachers with use of open distance courses and gradual preparation of students for the learning process in the new conditions. The structure of distance courses for different forms of education (full-time, part-time, and blended) is built. The forms of learning (face-to-face, the <b>driver</b> complementary, <b>rotation</b> model; flex model, etc.) are analyzed. The dynamic version of implementing blended learning models in NASAA using DLS “Prometheus” and Moodle is presented. It is concluded that the experience of NASAA shows that the blended form of distance learning based on Moodle platform is the most adequate to the requirements of Ukraine’s development within the framework of European education...|$|R
5000|$|From January 2010 313101, 313108 and 313109 {{provided}} <b>driver</b> {{training in}} <b>rotation</b> as a six-car formation, with single units leaving for Stewarts Lane TMD as required for scheduled maintenance.

40|$|International audienceSmartphone usage {{while driving}} is a {{dangerous}} activity directly linked to 17 % of deadly accidents in France in 2015. While it can potentially impact every road user, professional drivers {{are perhaps the most}} affected collective as they spend a high amount of time in their vehicles on a daily basis, whether they deliver goods or transport people. Detecting smartphone usage is interesting for many reasons, from legal controls to forensics investigation in accidents, without forgetting the possibility of alert the driver of the danger he is engaging in. In this study we evaluate the pertinence of using <b>driver</b> head <b>rotation</b> movements to automatically predict smartphone usage at the wheel. In order to fit the system to the particularities of professional drivers, a naturalistic driving study have been conducted. 15 operational vehicles from two private French transport companies were equipped with near-infrared cameras, embedded real-time computer vision and machine learning techniques. Common behavioural patterns have been revealed. Head rebounds are a constant (letting the driver switch gaze between the road and the device). Additionally, the duration a driver spends looking down from a reference neutral direction {{can be used as a}} reliable parameter to predict smartphone usage. On the other hand some divergences between van and bus drivers head movements have been noticed. A real-time smartphone usage detection system has been implemented from the results of this study. Preliminary results are encouraging and a prototype of the system is already being tested by professional drivers in a naturalistic context...|$|R
40|$|In forward {{collision}} avoidance systems, warnings may be provided more effectively if the underlying timing is set earlier than normal when the driver’s attention {{is not in}} the forward direction of the vehicle. In this regard, we determined the following driver characteristcs: (1) the amount of horizontal facial rotation needed to keep track of a moving object in the driver’s field of view increases significantly when the horizontal viewing angle of that target object exceeds 20 degrees, (2) when the driver’s face is oriented in the forward direction, the horizontal angle of facial rotation falls within 15 degrees, and (3) the reaction time to warning lengthens in accordance with the increase in the horizontal viewing angle. In the context of forward collision warning systems, we have determined the difference in the distribution of the <b>driver’s</b> horizontal facial <b>rotation</b> angle, for cases when the driver’ attention was and was not directed to objects in the forward direction of the vehicle. Furthermore, we have measured the reaction time to warning when the driver’s face was not directed forward. Last, our findings were successfully applied to issue the onset timing of a forward collision warning system...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{many studies}} have {{actively}} dealt {{with the issue of}} driver-gaze tracking for monitoring the forward gaze and physical condition. Driver-gaze tracking is an effective method of measuring a driver’s inattention {{that is one of the}} major causes of traffic accidents. Among many gaze-tracking methods, the corneal specular reflection (SR) -based method becomes ineffective, unlike in an indoor environment, when a driver’s head rotates, which makes SR disappear from input images or disperses SR in the lachrymal gland or eyelid, thereby increasing the gaze-tracking error. Besides, since a driver’s eyes in a vehicle environment need to be captured in a wide range covering his head rotation, the eye region is captured in a relatively low resolution compared to face-only images taken in indoor environments at the same resolution, making pupil and corneal SR difficult to detect accurately. To solve these problems, we propose a fuzzy-system-based method for detecting a driver’s pupil and corneal SR for gaze tracking in a vehicle environment. Unlike existing studies detecting pupil and corneal SR in both eyes, the method proposed in this research uses the results of a fuzzy system based on two features considering the symmetrical characteristics of face and facial feature points to determine the status of a <b>driver’s</b> head <b>rotation.</b> Based on the output of the fuzzy system, the proposed method excludes the eye region, which is very likely to have a high error rate of detection due to excessive head rotation, from the detection process of the pupil and corneal SR. Accordingly, the proposed method detects pupil and corneal SR only in the eye region that apparently has a low detection error rate, thereby achieving accurate detection. We use 20, 654 images capturing 15 subjects (including subjects wearing glasses), who gaze at pre-set fifteen regions in a vehicle, to measure the detection accuracy of the pupil and corneal SR for each region and the gaze tracking accuracy. Our experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than existing methods...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{variation}} of surface differential rotation and meridional flow along {{the lower part}} of the zero age main sequence (ZAMS). We first compute a sequence of stellar models with masses from 0. 3 to 1. 5 solar masses. We then construct mean field models of their outer convection zones and compute differential rotation and meridional flows by solving the Reynolds equation with transport coefficients from the second order correlation approximation. For a fixed rotation period of 2. 5 d we find a strong dependence of the surface differential rotation on the effective temperature with weak surface shear for M dwarfs and very large values for F stars. The increase with effective temperature is modest below 6000 K but very steep above 6000 K. The meridional flow shows a similar variation with temperature but the increase with temperature is not quite so steep. Both the surface rotation and the meridional circulation are solar-type over the entire temperature range. We also study the dependence of differential rotation and meridional flow on the rotation period for masses. from 0. 3 to 1. 1 solar masses. The variation of the differential rotation with period is weak except for very rapid rotation. The meridional flow shows a systematic increase of the flow speed with the rotation rate. Numerical experiments in which either the Λ effect is dropped in the Reynolds stress or the baroclinic term in the equation of motion is cancelled show that for effective temperatures below 6000 K the Reynolds stress is the dominant <b>driver</b> of differential <b>rotation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} Jupiter and Saturn often {{emphasize}} their similarities, but recent observations have highlighted important differences. The stratospheres of both planets exhibit an equatorial oscillation reminiscent {{of that in}} Earth's middle atmosphere. Jupiter's oscillation has a 4 - 5 year period, not linked to its season, {{and it has been}} modeled as an analog to the terrestrial quasi-biennial oscillation, driven by the stresses associated with vertically propagating waves. Saturn's equatorial oscillation is nearly semiannual, but wave activity may still be a <b>driver.</b> Jupiter's internal <b>rotation</b> rate is inferred from its steady modulated radio emission. Saturn's internal rotation is more enigmatic. It has been inferred from the modulation of the body's kilometric radio emission, but this period has varied by 1 % over the last 25 years. Saturn's equatorial winds are also puzzling, as those inferred from cloud tracking by Cassini and more recent HST observations are weaker than those from Voyager. Whether this is attributable to a difference in altitudes of the tracked clouds in winds with vertical shear or a real temporal change in the winds is not known. Both winter and summer poles of Saturn exhibit very compact circumpolar vortices with warm cores, indicating subsidence. Titan's middle atmosphere is characterized by global cyclostrophic winds, particularly the strong circumpolar vortex in the winter hemisphere. In many ways, the spatial distribution of temperature, gaseous constituents, and condensates is reminiscent of conditions in terrestrial winter vortices, albeit with different chemistry. The meridional contrast in Titan's tropospheric temperatures is small, only a few kelvins...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the changes and <b>drivers</b> of crop <b>rotation</b> {{patterns}} in the United States and their implications to nitrogen loading using principally the Cropland Data Layers (CDL) produced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). We determined the temporal changes for different crops in the United States using different time periods from 2003 to 2011. Annual, biannual, and four-year rotation patterns were quantified and the trends of monocultural cropping practices were analyzed. ^ The price of crops, changes in policies and expansion of ethanol production were found to contribute to the observed shift in crop rotation strategies. The impact of ethanol plants on corn monoculture was analyzed using different sized buffers and a continuous distance raster. We found that the closer to an ethanol plant, the higher likelihood that corn is planted continuously. The results also showed the direct effect of policy changes as well as changes in crop prices. ^ With the increase in corn monoculture there is an increase in the required amount of applied nitrogen fertilizer to attain desired yields. We developed a model based on the corn yield potential of different soils combined with the recommended amount of applied nitrogen for different corn rotation practices at a national scale from 2009 to 2011. ^ Our results were within 1 percent of National Agricultural Statistic Services (NASS) estimated nitrogen use for corn in 2009 and 2010. The model allowed us to spatially determine the distribution of nitrogen used for corn growth as well as to create scenarios to simulate the potential changes to nitrogen loading if all corn was grown in rotation or if all corn was grown in monoculture. We found that changes in crop rotations can have as much if not greater impact on the total amount of recommended nitrogen applied for corn production as the increased nitrogen from the yearly growth in corn production. ^ Using the nitrogen model, we developed a user interface that allows a land manager or farmer to select their area of interest. The interface calculates the contribution to the total applied nitrogen within each intersected 12 digit hydrologic unit from a selected area of interest and the desired rotation practice. The interface then determines how much nitrogen would be used if the manager changes their rotation practices. ...|$|R
