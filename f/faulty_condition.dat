50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a <b>faulty</b> <b>condition</b> occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

Among different types of PM machines, five-phase BLDC machines are very interesting in fault tolerant applications of PM drives. Torque improvement in five-phase BLDC machines can be accomplished by optimizing their mechanical structure or by enhancing their controlling methods. New current controllers are proposed in this thesis {{to improve the quality of}} generated torque under normal operations of five-phase BLDC machines. Proposed current controllers are based on combination of predictive deadbeat controlling strategy and Extended Kalman Filter estimation. These controllers will be the basis for accurate faulty operation of the motor. Operation of five-phase BLDC machines under <b>faulty</b> <b>conditions</b> has also been considered in this study. To improve the generated torque under <b>faulty</b> <b>conditions,</b> both amplitude and phase angle of fundamental and third current harmonics are globally optimized for the remaining healthy phases. Under <b>faulty</b> <b>conditions,</b> appropriate reference currents of a five-phase BLDC machine have oscillating dynamics both in phase and rotating reference frames.

40|$|With current {{advances}} in sensors and information technology, online measurements of process variables become increasingly accessible for process control and monitoring. Such measurements {{may take the}} shape of curves rather than scalar values. The term Multichannel Functional Data (MFD) is used to represent the observations of multiple process variables {{in the shape of}} curves. Generally MFD contains rich information about processes. The challenge of process control in MFD is that Statistical Process Control (SPC) is not directly applicable. Furthermore, there is no systematic approach to interpret the complex variation in MFD. In this research, our objective is to develop an approach to systematically analyze the complex variation in MFD for process change detection and process <b>faulty</b> <b>condition</b> discrimination. The main contributions of this thesis are: MFD decomposition, process change detection, and process <b>faulty</b> <b>condition</b> discrimination. We decomposed MFD into global and local components. The approach reveals global and local variations that are due to global signal shifts and local variations. Global variation was extracted using weighted spline smoothing technique, whereas, local variation was obtained by subtracting the global variation from original signals. Weights were obtained using the local moving average of the generalized residuals. The proposed approach helps in process change detection and process <b>faulty</b> <b>condition</b> discrimination based on further MFD analysis using Principal Curve Regression (PCuR) Test. For process change detection, global variation component was used in the PCuR test. In-control global data sets were used as training data to detect process change that is due to global and local variation. On the other hand, for <b>faulty</b> <b>condition</b> discrimination purpose, local variation component was used in the PCuR test. In-control local variation data sets were used as training data in the PCuR test; therefore, process <b>faulty</b> <b>condition</b> that is due to local variations remains in control, whereas, process <b>faulty</b> <b>condition</b> that is due to global shifts appears as random out of control points in the PCuR test.
