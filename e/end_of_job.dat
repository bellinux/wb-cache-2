'At 7.30 the breeze came up, and the big drops began, when suddenly a bright forked flash so sustained that it held its place before our eyes like an immense white-hot crooked wire, seemed to fall on the deck, and be splintered there. But one moment and the tremendous crack of the thunder was alive and around us, making the masts tremble. For more than an hour the flashes were so continuous that I think every three seconds we had a perfect view of the whole horizon. I especially remember the firmament between the lurid thunder clouds looking quite blue, so intense was the light. The thunder rolled on without cessation, but the tremendous claps occurred only at intervals. We have no lightning conductor, and I felt somewhat anxious; went below and prayed God to preserve us from lightning and fire, read the magnificent chapter at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Job.</b> As the storm went on, I thought that at that very hour you were praying [...] "From lightning and tempest, good Lord, deliver us." [...] We had no wind: furious rain, repeated again from midnight to three this morning. About eleven the thunder had ceased, but the broad flashes of lightning were still frequent. The lightning was forked and jagged, and one remarkable thing was the length of time that the line of intense light was kept up, like a gigantic firework, so that the shape of the flash could be drawn with entire accuracy by any one that could handle a pencil. It was a grand and solemn sight and sound, and I am very thankful we were preserved from danger, for the storm was right upon us, and the danger must have been great.' ...|$|E

50|$|Throughout history {{non-indigenous}} {{members of}} minority groups have been absorbed into military service. Examples of this practice in ancient armies include Hannibal's use of Ethiopian soldiers, the Roman Auxilia, the Byzantine Empire's recruitment of the Middle Eastern population, and the Ottoman Empire's use of religious minorities through the Millet system. In these cases where military service was voluntary, minorities saw it as an opportunity to progress socially in the society, and perhaps achieve citizenship for themselves and by extension, to their children. For most of the history of minority groups in military organizations, minorities were often segregated from the dominant racial group by forming separate contingents for such groups. This was true in ancient military organizations, but also in a more recent historical context through the French-Canadian regiments of Canada during World War I, and World War II, the British army and their conscription of various minority groups from their conquests during colonialism, and the segregation of minority groups into Caucasian commanded, minority composed, regiments during similar time periods as mentioned previously. In the case of the United States, African-American participation in the military after World War II was high due to the better treatment afforded African-Americans in the military by Caucasian members. With the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> exclusion by 1954 reenlistment rates increased on average until they were close to double that of Caucasian servicemen. A similar situation arose in the United Kingdom with minority participation, but both situations saw a sharp disparity in upper rank distribution, as both had, and to a lesser extent, still have a disproportionately low level of upper ranked minorities.|$|E

40|$|In Pakistan approx. 30 % of the 18, 000 known leprosy {{patients}} have {{dropped out of}} their treatment programs. To investigate reasons for such widespread noncompliance, 128 diagnosed leprosy patients [...] 59 outpatients and 69 inpatients [...] were interviewed in Karachi. More {{than half of the}} 'noncompliant' outpatients denied having the disease. Denial was found to be an understandable coping mechanism in view of the severe stigma associated with leprosy. The presence of close-knit extended families, in which joint decision-making was the norm and in which such a dread diagnosis could spel the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> and marriage prospects for even distant relatives, contributed to the likelihood of denial. In such a setting, the very term 'noncompliant' appeared to be an oversimplification since it covered so many different types of culturally-constrained behavior. In addition, many of the patients who initially seemed most 'compliant' by virtue of being long-term hospital inpatients in fact owed their hospitalization to the fact they had been markedly noncompliant in the past. Thus the usual view that adherence to a biomedical treatment regimen constitutes 'compliance' and that nonadherence to such a regimen constitutes 'noncompliance' proved inadequate for understanding the health behavior of these Third World leprosy victims. The study also showed that many patients had initially consulted traditional healers, inadequately-trained physicians, and/or untrained medical practitioners for treatment of their symptoms, which resulted in lengthy delays before they were correctly diagnosed. Further, even after the diagnosis was made and appropriate medications were prescribed by trained personnel, most patients were not told what had caused their leprosy and how the drug regimen worked to combat it: when questioned, only 4 % of the 128 respondents attributed the disease to infectious organisms. In addition, patients were usually not warned in advance of the possibility of undesirable side effects from their leprosy medications, which led to further 'compliance' problems. The findings of this study emphasize the need for better training of physicians and other health care providers in early diagnosis of leprosy and better health education of diagnosed patients. To be truly effective, the treatment of leprosy must include counseling of extended families and education of the public at large as well as enhanced communication with the patients themselves. compliance denial leprosy Pakistan patient education primary health care stigma...|$|E

The former approach requires mainly data in time stamped event form, while the latter needs them {{in the form of}} sequences. As for the first approach, where classical tools are survival curves and regression like risk models such as the widely used proportional hazard Cox model, we will discuss the advantages of survival trees. Their principle consists in recursively partitioning the data at hand by means of explanatory variables so as to get groups with survival curves or hazard functions that differ as much as possible from one group to the other. This tree approach advantageously complements classical regression like models by their ability to automatically detect the most significant interaction effects. Sequential data analysis is less popular though it is best suited for analyzing whole trajectories in a holistic way. Discrete Markov models are sometimes used, especially in mobility analysis for analyzing the transition rates between states. Clustering of sequences using optimal matching is also a very powerful descriptive analysis tool. In this framework, we are mainly interested in: 1. Mobility trees, which are just classification trees where the present state serves as target class variable and the previous states belong to the set of predictors, and 2. In exploiting algorithms developed in the data mining area for finding frequent subsequences and associations between subsequences in for instance web logs or DNA sequences. We expect such tools to be helpful for discovering relevant relationships between for example characteristic family life subsequences and professional subsequences. Even though the project started only at the beginning of February 2007, we are able to present our very first results. Using data from the SHP panel data we present mobility trees for the working status (full time active, part time active, unemployed, non active). This exhibits interesting interactions between previous states and the education level. For instance, women with lower education (less than full time vocational school) have much higher chances to leave the labor force after having been active occupied than those with higher education. Using the 2002 biographical SHP survey, we present a first attempt of survival tree for analyzing marriage duration until divorce. One important result that follows from this analysis is how the role of the child as a moderator of the divorce hazard depends upon the birth cohort: the child seems to become cement for the marriage only for those born after 1940. Regarding the association between frequent subsequences, we will investigate, using among others implication graphs, the relationship between selected event subsequences...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{research}} was conducted {{by means of a}} study of literature and empirical methods. The literature study demonstrated that CSTs (Control System Trips) are very critical throughout the project life cycle in the chemical industry. There is however, a lack of engineering management interaction throughout the different phases, as well as effective front end loading and knowledge of CSTs. Knowledge gained from the literature study as well as personal experience, insight and practical knowledge of this field of engineering management were used to construct a plan that can be used throughout all the different phases of a project in the chemical industry herein referred to as the CSTMP (Control System Trip Management Plan) in South Africa. The CSTMP was developed for each different phase of a project. The plan covers all reviews, tests, interface management, engineering management, and risk management, <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> / phase documentation, and so forth. The researcher submits that the CSTMP constitutes the issue of the new knowledge that he has contributed to the science of Engineering Management. The CSTMP is developed in detail in Chapter 4 of this work. The CSTMP was applied to the Nigel PPS (Pressure Protection Station) project for evaluation. The CSTMP was not used until the basic engineering phase and calculated assumptions were made to compute the possible loss in cost. The Nigel PPS project was part of the natural gas network conversion project. The project consisted of the conversion of the Gauteng network from hydrogen-rich gas to natural gas from Mozambique. The total cost of the conversion was R 373 million and it was successfully completed in June 2004. It is estimated that by implementing the plan, 4. 7 % of the cost could have been saved. The CSTMP was validated by means of several questionnaires, completed by control system engineers as well as by technologists and technicians. The aim of the questionnaires was to determine their knowledge regarding the importance of CSTs during project phases. The CSTMP was tested by means of two additional questionnaires which were issued to a dedicated group of engineering managers. The first questionnaire was analysed to determine the engineering managers' knowledge and competence. The second questionnaire was issued after a presentation on the CSTMP to determine the engineering managers' knowledge and acceptance of the CSTMP. The resulting data were statistically analysed and documented to confirm that the CSTMP will indeed make a contribution to the chemical industry in South Africa. The problem statement addressed by this thesis states that projects in the chemical industry are executed without due cognisance of the engineering management of CSTs, causing rework, unsafe conditions, insufficient front end loading and no continuity in resources. It is crucial that an effective CSTMP is maintained throughout project phases for each new or refurbished project. The CSTMP could be applied to non-chemical plants in the industry. The lack of a well structured and integrated CST management plan is a root cause of the lack of engineering management effort with respect to CST Management. The following main conclusions were drawn {{as a result of this}} work: • Engineering managers should take cognisance of the requirements of a CSTMP and should implement such as part of their risk management accountability. The CSTMP will help engineering managers to understand and consequently, accept accountability for CSTs during all the different phases of a project. • There will be a definite cost saving if a formal CSTMP is implemented during a project. Rework will be cut to a minimum and actions will follow in a logical sequence during each phase of a project. This was measured on a single project and could not be executed on several different types of projects, due to time and practical constraints. The CSTMP will also improve the front end loading of a project, due to better management. • The CSTMP will ensure continuity across identified project phases. The plan will also highlight the importance of the CSTs on all the phases of a project. This enables the control systems engineer to become involved earlier in a project in identifying possible risks as well as continuity during the FAT (Factory Acceptance Test). During the FAT, all designs are integrated into a dedicated system, interfaces are clarified and training (operation and maintenance) finalised. An effective FAT will ensure a quicker and safer startup of a plant. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|Both {{individual}} characteristics and organizational internal structure are {{significantly related to}} employees' participation in both kind of education and training, namely the firm-provided as well as self-chosen and paid education and training outside the firm. Those employees who are male and younger, those who are at higher <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> hierarchy, those who experienced more internal mobility, {{are more likely to}} participate in both kinds of education and training. They take the advantage of both kinds of education and training programs. Cases of this study include 31736 employees from 410 enterprises, randomly sampled at China's county level from different regions in terms of economical development. Multilevel logistic regression was employed to model the impact of region, firm and individual characteristic on employees' participation in adult education and training. Dependent variables are classified in three groups in this study: (a) those employees who participated in the training provided by firm only, (b) those employees who participated in self-chosen and self-paid adult education and training outside firm only, and (c) those employees who participated in both two kinds of adult education and training. In regard to employees' participation in firm provided training only, the labor market structural factors and the firms' internal organizational structure had the most explaining power, between these two firms' internal market characteristics had greater impact. A job position that an employee obtained is his/her niche in the labor market. The characteristics of an internal market is decisive for allocating training opportunities. Those employees at a position in advantage are likely to participate in firm supported training. That is, the higher an employee is at occupational hierarchy, the longer a person has worked in current firm, the greater the extent to which an employee has experienced changes in the workplace, the more likely that employee would take part in firm provided training. In the context of global market and knowledge economy development, adult education and training are regarded as an important factor in keeping economic growth in China. They also become a means for individuals to acquire knowledge, skills and to enhance human capital, thus improving their ability in the job market. In the fast-growing market-oriented economy in China, many employees have been involved in job-related education and training of various kinds. In the transition from the planned to a market economy, firms are more autonomous in the organization of production, and individuals are free to pursue their occupational aspirations. Firms and individual started to take responsibilities to invest in education and training in order to acquire competence. It is interesting to study who participate in adult education and training as an opportunity to update job skills. It is important to understand if that would have implications in improving the workforce quality. The empirical analyses supported the hypothesis that employees' participation in adult education and training is determined by both {{individual characteristics}} and multi-level labor market structures. Both employees and their firms are embedded in certain social structure that could be facilitating or constraining in terms of making educational opportunities available to firms and individual employees. The findings clearly show that patterns of the three groups of independent variables having impact on the three types of participation choices vary. These findings show that employees' participation in education and training is related to individual characteristics acquired before entering the labor market, and it is also related to the characteristics of labor market. Making education and training available for employees has become a practice to improve competence, which is vital to maintain sustainability. Therefore, it should give consideration to improving equality of participation for different groups of employees and reducing disparity between regions. A mechanism is necessary to coordinate education and training among sectors, such including education, economic sector and the government administration for the workforce. That would encourage the exchange of information between sectors and improve cooperation in developing programs for the workforce. In such a way, adult education and training can play an important role and meet skill training needs for different social groups. This thesis takes employees' participation in education and training for a study. It is focused on the following research questions: Who had an opportunity to participate in adult education and training during the economic reform in mainland China? What are the factors affecting employees' participation? Based on human capital theory, labor market segmentation theory and organization theory, it is hypothesized that employees' individual characteristics, the firms' internal structural characteristics, and the firms' characteristics in relations to labor market all these multi-level factors have impact on employees' participation in adult education and training. Independent variables are accordingly deduced into three groups. Individual characteristics are those achieved status possessed by employees before entering into the labor market, include age, gender, marital status, initial education level. Characteristics of the firms' internal labor market is represented by the employees' job related characteristics in terms of job position, work experience in years, mobility, and the extent an employee experienced the firms' reform. An employee acquired these work-related attributes after having entered the firm, or being selected by a firm if one's individual characteristics were considered matching in the workplace. Finally, firms' characteristics, reflecting firms' attributes as compared to other firms in the market system, would affect resource allocation and labor requirements. These variables include firm size, the average education year of employee with in firm, the overall mobility of a firm's internal labor market, types of ownership, and the economic industrial sector that the firm belongs to. Whether an employee has participated in self-paid adult education is an interaction of individual characteristics and labor market structure. Those employees who are male, younger, and who had senior secondary education are likely to participate in self-paid adult education. In regard to one's decision of participating in self-paid adult education or not, it mostly related to one's own individual characteristics. As an employee is embedded in the firm and then the firm embedded in the large labor market, his or her action is affected by the labor market structure, too, but those are the secondary factors. 王蕊. 呈交日期: 2006 年 2 月. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2006. 參考文獻(p. 213 - 232).

40|$|Background Much {{recent work}} {{extending}} the field <b>of</b> <b>job</b> characteristics to include {{positive aspects of}} work makes the implicit assumption {{that the absence of}} negative work characteristics is equivalent to the presence of positive work characteristics. Aims To consider the effect sizes seen at different <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> characteristic dimensions and to compare the impact of the presence and absence <b>of</b> <b>job</b> characteristics in association with mental health and well-being outcomes. Methods Data from 8755 workers were analysed to compare the impacts of the presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>job</b> characteristics (job demand, extrinsic effort and social support) in associations with both positive (job satisfaction) and negative (work-related stress) outcome measures. Results Comparable presence and absence impacts were apparent for extrinsic effort in association with work-related stress. However, in the association between job demand and work-related stress, the presence of high levels <b>of</b> <b>job</b> demand had a significantly greater impact than the absence of high levels <b>of</b> <b>job</b> demand; while in the association between social support and job satisfaction, the absence of high levels of social support had a significantly greater impact than the presence of high levels of social support. Conclusions It is not always appropriate to assume that the absence of negative aspects of the work environment is equivalent to the presence of positive aspects...|$|R
