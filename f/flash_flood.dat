40|$|This paper {{examines}} the {{spatial distribution of}} frequency of <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> along with their seasonal distribution. The spatio-temporal analysis of past <b>flash</b> <b>flooding</b> covered 124 <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> affecting areas of Slovenia between 1550 and 2015. <b>Flash</b> <b>floods</b> are most common in the mountainous and hilly area of northern Slovenia, which consists of alpine and {{a large part of}} subalpine landscapes. Autumnal <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> occur across most of the country, while summer <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> are seen mainly in the east.

50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>floods</b> {{most often}} occur in {{normally}} dry {{areas that have}} recently received precipitation, {{but they may be}} seen anywhere downstream from the source of the precipitation, even many miles from the source. In areas on or near volcanoes, <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> have also occurred after eruptions, when glaciers have been melted by the intense heat. <b>Flash</b> <b>floods</b> are known to occur in the highest mountain ranges of the United States and are also common in the arid plains of the Southwestern United States. <b>Flash</b> <b>flooding</b> can also be caused by extensive rainfall released by hurricanes and other tropical storms, as well as the sudden thawing effect of ice dams. Human activities can also cause <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> to occur. When dams fail, a large quantity of water can be released and destroy everything in its path.|$|R

5|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>flood</b> {{warnings}} {{were issued}} across northern Thailand on April29 under {{the threat of}} heavy rains from Mala's remnants.|$|E
5|$|After degenerating into {{a remnant}} low on September10, {{moisture}} {{associated with the}} former tropical cyclone spread across the Southwestern United States. Aided by above-average water vapor levels and the aforementioned upper-level trough, scattered thunderstorms developed across the region on September14. Two major incidents of flash flooding resulted in 21deaths in Utah, the deadliest <b>flash</b> <b>flood</b> event in the state's history. The previous deadliest event was on August13, 1923, when seven people died near Farmington.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm formed, {{officials}} in Galveston County, Texas issued a voluntary evacuation for {{the western end of}} Galveston Island, as the area was not protected by the Galveston Seawall. The ferry from the island to the Bolivar Peninsula was closed, while voluntary evacuations were issued in Surfside in Brazoria County. When the National Hurricane Center issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings from Sargent, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana. After the storm made landfall, <b>flash</b> <b>flood</b> watches and warnings were issued for numerous areas in eastern Texas.

50|$|The Somali <b>Flash</b> <b>Floods</b> are a {{group of}} <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> that occur {{annually}} {{in the country of}} Somalia. The floods are a result of the Gu rains, which is the monsoon like rainfall that comes every March in the region. Every year, in the period shortly after the Gu rains from March to July, <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> hit the lower Jubba and lower Shabelle regions of Somalia. These <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> cause devastation and destruction, causing casualties and displacement. In recent years, the effects of the floods have increased compared to past floods. This is due to Somali population increase and continuing lack of preparation mechanisms, and they may be exemplified by meteorological reasons as well.|$|R
25|$|On 21 June, about 2000 {{homes were}} left without {{electricity}} and properties were affected as <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> hit Kilmarnock.

5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical cyclone, local National Weather Service offices issued flood watches for portions of South Carolina, much of eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and southeastern Maryland.

Wind and lake wind advisories were posted {{in parts of}} Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a <b>flash</b> <b>flood</b> temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.|$|E

5|$|July 18–20, 2015: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Dolores brought scattered showers and thunderstorms throughout Southern California, breaking many rainfall records and causing flooding. One such <b>flash</b> <b>flood</b> caused {{a bridge to}} collapse which shut down Interstate 10 between Indio and Blythe, effectively shutting off the primary Phoenix-to-Los-Angeles route. The good news was that the rain helped firefighters contain the North Fire within 3 days.|$|E

50|$|A violent pre-dawn {{thunderstorm}} {{known as}} Sumatra squall rattled Singapore {{in the early}} hours, causing <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> in parts of Singapore.

All three areas remained passable to traffic despite the <b>flash</b> <b>floods.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>floods</b> are extreme natural {{phenomena}} that determine numerous property damage {{and loss of}} human life on both global and local level. In order to highlight not only the frequency of occurrence of floods on the rivers in the Land of Dorna but also their effects on the community, we set ourselves to perform a secondary analysis of data provided by Siret River Basin Administration. As a result, one can observe that the highest frequency of occurrence of <b>flash</b> <b>floods</b> {{in the region of}} Dorna is in the spring. During the same period of time (from 1993 to 2003) there were recorded only significant property damages after the <b>flash</b> <b>floods.</b> At the end of this paper we suggested a series of coherent measures in order to combat the negative effects of <b>flash</b> <b>floods...</b>|$|R
