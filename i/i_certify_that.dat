60|$|<b>I</b> <b>certify</b> <b>that</b> in November, 1900, while {{surveying}} in Wyoming, {{my party}} saw two wolves chase a two-year-old colt over a cliff some fifteen or sixteen feet high. I {{was on the}} spot with two others immediately after the incident occurred. The only injuries to the colt, aside from a broken leg, were deep lacerations made by wolf fangs in the chest behind the foreshoulder. In addition to this personal observation I have frequently heard from hunters, herders, and cowboys that big wolves frequently kill deer and other animals by snapping at the chest.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>certify</b> <b>that</b> I {{lived for}} twenty years in {{northern}} Nebraska and Dakota, {{in a region where}} timber wolves were abundant.... I saw one horse that had just been killed by a wolf. The front of his chest was torn open to the heart. There was no other wound on the body. I once watched a wolf kill a stray horse on the open prairie. He kept nipping at the hind legs, making the horse turn rapidly till he grew dizzy and fell down. Then the wolf snapped or bit into his chest.... The horse died in a few moments.|$|E

"The young gentleman whom I met at Arthur's Chocolate House {{had black}} hair, a little cocked nose, and {{was by no}} means so {{fortunate}} in his personal appearance as Mr. Warrington," [...] said the Baron, with much presence of mind. [...] "Warrington, Dorrington, Harrington? We of the continent cannot retain your insular names. <b>I</b> <b>certify</b> <b>that</b> this gentleman is not the individual of whom I spoke at dinner." [...] And, glancing kindly upon him, the old beau sidled away to a farther end of the room, where Mr. Wolfe and Miss Lowther were engaged in deep conversation in the embrasure of a window. Here the Baron thought fit to engage the Lieutenant-Colonel upon the Prussian manual exercise, which had lately been introduced into King George II.'s army--a subject with which Mr. Wolfe was thoroughly familiar, and which no doubt would have interested him at any other moment but that. Nevertheless the old gentleman uttered his criticisms and opinions, and thought he perfectly charmed the two persons to whom he communicated them.|$|E
