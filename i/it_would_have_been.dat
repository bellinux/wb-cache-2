Telefe then asked series creator Sebastian Ortega to make a film. Negotiations were confirmed by producer Pablo Culell, who said that although Underground produces television series it can also produce stage plays and films.|$|E

In addition, Joyce moved south of west for a time at a location where it is rare for tropical cyclones to do so.|$|E
