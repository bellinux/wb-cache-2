Among the applications current in IPM in the Caribbean are resistant varieties, biological control, cultural control systems, and minimal pesticide use. 'Practice what you preach' was clearly the motto of the week, with the seminar participants being thrown into a series of role-play run-ins, simulations, self-criticism sessions, group dynamics and field work, as well as a tough programme of study of background papers which provide a detailed picture of agriculture in the region. By learning-by-doing themselves the 45 participants from 12 Caribbean nations got the message alright. They should soon be emailing each other to announce the much-improved rates of take-up of integrated pest management techniques by the farmers with whom they will apply participatory methods. Not that the seminar thought that it is just a question of farmer take-up. Policy-makers were expected to participate too, by shaping and applying IPM policies which ensure that the farmer is not always tempted by the quick returns offered by chemically-protected harvests. The seminar was co-organised by CABI Bioscience, CARDI and CTA with additional support from the Swissfive-day regional seminar held in Trinidad and Tobago in September 2000, about farmer participation in training in ecological crop management, including integrated pest management (IPM...|$|R

How do you react and cope with all the services and facilities serve in the library? Do you aware that library patron's behavior can affect the librarian to achieve the library's objectives? Based on Jordan P. (1974), the librarians need to achieve specific objectives but the behavior of the library user's and staffs become the barrier to fulfill the objectives. The research or investigation of patron's behavior cannot be done by observations alone. As an example, the assumptions of a boy is sleeping is not true for a boy who is thinking hard for his problem. It may look simple but sometimes it can be more complicated. The user and patron are the essential element of the library and the librarian should be empathetic and understand their users and have to control many types of user's. However, some of the users have some problems regarding their attitude and it becomes some sort of challenges for the librarians to handle it...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} SHOE, {{a set of}} Simple HTML Ontology Extensions {{which allow}} World-Wide Web authors to annotate their pages with semantic knowledge such as "I am a graduate student" or "This person is my graduate advisor". These annotations are {{expressed in terms of}} ontological knowledge which can be generated by using or extending standard ontologies available on the Web. This makes it possible to ask Web agent queries such as "Find me all graduate students in Maryland who are working on a project funded by DoD initiative 123 - 4567 ", instead of simplistic keyword searches enabled by current search engines. We have also developed a web-crawling agent, Expos e, which interns SHOE knowledge from web documents, making these kinds queries a reality.

40|$|I {{bought my}} first zine today! Actually, I had a {{bag full of}} zines ($ 48. 44 worth, to be exact) by the time I left Bizarro-Wuxtry Comics in {{downtown}} Athens. You might say I got a bit carried away. But I've been interested in checking out zine culture for some time now. Several kids I know locally write zines, and Michele Knobel's recent talk [Knobel & Lankshear, 2001] on zines at the University of Georgia piqued my interest even further. Truth is, I've been thinking about zines {{and other forms of}} popular culture a lot this week—largely due to a question directed my way as I worked with some colleagues on a grant proposal to study adolescents ' literacy practices as they engage with popular media. The question had to do with frivolity. Did I think the reviewers of our proposal would dismiss it as being too frivolous? After all, my friends noted, there are teenagers who can't read, and we're proposing to study youth's fascination with zines, comics, videos, CDs, instant messaging, and the like. The question gave me pause, but then I remembered Robert (self-selected Alvermann & Heron 2 pseudonym) from our media club study. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> how he struggled to read in school and yet seemed to have so little difficulty reading text from the Dragon Ball Z series on the computer screen?

40|$|What popular news <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>recall</b> about {{networked}} systems? You've {{probably heard}} about the several hour failure at Amazon's computing utility that knocked down many startups for several hours, or the attacks that forced the Estonian government web-sites to be inaccessible for several days, or you may have observed inexplicably slow responses or errors from your favorite web site. Needless to say, keeping networked systems robust to attacks and failures is an increasingly significant problem. Why {{is it hard to}} keep networked systems robust? We believe that uncontrollable inputs and complex dependencies are the two main reasons. The owner of a web-site has little control on when users arrive; the operator of an ISP has little say in when a fiber gets cut; and the administrator of a campus network is unlikely to know exactly which switches or file-servers may be causing a user's sluggish performance. Despite unpredictable or malicious inputs and complex dependencies we would like a network to self-manage itself, i. e., diagnose its own faults and continue to maintain good performance. This dissertation presents a generic approach to harden networked systems by distinguishing between two scenarios. For systems that need to respond rapidly to unpredictable inputs, we design online solutions that re-optimize resource allocation as inputs change. For systems that need to diagnose the root cause of a problem in the presence of complex subsystem dependencies, we devise techniques to infer these dependencies from packet traces and build functional representations that facilitate reasoning about the most likely causes for faults. We present a few solutions, as examples of this approach, that tackle an important class of network failures. Specifically, we address (1) re-routing traffic around congestion when traffic spikes or links fail in internet service provider networks, (2) protecting websites from denial of service attacks that mimic legitimate users and (3) diagnosing causes of performance problems in enterprises and campus-wide networks. Through a combination of implementations, simulations and deployments, we show that our solutions advance the state-of-the-art. by Srikanth Kandula. Thesis (Ph. D.)
