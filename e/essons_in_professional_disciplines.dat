40|$|In {{exploring}} phenomenological literature, it {{is evident}} that the term ‘phenomenology’ holds rather different meanings depending upon the context. Phenomenology has been described as both a philosophical movement and an approach to human science research. The phenom- enology of Husserl, Heidegger, Gadamer, and Merleau-Ponty was philo- sophical in nature and not intended to provide rules or procedures for conducting research. The Canadian social scientist, van Manen, however, introduced specific guidelines for conducting human science research, which is rooted in hermeneutic phenomenology and this particular method has been employed <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> such as education, nursing, clinical psychology, and law. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the difference between the phenomenological method as described by van Manen and that of other philosophers such as Husserl, Heidegger, Gadamer, and Merleau-Ponty. In so doing, the author aims to address the blurred boundaries of phenomenology as a research method and as a philosophical movement and highlight the influence of theseblurred boundaries on nursing knowledge development...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge is a {{defining}} characteristic of professions but, given the ever‐increasing knowledge base, curricula <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> are becoming overcrowded. This paper discusses propositional/declarative knowledge {{in relation to the}} accounting knowledge base. Historically, professional areas such as medicine, law and accountancy have expanded their curriculum to encompass new areas. However, core curricula have been introduced recently in medicine and law to provide space for the development of wider skills, to equip students for lifelong learning and to enable them to tailor their study in line with interests, aptitudes and career intentions. These core curricula are examined in order to assess the arguments for and against a core curriculum for accounting. The paper concludes that the introduction of core curricula in undergraduate accounting education could address the problem of the increasing knowledge base while providing breadth, opportunities for developing interpersonal skills and allowing students to tailor their degrees. In this way, the vocational and academic aspects of undergraduate accounting education could be balanced more effectively...|$|R

40|$|Threshold Concepts {{had been}} {{identified}} that related to learning to be a researcher. The tentative threshold concepts included the concepts of: knowledge creation, argument, theory, framework, analysis and research paradigm.

However, {{knowledge and understanding of}} the Threshold Concepts noted above does not necessarily address the issue of the research candidate who appears to be able to demonstrate some of these concepts but still has difficulty with completing a quality doctorate. In particular, considerable anecdotal evidence suggests that some mature-age candidates, who have substantial professional experience, seem to be challenged more than one might expect in appreciating as Trafford and Leshem (2009) describe “doctorateness”.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} ways in which university students are introduced to disciplines and thence to the professions based on those disciplines. Design/methodology/approach – E-mail interviews with a broad sample of university teachers in a variety of <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> formed the basis of a grounded theory approach to identification of analytically distinct themes. Findings – Four different approaches were identified from the interview data, labelled as academic, apprenticeship, affective, and experiential. While these themes represent distinct approaches to introductory classes <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> fields, and have been described independently in the paper, in practice most teachers would use combinations of them. Research limitations/implications – The research represents a first stage in investigating approaches to introducing students to a discipline and profession. No claim is made to randomness, completeness or representativeness of the sample, which indeed was heavily based on colleagues in the broad area of pedagogy and teacher preparation. Practical implications – Teachers of introductory classes <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> can recognise their own approaches in the themes identified, and can consider a broader range of approaches based on the complete results. Workplace supervisors can consider diverse approaches utilised in academic settings. Social implications – Findings can contribute towards an awareness of the effect of introductory approaches to disciplines and professions in university classes, with potential implications for the way that university-trained professionals are accepted into the workplace. Originality/value – The research, unusually, shifts the focus from the end stage of professional education at university to the initial level. The investigation may form the basis of further research. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Classroom {{discourse}} analysis {{has contributed to}} understandings {{of the nature of}} student-teacher interactions, and how learning takes place in the classroom; however, much of this work has been undertaken in teacher-directed learning contexts. Student-centred classrooms such as problem-based learning (PBL) approaches are increasingly common <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> such as the health sciences and medicine. With the globalisation of education, health science and medical education, PBL classrooms are often sites of considerable linguistic and cultural diversity, yet little is known from a classroom discourse perspective about the language demands of PBL. This paper examines {{the ways in which the}} students and tutor negotiate and construct meanings through language in one first year physiotherapy PBL tutorial at an Australian university, with a particular focus on the ways in which the discourse is regulated in a student-centred learning environment. The analysis of the classroom discourse is underpinned by Hallidays systemic functional linguistics. The findings provide a description of the linguistic resources students draw on to co-construct and negotiate knowledge, as well as show how the tutor, with minimal strategic interventions, scaffolds the students learning. The findings also suggest that the PBL environment can be a challenging one for students whose cultural and language backgrounds are different from that of the classroom...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{challenges}} and criticisms {{attached to the}} conduct of research, none {{the least of which}} is a notion that much of the research undertaken <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> such as nursing may not have clinical and/or practical relevance. While there are a plethora of qualitative research methods that individuals must consider when designing research studies, one method stands out - Grounded Theory (GT). Grounded theory was developed in the early 1960 ’s by Glaser and Strauss. With its theoretical orientation based in sociology, GT strives to understand and explain human behavior through inductive reasoning processes (Elliott & Lazenbatt, 2005). Because of its emphasis on the utilization of a variety of data sources that are grounded in particular contexts, GT provides a natural theoretical fit when designing nursing research studies. In this article, the authors provide an overview of GT and then describe the appropriateness, advantages, and disadvantages of applying it as part of the research design process. Additionally, the authors highlight the importance of taking a reflexive position to stay engaged while interacting with the data, and explore how to apply GT theory to particular research questions and studies. Finally, the strengths and limitations of this method of inquiry as applied to nursing research using a brief case study approach is presented...|$|R

As this article shows, these three professions are facing a knowledge explosion and {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult for new graduates to have covered, even if only briefly, all possible aspects of the knowledge-based curriculum.
