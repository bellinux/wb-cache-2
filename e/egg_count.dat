50|$|Two peaks {{occur in}} the number of larvae present in the colony. The first peak occurs in early June, coming right after the peak <b>egg</b> <b>count.</b> The second, highest peak of the larval {{population}} happens in July at exactly {{the same time as the}} highest peak in the <b>egg</b> <b>count.</b> This is probably so closely matching because eggs hatch into larvae very quickly in July, when the temperature is high. The median count of larvae decreases slightly in August and then rapidly decreases to nothing (zero) in September. The speedy fall in larval population happens because larvae pupate, and late in the season there is increased parasitism of larvae and brood destruction wrought by the adult wasps. In early June, the first pupae appear. Compared to eggs and larvae, the pupal population seems to only have one maximum. The pupal instar has a duration of 18-26 days for P. metricus.|$|E

The yearly maximum point for the <b>egg</b> <b>count</b> occurs in July; {{egg production}} then decreases steadily to zero by September. Once the first brood of worker eggs has been laid, the queen decreases her rate of oviposition as this brood matures. Once they are mature, the queen stops laying eggs.

If the queen is killed, removed, or dies, workers can take over the responsibility of oviposition. In fact, 22% of an emerging brood comes from eggs that were not laid by the initial queen. Surprisingly, the final period of decreasing oviposition rate is not due to old age or mortality of the queen. It is actually due to ovarian diapause that occurs throughout the entire female population of the colony.|$|E

40|$|These {{studies were}} carried out in three {{locations}} representing low, medium and high altitudes in West Java {{to determine the effects of}} season, climate, management, growth and mortality on nematode parasitism in sheep and goats. Basically, the animals in each location were divided into treated and untreated groups with anthelmintics. Animals were weighed and faecal samples were collected every 2 to 4 weeks. Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus spp. were the predominant species of gastrointestinal nematodes recovered from faecal cultures. In low altitude areas, faecal <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> dropped progressively throughout the dry season and rose again with the onset of the wet season. The proportion of H. contortus larvae decreased progressively throughout the dry season and increased with the onset of the wet season, however the opposite pattern occurred with proportions of larvae of Trichostrongylus spp. In medium altitude areas, there was no consistent pattern of rising or falling faecal <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> associated with fluctuations in rainfall. In high altitude areas, there was a trend for <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> to increase progressively after the onset of the wet season even faecal <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> were below 1500 epg.

Treated animals in medium areas maintained low <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> until the end of the trial. Seasonal fluctuation in weight gain of sheep was observed in low areas. Treated animals had significantly lower mortality than untreated animals but the evidence that parasitism contributed to this mortality is persuasive.

40|$|The peri-parturient {{period is}} crucial for {{controlling}} worms as the acquired immunity of ewes is disrupted, resulting {{in an increase in}} faecal worm <b>egg</b> <b>counts.</b> Two hypotheses were tested in this experiment that ewes bred for worm resistance would have lower faecal worm <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> than unselected control ewes, during late pregnancy and lactation, under similar but separate grazing areas; and also that numbers of infective nematode larvae would be lower on pastures grazed by resistant ewes than pastures grazed by unselected control ewes. Faecal samples were collected from resistant and unselected ewes in late pregnancy and early lactation, during the winter rainfall season, and analysed for numbers of Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Teladorsagia circumcincta. Pasture samples were taken 1 week before and 7 weeks after lambing started and analysed for infective larvae. In all sheep, worm <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> rose 2 weeks prior to lambing and continued into lactation. Worm <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> were significantly lower in the resistant ewes from 1 week before lambing to 2 weeks after lambing.

40|$|Acquired {{immunity}} {{influences the}} severity of parasitic disease, but modelling the effects of acquired immunity in helminth infections has proved challenging. This {{may be due to}} a lack of suitable immunological data, or to the perceived complexity of modelling the immune response.

A large data set from commercially managed populations of Scottish Blackface sheep was used, which included relationships between IgA activity and worm length, and between worm length and fecundity.

This realistic but simple model of nematode infection emulates observed patterns of faecal <b>egg</b> <b>counts.</b> The end-of-season faecal <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> are remarkably robust to perturbations in the majority of the parameters, possibly because of priming of the immune system early in the season, reducing parasite establishment and growth and, therefore, faecal <b>egg</b> <b>counts.</b> Lowering the amount of early infection leads to higher end-of-season <b>egg</b> <b>counts.</b> The periparturient rise in <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> in ewes appears to have an important role in supplying infection for the priming of the immune response.

They both cause {{enlargement of the}} spleen, but their relative contribution to the condition of splenomegaly remains unknown in areas where both infections are endemic. Here, we have investigated whether relatively high exposure to both infections has a clinically measurable effect on this condition. Methods 96 children aged 6 – 16 years living along a ten kilometre stretch and within 4 km south of a river that {{is a source of}} both S. mansoni and malaria infections were examined clinically for splenomegaly along the mid clavicular line (MCL) and mid axillary line (MAL). The survey was conducted outside the malaria transmission season. The consistency of the organ was recorded as soft, firm or hard. Mapping of the locations of houses and the course of the river was undertaken. <b>Egg</b> <b>counts</b> were mapped at the household level, as were IgG 3 responses to Plasmodium falciparum schizont antigen (anti-Pfs IgG 3), in order to identify areas with relatively high exposure to both infections, either infection or neither infection. ANOVA was used to test for differences in <b>egg</b> <b>counts,</b> IgG 3 levels and the magnitude of spleen enlargement between these areas. Results 4 contiguous sectors were identified, one where anti-Pfs IgG 3 responses and S. mansoni <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> were both high, one where only anti-Pfs IgG 3 responses were high, one where only <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> were high, and one where both anti-Pfs IgG 3 responses and <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> were low. Spleen MAL and MCL values were significantly higher amongst children from the sector with highest IgG 3 levels and highest <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> but similar amongst children from elsewhere. Both <b>egg</b> <b>counts</b> and anti-Pfs IgG 3 responses were significantly higher in children with MAL values >= 4 cm. Hardening of spleens was associated with proximity of domicile to the river. Conclusions Micro-geographical variation in exposure to S. mansoni and malaria infections can be exploited to investigate the chronic impact of these two infections. These results provide firm evidence that relatively high exposure to both infections exacerbates splenomegaly even outside the malaria transmission season.
