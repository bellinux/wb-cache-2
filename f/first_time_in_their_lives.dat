5|$|In 1928 Constantine {{had signed}} an initial three-year {{contract}} with Nelson, {{to play in}} the Lancashire League. The contract was worth £500 per season, plus performance bonuses and travelling expenses. He remained there until 1937, an unusually long time for a professional to remain with one club. Constantine's appearances boosted attendances and gate receipts for all Nelson's matches, and was of great financial benefit to both the club and the League as a whole. In Constantine's nine seasons at the club, Nelson never finished lower than second, won the league competition seven times and the knockout cup twice. In 1931 Constantine renewed his contract for £650 per season; when in 1935 a rival league attempted to sign him, all the Lancashire League clubs contributed to his wage, which rose to £750 per year between 1935 and 1937. This was far more than the then maximum wage for a professional footballer of £386, or the £500 per season that a top county cricketer could potentially earn, and possibly made Constantine the best-paid sportsman in the country. Consequently, he and his family enjoyed a good standard of living for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alongside {{other ethnic}} groups, Singaporeans of Chinese origin from all social {{backgrounds}} and occupations have achieved significant upward advances in their educational levels, income, and life expectancy and experienced other social indicators. Singapore's rapid industrialisation between the 1960s and the 1990s has lifted numerous {{people out of}} poverty and has created a broad middle class for many Singaporeans. During the period of rapid economic growth the process, many Chinese began experience upward social mobility for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> In 2000, Chinese Singaporeans represented the second highest proportion of University graduates after the Singaporean Indians. In 2008, 86.2% of Chinese Singaporean students achieved 5 passes at O-level, the exams taken by 15- and 16-year-olds, compared to 59.3% for Singaporean Malays and 73% for Singaporean Indians.|$|E
500|$|In June 2017 {{the couple}} bought a multi-million-dollar {{vacation}} home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware near Cape Henlopen State Park, where {{they planned to}} host members of their extended family. [...] They were able to afford such {{a place for the}} <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> due to book deals they signed upon leaving office, with him committed to publishing two books and her one.|$|E
50|$|The 1961 Hawthorn Football Club {{season was}} the clubs 37th {{season in the}} Victorian Football League. The 1961 season was a {{historical}} one for Hawthorn finishing top of the ladder and claiming the McClelland Trophy for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history, reaching the Grand Final for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history, and winning the Premiership for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> history.|$|R

500|$|During, and in {{the days}} {{immediately}} following the assault, {{in many areas of}} the city, vengeful Soviet troops (often rear echelon units) engaged in mass rape, pillage and murder. Oleg Budnitskii, historian at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, told a BBC Radio programme that Red Army soldiers were astounded when they reached Germany. [...] "For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> eight million Soviet people came abroad, the Soviet Union was a closed country. All they knew about foreign countries was there was unemployment, starvation and exploitation. And when they came to Europe they saw something very different from Stalinist Russia... especially Germany. They were really furious, they could not understand why being so rich, Germans came to Russia".|$|E
500|$|It is the Depression. [...] Joe makes a bare {{living as}} {{assistant}} to his father. [...] Mr. Brinker's business has failed, and {{he lives with}} the couple, who are experiencing poverty for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> [...] The poverty affects Jennie more than Joe—the new Mrs. Taylor dislikes life as an impoverished housewife ("Money Isn't Everything"). [...] When she learns that Joe turned down a lucrative offer from a prominent Chicago physician, who is Charlie's uncle, Jennie at first rages. [...] When she finds that is not effective, she gets him {{to change his mind}} through guilt—if he accepts Dr. Denby's offer, he can earn the money to start the small hospital of which his father dreams and they will have the money to bring up a child properly.|$|E
2500|$|The Ottoman Empire had an {{interesting}} relationship with the Republic of Venice. Even though the two states often went to war over the control of East Mediterranean territories and islands, they were keen on restoring their trade pacts once the wars were over, such as the renewed trade pacts of 1479, 1503, 1522, 1540 and 1575 following major sea wars between the two sides. The Venetians were also the first Europeans to taste Ottoman delicacies such as coffee, centuries before other Europeans saw coffee beans for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> during the Battle of Vienna in 1683. These encounters {{can be described as}} the beginning of today's rich [...] "coffee culture" [...] in both Venice (and later the rest of Italy) and Vienna.|$|E

60|$|This was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> {{either had}} ever {{alluded to the}} fact, in the other's presence. Beulah turned pale; she trembled all over, as if in an ague; then she luckily burst into tears, else she might have fainted.|$|E

60|$|So the brethren turned, {{and led by}} a Mameluk, fled aghast for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> {{past the}} long lines of Templars and Hospitallers, who in the last red light of the dying day knelt upon the sand and prayed, while the emirs came up to kill them.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no escape}} for Hypatia; pride forbade her {{to follow her}} own maidenly instinct, and to recoil among the crowd behind her; and in another moment the Amal had lifted Pelagia from her mule, and the rival beauties of Alexandria stood, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> face to face.|$|E
60|$|Before {{that night}} was far advanced, Disco was {{constrained}} to acknowledge himself in error, for a veritable lion did actually prowl down to the camp, and salute them with a roar which had a wonderfully awe-inspiring effect on {{every member of the}} party, especially on those who heard it for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E

6000|$|To Fuller, to Chatfield-Taylor and to me, this {{joke was}} not {{altogether}} pleasant. We knew {{all too well}} the feeling {{of some of the}} writers who were coming. Several of them were seeing [...] "the West" [...] for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> others had not been in Chicago since the World's Fair in '93. All were conscious of the effort involved in reaching the arid and unknown frontier.|$|E
60|$|And {{then for}} the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> they shopped as {{partners}} in one concern. It was Christmas Eve, with its loads a holly and mistletoe, and the town was very full of strangers who had come in {{from all parts of}} the country on account of the day. Tess paid the penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm.|$|E
60|$|Barbara had {{a natural}} {{repulsion}} from her, {{and could not}} understand Armine's being attracted, and for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> this was creating a little difference between the brother and sister. Babie had said, in rather an uncalled-for way, that Miss Parsons would draw back when she knew the truth, and Armine had been deeply offended at such an ungenerous hint, and had reduced her to a tearful declaration {{that she was very}} sorry she had said anything so uncalled for.|$|E

60|$|No one had perhaps {{realised}} {{the amount}} of worry that this arrangement entailed. As Barbara said, {{if they could have}} gone away at once and worked for their living like sensible people in a book, it would have been all very well—-but this half-and-half state was dreadful. Personally it did not affect Babie much, but she was growing up to the part of general sympathiser, and for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> there was a pull in contrary directions by her mother, and Armine.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{worry about}} that,' replied the girl, 'for I've thought it all over, and have {{settled on a}} plan which will make us each able to bear with the other! See, I have had a fur cloak made for each of us, and if we put them on I shall not feel the heat so much nor you the cold.' So they put on the fur cloaks, and set out cheerfully on their way, and for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> quite happy in each other's company.|$|E
60|$|At last some of {{the people}} came to see if the King had succeeded in {{destroying}} the Dragon, and found their monarch running around in a circle, bumping into trees and rocks, but not getting a step nearer home. SO they took his hand and led him back to the palace, where every one was filled with sorrow at the sad sight of the headless King. Indeed, his devoted subjects, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> came as near to weeping as an inhabitant of the Valley of Mo can.|$|E
