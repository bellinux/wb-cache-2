Simulation experiments reveal that: (1) raising the fixed <b>exporting</b> <b>cost</b> to make sales in the EU market brings results that exports of the targeted commodities (motor vehicles and parts for ELV and electronic equipment for RoHS) to the EU from outside regions/countries expand while the domestic trade in the EU shrinks when the importer's preference for variety (PfV) is not strong; (2) if the PfV is not strong, policy changes that may bring {{reduction in the number of}} firms enable survived producers with high productivity to expand production to be large-scale mass producers fully enjoying the fruit of economies of scale; and (3) When the strength of the importer's PfV is changed from zero to unity, there is the value that totally changes simulation results and their interpretations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model aim {{to reconcile the}} discrepancy between the theoretical and empirical depiction of the productivity distribution. The Melitz (2003) while being able to reflect on the asymmetric selection of heterogeneous firms in trade, the model strictly truncate the least productive firms leaving the productivity distribution with a distinctive cut-off threshold at the lower end. This contradicts the empirical findings (Mayer and Ottaviano, 2007). The model in this paper proposed that firms are not only heterogeneous in terms of productivity but also in terms of fixed cost. In other words, viability selection in our model is based on firms’ efficiency (TFP). This model successfully depicts the productivity distributions of active firms in the market that resemble the empirical findings, for which a great range of productivity distribution of exporters and domestic firms overlap. In addition, we show that only when the fixed <b>exporting</b> <b>cost</b> is no less than proportionate to the domestic fixed cost will the ultimate free trade scenario ensures that the weighted productivity in trade be greater than the weighted productivity in autarky. Lastly, trade liberation is always welfare improving, mainly due to the increasing product varieties...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} repositioning {{empty containers}} between multi-ports over multi-periods with stochastic demand and lost sales. The {{objective is to}} minimize the total operating cost including container-holding cost, stockout cost, importing cost and <b>exporting</b> <b>cost.</b> First, we formulate the single-port case as an inventory problem over a finite horizon with stochastic import and export of empty containers. The optimal policy for period n {{is characterized by a}} pair of critical points (A n, S n), that is, importing empty containers up to A n when the number of empty containers in the port is fewer than A n; exporting empty containers down to S n when the number of empty containers in the port is more than S n; and doing nothing, otherwise. A polynomial-time algorithm is developed to determine the two thresholds, that is, A n and S n, for each period. Next, we formulate the multi-port problem and determine a tight lower bound on the cost function. On the basis of the two-threshold optimal policy for a single port, a polynomial-time algorithm is developed to find an approximate repositioning policy for multi-ports. Simulation results show that the proposed approximate repositioning algorithm performs very effectively and efficiently. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|E

These outcomes are the foundation of the widely-used sorting mechanism in the trade models with firm heterogeneity. A particular and novel finding is that high-productivity nonexporters face greater fixed <b>export</b> <b>costs</b> than low-productivity exporters. We also find that the substitution between fixed <b>export</b> <b>costs</b> and productivity in determining export decisions is weaker for firms with higher productivity.

Can we come up with a simple user-friendly formula to calculate the global welfare impact of the simultaneous trade liberalization of a number of countries? How sensitive is the answer to the assumption of the trade model? We find a striking answer to these questions. We find that, for a very broad class of models and settings, the global welfare impact of trade liberalization in a country, or a simultaneous liberalization of a number of countries, is given by the same simple formula. We find that the global welfare impact of the simultaneous trade liberalization of different countries only depends on two sets of statistics: (i) the ratio of the value of bilateral trade between each and every pair of trading partners and global income; and (ii) the change in <b>exporting</b> <b>cost</b> for each and every pair of trading partners. Most interestingly, the formula applies to a very broad class of models and settings, which include the general Ricardian model (including, for example, Anderson, 1979, and Eaton and Kortum, 2002), the models of Krugman (1980), Melitz (2003) and its extensions, and the extensions of these models to the multi-sectoral case, multi-factor production technology, multi-stage production, the existence of tradable intermediate goods and the existence of a large outside good sector in each country.

In these architectures, mediators accept queries from users, process them with respect to wrappers, and return answers. Wrapper provide access to underlying data sources. To efficiently process queries, the mediator must optimize the plan used for processing the query. In classical databases, cost-estimate based query optimization is an effective method for optimization. In a heterogeneous distributed databases, cost-estimate based query optimization is difficult to achieve because the underlying data sources do not <b>export</b> <b>cost</b> information.

Imports per product variety are decreasing in geographic distance, linguistic distance, and other measures of trade costs, consistent with adjustment to these costs occurring along the intensive margin. There is relatively little variation in the number of U. S. movies that countries import but wide variation in the box-office revenues per movie.

The presence of sunk <b>export</b> entry <b>costs</b> and efficiency uncertainty gives rise to hysteresis in export market participation.

The results and the estimated reaction of firms to changes in variable <b>export</b> <b>costs</b> are strongly affected. From a cross-section, we find that the effect of tariffs on exports channels evenly through the number of exporting firms - the extensive margin - and through the exports per firm - the intensive margin. When using the panel structure, only the intensive margin reacts to tariff reductions. To understand what underlies this result, we study the role played by incumbent exporters. The latter are responsible for 95  % of the response of French exports to tariff reductions.
