40|$|Various {{types of}} <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> {{available}} {{to the general public}} are worn for protection against inhalation of dust, pollutants, allergens, and pathogenic organisms. Recent news stories have illustrated the widespread use of <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> for protection against Swine flu (H 1 N 1), Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS), Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus outbreaks in Asia, and dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center. However, the level of protection provided by <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> is unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine how efficiently <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> prevent respiratory exposure to potentially harmful aerosols. Three types of commonly available <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> were tested: a surgical mask, a pre-shaped dust mask, and a bandana. An N 9...|$|R

5|$|Although {{it offers}} the {{greatest}} degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration, tracheal intubation {{is not the only}} means to maintain a patent airway. Alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen, volatile anesthetics or other breathing gases include the laryngeal mask airway, i-gel, cuffed oropharyngeal airway, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP mask), nasal BiPAP mask, simple <b>face</b> <b>mask,</b> and nasal cannula.|$|E

5|$|Hanigan {{spent the}} entire 2009 season with the Reds except for five games with the Bats. He served as the backup catcher to Ramón Hernández until Hernández {{underwent}} knee surgery and {{was placed on the}} DL. Hanigan went on the DL after he was hit on the <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> by a foul tip and suffered a concussion; he returned on August 8, 2009. For the season, Hanigan had the best fielding percentage as a catcher (.998), and the second best caught stealing percentage (42.9) in the majors.|$|E

It has darker and more reddish upperparts with brighter white dots, with more prominent white dots and a yellow-brown tinge to the underparts. It has pinkish grey feet and golden eyes.|$|E

The cover photo also shows a metal bracket on the side of Tittle's helmet which served to protect his face by preventing the helmet from caving in. The 1954 cover was the first of four Sports Illustrated covers he graced during his career.|$|E
5|$|WKU {{opened the}} third quarter on offense, and three plays later Jakes threw an {{interception}} to Deion Belue that was returned to the Hilltoppers' 25-yard line. Two plays after a <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> penalty brought {{the ball to the}} 12-yard line, McCarron connected with Norwood for a 12-yard touchdown reception and a 28–0 lead. The teams again traded punts late into the fourth quarter when Kenyan Drake scored on a 32-yard run to cap a 12-play, 81-yard drive that made the final score 35–0.|$|E

50|$|<b>Face</b> <b>masks</b> for {{football}} helmets today are multibar. The multibar facemasks {{are made of}} a number of materials including titanium, stainless steel, and most commonly carbon steel. Each facemask is coated with Polyarmor G17, a powder coating that is resistant to impact and corrosion. The Polyarmor is a thermoplastic coating used on a number of surfaces. While some organizations purchase new <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> every season, others have their equipment reconditioned.|$|R
5|$|Sometime {{during the}} 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied {{and his body}} was moved for safety, probably more than once. It {{was found in the}} Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the Cartonnage intact. Because of that exquisite <b>face</b> <b>mask,</b> Amenhotep's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} then-champion Petey Williams against Kaz {{in the opening}} contest of the telecast. Williams was {{accompanied}} by Rhaka Khan and Scott Steiner. The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 19 seconds. Williams wore a protective <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> due to a broken orbital bone. Khan and Steiner interfered in the bout several times. Kaz was legitimately busted open during the match after Williams bashed {{him in the face}} with a steel pipe. Williams won the encounter after performing his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver by slamming Kaz head-first into the mat to retain the TNA X Division Championship. Abyss returned after this match by aiding Kaz who was being attacked by Khan, Steiner, and Williams.|$|E
5|$|The female Bohemian waxwing is {{very similar}} to the male, but has a {{narrower}} yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red wing tips, no black on the throat and a smaller black <b>face</b> <b>mask.</b> Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern B. g. centralasiae is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.|$|E

5|$|Akins {{became a}} free agent before the 2002 season. The Montreal Alouettes {{expressed}} interest in signing Akins, but he decided to re-sign with the Tiger-Cats in May shortly before a deadline imposed by head coach Ron Lancaster. In a pre-season game, Akins suffered a collarbone injury when a player's <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> was driven into his chest. He returned in mid-July. In his second game of the season, Akins scored three touchdowns. He scored {{in each of the}} two following games as well. Akins' success was interrupted in late August when he re-injured his collarbone with deep bruising. After Akins returned, he caught an 84-yard touchdown while accumulating 150 receiving yards against the Alouettes. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats did not qualify for the playoffs in 2002, but Akins had his most successful season, catching 38 receptions for 732 yards and 7 touchdowns. All three values were career-highs for the wide receiver.|$|E
5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the face and body of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and yellow flowers of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual <b>face</b> <b>mask.</b> An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen in a photograph of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{five minutes}} into the third quarter, Namath forged another Jets drive, {{following}} an interception by safety Jim Hudson, that ended with halfback Bill Mathis scoring a 4-yard touchdown behind blocking guard Dave Herman to give New York a 19–14 lead. The Raiders responded with an 80-yard drive that saw running back Charlie Smith score his first touchdown of the game on a 3-yard pass from Lamonica. The Raiders took a 22–19 lead on a two-point conversion with Lamonica completing the attempt to receiver Hewritt Dixon. During this drive, Hudson was ejected from the game after being called for a <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> penalty followed by a dispute with an official. As he left the field, he gave the jeering crowd the finger. The penalties caused the ball to be placed at the Jets' 3-yard line, and Smith scored for Oakland one play later.|$|E
40|$|In {{the event}} of an {{influenza}} pandemic, where effective vaccine and antiviral drugs may be lacking, disrupting environmental transmission of the influenza virus will be the only viable strategy to protect the public. We discuss 2 such modalities, respirators (<b>face</b> <b>masks)</b> and ultraviolet (UV) light. Largely overlooked, the potential utility of each is underappreciated. The effectiveness of disposable <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> may be increased by sealing the edges of the <b>mask</b> to the <b>face.</b> Reusable <b>masks</b> should be stockpiled, because the supply of disposable masks will likely prove inadequate.
