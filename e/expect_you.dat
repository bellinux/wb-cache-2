When MacLeod {{revealed}} his immortality to Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit Part Two", she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects: [...] "I was just thinking how lonely you must be. Your parents, your friends... having them all die." [...] Tessa is a very empathic and understanding character, for example, in [...] "Saving Grace", she is jealous of MacLeod's former lover Grace; however, when MacLeod assures her {{that he no longer}} loves Grace, her response is simply that [...] "...that's all that need to be said. She's your friend and she's been hurt. You'll help her. I'd <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to do no less." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{allude to}} his {{supposed}} relationship with Mariah Carey, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof {{he claims to}} have of the couple. The song begins [...] "Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied seeing me. Now I'm pissed off," [...] before describing Carey's impersonation of him in her video, [...] "Oh gee, is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?/ Wow Mariah, didn't <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to go balls out." [...] Eminem continues describing a near-sexual encounter with the singer, threatening to release voice-mails and pictures he still has in his possession. Additionally, the song features a females voice, unknown whether or not Carey's, where she calls herself Mary Poppins, as well as several intervals of her laughter.|$|E
500|$|... "Unusual You" [...] is a midtempo electropop song, {{that has}} been {{described}} by Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press as [...] "synth-centric". The song has been noted by John Murphy of musicOMH to be reminiscent of [...] "Gwen Stefani's quieter moments." [...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Unusual You" [...] "goes for that shimmering waterfall mood first popularized by Janet Jackson rather than strict Madonna-style workouts." [...] According to Chris Richards of The Washington Post, Spears's vocals in the song are transformed into [...] "a spectral [...]" [...] Lyrically, [...] "Unusual You" [...] talks about an experienced woman finding unexpected love, with Spears voicing the lines, [...] "Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to break my heart? / I <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to / So why haven't you?." ...|$|E

500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E
500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> {{to come out and}} play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business". The band released a greatest hits collection entitled A-Sides on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously-unreleased [...] "Bleed Together," [...] which had been recorded during the Down on the Upside recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|A formal United States Navy {{board of}} inquiry, {{known as the}} Hepburn Investigation, {{prepared}} {{a report of the}} battle. The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942. [...] The report recommended official censure for only one officer, Captain Howard D. Bode of the Chicago, for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. Vice Admiral Ghormley was relieved not long afterward. [...] Vice Admiral Fletcher and Rear Admiral Noyes were relieved of their commands. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl, however, never commanded ships again. Captain Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on April 19, 1943, and died the next day. Crutchley was gazetted with the Legion of Merit (Chief Commander) in September 1944. Admiral Yamamoto signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory, stating, [...] "Appreciate the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organization. I <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to expand your exploits and you will make every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle." [...] Later on, though, when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports, he was intensely criticised by his comrades. [...] Admiral Turner later assessed why his forces were so soundly defeated in the battle: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{began its}} interrogations on May 27, 1920. Dean Greenough summoned each witness {{with a brief}} note, for example: [...] "I <b>expect</b> <b>you,</b> {{whatever}} your engagement may be, to appear at my office tomorrow, Friday, May 28th, at 2:45 P.M." [...] Another even said: [...] "If necessary you are directed to cut a final examination {{in order to keep}} this appointment." [...] Only the Court's notes survive, not transcripts, so it is difficult to ascertain the tenor of the exchanges, whether these were conversations, interviews, or interrogations, or perhaps changed in the course of each session. Clearly the Court pressed witnesses and challenged them with conflicting facts, since the Court's notes record admissions followed by attempts to recant, as well as denials followed by admissions. For example, the Court's note for Harold Saxton says [...] "when pushed he practically confessed to one act, but later retracted." [...] And Kenneth Day [...] "confessed to H.S. [...] relations with Roberts, after denial at first." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawking has {{estimated}} that he studied about a thousand hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, {{and he decided to}} answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) necessary. Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the oral to describe his future plans, he said, [...] "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> will give me a First." [...] He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners [...] "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves". After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in natural science and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.|$|E
2500|$|During that weekend, Texarkana {{residents}} {{kept the}} police busy by flooding the station with reports of prowlers. One officer stated {{that nearly all}} of the alarms were the result of excitement, wild imagination and even near hysteria. Farmhouses and neighborhoods blazed with lights. Several businesses, including cafes, theaters and night clubs, lost many customers. One business reported a 20% drop. The evenings were hopping, but the streets were practically deserted when dawn approached. The city became a virtual ghost town. Because of the drop in business, liquor stores closed at 9:30 and posted a statement in the paper saying, [...] "We fully understand the state of mind in which Texarkana is now gripped. And we are selling no liquor to persons who already have been drinking. We do not wish to add further to the troubles of the police. Any person who drinks whiskey at this time to get drunk and wander about the streets of Texarkana is further complicating the works of the police and is placing himself in grave danger of being shot by people whose nerves are on edge from the recent murders." [...] Since citizens were so jittery and armed with guns, Texarkana was a very dangerous place. Officers had to turn their siren on when they drove up, get out and stand in their headlights and announce themselves to keep from being shot by a nervous homeowner. In order to go to someone's house, you had to call in advance and let them know to <b>expect</b> <b>you.</b> A fearful tavern proprietor had shot a customer in the foot who was in search of beer.|$|E
