5|$|In a December 2013 interview, Nirbhaya's parents, Badri Nath Singh and Asha Devi, {{said they}} were trying to get the {{juvenile}} law changed in such crimes as the rape and murder of their daughter. They petitioned the Supreme Court to try the juvenile, just short of 18 when he committed the crime, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> court instead of a Juvenile Justice court.|$|E
5|$|Under the 'Passports Act 2005, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has {{the power}} to refuse, cancel or suspend a {{passport}} on a number of grounds including national security or health.

5|$|Eichmann's trial {{before the}} Jerusalem District Court began on 11 April 1961. The legal {{basis of the}} charges against Eichmann was the 1950 Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law, under which he was indicted on 15 {{criminal}} charges, including crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, and membership <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> organisation. The trial was presided over by three judges: Moshe Landau, Benjamin Halevy and Yitzhak Raveh. The chief prosecutor was Israeli Attorney General Gideon Hausner, assisted by Gabriel Bach of the Department of Justice and Tel Aviv District Attorney Yaakov Bar-Or. The defence team consisted of German lawyer Robert Servatius, legal assistant Dieter Wechtenbruch, and Eichmann himself.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no reason}} why the writ of error should be {{confined}} to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. There is nothing {{in the nature of the}} cases which should make a difference; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> case. They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.|$|E
5|$|A {{year into}} development, Activision {{proposed}} that Black Lotus be made {{part of an}} existing franchise and highlighted similarities to the True Crime series; both games were set in open worlds with plots centred on an undercover cop <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> organization. Sales of previous True Crime games had been disappointing, but Activision felt the innovations in Black Lotus could revitalize the franchise and make the game successful in its own right. Activision attached the game to the series and revealed {{it to the public}} as True Crime: Hong Kong in November 2009. They delayed the game until 2010 to allow further refinement. During this period Hollywood action editor Tony Ciccone was hired to consult on the game's visual identity and animations.|$|E
5|$|The Ratsiraka {{administration}} {{launched an}} inquiry into Tiko business practices in September 2000 and issued an executive decision in June 2001 that the company should be shut down for failure to adhere to a 1996 agreement requiring Tiko to create jobs and produce low-cost vegetable oil; this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court on 16 October 2002. A number of lawsuits have been filed over Ravalomanana's business practices, including a court judgment {{on the eve of}} the 2001 presidential election requiring the payment of between 200 and 363 billion Malagasy francs in Tiko back taxes, but all were either dismissed or ended in an out-of-court settlement; none resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> conviction.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E
5|$|The defense case {{commenced}} on March 25. The third {{count of}} the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton testified that he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton testified that his duties would include acting as a criminal defense attorney for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington. Burton testified that he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, {{and that he had}} only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E
5|$|CT was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> investigation {{conducted by the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the mid-1990s of Ed's Transmission, a transmission shop in Everett used by the agency for bus parts. Detectives from the FBI and Snohomish County Sheriff seized records from both parties and began a two-month audit of Community Transit management. The auditors released a report that criticized the management style of Executive Director Ken Graska and his department heads, leading to the former's resignation in December 1993 after nine years at his position. Federal prosecutors accused Ralph Woodall, the 50-year-old co-owner of the shop, of 15 counts of mail fraud after intentionally overbilling for transmission repairs. Community Transit Maintenance Director Michael Lynn resigned after confessing that he had accepted gifts from Woodall in exchange for sending all of CT's transmissions to Ed's Transmissions without going through competitive bidding. A U.S. District Court jury found Woodall guilty of 15 counts of mail fraud in December 1996, with Judge John C. Coughenour sentencing him to 2.5 years in federal prison the following May, along with Ed's Transmission being forced to pay a $825,000 settlement after a civil suit was filed.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} the failure to pay U.S. federal income tax, some tax protesters miss the {{distinction}} between civil and criminal liability. A verdict of acquittal <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> trial for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can continue to seek money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, {{the amount of money}} due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, and not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> trial. (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty verdict is reached <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>criminal</b> tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.|$|E
