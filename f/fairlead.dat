25|$|Grasp has {{heavy lift}} system that {{consists}} of large bow and stern rollers, deck machinery, and tackle. The rollers serve as low-friction <b>fairlead</b> for the wire rope or chain used for the lift. The tackle and deck machinery provide up to 75 tons of hauling for each lift. The two bow rollers can be used together with linear hydraulic pullers to achieve a dynamic lift of 150 tons. The stern rollers {{can be used with}} the automatic towing machine to provide a dynamic lift of 150 tons. All four rollers can be used together for a dynamic lift of 300 tons or a static tidal lift of 350 tons.|$|E

40|$|As the key {{devices in}} the mooring system of a Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO), <b>fairleads</b> {{are used to}} guide the cables (wire rope or chain) from the vessel towards the anchor and help to change the vessel’s {{floating}} condition in a smooth manner. The fatigue strength of <b>fairleads</b> cannot be neglect-ed because the FPSO always suffers from complicated environmental loadings due to wave, current and wind; and induces highly varied loadings in the <b>fairleads.</b> In this paper, fatigue strength analysis is carried out for the <b>fairleads</b> of a FPSO served in the South Sea in China. Hydrodynamic performance of the FPSO cou-pling with its mooring system is firstly obtained, and then the short-term history of cable tension can be ob-tained by wave scatter diagram. The cable tension {{is regarded as the}} dynamic loading acted on the fairleads; and the corresponding history of stress range in the <b>fairleads</b> can be obtained by finite element analysis (FEA). At last, fatigue accumulating damage in the <b>fairleads</b> is calculated based on the rain-flow counting method and S-N curves. The estimation framework based on the ship motion and mooring tension coupling analysis in time domain proposed in this work can provide a fast fatigue life prediction of the <b>fairleads</b> when the ship is operated in different conditions...|$|R

25|$|The bell is {{deployed}} {{over the}} side of the vessel or platform using a gantry or A-frame or through a moon pool. Deployment usually starts by lowering the clump weight, which is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, through a set of sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a <b>fairlead</b> on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. The bell hangs from a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads guide it down the clump weight cables to the workplace.|$|E

50|$|If {{the line}} {{is meant to be}} moved while in the <b>fairlead,</b> the angle in the line created by the <b>fairlead</b> must be shallow to {{minimize}} friction. For larger angles a block or pulley is used as a <b>fairlead</b> to reduce friction. Where {{the line is}} removed from a hook <b>fairlead</b> before using, the angle is not an issue.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fairlead</b> is {{a device}} to guide a line, rope or cable around an object, {{out of the way}} or to stop it from moving laterally. Typically a <b>fairlead</b> will be a ring or hook. The <b>fairlead</b> may be a {{separate}} piece of hardware, or it could be a hole in the structure.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the {{fittings}} such as swivels or crutch plate, painter ring, stretchers, keel {{and stem}} band are fitted and fixed with screws. In a sailing dinghy, {{there would be}} more fittings such as <b>fairleads,</b> horse, shroud plates, mast step, toe straps and so on.|$|R
5000|$|Among other features, the Ibex {{can be built}} or {{delivered}} with Foer's patented Vector winching system. A winch is mounted centrally in the vehicle, and the cable runs to <b>fairleads</b> front and rear. This allows the vehicle to pull in either direction, or pull out the cable and secure it both ways, so that the vehicle can pull along the cable like a cable car. http://www.4wdonline.com/Foers/Winch.html ...|$|R
50|$|An {{aluminium}} mast and boom {{are used}} to set a bermuda rig of mainsail and jib. To keep things simple, the jib sheets lead to fixed <b>fairleads</b> and cam-cleats, the mainsail is loose-footed, and the mainsheet leads to a rope horse across the transom. ClamCleats may be present to allow this mainsheet traveller to be adjusted. The standard mainsail has three fibreglass battens, and can be shaped using a kicking strap and Cunningham.|$|R
5000|$|While {{fairleads}} {{are most}} frequently found in nautical applications, they can be found anywhere [...] is used. In off-roading, a <b>fairlead</b> is used to guide the winch cable and remove lateral strain from the winch. A roller <b>fairlead</b> is used with steel cable and a hawse <b>fairlead</b> is used with synthetic cable.|$|E
50|$|Fairleads {{are used}} {{on almost every}} {{sailboat}}. Even as simple a sailboat as a Sunfish has a <b>fairlead</b> for each of its two lines. A ring <b>fairlead</b> holds the halyard parallel to the mast so its cleat can be located near to the cockpit. On models without a deck block for the sheet, a hook <b>fairlead</b> in the forward edge of the cockpit gives the sailor options when handling the sheet.|$|E

50|$|Various {{hardware}} {{is found}} {{attached to the}} boom. The hardware could include <b>fairleads,</b> blocks, block tracks, and cleats. For attachment, screws are used on wooden booms and screws or rivets on aluminium booms. If {{the foot of the}} sail is attached to the boom, there may be hoops from the foot of the sail, around the boom, or there may be a track {{on the top of the}} boom into which fittings on the foot of the sail are slid.|$|R
50|$|The skidders use {{the same}} 6V53 Detroit Diesel engine and {{steering}} gearbox as the M113, but utilized a more heavily built undercarriage and a 4-speed Clark powershift transmission. The skidder either came as a cable arch model, with a tilting tray to set the logs on (A hydraulic grapple attachment was later offered to fit over the cable <b>fairleads).</b> Or as a Clam-Bunk forwarder, with a Prentice grapple mounted {{on the roof of}} the cab. Dealers also modified the base tractor to handle various forestry and utility jobs.|$|R
25|$|With few exceptions, the hull, ramp, {{and power}} plant of the LCA {{remained}} the same throughout the war. Early on the coxswain's position was moved from aft to forward on the starboard side. Other particulars could vary greatly; some LCAs having Direction finding antenna loops, others Danforth anchors on vertical racks forward. The hatch layout on the stern deck varied, as did the placement and type of mooring bits, chocks, cleats, <b>fairleads,</b> and fuel caps. Photographic evidence shows all these variations and also differences in {{the placement of the}} lifelines that were looped along either hullside for men in the water.|$|R

50|$|Fairlead-A U-shape or {{circular}} fitting often positioned {{near the}} bow that leads an anchor warp or a sheet to a cleat or winch. The anchor <b>fairlead</b> is usually bronze or stainless steel {{as it must}} take the regular abrasion of the warp and chain. The anchor <b>fairlead</b> is usually set on the change of angle between the deck and the topside to prevent wear and tear.|$|E
5000|$|To make it work, the {{backstay}} is led {{through a}} block or <b>fairlead</b> along the deck to a two-legged, second order lever mounted with its fulcrum above deck level. The end of the runner {{is attached to a}} cross-member between the two legs and part way along the lever. When the lever is moved away from the <b>fairlead,</b> tension is placed on the runner on a line below the fulcrum so that the lever is pulled down onto the deck. When the tension is to be released, the lever is thrown towards the <b>fairlead.</b> When released, the amount of slack in the runner is therefore twice the distance of the attachment point from the fulcrum. It is not necessary to have great leverage as the adjustment is made at a point in the manoeuvring of the boat when the rigging is slack. The significant point is that the lever should be designed to take up the required amount of slack.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, clewlines are {{attached}} to the outer corners or clews of the sail. They lift more weight than the buntlines, and also have to pull against the sheets - although these will have been released there is still a certain amount of friction produced by the blocks and <b>fairleads</b> that they run through. For this reason the clewlines are usually fitted with blocks to increase the mechanical advantage. The clewlines are coloured green in the diagram, and run along the underside of the yard from the outboard ends to the mast, and then down to the deck.|$|R

50|$|The main {{limitation}} {{with this}} design {{is that if}} the ship had no support ledge it must be attached to the ship by some other method. Wire pendants hanging from the vessel are the main method used but although these required the addition of two brackets on the ship this is a minor modification. For occasional or single voyage visits, synthetic strops are provided and secured through the <b>fairleads</b> onto the ships’ bitts. An alternative to the ledge using a central hook on the linkspan to a bar on the vessel is also adopted. All these alternatives must ensure that the loads are shared by both the support pendants.|$|R

A {{standard}} Royal Navy [...] whaler was fitted {{on the port side}} of the funnel in addition to the US-issue ship's boat on the starboard side; additional lifesaving rafts were also fitted: big ones on sloping launch skids aft of the funnel and small ones aft of the searchlights. Wind deflectors were fitted on {{the leading edge of the}} bridge area and a canvas-covered shelter was installed on the quarterdeck to provide better weather protection for depth charge crews. Oiling <b>fairleads</b> were fitted to the edge of the hull by the anchor winch. The bilge keels were lengthened and made deeper (a process that took a minimum of three weeks).|$|R
25|$|Sydney {{paid off}} at Sydney on 8 May 1928 {{and arrived at}} Cockatoo Island in 1929, where she was broken up. The ship's {{foremast}} was retained, and in 1934, it was erected at Bradleys Head by the floating crane Titan. This initially served as {{a monument to the}} engagement against Emden, but was rededicated in 1964 as a monument for all Australian ships lost and all sailors killed in the line of duty. Part of the bow, including the stem head, jackstaff, and <b>fairleads,</b> was set into the seawall at Milsons Point, under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. One of the cruiser's derricks is on display in the Victory Memorial Gardens in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, and a compass stand is located at Port Macquarie, New South Wales. The main top-mast was erected at Environa, New South Wales, but rotted at the base and collapsed. It was later moved to Jervis Bay.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The motion {{performance}} of Spar platform and dynamic characteristics for the mooring lines under different mooring configurations {{have been studied}} both in static analysis and coupled dynamic analysis. First, 3 D hydrodynamic finite element model is built {{and the effects of}} the mooring system are taken into account by giving the specified pre-tension, angle and stiffness of the mooring lines on the <b>fairleads.</b> And hydrodynamic analysis of Spar platform is performed by the way of utilizing potential flow theory in frequency domain in order to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients. Then, static analysis is applied to obtain restoring stiffness curves for the mooring system, structure displacements and mooring line tensions etc [...] At last, coupled time domain analysis of the motion response of Spar is conducted for the coupled system and the dynamic tensions of mooring lines are calculated. The research results can be served as a reference for the selection and the performance study for mooring systems during preliminary design...|$|R
