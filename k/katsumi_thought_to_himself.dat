60|$|I {{took the}} liberty of {{interrupting}} him. I {{had no idea of}} allowing him <b>to</b> keep his <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Abu Sufyaan <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "By Allaah! I {{would have}} {{certainly}} lied had I not feared {{being called a}} liar." ...|$|R
6000|$|Geoffrey, sipping his tea, smiled grimly {{behind the}} shelter of his cup. [...] "She does it uncommonly well," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|R
60|$|He walked on, {{counting}} as regularly as he could, and <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that {{he never}} before realized how long fifteen minutes were.|$|R
60|$|Israel <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that seldom {{before had}} he {{seen such a}} being. Though dressed Ã -la-mode, {{he did not seem}} to be {{altogether}} civilized.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{understand}} it," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Mrs. Housekeeper is mad. Oh, dear, dear me--Bedlam is {{the only}} place for her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something has happened," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> Then {{he opened}} Mary's letter. It was dated Tuesday, that is, two days before, and ran: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh {{that the}} black raven were here to help me!' he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> And in a moment the black raven was perched on his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|When the squire saw this, he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'The horses {{will come}} {{the same way}} if I don't open the door,' so he did this.|$|R
6000|$|... "This fellow is shamming dead," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> {{and lifted}} his gun, for in those times we {{could not afford to}} nurse sick Kaffirs.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If she REALLY could pledge herself,' he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> with passionate insistence {{but hardly}} any hope. Yet a curious little irresponsible {{laughter}} {{appeared in his}} heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll show Andrew that I {{mean to be}} on time," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> as {{he turned}} into the street upon which the stable was situated.|$|R
60|$|The signal officer nodded, {{and drank}} the liquor. As he smacked his lips while going on deck, he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> these nabobs drink famous good wine.|$|R
6000|$|The priest {{signed to}} her quietly {{to return to}} the stool. [...] "I never {{suspected}} the child had so much spirit in her," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|R
60|$|His mother {{answered}} {{that it was}} a whim, and nobody could persuade her to lay it aside; whereat the young man laughed, but kept his <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|R
60|$|Arthur <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> {{that he had}} at {{that moment}} some not far from his heart that must be quite as beautiful, {{but he did not}} say so.|$|R
60|$|Lieutenant D'Hubert {{could not}} be {{altogether}} unsympathetic toward that sentiment. This little fellow is a lunatic, he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> {{but there is something}} in what he says.|$|R
6000|$|... "See {{the work}} of Hokosa," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "Moses set up a serpent to save the people; yonder wizard sets up one to destroy them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just the man {{to serve}} under," [...] Ralph <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "Cool, self possessed, and with an eye that will see a weak point in a moment.|$|R
6000|$|Bless me, Martin <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> he doesn't {{know what}} I was talking about. He hasn't {{understood}} {{a word of}} it. What did he do with his education, anyway? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{does all}} this matter <b>to</b> me?' Francis <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> She paused, evidently expecting him to say something. 'So you have come to Venice?' he said carelessly. 'Why?' ...|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} there was silence. Each brother was {{thinking}} his own <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> about this double disclosure. At last, Granville lifted his head and spoke again.|$|R
60|$|Lieut. D'Hubert {{could not}} remain {{altogether}} unmoved by that simple sentiment. This little fellow was a lunatic, he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> {{but there was}} something in what he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} be surprised," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "if the girl is right, {{and if there is}} not serious trouble brewing in the slums of Paris.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's one thing," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "they can't go on shooting. They'll {{have the}} police after {{them if they}} do. I wonder they dared to there." ...|$|R
60|$|Razumov <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> {{that this}} man {{entrusted}} with so much arbitrary power must have believed what he said or else {{he could not have}} gone on bearing the responsibility.|$|R
6000|$|It so {{happened}} that each {{found a good}} master, where he learnt all that was necessary for his trade {{in the best possible}} way. The blacksmith had to shoe the king's horses, and <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'Without doubt the house will be yours!' The barber shaved the best men in the kingdom, and he, too, made sure that the house would be his. The fencing-master received many a blow, but he set his teeth, and would not allow <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> be troubled by them, for he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'If you are afraid of a blow you will never get the house.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{not much}} further,' he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> as he reached an avenue of walnut trees, when {{suddenly}} a voice spoke out from over his head, and made him jump.|$|R
60|$|Godwin <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that it {{was like}} another smile, that {{on the face of the}} woman-headed, stone sphinx which they had seen set up in the market place of Beirut.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "this man is in entire {{command of}} a very {{important}} branch of the British Service in Italy. We are a great race still." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marry again?" [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> as he {{rang the}} bell. [...] "Donna Brigida, {{was your first}} failure not enough for you? Are you going to try a second time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Colville <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that {{he could}} have said; but he was silent. At the moment he was not equal to so much joke or so much truth; and Imogene went on-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Now the boy {{had been}} rather uneasy when he recollected his father's words, but he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'What is done cannot be undone,' and answered, 'Very well, so let it be.' ...|$|R
6000|$|After this {{it slipped}} out, {{and no one}} could get hold of it. But the king's cook <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'I shall see if I can't get hold of you to-morrow evening.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose there}} is another woman in London," [...] he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "that has not heard all about the row at the Cockpit, and that would write to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll go to {{my sister}} the frog,' he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'and she will sew them {{together}} for me'; and he set off at once for the swamp in which his sister lived.|$|R
