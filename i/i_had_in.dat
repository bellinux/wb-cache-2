She later explained choosing which producers to work with, saying [...] "All of these people have a reputation for being visionaries and knowing them well, I felt 'Okay, now it's time to put together a project that not only takes us to another place, another dimension, but highlights these sights.'

Religion, however, played an increasingly insignificant role in his life. He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to atheism: [...] "I had a very clear feeling that I didn't believe in God and that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty; the more I studied religious subjects, the less I believed in God." [...] Before becoming active in politics Mikoyan had already dabbled {{in the study of}} liberalism and socialism.|$|E

Nolan contacted Bowie, who initially turned down the part. A lifelong fan, Nolan flew out to New York to pitch the role to Bowie in person, telling him {{no one else could}} possibly play the part; Bowie accepted after a few minutes.|$|E

[...] Gygax designed the Tomb of Horrors modules for two related purposes. First, Gygax explains, [...] "There were several very expert players in my campaign, and this was meant as yet another challenge to their skill—and the persistence of their theretofore-invincible characters. Specifically, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind foiling Rob Kuntz's PC, Robilar, and Ernie Gygax's PC, Tenser."

500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

500|$|The new {{schedule}} {{resulted in}} a conflict for Anthony Quinn, who was signed to play the title role in Attila, a 1954 epic, also produced by De Laurentiis and directed by Pietro Francisci. At first, Quinn considered withdrawing from La Strada, but Fellini convinced him to work on both films simultaneously, shooting La Strada {{in the morning and}} Attila in the afternoon and evening. The plan often required the actor to get up at 3:30a.m. in order to capture the [...] "bleak early light" [...] on which Fellini insisted, and then leave at 10:30 to drive to Rome in his Zampanò outfit in order to be on the set in time to be transformed into Attila the Hun for afternoon shooting. Quinn recalled: [...] "This schedule accounted for the haggard look <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> both films, a look that was perfect for Zampanò but scarcely OK for Attila the Hun." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} moment when Nico Rosberg let him past {{in the early stages}} of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his {{teammate}} for [...] "being a gentleman". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: [...] "It was more painful the feeling that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that's not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [...] was just a consequence of that." [...] Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. He pointed to the possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.|$|E

This featured guest appearances {{from some of}} his friends, including Klinghoffer, and Chili Peppers bandmates Smith and Flea. In June 2004, {{he announced that he}} would be releasing six records over six months: The Will to Death, Ataxia's Automatic Writing, DC EP, Inside of Emptiness, A Sphere in the Heart of Silence and Curtains. With the release of Curtains Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004, for the track [...] "The Past Recedes". He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape, avoiding modern studio and computer-assisted recording processes. Frusciante noted, [...] "These six records were recorded in a period of six months after coming home from touring with the Chili Peppers for one-and-a-half years. I made {{a list of all the}} songs I had and they totaled about seventy. My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> <b>In</b> the midst of doing that, I was writing some of my best songs, so some of these albums have as many new songs as old songs. It was definitely the most productive time of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Acknowledging {{the failure}} of the ongoing Anarky series, Grant has conceeded that its themes, in {{particular}} his interest in exploring esoteric concepts such as philosophy of mind, likely resulted in [...] "plummeting" [...] sales. Breyfogle claimed the difficulty of combining escapist entertainment with social commentary as his explanation for the series' failure. Breyfogle wrote at the time: [...] "Anarky is a hybrid of the mainstream and the not-quite-so-mainstream. This title may have experienced exactly what every 'half-breed' suffers: rejection by both groups with which it claims identity." [...] Besides the themes, commentators have also found the escalation of Anarky's skills and special heroics as a source of criticism among readers. [...] "I liked the original concept behind Anarky: a teenage geek who reads The Will to Power one too many times and decides to go out and fix the world," [...] wrote a critic for Fanzing, an online newsletter produced by comic book fans and professionals. [...] "But the minute he wound up getting $100 million in a Swiss Bank account, owning a building, impressing Darksied, getting a Boom Tube and was shown as being able to outsmart Batman, outhack Oracle and generally be invincible, I lost all interest <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The limited series Infinite Crisis (2005), {{written as}} {{a sequel to}} the 1985 maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths, altered DC Comics continuity. Subsequently, all comic book titles {{published}} by DC Comics skip forward one year and a new maxi-series entitled 52 retroactively chronicles the 52 weeks which directly followed Infinite Crisis. When DC editors called for a redesign of Batwoman, comic book artist Alex Ross drew inspiration from the modified Batgirl costume he designed for Barbara Gordon, seven years prior to Kate Kane's debut in the limited comic book series 52. Ross and comic book author Paul Dini initially planned to revive the former Batgirl Barbara Gordon using {{an updated version of}} the character's original costume, with red accents in place of the traditional yellow. However, since Gordon served as one of {{a very small number of}} disabled superheroes of DC Comics as Oracle, DC's editorial staff decided to revitalize the original Batwoman instead. In an interview with Newsarama, Ross states [...] "They had me change the mask and hair to make it a bit more Batwoman, rather than Batgirl...I pointed out to them that the mask makes her look like the Huntress a little overall—but there weren't many options. The original mask that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> there when it was to be a Batgirl design was the complete head cover that we've seen, so they did need something different from that." ...|$|E
