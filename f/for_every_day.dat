5|$|Stews {{are basic}} fare <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> family cooking and are always served with {{vermicelli}} rice or plain rice. They are popular {{because they provide}} {{a wide range of}} nutrients from the meat, the vegetables and the rice. The extra liquid is also essential in such dry climate. Stews are also economically beneficial, as they provide relatively small amount of meat into feeding large families, especially within the poorer population.|$|E

5|$|Shooting for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari {{began at}} the end of December 1919 and {{concluded}} {{at the end of}} January 1920. It was shot entirely in a studio without any exterior shots, which was unusual for films of the time, but dictated by the decision to give the film an Expressionist visual style. The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> of filming. But Hermann Warm claimed they were never present for any of the shooting or involved in any discussions during production.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so popular that <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> since its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on every single day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively covered and ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a clock on the tower since the early 1700s. There is a peal of eight bells in the tower. Tenor 28cwt (3,136lb/1,422kg) in C. The {{original}} five bells were re-cast by the celebrated Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke in 1735 to make a peal of six, and in 1898 four of these were re-cast and two were repaired by Messrs. Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Two additional bells, the gift of Brigadier Ommanney, were added in 1928 to complete the octave, which still contains two of the Bilbie bells. The present clock, installed in 1903, plays a verse of a hymn every four hours, at 8am, noon, 4 and 8pm, with a different hymn tune <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> of the week. The church is a Grade I listed building.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, {{families}} of those placed at the Receiving Home for Children sued over the poor conditions there. A federal court found that the facility had violated the constitutional rights of the children there by housing an average of 71 individuals {{a night at the}} Receiving Home. Staffing ratios were 1 staff person for 10 children, and on particularly bad days could worsen to 1 to 15.

25|$|In Israel, Jewish {{circumcision}} {{is entirely}} legal, as is posthumous circumcision. In 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court overruled {{an attempt to}} have after-death circumcision outlawed. Though illegal, female circumcision is still practiced among the Negev Bedouin, and tribal secrecy among the Bedouin {{makes it difficult for}} authorities to enforce the ban. In 2013, Rabbinical court in Israel ordered a mother, Elinor Daniel, to circumcise her son or pay a fine of 500 Israeli Shekel <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> that the child is not circumcised. She appealed against the Rabbinical court ruling and the High Court ruled in her favour stating, among other considerations, the basic right of freedom from religion.|$|E

Viewership peaked on Christmas Day 1987 when an average of 28.5million viewers tuned in to see Hilda Ogden leave the street to start a new life as a housekeeper for long term friend Dr Lowther (although there is some confusion as to whether or not this was actually the highest rating episode due to a special omnibus repeat of that week's episodes being combined with the original airing). Since EastEnders began airing in 1985 on the BBC, the two programmes have constantly battled it out for first place in the ratings.|$|E

25|$|Local {{fishermen}} {{complained to}} municipal authorities that Hotelito Desconocido's construction was illegal and that Murzilli's plans were not legally approved. However, municipal officials reportedly {{told them that}} the investment brought by the construction was big for Tomatlán. The group decided to establish a working relationship with Hotelito Desconocido; they allowed the construction to continue because they believed that Hotelito Desconocido would bring new jobs to Tomatlán. The hotel ownership was eventually passed down to another Italian national, Giuliano Gasparotto. The group of fishermen stated that once Gasparotto was in charge of Hotelito Desconocido, he ignored the previous concessions and stopped compensating fishermen MXN$10,000 <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> they could not fish in the sea.|$|E
25|$|After Elvis's {{return to}} America, the couple stayed in contact over the phone, though {{they would not}} {{see each other again}} until the summer of 1962, when Priscilla's parents agreed to let her visit for two weeks.

Elvis agreed to all these demands and Priscilla flew to Los Angeles. Elvis told her {{that they were going to}} Las Vegas and, to throw her parents off the scent, he had Priscilla write a postcard <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> they would be gone so that they could be mailed from Los Angeles by a member of his staff.|$|E
25|$|The National Christmas Tree again {{remained}} largely unlit in 1980. President Carter's five-year-old grandson, Jason, {{switched on the}} tree.

The lights on the tree shone for 417 seconds, one second <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> that the hostages had been captive. The lights were then turned off, leaving only the star atop the tree shining. When the hostages were released on January 20, 1981, the tree was redecorated. It was relit for the returning hostages on January 27. 1980 was also the first year that the Pageant of Peace organizers were required by the National Park Service to hold an open meeting to solicit input from the public.
