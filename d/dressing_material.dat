50|$|These super-absorbent fiber {{dressings}} rely on {{properties of}} smart polymers sensitive to humidity levels. The <b>dressing</b> <b>material</b> responds {{to changes in}} wound moisture in real time and, when needed, can reverse its function (switching from absorption to hydration and back) over each specific area of the wound and periwound.

50|$|The dressing’s mode {{of action}} relies {{on the ability of}} the {{polymers}} to sense and adapt to the changing humidity and fluid content in all areas of the wound simultaneously and to automatically and reversibly switch from absorption to hydration.

50|$|In an {{operating}} room, while {{all members of}} the surgical team should demonstrate good aseptic technique, it {{is the role of the}} scrub nurse or surgical technologist to set up and maintain the sterile field. Medical procedure rooms should be laid out according to guidelines including regulations concerning filtering and airflow. Members of the surgical teams may wash their hands and arms with germicidal solution (e.g. an iodine solution such as betadine), and may also wear sterile gloves and gowns. Staff members' hair should be covered and surgical masks should be worn. Instruments should be sterilized through autoclaving or by using disposable equipment. Suture material or xenografts also need to be sterilized beforehand. <b>Dressing</b> <b>material</b> should be sterile. Antibiotics may also be used, and dirty, biologically contaminated material should be subject to regulated disposal.|$|E

Materials and methods. The study included 24 patients with DM 1 and DM 2 and neuropathic or neuroischemic forms of DFS in the absence of pronounced leg ischemia (ankle-brachial index > 0. 7). Duration of the observation period was 8 weeks, the patients were examined once in 2 weeks. The <b>dressing</b> <b>materials</b> used in the study were based on the Cellosorb NA, Cellosorb Ag, Urgotul S Ag. technology (Laboratories Urgo). Efficacy and safety of the <b>dressing</b> <b>materials</b> were estimated from the wound size, degree of exudation, characteristics of the wound bed and the surrounding tissues. The data obtained were treated using Statistica v. 7. 0 software (StatSoft Inc.). Results. Efficacy of local therapy was assessed based on the Pressure Ulcer Scale of Healing (PUSH). Neither local nor systemic adverse events related {{to the use of the}} above <b>dressing</b> <b>materials</b> were registered during the follow-up. Cellosorb NA and Cellosrb Ag hydrocellular dressings showed high absorption activity and atraumatic properties. Most patients especially those using Cellosorb Ag were free from local infection.

The U-boat moved closer, at which point Atik dropped her concealment and opened fire with all weapons. U-123 ran off, (one man died in the action), but she dived, returned and sank the American vessel with a torpedo. There were no survivors.This was Captain Reinhard Hardegen's second patrol in charge and quoted from U123 K.T.B war patrol log the following: [...] Except for Holzer, no one was wounded and a low pressure test showed that the pressure hull was intact. We were incredibly lucky. Eight 20 mm hits were counted on the bridge the next day. After {{we were out of}} range I went below deck and saw that the condition of F.z.See Holzer was hopeless. A 20 mm round detonated in his right thigh, ripped open the flesh from the hip joint to the knee and partially removed it. One could not see if the bone had been shattered. The leg was only hanging on small flaps of skin. We bound off the leg. We could only wrap a towel around the big wound because we had not enough <b>dressing</b> <b>material</b> for such injuries. It was immediately clear that such an injury could not be treated even by a doctor under the circumstances aboard a U-boat. We were many days from the next neutral harbor, so I took the decision to make it as easy as possible for him and injected a substantial dose of morphine. Holzer acted bravely in an exemplary manner. For one hour he was conscious, without a single word of complaint. [...] F.z.See Holzer was buried at sea the following day.|$|E

Keratin can retain a large amount of water in its structure, which makes it a good candidate for wound <b>dressing</b> <b>material</b> as it can help in prevention of loss of biological fluids to the environment and reduce wound exudate.

40|$|Aims To {{determine}} if bacterial species responsible for clinically relevant wound infection produce specific volatile profiles {{that would allow}} their speciation. Methods and Results Selected-Ion Flow Tube-Mass Spectrometry in full mass scan mode was used to analyse headspace gases produced by wound-associated bacteria grown in vitro, so as to enable identification of bacterial volatile product ion profiles in the resulting mass spectra. Applying multivariate statistical analysis (hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis) to the resultant mass spectra enabled clear speciation. Moreover, bacterial volatile product ions could be detected from artificially contaminated wound <b>dressing</b> <b>material,</b> although the pattern of product ions detected was influenced by culture conditions. Conclusions Using selected product ions from the SIFT-MS mass spectra {{it is possible to}} discriminate wound-associated bacterial species grown under specific in vitro culture conditions.

The methylcellulose paste solution with various of molecular weight (SM- 4, SM- 100, SM- 400, SM- 4000 and SM- 8000) at different concentration (15 - 30 % w/v) were irradiated by using electron beam on the dose range of 10 kGy up to 40 kGy. Gel fraction and swelling ratio of hydrogels were determined gravimetrically. Tensile strength and elasticity of hydrogels were measured using a universal testing machine. It was found that with the increasing of irradiation dose from 10 up to 40 kGy, gel fraction and tensile strength were increased for all of hydrogels with various of molecular weight. On contrary, the swelling ratio of hydrogels decreased with increasing of irradiation dose. The optimum hydrogels elasticity were obtained from methylcellulose solution with the concentration range of 15 - 20 % with irradiation dose of 20 kGy and showed excellent performance.
