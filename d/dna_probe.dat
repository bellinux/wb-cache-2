25|$|Annealing, in genetics, {{means for}} {{complementary}} sequences of single-stranded DNA or RNA to pair by hydrogen bonds {{to form a}} double-stranded polynucleotide. The term {{is often used to}} describe the binding of a <b>DNA</b> <b>probe,</b> or the binding of a primer to a DNA strand during a polymerase chain reaction. The term is also often used to describe the reformation (renaturation) of reverse-complementary strands that were separated by heat (thermally denatured).

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{strategy}} called the ‘Protected <b>DNA</b> <b>Probes</b> (PDP) method’ in which appropriately protected bases selectively bind to the complementary bases without the removal of their base protecting groups. Previously, we reported that 4 -N-acetylcytosine oligonucleotides (ac 4 C) exhibited a higher hybridization affinity for ssDNA than the unmodified oligonucleotides. For the PDP strategy, we created a modified adenine base and synthesized an N-acylated deoxyadenosine mimic having 6 -N-acetyl- 8 -aza- 7 -deazaadenine (ac 6 az 8 c 7 A). It was found that PDP containing ac 4 C and ac 6 az 8 c 7 A exhibited higher affinity for the complementary ssDNA than the corresponding unmodified <b>DNA</b> <b>probes</b> and showed similar base recognition ability. Moreover, {{it should be noted}} that this PDP strategy could guarantee highly efficient synthesis of <b>DNA</b> <b>probes</b> on controlled pore glass (CPG) with high purity and thereby could eliminate the time-consuming procedures for isolating <b>DNA</b> <b>probes.</b> This strategy could also avoid undesired base-mediated elimination of <b>DNA</b> <b>probes</b> from CPG under basic conditions such as concentrated ammonia solution prescribed for removal of base protecting groups in the previous standard approach. Here, several successful applications of this strategy to single nucleotide polymorphism detection are also described in detail using PDPs immobilized on glass plates and those prepared on CPG plates, suggesting its potential usefulness...|$|R

50|$|The basic {{technique}} {{for the detection}} of RFLPs involves fragmenting a sample of DNA by a restriction enzyme, which can recognize and cut DNA wherever a specific short sequence occurs, in a process known as a restriction digest. The resulting DNA fragments are then separated by length through a process known as agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a membrane via the Southern blot procedure. Hybridization of the membrane to a labeled <b>DNA</b> <b>probe</b> then determines the length of the fragments which are complementary to the probe. An RFLP occurs when the length of a detected fragment varies between individuals. Each fragment length is considered an allele, and can be used in genetic analysis.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two common}} {{mechanisms}} by which {{the size of a}} particular restriction fragment can vary.

In allele [...] "A", the genome is cleaved by a restriction enzyme at three nearby sites (triangles), but only the rightmost fragment will be detected by the probe. In allele [...] "a", restriction site 2 has been lost by a mutation, so the probe now detects the larger fused fragment running from sites 1 to 3. The second diagram shows how this fragment size variation would look on a Southern blot, and how each allele (two per individual) might be inherited in members of a family.|$|E
50|$|A {{mobility}} shift assay is electrophoretic {{separation of}} a protein-DNA or protein-RNA mixture on a polyacrylamide or agarose gel {{for a short}} period (about 1.5-2 hr for a 15- to 20-cm gel).

The control lane (<b>DNA</b> <b>probe</b> without protein present) will contain a single band corresponding to the unbound DNA or RNA fragment. However, assuming that the protein is capable of binding to the fragment, the lane with protein present will contain another band that represents the larger, less mobile complex of nucleic acid probe bound to protein which is 'shifted' up on the gel (since it has moved more slowly).|$|E
