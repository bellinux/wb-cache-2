50|$|The freight {{market is}} a very {{volatile}} market, with standard deviations of up to 70%. From an options perspective, this is a possibility for a very large up and downside—part of this downside can be hedged away via freight derivatives. AG-Japan clean and dirty are the most liquid routes traded in the derivatives market. Frontline has a very high dividend yield, both in cash and in Ship Finance (SFL) stocks; for example, in late 2007 its annual dividend ran between 12 and 18%, depending on the fluctuating share price. SFL is an offshoot of Frontline; the offshoot is estimated to have generated 25% gains to shareholders due to the different risk in Frontline and SFL. Golden Ocean Group (GOGL), a <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> firm, was also spun off of Frontline and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. GOGL is a volatile stock, and as with Frontline, dry freight derivatives are available. In 2006, Frontline started a new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) project, Sea Production.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present, {{for the first}} time, the price {{formation}} of China’s <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> using vessel prices quoted by major Chinese shipyards in actual shipbuilding orders. This allows us to investigate the relationship of price and determinants in the Chinese shipbuilding industry by including generic market factors as well as Chinese elements. The analysis, employing Principal Component Regression (PCR) approach, indicates that the time charter rate has the most significantly positive impact. While increases in other four factors, namely shipbuilding cost, price cost margin, shipbuilding capacity utilization and credit rate, have descending order of positive influences. Different from traditional perception, we assert {{that the most important}} role of time charter rate plays mainly attributes to the ‘China Factor’ in bulk carrier sector. In addition, simulations are performed to investigate {{what would happen to the}} Chinese <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> prices under changes of time charter rate and shipbuilding cost.

40|$|A new exhaust {{emission}} inventory of ocean-going vessels (OGVs) was compiled for Hong Kong by using Automatic Identification System (AIS) {{data for the}} first time to determine typical main engine load factors, through vessel speed and operation mode characterization. It was found that in 2007, container vessel was the top emitting vessel type, contributing 9, 886, 11, 480, 1, 173, 521 and 1166 tonnes of SO 2, NOx, PM 10, VOC and CO, respectively, or about 80 %- 82 % of the emissions. The top five, which also included ocean cruise, oil tanker, conventional cargo vessel and <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier,</b> accounted for about 98 % of emissions. Emission maps, which add a new spatial dimension to the inventory, show the key emission hot spots in Hong Kong and suggest that a significant portion of emissions were emitted at berth. Scientific evidence about the scale and distribution of ship emissions has contributed in raising public awareness and facilitating stakeholder engagement about the issue. Fair Winds Charter, the world's first industry-led voluntary emissions reduction initiative, is a perfect example of how careful scientific research can be used in public engagement and policy deliberation to help drive voluntary industry actions and then government proposals to control and regulate marine emissions in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta region.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers {{estimation of}} three {{multiple linear regression}} models {{that are used to}} forecast the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> secondhand ship prices. The models include variables that range from exogenous to endogenous. The maingoalof the dissertation is to provide insight into the fiiture state of the sale and purchase market and also to test the assixmption that the dependent variable of secondhand prices is affected by the independent variables with a certain lag. There is a literature review and various reports and papers are proposed as a source for research material. The estimation techniques considered, involve Ordinary Least Squares, Weighted Least Squares, Log Linear Model estimation. Generalized Least Squares, Hildreth and Lu's scanning procedure, Nelder and Mead's Downhill SIMPLEX estimation, Cointegration and the Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCHT) model. The methodology followed to derive the forecasting models adopted is specimetrics and the theoretical framework on which it is developed is the Average Economic Regression. The models are estimated and the forecasts produced operate, as stated earlier, under the assumption that the secondhand prices are a function of certain variables lagged by 12 periods. Inference is finally drawn from the derived models regarding the relationship of the secondhand variable with the other variables and investment strategy guidelines based on the forecasts, are ultimately proposed. Various avenues for fiirther analysis are also proposed in the conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper uses a real options {{valuation}} {{model with}} stochastic freight rates to investigate market efficiency and {{the economics of}} switching between the dry bulk and the tanker markets in international shipping. A <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> is replaced with a tanker when the expected net present value of such a switch is optimal from a real options based decision rule. Depending {{on the development of}} the markets a reversal may take place later. The cost and demand parameters upon which the decisions to switch are made, including the stochastic characteristics of freight rates, are estimated from an empirical analysis that is updated every week throughout a 12 -year time period from 1993 to 2005. The second-hand market for bulk ships seems to have been efficient most of these years in the sense that market switching usually did not pay off, with one major exception: it seemed profitable in expectation to leave the dry bulk market and enter the tanker market over a significant period of time shortly after the millennium shift, and to return to dry bulk market about three years later. These points in time corresponded with an unprecedented boom period in the tanker and drybulk freight markets, respectively, and the result suggest that agents in the second-hand market were slow to adjust their expectations. In retrospect, such an investment policy also happened to be profitable compared to staying put in the tanker market, even after accounting for transaction costs...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a marine power plant with {{a battery pack}} has been modeled using bond graph theory, using the bond graph {{simulation}} software 20 -sim. The popularity of hybrid power systems are increasing in the marine sector, mainly {{because it is an}} effective way to reduce fuel consumption, emissions and maintenance costs. Three control strategies were created to test the model, where each strategy had a different focus. A new control strategy were developed after case study one, were each of the control strategies were tested. The new control strategy, which then would be used in case study two, combined two of the previously tested strategies, to gain the benefits of both. In case study 2, which was this thesis main case study, the results of two simulations where compared. One simulation ran two gensets and the other ran one genset assisted by a battery pack. The load profile applied was set to resemble an electric crane operation on a <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier.</b> The results show that if one genset is replaced with a 362 kWh battery pack, the fuel consumption rate can be reduced by 9. 23 %, while the maintenance costs for the operation can be reduced by over 50 %. The figures are believed to be conservative, since the battery pack model's efficiency rating is lower than the real battery pack, due to an added resistance to make the model stable. The results shows that implementing a battery pack can give significant reductions both environmentally and economically, and should be implemented on all ships that has a diesel-electric power system...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{fundamentally}} {{relevant to the}} development of a new enhanced Roller Track Gate (RTG) for the gravity type Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS), called the Multi-functional Roller Track Gate (MRG). Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS) are specialized types of <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> vessels, principally because these ships discharge their cargoes without the assistance of external sources. In 1908, the first commercial vessel of these types started trading in the Great Lakes region of North America. Subsequent to the inception of SULS, the technology has developed mainly in the hull structure and onboard unloading systems. Due to the 1980 s GL shipping recession, SULS migrated internationally and are now trading worldwide. Eight gravity gates for SULS were investigated in detail prior to designing the MRG. These examinations of previous gates were primarily to address the inherent issues and develop a new gate that would correct the current problems, when discharging dry bulk cargo with the existing gravity gates. The newly designed gate is accompanied with special control system that improves the discharging operations of these type vessels. This gate resulted in being heavier when compared to the existing RTG. However, this study also addresses and mitigates the associated improvements in this new type gate that increases the ship’s lightweight with the possibility of increasing payload / deadweight. High tensile steel was introduced for the hull to compensate for the added gate weight. The steel weight reduction investigation resulted in greater weight than what was required for offsetting the gate weight. The additional weight savings allowed for greater cargo lift for the vessels examined. The economic case study confirmed that by replacing the present Roller Track Gate with the Multi-functional Roller Track Gate, the shipowners’ would benefit from improve discharging performance, less port turn around time and reduced manning cost.

40|$|Quickly {{adapting}} to changing market conditions {{is crucial for}} every firm, especially in volatile and capital intensive markets. These are two characteristics of the maritime industry. Incorporating flexibility in design have gathered an increased focus as means to cope with such a dynamic context. To be flexible is not always enough, partially because exploiting this flexibility causes a time delay. This time delay causes more uncertainty, which could make a good investment decision into a bad one. Hence, this master thesis investigates the contribution from investment lags in engineering systems by the following: (i) Structuring and presenting a real option framework for identification of possible design solutions that reduces investment lag (ii) Propose value models for system design changes that are exposed for investment lag (iii) Propose design solutions that limits the investment lag. For this, an elongation of a dry bulk vessel is a thorough example. Agility represents {{the ability of a}} system to change quickly, and investment lag is the time from the decision is made until the system has changed capabilities. All investments have lags to some degree, which is often disregarded in traditional real options analyses. For systems with relatively long time lags, {{there is a need to}} better understand the impact of these investment lags. To identify design solutions that enables agility, a further separation in the real options framework has been proposed as a contribution to the existing literature. On options is seen as the superior option, which is the operational option on a projects future cash flow. This is often related to changes in value enabling variables, and as this is the conventional real option, there exist an established valuation framework for it. Further, on options are separated in two classes, Built-in-Design options and Design Change options. The former is multifunctionality that are implemented in the system from the initial design stage, the latter are options that make changes in the design, often referred to as in options, which comes with an investment lag due to off-hire when performing the design change. By this separation of on options, path enablers could be tied to real options. Path enablers are features that enables easier change in value enabling variables, making it easier to exercise options. Design path enablers are design features that enables easier exercise of design change option, thereby reducing the investment lag and cost of exercise. Thus, Design Change options could be seen as operational path enablers, that enables change of operation, which by definition is an on options. The relation between the option value of a capacity expansion/market entry, and the investment lag is defined to value agility. This gives a possible value for investment lag reducing path enablers. A design neutral capacity expansion in the dry bulk freight market is used as an illustrative case, and by introducing the investment lag as a parameter in the real option model, the value of a capacity expansion option could be considered as a function of investment lag. For this, the cost of investment lag is defined as the opportunity cost of operating in the market. The analysis is conducted in several steps, by three models with increasing degree of complexity. Qualitative and quantitative time series analysis on dry bulk freight rates in the Capesize segment in the time span between 1990 and 2017 resulted in freight market replications for two of the models using the geometric Mean Reversion model, and the last with market rates and asset prices as correlated mean reversion paths. Then, by Monte Carlo simulation, a now-or-never investment analysis determines the value of agility by simulation of the projects cash flows, thereafter through including investment timing flexibility based on the Least Squares Monte Carlo algorithm, which gives the value of agility through an established option valuation framework. For this model two approaches were taken, one with correlated vessel values and freight rates, and one with vessel values as a value of underlying freight rates. The option value reflects a premium of second hand vessel prices with different investment lags, and with no investment lag the maximum value will be respectively 147, 60 and 12. 2 USD/dwt for the now-or-never approach, LSMC and LSMC and with correlated asset paths, which is reduced to 85 %, 65 % and 55 % of maximum value for an investment lag of 6 months. The results of the different models are quite consistent in their form, and the spread between the maximum value can be explained through different approaches and different underlying stochastic processes. The LSMC model with vessel values as function of freight rates is seen as the most realistic, as it includes investment timing flexibility and geometric Mean Reversion as underlying stochastic process for freight market dynamics. Further, design path enablers for the illustrative case is proposed, an elongation of a <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>carrier</b> which gives a capacity expansion. Design path enablers for this elongation is elements that make the vessel ready for elongation, examples of this can be thickness of plates and visibility. As the design still water bending moment and wave bending moment is a function of L^ 3, a greater thickness is required. Further, the visibility of water surface shall not be obscured by more than 1 xLOA forward of the bow. Hence, path enablers for an elongation from 150 m to 200 m could be to build the initially 150 m long vessel with bottom plate thickness of 12 mm instead of the required 11 mm and a higher bridge. This will make the initial structure ready for 200 m LOA. By implementing design path enablers one increases the design freedom over the systems lifetime. In conventional design thinking, a design is often optimised for a base case. Though, by implementing design path enablers, one admit that the future is uncertain and partly unpredictable, and enables easier future design changes. This will increase the design freedom over the systems lifetime, which again is reflected by flexibility in operations at a strategic level. By implementing such design path enablers, together with Built-in design options, agility is enabled through design, thus, Agility by Design...|$|E
