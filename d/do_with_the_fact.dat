Much of this has to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Divan poetry is written in Ottoman Turkish, which was written using {{a variant of the}} Arabic script and made extensive use of Arabic and Persian words, making the language vastly different from modern Turkish. In its own time, knowledge of this form of literary Turkish was largely limited to the educated classes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Awole there was a {{scramble}} for the throne by numerous contenders; some {{were reported to have}} spent less than six months on the throne; there was also a period of interregnum of almost twenty years where the various factions could not agree on a candidate for the throne. This period of vacuum led to the rise of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and others like the Otun to the Are-Ona Kakanfo, called Solagberu, and also Shehu Alimi, who was the leader of a growing Muslim population in Oyo. These new powers had lost regard for the office of the Alaafin due to the various political wranglings and the lack of a central authority at the time; this situation eventually led up to Afonja seceding Ilorin from Oyo in 1817 with the help of Oyo Muslims. In 1823, after Afonja had been killed by his allies, Shehu Alimi and Solagberu (Solagberu was also later killed by Alimi's son), Ilorin became part of the Sokoto Caliphate. By the time Captain Hugh Clapperton visited Oyo-Ile in 1825 during the reign of Alaafin Majotu, the empire was already in a state of decline. Clapperton's party recorded passing numerous Oyo villages burned by the Fulani (Ilorin) while Majotu had also sought the help of the English king and the Oba of Benin in putting down the Ilorin rebellion. Clapperton also noticed a shortage of horses, even though the Oyo were renowned as a great cavalry force; this might have something to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that most of the empire's soldiers and hence cavalry were stationed at Ilorin under the command of Afonja and later on Alimi's successors.|$|E

Two troops of gorillas inhabited the 6.5 acre exhibit, with a dozen gorillas in Pattycake's troop alone, including Fubo, Pattycake, Tunko, Triska, Halima, Fran, Layla, Kumi, Suki, Babatunde, Barbara, and M'domo.

Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this has something to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E

She stated that [...] "One of the most unfortunate things about this film is that it appeals to race prejudice upon the basis of conditions of half a century ago, which have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> we have to consider to-day. Even then it does not tell the whole truth. It is claimed that the play is historical: but history is easy to misuse." [...] In New York, Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise told the press after seeing The Birth of a Nation that the film was [...] "an indescribable foul and loathsome libel on a race of human beings". In Boston, the civil rights activist William Monroe Trotter organized demonstrations against the film, which he predicted was going to worsen race relations, while Booker T. Washington wrote a newspaper column asking readers to boycott the film. In Washington D.C, the Reverend Francis James Grimké published a pamphlet entitled [...] "Fighting a Vicious Film" [...] that challenged the historical accuracy of The Birth of a Nation on a scene-by-scene basis.|$|R
500|$|Skeptics such as James Randi {{suggest that}} his {{reputation}} as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as [...] "retroactive clairvoyance" [...] (postdiction). Thus, no Nostradamus quatrain is known to have been interpreted as predicting a specific event before it occurred, other than in vague, general terms that could equally apply to any number of other events. [...] This even applies to quatrains that contain specific dates, such as III.77, which predicts [...] "in 1727, in October, the king of Persia [...] captured by those of Egypt"—a prophecy that has, as ever, been interpreted retrospectively in the light of later events, in this case as though it presaged the known peace treaty between the Ottoman Empire and Persia of that year. Similarly, Nostradamus's notorious '1999' prophecy at X.72 (see Nostradamus in popular culture) describes no event that commentators have succeeded in identifying either before or since, other than by dint of twisting the words to fit whichever of the many contradictory happenings they are keen to claim as 'hits'. Moreover, no quatrain suggests, as is often claimed by books and films on the alleged Mayan Prophecy, that the world would end in December 2012. [...] In his preface to the Prophecies, Nostradamus himself stated that his prophecies extend 'from now to the year 3797'—an extraordinary date which, given that the preface was written in 1555, may have more than a little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that 2242 (3797−1555) had recently been proposed by his major astrological source Richard Roussat as a possible date {{for the end of the}} world.|$|E
500|$|Neighbours {{was created}} in the early-to-mid-1980s by Australian TV {{executive}} Reg Watson. Watson decided to create a soap opera after working on Crossroads and seeing how successful it and Coronation Street were in Britain. He had already created such successful Australian made soap operas as The Young Doctors, Prisoner and Sons and Daughters. Watson proposed the idea of making a show that would focus on more realistic stories and portray teens and adults who talk openly to each other and solve their problems together. Watson, who worked for the Grundy production company, decided to make his show appeal to both Australia and Britain. In 2005, Darren Devlyn and Caroline Frost from the Herald Sun reported that Watson then took his idea to the Nine Network in 1982, but it was rejected. Former Network Nine chief executive Ian Johnson commented {{that it was one of}} the [...] "biggest missed opportunities" [...] in his twenty-four years at the network. He added [...] "I remember it being discussed, but I'm not exactly sure what went against it. It may have had something to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> we'd picked up Sale of the Century with Tony Barber in 1980 and it was doing huge business, so we didn't have a pressing need for a five-night-a-week show." [...] Watson then took his idea to the Seven Network, who commissioned the show, following the success of his other Seven Network soap opera, Sons and Daughters. Several titles for the show were discussed, including People Like Us, One Way Street, No Through Road and Living Together until the network programmers voted on Neighbours. The first episode was broadcast on 18 March 1985 and reviews for the show were favourable. However, the Melbourne-produced programme underperformed in the Sydney market and after a meeting of the general managers, Seven decided to drop the show in October 1985. Seven's Melbourne programme boss, Gary Fenton said Sydney chief Ted Thomas told the other general managers that Seven could not afford three dramas and argued that the Sydney-based A Country Practice and Sons and Daughters be retained.|$|E

50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II the situation in Europe curtailed the sharing of items from the archive. The uncertainty also propelled Manus to merge her private library and documents into the IAV holdings for safety. This {{proved to be a}} costly miscalculation, as when the Nazis invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, the archive became a target. By June, German officials had inspected IAV twice and on 12 July 1940 the Security Police confiscated forty boxes of materials, as well as the furnishings and fixtures. The only item which was not taken was the safe, which contained money, other valuables and some of Jacob's papers. The reasons the documents were taken has been obscured. The Germans claimed that the Berlin women's movement wanted them, which the German women later denied, though Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, head of the National Socialist Women's League did admit to having received around 500 books from IAV in 1942. Francisca de Haan a professor of gender studies at Budapest's Central European University, believes that the actual reason the archives were taken had more to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that Manus, <b>the</b> president was Jewish, both an international feminist and pacifist, and suspected of Communist leanings because of her left-leaning views and activities; Manus would later be executed at Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1943.|$|R

2500|$|However, the {{suppression}} of the Uyghurs has more to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they are separatist, rather than Muslim.

The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs, Hui Muslim protestors who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the stereotypical}} view of Chinese magistrates {{was that they}} were {{reluctant}} to intervene as arbiters in any kind of civil dispute, more recent studies have argued that most of a magistrate's work involved the settlement of civil disputes.

Moreover, scholars in the early 21st century, such as Philip Huang （黃宗智）, have argued that the traditional Chinese system of justice was fair, efficient, and frequently used in the settlement of disputes.|$|R
