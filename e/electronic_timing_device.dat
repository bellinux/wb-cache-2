50|$|NIS agents Robert Nigro and Goodman briefed Miceli {{on their}} case against Hartwig, {{telling him that}} they {{believed}} that Hartwig had blown up Turret Two with a Radio Shack timer, {{and gave him a}} copy of Smith's interview. They did not tell Miceli that Smith had recanted his statement or that the NIS had been unable to find any evidence that Hartwig had ever purchased any electronic device from Radio Shack. Miceli directed his team to begin testing to see if an electrical timer could have ignited the powder bags. Technicians at the Navy's metallurgical laboratory at Norfolk Naval Shipyard tested the copper-nickel-alloy rotating band from the center gun's projectile, and stated that they had found trace chemical elements, including barium, silicon, aluminum, and calcium, under the band, which indicated that an electronic timer had been used to cause the explosion. Miceli asked the FBI to duplicate the test on the band. After testing the band, the FBI stated that they did not believe an <b>electronic</b> <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> had been present and that chemicals found on the band likely came from Break-Free solvent used by the Navy to extract the projectile from the center gun barrel after the explosion. According to Ken Nimmich of the FBI Laboratory, Miceli then abruptly terminated the Navy's request for assistance from the FBI lab.|$|E

5000|$|In the Melbourne Cup on November 4, Viewed {{defeated}} the Luca Cumani-trained Bauer {{in a photo}} finish. [...] The finish was so close that the <b>electronic</b> <b>timing</b> <b>devices,</b> which are placed inside the saddle cloths, recorded that Bauer had completed the course one-hundredth of a second faster than Viewed. [...] Viewed was trained by Bart Cummings and was ridden by Blake Shinn. It was Shinn's first Melbourne Cup winner and the 12th for Cummings. [...] It was the fourth time Cummings had won the Cup in partnership with Dato Tan Chin Nam, the owner. Viewed was an outsider in the Melbourne Cup, and paid $41.00 on the totalisator in New South Wales.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Many {{studies have}} used {{subjective}} measures to examine patient compliance during orthodontic treatment. Objective measurement of compliance has {{been confined to}} only a few studies that used <b>electronic</b> <b>timing</b> <b>devices</b> built into removable appliances. Our aim {{in this study was}} to compare subjective and objective methods of measuring compliance with headgear wear. It was hypothesized that orthodontists, patients, and patients’ parents overestimate compliance and report more wearing hours than the headgear timers indicate. Also, relationships between sex, age, treatment time, and headgear compliance were explored. Methods: A headgear timer device and 3 questionnaires were developed to assess compliance. The subjects were unaware that their headgear use was being measured. Results: Significant differences between the estimates of orthodontists, patients, parents, and headgear timer scores were found. Also, there were differences regarding age and treatment time. Conclusions: Subjective measures might result in overestimation of compliance. This suggests that the use of an objective instrument to measure headgear compliance should be continued in future studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Using {{cinematography}} {{to identify}} the drive and recovery phases in wheelchair racing, {{it has been reported}} that the drive phase was approximately 33 % of each propulsive cycle time, with remaining time devoted to the recovery phase. In this study, an <b>electronic</b> <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> has been developed to accurately measure the drive phase time and recovery phase time in each cycle of wheelchair racing. Seventeen wheelchair athletes with national and/or interna-tional racing experience were tested on four selected speeds. It was found that the drive phase was approximately 23 % of each cycle time during wheelchair racing. The drive phase time decreased in each propulsive cycle as speed increased from 30 to 90 % of the peak speed...|$|E
40|$|A tissue {{processing}} instrument (the Histokinette) {{was modified}} {{by the addition}} of an <b>electronic</b> <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> which allows an immunocytochemical staining technique (the APAAP method) to be performed as a semiautomated procedure. After incubation with primary monoclonal antibodies (applied by hand) slides (up to 72 in a batch) are placed in racks and cycled through tanks of reagents, comprising anti-mouse Ig followed by APAAP complexes with intervening timed draining and washing stages. This semiautomated process gave consistent staining results and offered considerable savings in time compared with conventional methods. The same reagent baths were used over four months on an almost daily basis without deterioration in staining intensity, and consequently the calculated overall cost of the staining procedure was less than if the reagents had been applied by hand and then discarded. The machine is now into its eleventh month of operation; the reagents have been changed twice. It is suggested that this approach, because of savings in time and increased consistency, may be an attractive technique for the routine immunocytochemical staining of slides, and that the nature of the APAAP method is particularly suitable for automation as the necessary reagents can be produced at low cost...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Kinesiology: Teaching/Coaching, 2009 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationships between measures of power clean (PC) performance, vertical jump height (VJ), and sprint times among Division II collegiate female soccer players. Hypotheses were (1) relative measures of PC and VJ height would be directly related to each other and inversely related to sprint times, and (2) relative measures of PC would distinguish soccer athletes with regard to sprint ability. PC performance was measured using a standard 3 -repetition maximum (3 -RM) protocol; 1 -RM PC was estimated using a standard conversion table. VJ height was measured using a commercial measuring device; absolute and relative (to body mass) peak power were estimated using validated equations. Sprint times for 20 and 40 m distances were measured as best scores from two trials measured using an <b>electronic</b> eye <b>timing</b> <b>device.</b> Scores on relative PC and VJ height were related (r =. 54, p. 05) or for the 40 -m sprint (t [16] = 1. 54, p >. 05). Lack of standardization in performance of the PC or inaccuracies in estimating 1 RM PC from multiple repetition max effort may explain why there was not a significant relationship between PC performance and sprint times...|$|R

40|$|Computerized {{drilling}} and the <b>electronic</b> <b>timing</b> of detonations are two technological breakthroughs which {{have had an}} important role in updating {{drilling and}} blasting excavation methods, although the <b>electronic</b> <b>timing</b> of detonators is still a comparatively infrequent technical solution to precision blasting problems. On the basis of an extensive collection of published cases, this paper reviews the successes achieved and the main expected advantages from the electronic ignition devices. After describing the primary characteristics of these detonators, some elements will be considered, in order to better understand their applications in different conditions, both in open pit and underground sites: extension of the time delay number, freedom in the choice of time intervals between detonations, timing accuracy, reduction of vibrations, control of back-break and fragmentation. The results are compared to those obtained by pyrotechnical <b>timing</b> <b>devices,</b> and summarized in the concluding remark...|$|R
5000|$|In 1948 Bulova began {{developing}} the Phototimer, a unique combination of photo-finish camera and precision <b>electronic</b> <b>timing</b> instrument. The Phototimer {{was the first}} automatic <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> {{to be used in}} competitive sports. It was used extensively in North America, including at the 1948 US Olympic trials. The Bulova device was activated by the sound of the starting gun firing, rather than by a direct connection, which means that the times were around 0.02 seconds faster than reality. [...] The 1948 Olympics, however, continued to use Omega <b>timing</b> with a <b>device</b> called the 'Magic Eye', developed by British Race Finish Recording Co. Ltd. [...] The automatic times produced in the 1948 Olympics have never been released, but examination of the photos at the finish means that margins have been calculated to 1/100 second accuracy.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evailuate whether use of <b>timing</b> <b>devices,</b> such as audible metronomic tones, would improve BCPR perfomance by trained bystanders. Twenty pairs of bystanders trained in two-person BCPR performled BCPR for 4 minutes on a simulated cardiopulmonary arrest patient using three interventions: 1) BCPR with no <b>timing</b> <b>devices,</b> 2) BCPR plus metronomic tones for coordinating compression rate only, 3) BCPR with a <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> and metronome for coordinating ventilation and compression rates, respectively. Bystanders were evaluated on their ability to meet international and AHA CPR guidelines. Bystanders failed to provide the recommended number of breaths and number of compressions in the absence of a <b>timing</b> <b>device</b> and in the presence of audible metronomic tones for only coordinating compression rate. Bystanders using <b>timing</b> <b>devices</b> to coordinate both components of BCPR provided the reco number of breaths and were closer to providing the recommended number of compressions compared with the other interventions.
