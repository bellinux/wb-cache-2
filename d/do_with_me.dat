25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E
500|$|Chesimard {{changed her}} name to Assata Olugbala Shakur in 1971. Assata is a West African name, derived from the Arabic name Aisha, said to mean [...] "she who struggles", while Shakur means [...] "thankful one" [...] in Arabic. Olugbala means “love for the people” in Yoruba. She now {{identified}} as an African and felt her old name no longer fit: “It sounded so strange when people called me Joanne. It really had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I didn’t feel like no Joanne, or no negro, or no amerikan. I felt like an African woman”.|$|E

500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling me what to do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And it has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E
500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2016, Wayne made {{statements}} {{critical of}} the Black Lives Matter movement, saying [...] "I don’t feel connected to a damn thing that ain’t got nothin’ to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> If you do, you crazy as shit", and adding that {{his status as a}} rich African American with white fans is evidence that black people are valued in modern America.|$|E

"All {{the things}} that went wrong with Sabbat {{in the old days}} were really nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and Andy Sneap, even though we had our {{disagreements}} in the days when we were young.

2500|$|Part 2, pages 51–53, dated July 1878, {{had another}} note {{attached}} to it: [...] "I've sealed the previous fifty pages {{in an envelope}} as finished. But {{in the course of}} the last 2.5 years lots of things have happened related to this case and I see that, having once started, I need to continue..." [...] There is an inscription on the envelope: [...] "These papers which have to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> personally, I commit to Sophia Aleksandrovna Nikitenko for her to deal with them as I asked her to. Ivan Goncharov, May 19, 1883".|$|E

2500|$|During a 2013 {{interview}} with Chicago Pride, on being {{asked if he}} has kept in contact {{with any of the}} other Cobra actors, he replied [...] "No. There were few I was close with - but mostly the civil suit, and the pressure Bryan Kocis put on the other models, not to have anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and then Bryan's death pretty much put an end of the friendships I'd garnered there. From what I've heard some have moved on nicely enough. Some aren't even alive anymore. I randomly saw one in a San Francisco gym during Pride a few years ago but thought better of stopping him to say hello. It's a chapter of my life I don't like to revel in." [...] He stated in the interview that the trend in the pornographic industry is toward unprotected, unsafe sex. He has warned about the social impact on gay and bisexual men's decision making, especially when in the heat of lust and passion, while influenced by alcohol or drugs. He appeared in a short interview for his film Big Easy in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The 1972 Hans Jayanti, {{an annual}} festival celebrating the {{birthday}} of Rawat's guru was attended by over 500,000 people. Six Jumbo jets were chartered by American followers who paid extra so that South Americans could fly from New York to India for free. Other countries made similar arrangements to help the less financially able. On arrival, Indian customs impounded a suitcase containing cash, jewelry and wristwatches worth between US$27,000 and $80,000 which they said had not been properly declared. Rawat said, [...] "It has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> it {{is an attempt to}} harm the Divine Light Mission. When someone grows, others get jealous of him, and the Divine Light Mission has just blasted like an atomic bomb all over the world." [...] A DLM spokesman said that the money had been pooled by 3,000 followers to cover expenses, and that the valuables were gifts. The finances of Rawat and the DLM in India and overseas were investigated by the Indian government. In June 1973 the investigation was still under way, and Rawat had to post a $13,300 bond in order to leave the country. Charges were never filed, and the Indian government later issued an apology.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after, Kirchner's {{close friend}} and mentor, Botho Graef died and Kirchner {{decided to return to}} Davos for treatment. There he was under the care of Dr. Lucius Spengler who forced Kirchner to adhere to strict rules and routine. Kirchner deeply resented this and did {{everything}} in his power to deceive the doctor: [...] "Spengler didn’t know what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> for my deception was totally alien to this excellent man’s way of thinking". To avoid being under constant watch, Kirchner moved to the Reusch Hut on the Stafelalp in the summer of 1917. Kirchner continued to experience depression, occasional pain and paralysis of his limbs but wrote in a more cheerful tone to Dr. Hagemann at the end of July: [...] "I wish to remain in the world and for the world. The high mountains here will help me". The summer was very productive despite Kirchner's illness. He finished some important pieces during the two month, such as [...] "View of the Church in Monstein" [...] and [...] "Rising Moon in the Stafelalp". Together with 11 woodcuts, these works marked the start of Kirchner's Alpine life.|$|E

2500|$|A popular {{paean to}} the Ganges is the Ganga Lahiri {{composed}} by a seventeenth century poet Jagannatha who, legend has it, was turned {{out of his}} Hindu Brahmin caste for carrying on {{an affair with a}} Muslim woman. Having attempted futilely to be rehabilitated within the Hindu fold, the poet finally appeals to Ganga, the hope of the hopeless, and the comforter of last resort. Along with his beloved, Jagannatha sits {{at the top of the}} flight of steps leading to the water at the famous Panchganga Ghat in Varanasi. As he recites each verse of the poem, the water of the Ganges rises up one step, until in the end it envelops the lovers and carry them away. [...] "I come to you as a child to his mother," [...] begins the Ganga Lahiri. [...] I come as an orphan to you, moist with love. [...] I come without refuge to you, giver of sacred rest. [...] I come a fallen man to you, uplifter of all. [...] I come undone by disease to you, the perfect physician. [...] I come, my heart dry with thirst, to you, ocean of sweet wine. [...] <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> whatever you will.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of their {{previous}} album, The Real Thing and its subsequent tour, Faith No More took a break {{for a year and a}} half before beginning work on the follow-up, Angel Dust. During this time Mike Patton rejoined his high-school band Mr. Bungle to record their eponymous début album. This situation had an effect on the band, since drummer Mike Bordin thought the writing process was like the state of a [...] "magic slate" [...] having been [...] "completely covered in writing; there was not any more room for any more writing on that slate, so we all went and said all right, and erased everything, and started writing new stuff," [...] and Patton was creatively revitalized. They decided not to [...] "play it safe" [...] and instead took a different musical direction, much to the dismay of guitarist Jim Martin. [...] Martin also didn't like the title of the album as chosen by keyboardist Roddy Bottum. [...] In an interview taken while they were in the studio he said that [...] "Roddy [...] wanted to name it Angel Dust, I don't know why, I just want you to know that if it's named Angel Dust, it didn't have anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} received media criticism {{due to her}} American accent {{upon her}} reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, [...] "I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart." [...] However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the Daily Mirror describing it as [...] "hilarious" [...] and branding the character [...] "Go Away Again Vicki". [...] He added, [...] "Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys." [...] Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: [...] "When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that {{for a few months}} and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and they told me they wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent - but it was nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not understand," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{break off}} all {{communication}} with you here and now. You must {{give me a}} power of attorney ere you start to-night, and then be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> trenchantly until better days." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{experience}} {{was very difficult}} for Foster, and she has rarely commented on it publicly. In the aftermath of the events, she wrote an essay titled Why Me?, which was published by Esquire in 1982 on the condition that [...] "there be no cover lines, no publicity and no photos". In 1991, she cancelled an interview with NBC's Today Show when she discovered Hinckley would be mentioned in the introduction, and the producers were unwilling to change it. She discussed Hinckley with Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes II in 1999, explaining that she does not [...] "like to dwell on it too much [...] I never wanted to be the actress who was remembered for that event. Because it didn't have anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I was kind of a hapless bystander. But [...] what a scarring, strange moment in history for me, to be 17 years old, 18 years old, and to be caught up in a drama like that." [...] She stated that the incident had a major impact on career choices she made but acknowledged that as difficult as the ordeal was for her, it was minimal compared to the suffering of Reagan's press secretary James Brady, who was permanently disabled in the shooting and {{died as a result of}} his injuries 33 years later, and his loved ones: [...] "whatever bad moments that I had certainly could never compare to that family".|$|E
2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It has to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have {{nothing better to do}} than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E
