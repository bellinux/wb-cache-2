50|$|The European Lead Factory is {{operational}} since 2013 and {{consists of}} two main components: the Joint European Compound Library and the European Screening Centre. Together these elements provide a platform for pharmaceutical researchers in Europe to identify drug discovery starting points, by connecting <b>innovative</b> <b>drug</b> targets to high-quality small molecules. The result is defined in a ‘hit list’: a number of compounds that show affinity for the target. The compounds on those lists can either be used as probes to better understand biological pathways or as starting points for lead discovery efforts for novel drugs. These hits can be further optimised outside of the European Lead Factory, for affinity but also for drug-like properties as selectivity, solubility and metabolism in the human body. The ultimate goal is that these candidate drugs will solve unmet medical needs when fully approved as drug by the authorities.|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} fast drug {{innovation}} {{and the public}} demand for risk-free drugs creates a dilemma for regulatory authorities: less restrictive procedures involve uncertainties about benefit/risk profiles of new drugs. The European Union has introduced two instruments that regulate early market access: conditional approvals (CAs) and approvals under exceptional circumstances (ECs). We have studied whether these instruments compromise the safety of new drugs and whether they lead to earlier access to <b>innovative</b> <b>drugs.</b> Our study shows that neither of these regulatory pathways accelerates the approval process for <b>innovative</b> <b>drugs.</b> However, the CA pathway shortens the clinical development period. Approvals under ECs are associated with longer clinical development periods, but this regulatory pathway may open up opportunities for specific drugs to be admitted into the market because less comprehensive data are required. Despite {{the fact that these}} advanced approvals are based on limited safety databases, there are no special safety issues associated with using these pathways...|$|R

50|$|Approaching cancer {{research}} {{with a different}} angle, not asking why the normal cells become malignant, but rather from the patients expectations: how do my tumor cells quit their malignant status, and thus, revert?, Laurent Susini joined Molecular Engines Laboratories (M.E.L.), a biotech company with headquarters and laboratories located in Paris (France), in 2000, {{to develop a new}} generation of <b>innovative</b> <b>drugs</b> against cancer with Adam Telerman and Robert Amson.|$|R

40|$|Within the Italian federalist framework, {{national}} and regional governance tools for pharmaceutical care have been developed in recent years. From a financial perspective, the pharmaceutical outpatient expenditure has already been put under control and this has markedly contributed to reducing the overall costs. The hospital pharmaceutical expenses instead have grown. On this last element bears how <b>innovative</b> and expensive <b>drugs</b> are introduced and managed; among these drugs, cancer drugs have a decisive role. In the last years the AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco – Italian Drugs Agency) policies regarding the adoption process of new drugs have stressed the concept of value for money: any <b>innovative</b> and expensive <b>drug</b> is linked to a web-based control register in order to monitor outcomes. The aim is to relate the drug price to the obtained results (payment by result and risk-sharing) {{or at least to}} institute simple financial agreements (cost-sharing) that can be defined as managed entry agreements (MEA). The critical point that can cause equity problems is the way these national governance tools are applied in different regional contexts. There are in fact marked differences among Italian regions. Most regions are aware {{that the only way to}} rule the system, and in particular the use of <b>innovative</b> <b>drugs,</b> is to have stronger evidence-based management tools able to connect different systems of oncological prescriptions. The aim is to follow patients in different care settings in order to measure the pathway phases in terms of consumption, costs and quality outcomes and therefore evaluate in actual practice the value for money of <b>innovative</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} health care cost, focus {{needs to be}} given towards value-for-money, especially {{in the context of}} <b>innovative</b> <b>drugs.</b> A multi-disciplinary approach towards drug development is important in order to demonstrate the value of innovation to physicians and patients. Input into the drug development process at various stages of clinical trials must incorporate patient-focused endpoints and analyses. Demonstrating value of drugs will help ensure that innovative therapies should be seen as health care investment and not expense...|$|R
50|$|Within the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, prize theory has gotten much criticism. One {{of the main}} criticisms is that giving rewards {{in the form of}} prize money to drug companies for producing <b>innovative</b> <b>drugs</b> will not be seen for many years while the drug is tested in the market, and that prize funds would not reward pharmaceuticals for producing different versions of drugs; “me-too” drugs. These variations are seen as part of the bigger problem by Senator Sanders.|$|R

40|$|R educing {{health costs}} {{is a hot}} {{political}} issue in manycountries, so the introduction and use of generic drugsis stimulated. The generics may be introduced when the patent of an <b>innovative</b> <b>drug</b> expires. With classic drugs, normally produced by chemical synthesis, only limited data for marketing approval application are needed compared with the original drug (1). The generic manufacturer needs to submit data showing the generic to be chemically identical to the <b>innovative</b> <b>drug</b> and pharmaceutically acceptable. In addition, the bioavailability of the generic product must {{be shown to be}} equivalent to that of the reference product. This is assessed by pharmacokinetic studies demonstrating an equivalent rate and extent of absorption, typically conducted in healthy volunteers. If the pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the drug plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum ob-served plasma concentration (Cmax) fall within the range of 0. 80 to 1. 25 (90 % confidence interval), the products are considere...|$|E
