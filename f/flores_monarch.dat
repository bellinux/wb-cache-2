Recent surveys have added substantially to the data base, especially of the resident forest species, and endangered and endemic taxa, as well as adding a number of migrant and maritime species to the island list. Of particular interest are the rare forest endemics Wallace's Hanging-parrot Loriculus flosculus, the almost unknown Flores Scopsowl Otus alfredi, <b>Flores</b> <b>Monarch</b> Monarcha sacerdotum and Flores Crow Corvus florensis. An appeal is made for further surveys over the eastern part {{of the island}} and the eastern island chain...|$|E
