[...] The first successful VfR test <b>firing</b> <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> (five minutes) {{was conducted by}} Max Valier at the Heylandt Works on January 25, 1930; and additional rocket experiments were conducted at a farm near Bernstadt, Saxony.|$|R
50|$|In 1928 and 1929, {{he worked}} with Fritz von Opel {{on a number of}} rocket-powered cars and aircraft. For von Opel, these were {{publicity}} stunts for the Opel company, and for Valier, a way of further raising interest in rocketry amongst the general population. It was Valier who enlisted the assistance of Friedrich Sander in these endeavours as the supplier of solid-fuel rocket motors. By the late 1920s, the VfR was focussing its efforts on liquid-fuelled rockets. Their first successful test <b>firing</b> <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> (five minutes) occurred in the Heylandt plant on January 25, 1930. On April 19, 1930, Valier performed the first test drive of a rocket car <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> propulsion, the Valier-Heylandt Rak 7.|$|R

50|$|Electrochemical {{fuel cells}} such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) {{are also being}} {{considered}} as a power source since they can produce instantaneous energy like batteries and conserve the fuel source when not needed.

50|$|Fuel gas is contrasted <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> {{and from}} solid fuels, though some fuel gases are {{liquefied}} for storage or transport.

40|$|In {{piston engines}} and in gas turbines, the {{injection}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> {{often leads to}} the formation of a liquid film on the combustor wall. If a flame reaches this zone, undesired phenomena such as coking may occur and diminish the lifetime of the engine. Moreover, the effect of such an interaction on maximum wall heat fluxes, flame quenching and pollutant formation is largely unknown. This paper presents a numerical study of the interaction of a premixed flame with a cold wall covered with a film of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel.</b> Simulations show that the presence of the film leads to a very rich zone at the wall in which the flame cannot propagate. As a result, the flame wall distance remains larger <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> than it is for a dry wall and maximum heat fluxes are smaller. The nature of the interaction of flame wall interaction <b>with</b> a <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> is also different from the classical flame / dry wall interaction: it is controlled mainly by chemical mechanisms and not by the thermal quenching effect observed for flames interacting with dry walls: the existence od a very rich zone created above the liquid film is the main mechanism controlling quenching...|$|R
30|$|To {{solve the}} problem {{progressively}} as indicated in the above strategy, we started our investigation with the modeling of the oxygen separation process along <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> atomization, heating, and evaporation.

Once we decide the correct percentage that should be fed to have close-to-complete reaction then we model the oxy-combustion of the fuel vapor inside the OTR.|$|R
