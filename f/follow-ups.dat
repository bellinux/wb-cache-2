5|$|As a start, the {{spectrum}} of HAT-P-33 was composed using the digital speedometer at the 1.5-meter Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The collected data found that the star was a single dwarf star exhibiting a slight rotation. Several of its parameters, including its effective temperature and surface gravity, were found. Additionally, the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at a 1.93-meter telescope at France's Haute-Provence Observatory was used to observe the star. The resulting data invited the possibility that radial velocity measurements, which can exhibit anomalies that often indicate {{the presence of a}} planet, may have been because of background distortion (and not a planet). This possibility significantly complicated the ability of scientists to verify this planet. After the observations, <b>follow-ups</b> were postponed for several years.|$|E
40|$|Background: Spontaneous {{reports of}} {{suspected}} adverse drug reactions to regulatory bodies and market authorization holders {{are important in}} pharmacovigilance. <b>Follow-up</b> information, which {{can be difficult to}} obtain, is often required from reporters; therefore, we developed targeted <b>follow-up</b> letters that we hoped would make replying easier. Objective: To examine the effects of introducing targeted letters on responses to <b>follow-up</b> requests from a regional pharmacovigilance centre in the UK. Method: In January 2001 we redesigned our <b>follow-up</b> request letter to include tick-boxes targeted to obtain the appropriate information from reporters. Response rates and the requirement for a second <b>follow-up</b> letter were examined for the 5 -year period before introduction of the targeted <b>follow-up</b> letter (1996 - 2000) and the 5 years after the change to the targeted <b>follow-up</b> system (2001 - 5). In an 18 -month sub-study examining data from 2001 - 2, time from the production of the first targeted <b>follow-up</b> letter to receipt of a response from reporters was also measured. Results: The introduction of targeted <b>follow-up</b> letters was associated with an increase in the mean annual response rate for <b>follow-up</b> from 36. 4 % in the 5 years pre-targeted <b>follow-up</b> to 60. 5 % in the 5 years post-targeted <b>follow-up</b> (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether intensive <b>follow-up</b> improves 5 -year survival rates in patients with colorectal cancer who were operated on for cure. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Intensive <b>follow-up</b> of patients with colorectal cancer is still controversial. The present uncertainty {{in regard to the}} value of intensive <b>follow-up</b> could be the result of the absence of prospective randomized studies comparing patients with and without <b>follow-up.</b> METHODS: Studies comparing two <b>follow-up</b> programs of different intensities were identified in the medical literature and were aggregated in a meta-analysis using the "random effects method. " Seven nonrandomized studies describing 3283 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with intensive <b>follow-up</b> did have 9 % better 5 -year survival rates than did those with minimal or no <b>follow-up,</b> only when intensive <b>follow-up</b> included carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assays. In addition, more asymptomatic recurrences were detected and more recurrences were resected in patients with intensive <b>follow-up.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicated that intensive <b>follow-up</b> using CEA assays can identify treatable recurrences at a relatively early stage. Treatment of these recurrences appears to be associated with improved 5 -year survival rates. However, not all intensive <b>follow-up</b> strategies will be equally effective. <b>Follow-up</b> may yield the best results if diagnostic tests are used only to detect those recurrences that can be operated on with curative intent and when <b>follow-up</b> is "individualized," according to patient characteristics...|$|R

Methods: Intervention design: GP-led integrated melanoma <b>follow-up</b> was designed and tested according to the MRC framework for the design and evaluation of complex healthcare interventions. Exploratory randomised trial: An exploratory randomised trial involving 35 practices and 142 patients was conducted to determine whether patients were more satisfied with the GP-led <b>follow-up</b> than hospital-based <b>follow-up.</b> The study also explored guideline adherence; health-related quality of life; and costs. Parallel qualitative interviews: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 patient recipients and 17 intervention GPs, ascertaining their experiences and views of the new service. Results: A GP-led integrated melanoma <b>follow-up</b> is feasible. It was attractive to most patients eligible to receive it. Patients that received the programme reported better satisfaction with <b>follow-up</b> during the study year in 6 out of 15 aspects of <b>follow-up</b> care.

40|$|Background Cancer <b>follow-up</b> has {{traditionally}} been undertaken in secondary care, but there are increasing calls to deliver it in primary care. Aim To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of primary versus secondary care <b>follow-up</b> of cancer patients, determine {{the effectiveness of the}} integration of primary care in routine hospital <b>follow-up,</b> and evaluate the impact of patient-initiated <b>follow-up</b> on primary care. Design of study Systematic review. Setting Primary and secondary care settings. Method A search was carried out of 19 electronic databases, online trial registries, conference proceedings, and bibliographies of included studies. The review included comparative studies or economic evaluations of primary versus secondary care <b>follow-up,</b> hospital <b>follow-up</b> with formal primary care involvement versus conventional hospital <b>follow-up,</b> and hospital <b>follow-up</b> versus patient-initiated or minimal <b>follow-up</b> if the study reported the impact on primary care. Results There was no statistically significant difference for patient wellbeing, recurrence rate, survival, recurrence-related serious clinical events, diagnostic delay, or patient satisfaction. GP-led breast cancer <b>follow-up</b> was cheaper than hospital <b>follow-up.</b> Intensified primary health care resulted in increased home-care nurse contact, and improved discharge summary led to increased GP contact. Evaluation of patient-initiated or minimal <b>follow-up</b> found no statistically significant impact on the number of GP consultations or cancer-related referrals. Conclusion Weak evidence suggests that breast cancer <b>follow-up</b> in primary care is effective. Interventions improving communication between primary and secondary care could lead to greater GP involvement. Discontinuation of formal <b>follow-up</b> may not increase GP workload.

40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} a report of a {{systematic}} review of the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of nurse-led <b>follow-up</b> for patients with cancer. Background. As cancer survivorship increases, conventional <b>follow-up</b> puts a major burden on outpatient services. Nurse-led <b>follow-up</b> is a promising alternative. Data sources. Searches were conducted covering a period from inception to February 2007 of 19 electronic databases, seven online trial registries, five conference proceedings reference lists of previous reviews and included studies. Review methods. Standard systematic review methodology was used. Comparative studies and economic evaluations of nurse-led vs. physician-led <b>follow-up</b> were eligible. Studies comparing different types of nurse-led <b>follow-up</b> were excluded. Any cancer was considered; any outcome measure included. Results. Four randomised controlled trials were identified, two including cost analyses. There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in survival, recurrence or psychological morbidity. One study showed better HRQL measures for nurse-led <b>follow-up,</b> but one showed no difference, two showed a statistically significant difference for patient satisfaction, but two did not. Patients with lung cancer were more satisfied with nurse-led telephone <b>follow-up</b> and more were able to die at home. Patients with breast cancer thought patient-initiated <b>follow-up</b> convenient, but found conventional <b>follow-up</b> more reassuring. One study showed the cost of nurse-led <b>follow-up</b> to be less than that of physician-led <b>follow-up,</b> but no statistical comparison was made. Conclusion. Patients appeared satisfied with nurse-led <b>follow-up.</b> Patient-initiated or telephone <b>follow-up</b> could be practical alternatives to conventional care. However, well-conducted research is needed before equivalence to physician-led <b>follow-up</b> can be assured in terms of survival, recurrence, patient well-being and cost-effectiveness...|$|R

GPs were also surveyed in their <b>follow-up</b> practice of RP patients, to assess their familiarity in caring for these patients. Results: In total, 65 cases were identified that met the inclusion criteria. At 60  months of <b>follow-up,</b> 66 % (43 / 65) of patients had a compliant <b>follow-up</b> regime. For patients with noncompliant <b>follow-up</b> at 60  months, median time of compliance did not differ significantly when assessing preoperative PSA, Gleason sum, extraprostatic extension, or surgical margin status. Of the GPs surveyed, 68 % of GPs felt comfortable in <b>follow-up</b> of RP patients. Some 62 % of GPs would expect the PSA to be < 0. 1 and 25 % of GPs would measure the PSA annually. Conclusion: Our study identified that <b>follow-up</b> by GPs after RP is insufficient. Accordingly, there is a requirement for formal educational programs if primary care is to take a greater role in <b>follow-up</b> of these patients...|$|R
