5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and <b>foreign</b> <b>ownership</b> in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, NBN's Perth-based owner, Parry Corporation, spun off NBN Limited {{into a new}} company, NBN Enterprises, and took a 40% stake in the new company, with Security Pacific Capital Corporation buying 60%. Parry sold their stake soon after, holding onto Papua New Guinea {{television}} station NTN, which NBN had helped to set up. Fulcrum Media's move to later purchase the station was a source for confusion, as {{it was revealed that}} many companies, including the NSW State Superannuation Board and Westpac Banking Corporation, held substantial stakes in Fulcrum Media. Parry Corp's new owner CityWest issued a court challenge to re-acquire NBN, but it was revealed that CityWest was held by Hong Kong company Hung Lung Corporation, thereby violating <b>foreign</b> <b>ownership</b> laws. Following ownership changes, NBN Enterprises was sold to Washington H. Soul Pattinson for A$36 million.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, around 7% of all New Zealand agriculturally {{productive}} land was foreign-owned. In 2011, economist Bill Rosenberg {{said that the}} figure is closer to 9% if <b>foreign</b> <b>ownership</b> of forestry is included. In March 2013 the financial sector, which includes the four big Australian owned banks, was worth $39.3 billion accounting for the largest portion of the $101.4 billion <b>foreign</b> <b>ownership</b> of New Zealand companies.|$|E

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{implications}} of increasing stock market globalisation for the economics of protection. European, Japanese and Australian data mostly indicate that over 30 per cent {{of the stock market}} is now foreign-owned, a large increase on the 1980 s. <b>Foreign</b> share <b>ownership</b> in the USA is lower, but increasing fast. This degree of <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership</b> is likely to change qualitatively the nature of governmental support for 'domestic' firms. A series of worked duopoly examples suggests that the level of <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership</b> is usually sufficient for profit shifting on its own no longer to justify protection. ...|$|R
30|$|The paper {{considered}} {{a model of}} the world economy consisting of structurally identical economies and analyzed the stability of a unique symmetric steady state with and without <b>foreign</b> land <b>ownership</b> rights. This does not imply that initial differences in production technology, consumer preferences, or land endowment are unimportant for the world economy not to converge to the symmetric steady state. Instead, I demonstrated that even a small amount of inequality, expressed in terms of initial capital stock, can be magnified after <b>foreign</b> land <b>ownership</b> is allowed. I do not argue that <b>foreign</b> land <b>ownership</b> should be blamed for non‐convergence and other sources of inequality such as geography, credit market imperfections, lack of transparency in corporate governance, and poorly designed public policies, are unimportant sources for non‐convergence. Instead, I demonstrated that the <b>foreign</b> land <b>ownership</b> alone can create advantage/disadvantage for initially rich/poor countries and halt the process of convergence.|$|R

25|$|The company {{started the}} process of being listed on the NASDAQ {{exchange}} in New York in January 1983. No Norwegian company had previously been listed in the US; the legislation was not harmonized and there were restrictions on twenty percent <b>foreign</b> <b>ownership</b> of Norwegian companies. The limited was raised to forty-nine percent, but this was regarded by ND as too low, so they split the ownership into A- and B-shares, with and without voting rights. With this change, Norwegian authorities permitted an eighty percent <b>foreign</b> <b>ownership</b> in the company, but only the non-voting B shares were permitted to be listed on NASDAQ. The initial public offering brought in NOK400 million in capital.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{interaction}} between corporate disclosure and <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership</b> on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE). Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows the trinary procedure of Aksu and Kosedag and uses the Standard & Poor's transparency and disclosure items in the construction of the disclosure index. Therefore, the paper adopts a panel data analysis covering a period from 2002 to 2007 using the seemingly unrelated regression approach. Findings – The results indicate a statistically significant interaction between corporate disclosures and <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership</b> among the sample firms. The market value of equity and market-to-book value ratio is documented; free cash flow and financial leverage have statistically significant relationships with <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership.</b> Originality/value – This is the first of its kind in the country that considers the impact of corporate governance and disclosure on <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership</b> despite the numerous studies carried out on the GSE.

25|$|A {{referendum}} in Haiti subsequently approved {{the new constitution}} in 1918 (by a vote of 98 225 to 768). It was a generally a liberal document, and it explicitly allowed foreigners to purchase land.

40|$|This paper empirically {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} <b>foreign</b> bank <b>ownership</b> and the three pillars of the New Basel Capital Accord (i. e., capital regulatory oversight, supervisory oversight, and market discipline). Using a new database covering 153 countries, we find that countries with greater market discipline have a lower presence of foreign banks operating in their economy. Furthermore, our evidence indicates that capital regulatory oversight and supervisory oversight are not significantly related to <b>foreign</b> bank <b>ownership.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|Further, {{works on}} {{domestic}} versus <b>foreign</b> <b>ownerships</b> emphasize {{the negative effects}} of the latter. However, Mata and Portugal (2002) cannot report significant differences in survival chances between domestic and foreign firms. Kronborg and Thomsen (2009) further note a significant survival premium for non-domestic firms. Possible explanations are offered by Vicente-Lorente and Suárez-González (2007), who summarize that due to their cultural background, foreign firms are characterized by more heterogeneous downsizing behaviors compared to domestic market participants, yielding ambiguous results.|$|R
25|$|Although a net-importing {{nation will}} {{transfer}} {{a portion of}} domestic currency into <b>foreign</b> <b>ownership,</b> the currency will usually remain within the importing nation.

25|$|In many cases, {{such as the}} cabinet-directed {{prohibition}} on <b>foreign</b> <b>ownership</b> for broadcasters and the legislated principle of the predominance of Canadian content, these acts and orders often leave the CRTC less room to change policy than critics sometimes suggest, {{and the result is}} that the commission is often the lightning rod for policy criticism that could arguably be better directed at the government itself.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>foreign</b> institutional <b>ownership</b> on contemporaneous stock return volatility in Indonesia. In this study, return volatility is measured as standard deviation of daily stockreturns. The dynamic panel data results based on System GMM (S-GMM) estimation, confirm that <b>foreign</b> institutional <b>ownership</b> tend to linearly and convexly increase monthly stock return volatility. The linear impact seems to be weaker for stocks with higher market capitalization, but stronger for stocks with higher turnover. Furthertest reveals that foreign financial institutional ownershiplinearly contributes to return volatility upsurge, while <b>foreign</b> non-financial corporation <b>ownership</b> convexly contribute to return volatility increase. The additional test also uncovers that domestic financial and non-financial institutionalownerships do not impact return volatility. </p...|$|R
50|$|Multinational {{corporations}} are also ranked {{by the amount}} of foreign assets that they own. However, the TNI ranking can differ markedly from this. For example, as of 2000, General Electric was the second largest multinational corporation in terms of <b>foreign</b> assert <b>ownership.</b> However, it ranked only 73rd by the TNI, with an index of only 40%. Although the company had large investments outside of the United States, most of its sales, employment, and assets were within the U.S.. In contrast, Exxon has a TNI of 68% and Vodafone has a TNI of 81%. As of 2001, General Electric ranked 75th, with a TNI of 36.7%. The 14 most transnational corporations originated in small countries (Switzerland, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada), whereas the largest multinational corporations in terms of <b>foreign</b> asset <b>ownership</b> all had low TNI scores. General Motors, the fourth largest multinational corporation in terms of <b>foreign</b> asset <b>ownership</b> only ranked 83rd (30.7%) on the TNI top 100. IBM ranked 50th (53.7%), Volkswagen ranked 45th (55.7%), and Toyota, the sixth largest multinational corporation in terms of <b>foreign</b> asset <b>ownership,</b> only ranked 82nd (30.9%) on the broader TNI scale.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the implications of}} <b>foreign</b> firm <b>ownership</b> and international profit shifting through thin capitalization for corporate tax policy. We consider a model of interjurisdictional tax competition where the corporate tax serves as a backstop to the personal income tax, interest on debt is deductible from the corporate tax base and multinational firms may shift profit across countries through thin capitalization. We show {{that the problem of}} thin capitalization induces countries to reduce their corporate tax rates below the personal income tax rate and to broaden their tax bases. Moreover, <b>foreign</b> firm <b>ownership</b> leads to a reduction in corporate tax rates. We also show that there is scope for welfare enhancing tax coordination in our model. In the presence of both <b>foreign</b> firm <b>ownership</b> and thin capitalization, countries gain from a coordinated increase in corporate tax rates or from a coordinated broadening of the tax base. tax competition, income shifting...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the association of}} <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership</b> with firm-level disclosure and corporate governance structures in Zimbabwe, a developing country in Southern Africa. Our motivation for the study derives from the literature, which suggests that foreign investors: (1) generally have a preference for companies {{in which they are}} well informed and where their investments {{are more likely to be}} protected, and (2) avoid companies in developing countries because of weak corporate governance structures and low disclosure. Using data drawn from companies listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, we examine the effect of disclosure and corporate governance on <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership.</b> We find that disclosure, proportion of non-executive directors, institutional share ownership and audit committee independence are all positively and significantly associated with <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership.</b> Our results also demonstrate that market capitalization, return on equity and liquidity ratios are significantly associated with <b>foreign</b> share <b>ownership.</b> These results are consistent with the notion that foreign investors have a preference for companies with effective corporate governance structures, companies with less information asymmetry, as well as companies with healthy cash positions. The results have implications for policy-makers in developing countries in their endeavour to improve liquidity on stock markets through the participation of foreign investors. The results are also useful to managers in developing countries who are keen to increase the market value of their company, thereby reducing their cost of capita...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} restricting foreign bank entry on bank net interest margins while controlling for (a) impediments to domestic bank entry, (b) the degree of <b>foreign</b> bank <b>ownership</b> of the domestic banking industry, (c) an array of bank-specific characteristics, (c) banking sectorconcentration, and (d) various country traits. Using data on almost 1200 banks across 47 countries, {{the results suggest that}} restricting foreign bank entry boosts bank net interest margins. Also, restricting foreign bank entry is special since restricting domestic bank entry does not help explainbank margins and the degree of <b>foreign</b> bank <b>ownership</b> also enters insignificantly. ...|$|R

Imports are an economic benefit to the importing nation because they provide the nation with real goods it can consume, that it otherwise would not have had.

25|$|The {{idea was}} to create a network of wholly and {{partially}} owned channels, and affiliates to rebroadcast the network's programs. In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC. The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries; many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit <b>foreign</b> <b>ownership</b> of broadcasting properties. As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Cross-border and {{international}} second home ownership is a worldwide phenomenon and growing in popularity as people seek for desirable environments further away than before. As the desired landscapes {{are also likely}} to possess a considerable local and national value, research is needed to find out how host societies perceive and receive the newcomers. This paper explores the Finnish public debate on <b>foreign</b> second home <b>ownership</b> from 1990 to 2008, a period that has witnessed a considerable growth in <b>foreign</b> property <b>ownership.</b> The paper uses the concept of cottage landscape to analyse how second homes are positioned nationally and how <b>foreign</b> second home <b>ownership</b> is debated in relation to the national definitions and valuations. Based on changing emphases and fears related to the phenomenon, three periods of public debate are distinguished. The results demonstrate the iconic image of cottage landscape in the Finnish society by showing how <b>foreign</b> second home <b>ownership</b> is perceived {{as a threat to the}} Finnish way of life, landownership rights and national identity. From the perspective of the host society, <b>foreign</b> second home <b>ownership</b> is a complicated and emotional matter with potential to arise opposition and even conflicts when the foreign demand focuses on locally or nationally valued landscapes. Therefore research on the internationalisation of second home ownership can no longer ignore the perspective of the host society...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} ownership types on firms’ R&D intensity and innovation performance, using a sample of 357, 857 Chinese firms from 2005 to 2007. This study finds considerable divergence among Chinese domestic enterprises in terms of R&D intensity and innovation performance. We find that firms owned by the central government are the key drivers for firms’ R&D activities, while local government, private and <b>foreign</b> <b>ownerships</b> are negatively related to both R&D intensity and innovation performance. This paper finds significant divergence within government ownership category and argues that China’s institutional changes generate varied government ownership groups with different levels of resource endowment, which in turn influence firms’ R&D activities.|$|R
