25|$|Digital {{terrestrial}} television (DTTV or DTT) is a technological evolution of broadcast television and an advancement over analog television. DTTV broadcasts land-based (terrestrial) signals. The advantages of digital {{terrestrial television}} are similar to digital versus analog in platforms such as cable, satellite, and all telecommunications: the efficient use of spectrum and provision of more capacity than analog, better quality images, and lower operating costs for broadcast and transmission (after the initial upgrade costs). A terrestrial implementation of <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> (<b>DTV)</b> technology uses an aerial to broadcast to a conventional television antenna (or aerial) instead of a satellite dish or cable television connection.|$|E

During the 11th ASEAN Digital Broadcasting Meeting members updated the status on DTV implementation and agreed to inform ASEAN members on the Guidelines for ASEAN Digital Switchover. An issue was raised around the availability and affordability of set-top boxes (STB), thus ASEAN members were asked to make policies to determine funding for STBs, methods of allocation, subsidies and rebates, and other methods for the allocation of STBs. It was also agreed in the meeting to form a task force to develop STB specifications for DVB-T2 to ensure efficiency.|$|E

The FCC is required by statute to avoid harmful interference to licensed TV channels. This paper addresses two of the core questions related to the proposed introduction of unlicensed transmissions in the vacated TV channels: Do the proposed rules provide DTV stations adequate protection from interference from these devices?

40|$|For {{understandable}} reasons many television programmes rely on {{visual content}} and composition {{to help to}} tell their story. The provision of additional description of the scene or action can therefore provide a considerable benefit to understanding, especially to the visually impaired. Audio description (AD) is an ancillary component associated with a TV service which delivers a verbal description of the visual scene {{as an aid to}} understanding and enjoyment particularly (but not exclusively) for viewers who have visual impairments. This White Paper describes the user requirements for audio description, how audio description can be implemented for <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> and how it works for <b>digital</b> terrestrial <b>television</b> (DTT). It also describes a particular practical implementation based on a PCMCIA card module which plugs into any DTT receiver which is fitted with an operative "Common Interface" (CI) socket.

40|$|AbstractThe primary {{objective}} of IEEE 802. 22 standard {{is to determine}} vacant spectrum bands available in <b>Digital</b> <b>Television</b> channel (<b>DTV)</b> and to utilize them for wireless rural broadband connectivity. Cognitive Radio aims at maximizing the utilization of the limited radio bandwidth while accommodating {{the increasing number of}} services and applications in Wireless networks. For cognitive radio networks to operate efficiently, Secondary Users (SU) should be able to exploit radio spectrum that is unused by the primary user. A critical component of cognitive radio is thus spectrum sensing. The secondary user should sense the spectrum efficiently, utilize the opportunities for transmission, and vacate the channel once primary user reoccupies it. In this paper, we propose approaches for cooperative spectrum sensing as per the IEEE 802. 22 standard. This paper describes several simulation scenarios {{that can be used to}} evaluate spectrum sensing by single SU unit (local sensing) and multiple SUs in a cooperative setup. The detection accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithms are described using performance metrics called probability of detection and probability of false-alarm through extensive simulations using Matlab...|$|R
40|$|<b>Digital</b> {{terrestrial}} <b>television</b> (<b>DTV)</b> covers an {{area with}} radius as large as 60 km. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Office of Communications (Ofcom) suggests detection of DTV signal at signal strength of as low as - 114 dBm and - 120 dBm respectively. Thus, detection of DTV signals in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is vital. Continual pilot (CP) positions in all the DTV signals are fixed. Digital Video Broadcasting Terrestrial (DVB-T), a DTV standard, is followed {{by most of the}} countries of the world. In this paper we propose a correlation based CP detection which can detect a DVB-T signal at low SNR. One CP carrier was generated at the receiver which was correlated with the received orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal sequence. The correlation coefficient was then compared with a threshold correlation coefficient to identify the existence of the CP to detect the presence of a DVB-T signal and thereby spectrum hole. It was found from the simulation study for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel that signal detection at low SNR is possible compared to the time domain symbol cross-correlation (TDSC) method. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} from analogue to the <b>Digital</b> Terrestrial <b>Television</b> (<b>DTV)</b> in Europe is {{planned to be}} completed {{by the end of the}} year 2012. The DTV spectrum allocation is such that there are a number of TV channels which cannot be used for additional high power broadcast transmitters due to mutual interference and hence are left unused within a given geographical location, i. e. the TV channels are geographically interleaved. The use of geographically interleaved spectrum provides for the so-called TV white spaces (TVWS) an opportunity for deploying new wireless services. The main objective of this paper is to present the spectrum policies that are suitable for TVWS at European level, identified within the COGEU project. The COGEU project aims the efficient exploitation of the geographical interleaved spectrum (TVWS). COGEU is an ICT collaborative project supported by the European Commission within the 7 th Framework Programme. Nine partners from seven EU countries representing academia, research institutes and industry are involved in the project. The COGEU project is a composite of technical, business, and regulatory/policy domains, with the objective of taking advantage of the TV digital switchover by developing cognitive radio systems that leverage the favorable propagation characteristics of the UHF broadcast spectrum through the introduction and promotion of real-time secondary spectrum trading and the creation of new spectrum commons regimes. COGEU will also define new methodologies for compliance testing and certification of TVWS equipment to ensure non-interference coexistence with the DVB-T European standard. The innovation brought by COGEU is the combination of cognitive access to TV white spaces with secondary spectrum trading mechanisms. telecommunications,spectrum management,secondary spectrum market,regulation,TV white spaces,cognitive radio...|$|R
