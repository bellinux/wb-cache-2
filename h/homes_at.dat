5|$|Black-headed sugar ants are nocturnal foragers of food. The {{species is}} {{sometimes}} considered a household pest since ants can enter human <b>homes</b> <b>at</b> night {{in search of}} food. During the day, these ants are not active and have exhibited sleep-like behaviours until it is night. The black-headed sugar ant predominantly feeds on sweet secretions and sugar water; insects {{and a variety of}} foodstuffs in human homes are also consumed.|$|E

5|$|As a seaside resort, {{the economy}} is mainly based around tourism; there are several hotels and guest houses near the seafront, to {{accommodate}} the influx of visitors during the summer. The High Street {{has a variety of}} shops and services, and there are a small number of factories. The elderly population has led to many health and social care jobs at local care <b>homes.</b> <b>At</b> the 2001 UK census, 6.9% of the population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|E
5|$|At this point, NY75 turns northeastward, {{overlapping}} with US62 into {{the nearby town}} of Hamburg along Gowanda State Road. Development along the highway quickly rises in density from a large farm and a pocket of <b>homes</b> <b>at</b> the start of the concurrency to a series of residential streets across the town line that make up the hamlet of Water Valley. The influx of homes brings US62 and NY75 across the main channel of Eighteenmile Creek and into the village of Hamburg, where the highway changes names to Pierce Avenue. The two routes remain concurrent for three blocks to an intersection with Lake Avenue, where Pierce Avenue becomes Main Street. While US62 continues east into Hamburg's central business district on Main Street, NY75 follows Lake Street northward along the mostly residential western edge of the village.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new <b>homes</b> <b>at</b> about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E
5|$|In Okaloosa County, up to 1,267 {{residents}} {{lost power}} during the storm. Most {{of the residents}} had their power restored within a few hours; however, due to continuing wind damage, scattered power outages, affecting up to 500 <b>homes</b> <b>at</b> a time, occurred throughout the county. Throughout the county, roughly $25,000 was sustained in flood losses. A second fatality occurred after a man was knocked off his ship near the coast of Bay County. Rescuers managed to reach him but during the rescue, he fell off the life raft and was lost. The search was later called off as he was presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|Old Louisville is {{also home}} to the Ferguson Mansion, built by Edwin Hite Ferguson. Ferguson {{commissioned}} the Louisville architectural firm of Cobb and Dodd—the same firm responsible for designing the Seelbach Hotel and the new capitol building in Frankfort—to design his home in 1901. Construction of the mansion took four years (1901–1905) and cost $100,000, which was approximately ten times the cost of the neighboring Victorian <b>homes.</b> <b>At</b> the time, the mansion was the most expensive home in Louisville. In the 1920s, the Fergusons sold the home to the Pearson family, and it served as the Pearson Funeral Home until the mid-1970s. The house also provided the headquarters for John Y. Brown, Jr.'s successful 1979 gubernatorial campaign. In 1986, the mansion became the headquarters of The Filson Historical Society.|$|E

5|$|State Route 664 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with State Route 120 in community of Lock Haven. The highway progresses northward, leaving the community limits of Lock Haven. After the intersection with East Water Street, State Route 664 crosses the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. The {{bridge over the}} branch of river was constructed in 1986. At the intersection with Farrandsville Road, the highway turns eastward, paralleling the river. Nearing State Route 150, the highway turns northward and into Dunnstown. While winding around a few curves, State Route 664 intersects with Armory Drive, an access road to a local armory. The route's surroundings are highly developed in Dunnstown, with the highway passing along <b>homes.</b> <b>At</b> the intersection with Aikey Street, State Route 664 leaves Dunnstown and proceeds northward.|$|E
5|$|The {{first white}} {{settlers}} in Lackawanna County settled near Keyser Creek. Timothy Keys, Solomon Hocksey, and Andrew Hickman constructed <b>homes</b> <b>at</b> this location in 1769.

Just inside of the community, CR101 intersects Hilldale Drive and Dogwood Road, two local streets connecting to Herricks Middle School. The route continues on through Searingtown into the village of North Hills, where the homes give way to trees as it turns to the northeast and passes under the Northern State Parkway. A short distance after the Northern Parkway overpass, CR101 meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) by way of Nassau Boulevard—the southern service road—and North Service Road.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains {{fell over}} Taumalipas, with 348.8mm {{measured}} along the Tamesí River. Widespread flooding forced some 400families to evacuate throughout the state; 70trapped families in El Mante {{had to be}} rescued from their flooded <b>homes.</b> <b>At</b> {{the height of the}} storm, high-voltage electrocutions due to downed power lines caused two deaths in the municipalities of Tampico and Reynosa while critically injuring two workers in Matamoros. By July4, two more deaths were reported in the state, though their causes remain unspecified. Approximately 40,000residents suffered property damage to their homes. A state of emergency was declared in the municipalities of Tampico, Ciudad Madero, Altamira, and González in light of the damage. Broken drains and sewers in the storm's wake increased the risk of cholera through contaminated water. Damage estimates in Tamaulipas exceeded Mex$67million (US$5.8million). In neighboring San Luis Potosí, Arlene dropped 12.18in (309.4mm) of rain and claimed the lives of five people, two due to drownings. Landslides left dozens of communities isolated, and more than 600residents fled from flooded areas, particularly in Ciudad Valles, Tamazunchale, El Naranjo, and Xilitla.|$|E
5|$|In 1670 the Duke of Lauderdale {{commissioned}} Bruce to remodel Thirlestane Castle, his 16th-century tower {{house in}} the Border country. Bruce, working with King's master mason Robert Mylne, extended the building with new corner pavilions and a new entrance, and re-planned the interior. Lauderdale continued to employ Bruce, often working closely with Lord Haltoun, Lauderdale's brother, during the 1670s, on his <b>homes</b> <b>at</b> Brunstane near Edinburgh, and Lethington (later renamed Lennoxlove), as well as commissioning a design for new gates at his English property, Ham House, near London, in 1671. At Ham Bruce may have had further involvement with the remodelling works going on there, {{under the direction of}} the English architect William Samwell. While engaged at Thirlestane, Bruce also designed the nearby Lauder Kirk, his only complete church. One of very few 17th century cruciform-plan churches in Scotland, it may have been inspired by François Mansart's similar church at Balleroy in France.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May, {{a second}} {{operation}} {{was conducted by}} the same units, {{this time in the}} northern Armenian town of Voskepar. Under the same pretext as the previous operation, the joint forces entered Armenia with tanks and other armored vehicles, claiming that militia units were staging attacks from that area into Azerbaijan. The operation was conducted in a similar manner but with deadlier results. In addition to the arbitrary arrests of twenty men in towns surrounding Voskepar, a bus carrying thirty Armenian policemen was attacked by elements of the 23rd Division, killing eleven of the officers and arresting the rest. The OMON units also took part in razing and looting the outlying villages around Voskepar. Residents were similarly forced to leave their homes and thus ceded them after signing a form which stated that they were leaving their <b>homes</b> <b>at</b> their own volition.|$|E

In several counties, such as Alachua, Bradford, Duval, Flagler, Hardee, Martin, Orange, Putnam, and St. Lucie, impact was primarily limited to falling trees, which blocked roads, knocked down some power lines, or left generally minor damage to homes and vehicles. A few tornadoes and waterspouts were spawned during a storm. A waterspout was spotted offshore Lee County near Bonita Springs and Estero. An EF1 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale touched down near Jacksonville. The tornado snapped {{a number of}} pine and hardwood trees, while causing roof damage to some <b>homes.</b> <b>At</b> a Publix distribution center, three empty trucks were overturned.

5|$|The Fuller Houses are two {{historic}} <b>homes</b> <b>at</b> 339-341 and 343-345 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Constructed in 1896-1897, the two Queen Anne-styled {{homes were}} constructed as rental properties for the Fuller family and {{are believed to}} have originally been identical in construction. The -story houses are marked by an octagonal bay which contains the front staircase and a large two-story porch projecting almost completely from the house itself. For the National Register of Historic Places nomination only a single unit was examined, but the identical unit below is believed to have undergone minimal alterations. The other house, 343-345 Broadway, was not surveyed, but has been more seriously modified to allow for four apartment units. The Fuller Houses are architecturally significant as well-preserved and well-detailed Queen Anne-styled apartment flats. The Fuller Houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
