40|$|Among the chemicals, {{pesticides}} {{which are}} mainly used in agriculture pose major health problems to human beings. Indiscriminate {{use of pesticides}} belonging to the class organophosphate, organochlorine, carbomate, and pyrethroid leads to various health problems affecting the nervous, endocrine, reproductive and immune systems. The toxicity of pesticide in human beings is influenced by {{various factors such as}} age, gender and health status of the individual in addition to the intensity and frequency of pesticide used. Comparatively, children are at greater risk than the adults. The <b>human</b> <b>detoxification</b> system plays a vital role in reducing the harmful effects of the pesticides. However, when the toxic level is increased beyond the capacity of the detoxification system, health condition deteriorates. Human diet plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health of a person. Vitamins such as Vitamin C and E are effective in preventing DNA damage because of their antioxidant properties. Intake of fruits and vegetables improves the antioxidants level in the blood. Phenolic substances present in certain spices possess potent anticarcinogenic activities. Organic farming may be a viable solution to reduce the toxic effects of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are {{important}} in intracellular binding and transport of numerous compounds, and {{play a central role}} in <b>human</b> <b>detoxification</b> processes. Human GSTs mainly consist of class Pi (GSTP), Mu (GSTM), Alpha (GSTA) and Theta (GSTT) enzymes, each subdivided into one or more isoenzymes. They catalyse the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to toxic compounds, resulting in more water-soluble and less biologically active products that may be easily excreted. The reactive -SH group in GSH is provided by cysteine, an important amino acid in GSH synthesis. METHODS: GST expression, enzyme activity and concentrations of cysteine and GSH in cytosolic fractions of organs from an embryo and a fetus at 8 and 13 weeks gestational age respectively were investigated. RESULTS: GSTP 1 was predominantly present in all tissues of both the embryo and fetus. GSTA (GSTA 1 + GSTA 2) concentrations were moderate as compared with GSTP 1, whereas GSTM 1 was present in only low amounts. GSTT 1 was not detected in any tissue. GST activity was highest in organs exposed directly to amniotic fluid. In all embryonic and fetal organs, considerable amounts of GSH and cysteine were detected, with higher GSH concentrations in organs where lower cysteine concentrations were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in embryonic and early fetal development cysteine, GSH and GSTs are present in high amounts, and that GSTP 1 is the most important GST isoform at these developmental stages...|$|E
40|$|General {{population}} {{exposure to}} pesticides mainly occurs via {{food and water}} consumption. However, their risk assessment for regulatory purposes does not currently consider the actual co-exposure to multiple substances. To address this concern, relevant experimental {{studies are needed to}} fill the lack of data concerning effects of mixture on human health. For the first time, the present work evaluated on human microsomes and liver cells the combined metabolic effects of, chlorfenvinphos, ethion and linuron, three pesticides usually found in vegetables of the European Union. Concentrations of these substances were measured during combined incubation experiments, thanks to a new analytical methodology previously developed. The collected data allowed for calculation and comparison of the intrinsic hepatic clearance of each pesticide from different combinations. Finally, the results showed clear inhibitory effects, depending on the association of the chemicals at stake. The major metabolic inhibitor observed was chlorfenvinphos. During co-incubation, it was able to decrease the intrinsic clearance of both linuron and ethion. These latter also showed a potential for metabolic inhibition mainly cytochrome P 450 -mediated in all cases. Here we demonstrated that <b>human</b> <b>detoxification</b> from a pesticide may be severely hampered in case of co-occurrence of other pesticides, as it is the case for drugs interactions, thus increasing the risk of adverse health effects. These results could contribute to improve the current challenging risk assessment of human and animal dietary to environmental chemical mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxins are {{polycyclic}} unsaturated {{organic compounds}} {{which are very}} closely related to pentacyclic compounds, widely known for their carcinogenic potential. These compounds usually consist of a coumarin nucleus flanked with a highly reactive bifuran ring system {{on one side and}} a six membered lactone ring on the other side.

40|$|C-S lyase enzymes {{catalyse}} {{the generation}} of mutagenic and/or cytotoxic thiols from cysteine conjugated xenobiotics. These cysteine conjugates are produced subsequent to glutathione conjugations as a metabolic step in the mercapturic acid pathway, traditionally {{thought of as a}} pathway solely associated with <b>detoxification.</b> <b>Human</b> Chang liver (HCL) cells were challenged with a range of cysteine conjugates demonstrated to be substrates for human hepatic C-S lyases. The cellular toxicity of these compounds was determined and it was observed that the rank order of substrate toxicity obtained for the HCL cells followed the rank order of C-S lyase activity of the substrates in a freshly isolated mitochondrial fraction of human tissue.

They occurred worldwide and were found predominantly in corn and in corn-based animal feeds and also {{can be found in}} other crops. Contamination of food and feed with fumonisins has been implicated in and associated with a number of diseases in both livestock as well as human beings. Approach: A review was done on the effect of fumonisins on animal and <b>human</b> and <b>detoxification</b> method for the prevention. ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, Google and Yahoo were used in the preparation of this review. Results: This review clarified that the major forms of fumonisins found in food were the B series, fumonisin B 1, B 2 and B 3. Fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) was the most common and the most thoroughly studied. FB 1 caused toxicities in animals including Equine Leukoencephalomalacia (ELEM), Porcine Pulmonary Edema (PPE) in pigs and nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic in rats. Furthermore, FB 1 had been implicated to be associated with high rates of human esophageal cancer. In addition to their natural occurrence in corn-based animal feeds and in home-grown corn used for food, fumonisins were frequently found in commercial corn-based foods.

40|$|The <b>human</b> <b>detoxification</b> enzyme {{glutathione}} s-transferase alpha 1 (GSTA 1 - 1) {{is known}} for its ability to conjugate a variety of different hydrophobic xenobiotics to the tripeptide glutathione. The conjugation can be catalyzed through either a substitution or an addition reaction. Which reaction mechanism is being used affects the cooperativity of the enzyme. GST is also capable of catalyzing isomerization reactions of particular substrates without conjugation to GSH which further extends its repertoire. The C-terminal of the enzyme transitions from a random loop to an α-helix that localizes over the active site as a ligand binds. The α-helix is also involved in product release. We hypothesize that the broad substrate specificity and the catalytic flexibility of GST is a result of a heterogeneous protein population where multiple conformers with different properties coexist. To identify different conformers in a population a single molecule approach is needed. Fluorescently tagged substrates and products of GSTA 1 - 1 have been imaged as they bind immobilized GSTA 1 - 1 using TIRF microscopy. Single molecule binding events can be analyzed to characterize different binding states of the enzyme. The observation of at least two average occupancy times suggests that there are multiple binding states and conformations of the enzyme. One of these binding states is dominating the population and a large number of binding events has to be sampled to pick up the more rare states. To further characterize the behavior of GSTA 1 - 1 FRET and DEER have been used to study the active site dynamics during binding of a ligand. Unlike X-ray crystallography, DEER and FRET provide a distribution in a distance between groups, and not just an average. Our data suggest that binding of S-hexylglutathione does not localize the C-terminal helix which is contrary to what can be observed in the X-ray crystal structure. Glutathione alone is sufficient to localize the helix. This highlights the importance of using proteins in solution to study their conformation...|$|E
40|$|Zearalenone (hereafter {{referred}} to as ZEA) is a nonsteroidal estrogenic mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium spp. on cereal grains. ZEA {{is one of the}} most hazardous natural endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) which induces hyper estrogenic responses in mammals. This can result in reproductive disorders in farm animals as well as in <b>humans.</b> Consequently, <b>detoxification</b> strategies for contaminated crops are crucial for food safety. In this study we have developed a bacterial based detoxification system using a non-pathogen Rhodococcus pyridinivorans K 408 strain. Following 5 days treatment of ZEA with R. pyridinivorans K 408 strain HPLC analyses showed an 87. 21 % ZEA-degradation efficiency of the bacterial enzyme systems. In another approach, the strain biotransformation ability has also been confirmed by a bioluminescent version of the yeast estrogen screening system (BLYES), which detected an 81. 75 % of biodegradability of ZEA, in a good agreement with the chemical analyses. Furthermore, the capacity of R. pyridinivorans to eliminate the estrogenic effects of ZEA was tested by using an immature uterotrophic assay. Prepubertal female rats were treated with vehicle (olive oil), 17 b-estradiol, ZEA (0. 1 - 1 - 5 - 10 mg/kg body weight) and LB broth containing 500 mg/l ZEA that has already been incubated with or without Rhodococcus pyridinivorans K 408 strain. Uterine weights were measured and the mRNA level changes relating to apelin, aquaporin 5, complement component 2, and calbindin- 3 genes were measured by qRT-PCR. These genes represent the major pathways that are affected by estromimetic compounds. Zearalenone feeding significantl...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a rat model, {{by which the}} effects of repeated ethanol withdrawal on withdrawal severity was investigated, {{in relation to the}} cognitive and behavioural deficits associated with repeated episodes of withdrawal. Repeated ethanol withdrawal in the rat has been well established to model the effects of repeated episodes of <b>human</b> alcohol <b>detoxification.</b> This model has enabled the study of withdrawal severity {{and the role of the}} prefrontal cortex in the form of rat behaviour. Chronic ethanol consumption led to disrupted circadian rhythm especially in measures of wakefulness and NREM sleep. However, there were no cumulative effects of multiple ethanol withdrawals. These results were confounded by altered circadian rhythms observed in the control group. Repeated ethanol withdrawal induced significantly higher levels of C-Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, compared to a single withdrawal episode. In!addition, repeated ethanol withdrawal also induced significantly higher Zif 268 expression, a marker for neuronal plasticity, in the prelimbic cortex. These findings indicated a sensitivity of prefrontal cortical areas in response to repeated ethanol withdrawal. In assessing performance on a 2 -choice serial reaction time task, repeated ethanol withdrawal resulted in more sessions to criterion, indicating possible learning deficits but only when the withdrawal experience occurred prior to behavioural training and testing. Repeated ethanol withdrawal did not significantly impair attentional set shifting ability on the intradimensional/extradimensional task. The findings of this current thesis suggest that repeated ethanol withdrawal did not produce significantly severe cognitive deficits as measured by behavioural tasks sensitive to prefrontal cortical damage, despite neurobiological activation of prefrontal areas.

40|$|Soy beans contain genistein, {{a natural}} {{compound}} that has estrogenic effects because it binds the estrogen receptor with relatively high affinity. Genistein is therefore {{the most important}} environmental estrogen in the <b>human</b> diet. <b>Detoxification</b> of genistein is mediated through conjugation by UDP-glucuronyltransferase 1 and 2 (UGT 1 and UGT 2) isoenzymes. Gunn rats have a genetic deficiency in UGT 1 activity, UGT 2 activities are not affected. Because our Gunn rats stopped breeding after the animal chow was changed to a type with much higher soy content, we examined the mechanism behind this soy diet induced infertility. Gunn and control rats were fed diets with and without genistein. In these rats, plasma levels of genistein and metabolites, fertility and reproductive parameters were determined. Enzyme assays showed reduced genistein UGT activity in Gunn rats, as compared to wild type rats. Female Gunn rats were completely infertile on a genistein diet, wild type rats were fertile. Genistein diet caused a persistent estrus, lowered serum progesterone and inhibited development of corpora lutea in Gunn rats. Concentrations of total genistein in Gunn and control rat plasma were identical and within the range observed in humans after soy consumption. However, Gunn rat plasma contained 25 % unconjugated genistein, compared to 3. 6 % in control rats. This study shows that, under conditions of reduced glucuronidation, dietary genistein exhibits a strongly increased estrogenic effect. Because polymorphisms that reduce UGT 1 expression are prevalent in the human population, these results suggest a cautionary attitude towards the consumption of large amounts of soy or soy supplements.

40|$|Industrial {{waste and}} sewage are serious and growing {{problems}} in most developing countries. Some heavy metals {{are known to}} cause damage to living organisms including <b>human</b> beings. Their <b>detoxification</b> efficiency indicates good potential for application in bioremediation of toxic heavy metals. In those heavy metals, Cadmium in soil is influenced {{to a great extent}} by microbial activity. Microorganisms have ability to absorb Cd from a medium. The biosorption removal of cadmium ions from aqueous solutions by using the bacterial culture was investigated. The growth of the Pseudomonas putida culture was noticed by Cd concentration in growth medium, thus about 20 % of the bacteria can grow up to 40 mg Cd/L medium. The results revealed that the living biomass of the cultures were more efficient to absorb Cd. The formulation of yeast, peptone medium fortified the cultures by ingredients favored the best growth yields that have the highest Cd absorption. The absorption of Cd by Pseudomonas putida was considerably influenced by the pH value of the absorption medium, contact time, biomass levels and Cd concentration. Thus, 93 % of Cd was absorbed in medium containing 10 mg Cd...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to ethanol {{leads to an}} imbalance in different excitatory and inhibitory amino acids. When ethanol consumption is reduced or completely stopped, these imbalances in different amino acids and neurotransmitters are behaviorally expressed {{in the form of}} ethanol withdrawal. Glutamate, a major excitatory amino acid, and GABA, a major inhibitory amino acid, are responsible, at least partly, for ethanol withdrawal symptoms. The hypofunction of GABA(A) receptors and enhanced function of NMDA receptors are suggested to be responsible for the increase in the behavioral susceptibility during ethanol withdrawal. This imbalance between receptors may be exacerbated by repeated withdrawal. Because multiple and repeated periods of chronic ethanol consumption and withdrawal often occur in alcohol abusers, animal studies on the neurochemical changes in different amino acids following chronic ethanol treatment (CET) that is interrupted by repeated ethanol withdrawal episodes may be of clinical relevance for the development of treatment strategies. Brain glutamate increases during the first cycle of ethanol withdrawal, and this increase is much higher during the third cycle of ethanol withdrawal. The elevated glutamate released in the hippocampus during the first cycle of ethanol withdrawal episode was exacerbated in subsequent withdrawal episodes. Acamprosate, a drug used during <b>human</b> alcohol <b>detoxification,</b> is able to completely block the glutamate increase observed during the first as well as the third withdrawal of ethanol. In ethanol-naive rats, there was no change in the glutamate microdialysate content after an acute ethanol injection. However, when repeated ethanol injections were cued with a vinegar stimulus that had previously been associated with the same ethanol injection, a significant increase in glutamate microdialysate content was assayed. Furthermore, when the cue was omitted, the ethanol injection induced no changes in glutamate microdialysate content in rats that had been previously ethanol conditioned. By comparison, a saline injection had no effect on extracellular glutamate concentration in rats naive for ethanol as well as in rats daily administered with repeated ethanol injections that were not paired with the cue. It appears probable that these conditioned responses by extracellular glutamate concentrations may participate in the environmental cue-induced conditioned cravings for ethanol that are thought {{to be related to the}} high frequency of relapse in detoxified alcoholics.

40|$|There are {{mutations}} that perturb {{the critical}} transport of copper in humans resulting in Menkes and Wilson diseases. Both genes encode 1500 residue proteins with six repeats {{of a heavy}} metal binding domain at the N-terminus of the P-type ATPase. The metal binding domains have homologous sequences containing the GMTCXXC motif also found in many proteins involved in detoxification systems found in yeast and bacteria. This sequence is able to bind and transport a host of different heavy metals in various environments. The gene for the first heavy metal binding motif (GMTCNSC) of the Menkes disease protein (MNK 1; residues 2 – 79) was synthesized, cloned, and expressed for biochemical and structural studies. MNK 1 binds various metals besides copper, such as Hg(II) and Ag(I) which prefer a linear bicoordinate geometry, as well as Cd(II) and Ni(II) which tend to bind proteins in an octahedral fashion. EPR studies demonstrate MNK 1 also binds Cu(II) which prefers a tetrahedral or square planar orientation unlike Cu(I). This is surprising since the two cysteine residues in GMTCXXC were shown to bind Cu(I) in a linear bicoordinate manner and all the proteins containing GMTCXXC studied thus far have linear bicoordinate metal centers. This indicates that the metal binding loop is flexible to accommodate alternate geometries. The three-dimensional structure of the Cu(I) bound form of MNK 1 was determined and is the first structure in the copper binding family to be solved with its native metal center. To provide further insight into metal selectivity, three 18 -residue peptides corresponding to the metal binding loop of MerP which is highly homologous to MNK 1 were synthesized. These peptides show how a change in register of the cysteines CAAC, CACA, and CCAA can fine tune mercury metal selectivity. Understanding metal specificity may provide insight into new methods for environmental as well as <b>human</b> heavy metal <b>detoxification.</b> ...|$|R
