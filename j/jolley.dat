5|$|The {{work which}} led to the {{recognition}} of Adiantum viridimontanum as a distinct taxon began in the early 20th Century. Following the discovery of disjunct specimens of western maidenhair fern, then classified as A.pedatum var. aleuticum, on the serpentine tableland of Mount Albert by Merritt Lyndon Fernald in 1905, botanists began to search for western maidenhair on ultramafic outcrops elsewhere in Quebec and Vermont. It was first identified in Vermont by L. Frances <b>Jolley</b> in 1922 at Belvidere Mountain in Eden. In 1983, William J. Cody transferred A.pedatum growing on serpentine, both in eastern and western North America, to A.pedatum ssp. calderi instead. Many of the stations for the fern in Vermont were described in 1985, in a survey of ultramafic outcrops in that state.|$|E

Fred Speller, who had suffered a badly broken leg early in the season, had been playing in practice matches and {{was believed to be}} back to full fitness. Fringe players Harry Edwards and Fred Jones had left the club, and Harry Morris had retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Goalkeeper George Hollis, backs Arthur Littleford, Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns, Teddy <b>Jolley</b> and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Frank Mobley, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon all remained with the club. Newcomers included forwards Jack Lee, Charles Izon and Walter Jackson, all signed from non-league clubs in the West Midlands area. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy. The team adopted a new kit, keeping the white knickerbockers but replacing the royal blue shirt and stockings with shirts in a lighter shade of blue, with navy collar trim, cuffs and pocket and navy stockings.|$|E

5000|$|Jiggering and jolleying: These {{operations}} {{are carried out}} on the potter's wheel and allow the time taken to bring wares to a standardized form to be reduced. Jiggering is the operation of bringing a shaped tool {{into contact with the}} plastic clay of a piece under construction, the piece itself being set on a rotating plaster mould on the wheel. The jigger tool shapes one face while the mould shapes the other. Jiggering is used only in the production of flat wares, such as plates, but a similar operation, <b>jolleying,</b> is used in the production of hollow-wares such as cups. Jiggering and <b>jolleying</b> have been used in the production of pottery since at least the 18th century. In large-scale factory production, jiggering and <b>jolleying</b> are usually automated, which allows the operations to be carried out by semi-skilled labour.|$|R
