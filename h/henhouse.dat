25|$|Unsurprisingly, {{educational}} and cultural projects proceeded {{at a slower}} pace than basic construction and agriculture, with a stone schoolhouse eventually constructed in 1845 and a reading room for adult members unveiled towards the start of 1846. A 60-foot long washhouse, a <b>henhouse,</b> and a sawmill during the commune's first 18 months, and a blacksmith and a cobbler practiced their respective crafts. Agriculture remained the chief preoccupation of most members of the phalanx, with a total of 1,553 acres obtained for Ceresco through 1845.|$|E
25|$|Under Pope Shenouda III, {{a number}} of recent renovations were {{performed}} at the monastery. An asphalt road to the monastery was built, and there have been several major cultivation projects. In addition, six water pumps, a sheepfold, a <b>henhouse</b> and two generators were added, together with the construction of new residential cells {{both inside and outside the}} monastery proper. There is now a clinic and a pharmacy to serve the monks, as well as a spacious retreat center for conferences and a large, two story guesthouse that was opened in January 1981.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} unusual tasks the works {{undertook}} in the war was the construction of <b>henhouses</b> for the GER farm at Bentley, Suffolk. each of which had a works number.|$|R
60|$|And {{in a week}} Mr. and Mrs. Skinner were {{installed}} in the farm, and the jobbing carpenter from Hickleybrow was diversifying the task of erecting runs and <b>henhouses</b> with a systematic discussion of Mr. Bensington.|$|R
50|$|Humans often build {{houses for}} {{domestic}} or wild animals, often resembling smaller versions of human domiciles. Familiar animal houses built by humans include birdhouses, <b>henhouses</b> and doghouses, while housed agricultural animals more often live in barns and stables.|$|R
25|$|The old World War II {{power house}} is a bunker-like structure, built of {{reinforced}} concrete with a small extension to the east, which was at some point used as a <b>henhouse.</b> The main section roof is covered with asphalt, and the extension has a pitched galvanised iron gable roof. One rectangular opening is in the main section {{and one in the}} extension. The garage and the workshop are timber framed and fibro clad, with a gable roofs of corrugated fibro cement with metal gutters and downpipes. They have timber doors, timber floors and timber-framed louvre windows.|$|E
500|$|Coyotes were {{probably}} semidomesticated by various pre-Columbian cultures. Some 19th-century writers wrote of coyotes being kept in native {{villages in the}} Great Plains. The coyote is easily tamed as a pup, but can become destructive as an adult. Both full-blooded and hybrid coyotes can be playful and confiding with their owners, but are suspicious and shy of strangers, though coyotes being tractable enough {{to be used for}} practical purposes like retrieving and pointing have been recorded. A tame coyote named [...] "Butch", caught in the summer of 1945, had a short-lived career in cinema, appearing in Smoky and Ramrod before being shot while raiding a <b>henhouse.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A domovoi or domovoy ( [...] ; literally, [...] " [...] {{from the}} house") is a {{protective}} house spirit in Slavic folklore. The plural form in Russian can be transliterated domoviye or domovye (with accent on the vowel after the v). In some accounts, the domovoi {{is described as}} having a wife (domovikha or kikimora) {{who lives in the}} cellar or <b>henhouse.</b> The Slavs and Balts of former times kept idols of the domovoi.|$|E
50|$|The {{economy is}} based on four {{agricultural}} branches: field crops, irrigated cultivation, orchards and <b>henhouses,</b> but agricultural crops do not generate enough income to support the kibbutz, so to earn a living, many of Ruhama's members have taken jobs outside the kibbutz.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the main buildings, there were numerous outbuildings. [...] One of these was the windmill house, near the main building and octagonal in shape. [...] This drew water from a well [...] deep. [...] The 1894 Sanborn map also shows icehouses, <b>henhouses</b> and corn cribs.|$|R
60|$|They {{had driven}} {{off the road}} a hundred feet to his tiny barn in order to water Hazel and Hattie. A sturdy young orchard covered most of his ten acres, though a goodly portion was devoted to {{whitewashed}} <b>henhouses</b> and wired runways wherein hundreds of chickens were to be seen. He had just begun work on a small frame dwelling.|$|R
2500|$|The property, which borders the Grand River, {{originally}} {{contained an}} approximate 4-hectare (10.5 acres) fruit orchard, large farmhouse, stable, pigsty, <b>henhouse,</b> icehouse and a carriage house. [...] During the Bells' 11-year {{residence at the}} Homestead, the working farm, with its plum, cherry, pear, apple and peach orchards, supplemented Melville's modest income from dramatic readings at elocutionary performances and university lectures on elocution and vocal physiology. Moreover, college lecture assignments were scarce for the male Bells as the nearest university was in Toronto, some 105km (65 miles) away. The Bell family was not well-to-do, but upper-middle class, and depended on the sales of their farm products to make ends meet.|$|E
2500|$|The Snakes & Arrows Tour {{prominently}} featured three <b>Henhouse</b> brand rotisserie chicken ovens {{on stage}} complete with an attendant in a chef's hat and apron to [...] "tend" [...] the chickens during shows. For the 2010–2011 Time Machine Tour, Lee's {{side of the}} stage featured a steampunk-inspired combination Time Machine and Sausage Maker, with an attendant occasionally throwing material into its feed hopper during the show. During the 2012-2013 Clockwork Angels Tour, Lee used a different steampunk device called a [...] "Geddison" [...] as a backdrop. This was composed of a giant old-style phonograph horn, an oversized model brain in a jar, a set of brass horns, and a working popcorn popper. [...] The 2015 R40 tour combined several of these elements together, {{with the exception of the}} chicken ovens used on the Snakes and Arrows tour.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{states in}} the U.S. enacted {{statutes}} that received English common law into their legal systems. For example, in 1863 the legislature of Idaho enacted a statute that made [...] "the common law of England ... the rule of decision in all courts" [...] of the state. However, English common law principles of treasure trove were not applied in the U.S. Instead, courts applied rules relating to the finding of lost and ownerless items. The treasure trove rule was first given serious consideration by the Oregon Supreme Court in 1904 in a case involving boys who had discovered {{thousands of dollars in}} gold coins hidden in metal cans while cleaning out a <b>henhouse.</b> The Court wrongly believed that the rule operated {{in the same way as}} early rules that awarded possession – and, effectively, legal title as well – to innocent finders of items that had been hidden or concealed and the owners of which were unknown. By awarding the coins to the boys, the Court implied that finders were entitled to buried valuables, and that any claims by landowners should be disregarded.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2015, a {{group of}} activists {{organized}} under the network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) released a video of laying hens from a Northern California farm that supplies eggs to Whole Foods. In the video, which featured footage of crowded, dirty <b>henhouses</b> and injured birds, DxE contended that the hens' welfare was severely compromised, even though numerous boards had labeled the farm as [...] "Certified Humane".|$|R
50|$|The group {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} the living conditions at Maryland <b>henhouses,</b> documenting corpses found in group cages and rescuing some of the hens found in the worst conditions. One of the farms documented, owned by ISE America, housed more than 800,000 hens. Following a tip about substandard conditions at the farm, COK requested permission to visit the farm before proceeding with an undercover investigation.|$|R
50|$|Gao-Guenie meteorites fell in Burkina Faso on March 5, 1960 at 17:00 (local time). After three {{separate}} detonations, several thousands of stones rained down over {{an area of}} about 70 km2. The sound of the fall was heard as far as Ouagadougou, which is 100 km away. Eyewitnesses said that some trees were broken and <b>henhouses</b> destroyed. The largest stones recovered weigh up to 10 kg.|$|R
2500|$|He vowed {{there would}} be a {{nationwide}} campaign of [...] "people power" [...] against any household and water charges. In September 2011, Higgins committed to facilitating the nomination of Senator David Norris for a place on the ballot paper ahead of the 2011 Irish presidential election despite multiple controversies enveloping the candidate. On the occasion of the publication of the Keane report on mortgage arrears in October 2011, Higgins criticised Enda Kenny's government and said the report was “a banker's charter written by bankers”. His description of allowing the banks to solve their own problems as being [...] "like sending a bunch of marauding foxes that had raided a <b>henhouse</b> back to give mouth-to mouth resuscitation to their victims" [...] was quoted several times by other commentators in the media. Higgins addressed [...] "The EU in Crisis" [...] public debate, held at the Ireland Institute in Dublin in October 2011. He served as Ruth Coppinger's election agent in the 2011 Dublin West by-election, held alongside the presidential election. At her campaign launch Higgins said Taoiseach Enda Kenny was engaging in a “cynical manipulation of the political agenda” by delaying the publication of his government's comprehensive spending review until after the elections.|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} his {{thinking}} didn't help him in the least. At last, however, he remembered the chicken dinner he had felt so sure {{he was going to}} enjoy. The thought of the chicken dinner reminded him that inside the <b>henhouse</b> it was dark. He had been inside that <b>henhouse</b> before, and he knew that there were boxes in there. If he were inside the <b>henhouse,</b> it might be, it just might possibly be, that he could hide when Farmer Brown's boy came in the morning.|$|E

5000|$|The Cans Festival {{is celebrated}} {{every year in}} the parish of Cans (O Porriño, Pontevedra Spain), which has an {{official}} population of 400 inhabitants although during the festival that number rises to more than 10,000 people. Its symbols of identity are the peculiar cinema rooms: sheds, basements, empty houses, wine cellars and even <b>henhouses</b> transferred altruistically by their owners who devote themselves to the festival and collaborate in everything they can.|$|R
50|$|Determined {{not to give}} up, Elmer {{shoots a}} giant arrow to Daffy, {{crashing}} through several <b>henhouses</b> and Daffy {{falls in love with}} a married hen. Her rooster husband furiously confronts Daffy. The duck declares it a mishap, claiming to be a family man himself (briefly appearing with a jalopy full of the previously mentioned ducklings). The rooster lets Daffy go, but Elmer shoots him yet again, starting the whole process over again.|$|R

60|$|You see it {{was this}} way: Reddy's wits were working very fast there in Farmer Brown's <b>henhouse.</b> He {{knew that he had}} only a forlorn chance of {{escaping}} when Farmer Brown's boy should come to open the <b>henhouse</b> in the morning. He knew that he must make the most of that forlorn chance. He knew that freedom is a thousand times better than a full stomach.|$|E

40|$|Mosquito {{surveys were}} carried out in Ishikawa City, Okinawa Main Island from January, 1968 by dry-ice traps, light traps, at cowsheds, pigsties, <b>henhouses,</b> human {{dwelling}} houses, and stables {{to the end of}} the year. By the former four methods, collections were continued till the end of April, 1970. C. tritaeniorhynchus summorosus is the most abundant in every cases. Ae. vexans nipponii is very abundant in dryice trap. An. tessellatus is collected by nearly only dry-ice trap. C. p. fatigans is high in relative abundance in light traps, at <b>henhouses,</b> and dwelling houses. C. neovishnui is high only in <b>henhouses.</b> Judging from the seasonal distribution of the females, fed ones, and males of C. t. summorosus, the gonoactivity of the females seems little affected by the shortening of day length in cold months and to continue feeding and egglaying actively in warmer winter and slowly even in severe cold winter for Okinawa. It is noteworthy fact that the habits of Okinawa summorosus is quite different from those of Nagasaki summorosus because the latter is, according to the observations of Dr. Kawai (1969), definitely affected by the shortening of day length becoming gonoinactive in spite of the environmental temperatures. The numerous and long lasting infections of Japanese encephalitis in pigs and in humans on Okinawa seem to have intimate bearing on the following facts: The gonoactivity of Okinawa summorosus is maintatined during cold months in spite of the shortening of day length; the population density of this mosquito seems rather low and much fluctuated, owing to that the paddyfields are very small in area and scattered among vast farm lands; the pigs are being raised rather in small scale, independently of the places being in ricefield area or in farm land; and consequently there remain at any time some number of susceptible pigs depending on the places where they are being raised...|$|R
50|$|Eventually the {{problems}} with Rascal's raids into fields and <b>henhouses</b> become too much; the neighbors' irritation with the boy's pet {{can no longer be}} ignored. In addition, Rascal has become a young adult and, as such, is getting attention from jealous male and interested female raccoons. Sterling realizes Rascal is a wild animal and can no longer be kept, unless always kept in a cage. He travels in the newly completed canoe to release Rascal in the woods at {{the far side of the}} nearby lake.|$|R
50|$|According to the Wall Street Journal, “it has {{provided}} its new organic egg farmers architectural blueprints and lists of contractors and manufacturers for new organic-friendly <b>henhouses,</b> guaranteed their bank loans or directly financed their equipment purchases at zero interest.” The company also actively recruits organic farms {{to increase the}} number of farms whose eggs are sold as Pete and Gerry's eggs, having worked with other farms instead of expanding their own operations. As of late 2014 Pete and Gerry’s worked with about 80 farms.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly the <b>henhouse</b> {{door was}} thrown open and Farmer Brown's boy stepped inside. In his hand {{he held a}} pan filled with the breakfast he had brought for the hens. Suddenly a box in the darkest corner of the <b>henhouse</b> moved. Farmer Brown's boy turned to look, and {{as he did so}} a slim form dashed fairly between his legs. It startled him so that he dropped the pan and spilled the corn all over the <b>henhouse</b> floor. [...] "Great Scott!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What under the sun was that?" [...] and rushed to the door to see. He was just in time {{to get a glimpse of}} a red coat and a bushy tail disappearing around a corner of the barn.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy Skunk sat on {{the floor}} of Farmer Brown's <b>henhouse,</b> rubbing his head and glaring up at the upper row of nests with eyes red with anger. Of course it was dark in the <b>henhouse,</b> for it was night, but Jimmy can see in the dark, just as so many other little people who wear fur can. What he saw was the anxious looking face of Unc' Billy Possum staring down at him.|$|E
60|$|Unc' Billy {{wasted no}} time in {{squeezing}} {{through a hole in the}} floor way over in one corner, a hole that Farmer Brown's boy had intended to nail a board over long before. Unc' Billy knew that Bowser couldn't get through that, even if he did manage to dig his way under the <b>henhouse.</b> Once through that and fairly in the <b>henhouse,</b> Unc' Billy drew a long breath. He felt safe for the time being, anyway, and he didn't propose to worry over the future.|$|E
50|$|The Maton-Hunt-Farnum Farm (also {{known as}} the Pardon Hunt Farm) is an {{historic}} farm on Putnam Pike in Glocester, Rhode Island. The main house is a -story wood-frame structure, five bays wide, with a gable roof and a central chimney, and is set {{on the north side}} of Putnam Pike. Behind the house are a number of farm outbuildings, including two barns, <b>henhouses,</b> a corn crib, and a privy. Built c. 1793 by Daniel Manton, the house exhibits fine Federal styling both inside and outside.|$|R
5000|$|In 1897, the Merediths bought 'Bally Bawn', {{a country}} house {{built around a}} library in 1750 by the Sulpicians, near Fort Senneville and Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec.

40|$|Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Triatomines are {{targeted}} {{for the control}} of Chagas disease in endemic areas of Brazil. METHODS: Data regarding triatomines captured during 2001 - 2008 in 34 municipalities in the Northeast of Minas Gerais were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 11, 187 triatomines from eight species were captured, mostly in <b>henhouses</b> and bedrooms. Trypanosomes were found in 203 samples. Main species were Triatoma sordida, Panstrongylus megistus, and Triatoma vitticeps. The number of P. megistus adults {{was positively correlated with}} temperature and precipitation, whereas the number of nymphs followed the inverse pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of triatomines in domiciles indicates the need for sustained entomological surveillance...|$|R
