At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Some of the earliest known domestications were of animals. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 11,000 BC. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs {{in the areas of}} modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. Camels were domesticated late, perhaps around 3,000 BC.|$|E

5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian.

In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E

5|$|The taxonomic {{placement}} of the turkey vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures has been in flux.

Some earlier authorities suggested that the New World vultures were {{more closely related to}} storks. More recent authorities maintained their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the main}} {{military}} leaders on the border to Scotland, Harclay became frustrated with Edward II's inactivity, particularly the humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322, which {{made it clear that the}} war could not be won. Harclay initiated negotiations with the Scots on his own accord, and on 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce. The act was without royal sanction, and amounted to treason. The king issued an arrest order for the earl, and on 25 February Harclay was taken into the king's custody. He was arraigned before royal justices on 3 March, denied a hearing, and executed the same day. He was hanged, drawn and quartered, and the various parts of his body displayed <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. Only after five years was he allowed a proper burial, but the conviction for treason was never annulled.|$|E
5|$|Heathen rites {{often take}} place in non-public spaces, {{particularly}} in a practitioner's home. In other cases, Heathen places of worship have been established on plots of land specifically purchased for the purpose; these can represent either a hörg, which is a sanctified place within nature like a grove of trees, or a hof, which is a wooden temple. The Heathen community has made various attempts to construct hofs <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. In 2014 the Ásaheimur Temple was opened in Efri Ás, Skagafjörður, Iceland, while in 2015 a British Heathen group called the Odinist Fellowship opened a temple in a converted 16th-century chapel in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Heathens have also adopted archaeological sites as places of worship. For instance, British practitioners have assembled for rituals at the Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire, the Rollright Stones in Warwickshire, and the White Horse Stone in Kent. Swedish Heathens {{have done the same}} at Gamla Uppsala, and Icelandic practitioners have met at Þingvellir.|$|E
