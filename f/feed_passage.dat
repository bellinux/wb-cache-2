40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} of efficiency of feed utilization {{determined by the}} feed conversion ratio (FCR) to the rate of <b>feed</b> <b>passage</b> through the digestive system of juvenile chickens was studied and three different methods of measuring <b>feed</b> <b>passage</b> rate (FPR) were evaluated. The FPR did not differ between sexes that had different FCR, nor did it differ between commercial broiler strains that differed in FCR. Feed restriction did not affect FPR. There was little correlation between FCR and FPR {{in any of the}} groups evaluated and the FPR was similar for high- and low-FCR groups. There was some evidence for increased FPR in birds grown at 32. 2 C compared with those grown at 26. 7 C. Similar results were obtained for FPR whether the tracer dye was given in the feed, or in a gelatin capsule, or no tracer dye was used. Repeatability of FPR obtained on the same individuals at different ages was very low.

40|$|Comparative {{studies on}} {{adaptive}} strategies of Small East African Goats and Somali Blackhead Sheep to seasonal changes of forage {{quality and quantity}} on offer were carried out for 2 years on a semi-arid thornbush savannah. They included monitoring of pasture condition, performance recording, monitoring of health status, feeding behaviour observations, feed intake measurements, measurements of rumen volumes, <b>feed</b> <b>passage</b> rates, chemical analyses of forages, in-vivo digestibility trials (nylon-bag), morpho-metric analyses of rumen mucosa and carcass appraisal. A synopsis of all preliminary results obtained todate shows that the goat is a highly selective feeder with a lower dry matter intake of higher quality than the sheep. <b>Feed</b> <b>passage</b> rates in goats are faster, absorptive surfaces in the rumen are larger and short chain fatty acid absorption is faster than in sheep. Mature sheep show higher live weight changes in relation to seasonal forage supply than goats and can develop fat deposit during the growing sason, which account for up to 40 % of the carcass weight. Fat deposits in goats rarely exceed 15 %. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} goats rely mainly on selectivity and harvesting efficiency during seasonal food scarcity, whereas sheep rely more on the build-up of body reserves during the growing season...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} develop a novel {{method of obtaining}} regionally-averaged heat {{transfer}} coefficients in flowfields characterized by three temperatures using the well-known transient calorimeter technique. The technique is used to determine heat transfer in aluminum models of idealized turbine blade leading edges cooled through internal surface impingement, film cooling <b>feed</b> <b>passages,</b> and external convective film cooling. The external surface is subject to a stagnating mainstream crossflow. Importantly, the contributions to heating from the external flow and cooling from the internal flow can be separately resolved solely by heating the internal flow. Results for a basic showerhead geometry and an advanced intersecting-passage cooling configuration are presented {{for a range of}} internal and external Reynolds numbers. The intersecting-passage model shows little improvement in heat transfer coefficient over the showerhead for the flow conditions tested; however, the total cooling carried out is improved by the increase in exposed surface area. The technique's uncertainties are fully assessed. Copyright © 2005 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|Heat stress {{occurs when}} a dairy cow’s {{internal}} heat load is greater than her capacity to lose unwanted heat to the environment.

Lower milk production and reproductive performance cause economic losses to dairy producers. The ordered priorities for reducing heat are: increasing water availability; providing shade in the housing areas (both dry and lactating cows) and holding pen; reducing walking distance to the parlor; reducing time in the holding pen; improving holding pen ventilation and freestall ventilation; adding cooling for the holding pen and exit lane; cooling close-up cows (3 wk before calving); cooling housing for fresh and earlylactation cows; and cooling housing for midand late-lactation cows...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Dietary clay {{supplements}} (bentonite and kaolinite) {{have been}} used as binding and lubri-cating agents in the production of pelleted feeds for chickens. The high-swelling and water absorbing capacity of some bentonites make them attractive dietrary additives for control of wet droppings in caged layers. In addition, experiments show that layers fed on these diets exhibit significant increases in body weight, egg size, and life expectancy even though their total caloric intake is less than that of the control group. Dietary kaolin improves caloric efficiency even more than bentonite but without ap-parent effect upon growth or carcass quality. Kaolins of smaller particle size are superior to those of larger size in improving caloric efficiency. The effective kaolins are estimated to be worth approxi-mately two calories of metabolizable energy per gram. The major beneficial effect appears to be due to a slowing down of the rate of <b>feed</b> <b>passage</b> through the intestinal tract.

The study was conducted using 36 male Menz sheep with a mean BW of 16. 45 Â± 0. 25 kg in a completely randomized design at Debre Zeit Research Station of the International Livestock Research Institute in Ethiopia. The nine treatments consisted of supplementing sheep fed chopped tef straw with wheat bran (positive control) or dried foliage of the multipurpose trees (MPTs), Sesbania sesban 1198 (SS 1), Sesbania sesban 15019 (SS 2), Acacia angustissima 15132 (AA), Leucaena pallida 14203 (LP), or mixtures of SS 1 + LP; SS 2 + LP; SS 1 + AA; SS 2 + AA {{at a ratio of}} 2 : 1 each. The supplement feeds were offered at 0. 9 % of BW on DM basis. The supplement MPTs contained low NDF (18 â€“ 32 %) and high CP (21. 7 â€“ 27. 5 %), whereas tef straw contained high NDF (72. 8 %) and low CP (4. 5 %). Soluble phenolics and condensed tannins were higher in the MPTs than in tef straw. Mixtures of LP with either SS 1 or SS 2 promoted higher (P 0. 05) were observed in the digestibility of DM, OM, NDF and ADF between mixtures of LP with SS 1 and SS 2 and the control treatment. Digestibility of N was higher (P < 0. 05) in animals supplemented with the control feed than those supplemented with the mixture of LP and SS 2. Supplementation with the mixtures of AA and both accessions of S.

This paper describes the CNCPS version 6 (CNCPSv 6), which represents a re-engineering and updating of CNCPS version 5 {{with the following}} objectives: (1) improve {{the organization of the}} model and user interface to improve speed and accuracy in formulating diets for a herd of dairy cattle, (2) expand the carbohydrate pools to include sugars, soluble fibers, and organic and volatile fatty acids, (3) integrate a fat model to account for ruminal lypolization and biohydrogenation, and absorption of fatty acids in the small intestine, and (4) update the computational sub-models with new information. The CNCPSv 6 model was re-designed using object-oriented programming in which physiological functions (e. g. growth, lactation, pregnancy) and anatomical compartments (e. g. rumen, intestines) were programmed as objects. The interface uses farm, location, and group flow, which decreases the number of inputs required per cattle group and allows for more rapid evaluation of diets, feed requirements, and nutrient excretion by location, group, and herd. The revised implementation of the body reserves sub-model allows accounting for fluxes in energy reserves when formulating diets.

In experiment 1 and experiment 2, {{the time for the}} unabsorbed <b>feed</b> <b>passage</b> through the alimentary canal was determined by measuring the DM and energy of excreta and feed residues in the alimentary canal at different periods. In experiment 3, the feed input of force-feeding was studied and a total of 70 mature Pekin drakes were allotted to 7 groups, each group containing 10 birds. After fasting for 36 h, one group served as a negative control to measure metabolic faecal energy plus endogenous urinary energy and the drakes of the other 6 groups were force-fed pelleted feed 30 g, 50 g, 70 g, 90 g, 110 g, and 150 g per bird, respectively. Energy excretion of the periods of 16 – 28 h after force-feeding was significantly higher than that of the periods after 32 h, and the total energy excretion of the periods after 32 h (P 0. 05). Metabo-lisable energy decreased significantly with an increase in feed input when the feed input was higher than 70 g (P < 0. 05).

Effects of low-density diets on {{nutrient}} digestibility and bird development were studied in Cobb 500 broiler breeder hens from 4 wk of age until {{the onset of the}} lay (wk 26). The experiment included 4 treatments. The control treatment was a normal density diet (ND; 2, 600 kcal/kg). Treatments 2 and 3 had a 12 and 23 % lower nutrient density than ND (LD 12 and LD 23, respectively) through inclusion of palm kernel meal, wheat bran, wheat gluten feed, and sunflower seed meal. Treatment 4 also had a 12 % lower nutrient density than ND but included oats and sugar beet pulp (LD 12 OP). Total daily intake of energy, digestible lysine, calcium, retainable phosphorus, sodium, and linoleic acid was kept constant in the low-density dietary treatments. Animal performance and development of the intestinal tract and reproductive tract were determined in addition to digestibility and <b>feed</b> <b>passage</b> rate. The LD 12 OP provided a lower AME and nutrient digestibility than calculated and was related to lower live weights. Birds given LD 23 and LD 12 OP showed a faster ovarian and oviduct development between wk 24 and 26 compared with ND. At 22 wk of age, LD 23 and LD 12 OP diets resulted in higher empty jejunum and ileum weights.

Three groups of 31 to 42 calves were sampled in a calf transporter before they entered the farm and four to seven times at approximately monthly intervals at the farm. All calves sampled in the livestock transporter were negative for E. coli O 157 on arrival, whereas positive animals were detected 1 day later. During the fattening period the E. coli O 157 infection rate varied between 0 and 38. 5 %. The animals were also found to be shedding during the cold months. E. coli O 157 was isolated from samples taken from water cups, floors, and <b>feed</b> <b>passages.</b> E. coli O 157 was detected in 9. 7 to 38. 9 % of the fecal samples taken at slaughter, while only two rumen samples and one carcass surface sample {{were found to be}} positive.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine the response of Friesian dairy cows to different frequencies of feeding a total mixed ration. The first compared alternate day with daily feeding. Cows fed on alternate days spent longer feeding, had increased dry matter intakes, and produced more milk, but with reduced protein content, compared with cows fed daily. Those fed daily increased feeding greatly after the food was offered to them. Those fed on alternate days had a smaller increase in feeding when food was offered, and their feeding pattern was-similar on feeding and nonfeeding days, suggesting {{that they could not}} anticipate the time that food would be offered. However, on days when no food was provided they were less aggressive than cows fed daily. Cows fed daily spent less time grooming themselves and more-time standing, suggesting that the extra feeding caused disturbance. A second experiment compared frequent feeding (four times per day) with infrequent feeding (once daily), with the cows fed infrequently being either housed with or apart from the cows fed frequently, to determine whether the disturbance of feeding other cows would affect cows housed in the same building but not fed frequently. Both groups of frequently fed cows spent less time feeding in the morning and more in the evening and had less circadian variation in sleeping and lying ruminating, compared with both groups of cows fed infrequently. Cows fed infrequently and housed by themselves produced more milk but with reduced milk protein concentration, compared with the infrequently and frequently fed cows that were housed together. They also spent more time standing in the <b>feeding</b> <b>passage,</b> not ruminating, and more time grooming themselves, indicating less disturbance. Thus cows fed infrequently had reduced milk yield if they were housed with frequently fed cows, and it is concluded that in both experiments frequent feeding disturbed the cows and reduced milk production...|$|R

The impact of dark exposure on productivity, GIT segment and content weights and {{feeding behaviour}} of Ross 308 broilers (7 - 31 d) was studied. Four lighting programs were used (23 L: 1 D (1 D), 20 L: 4 D (4 D), 17 L: 7 D (7 D), and 14 L: 10 D (10 D). The birds (n= 4000) were housed in 8 rooms with 8 pens per room (2 replications per lighting treatment and 4 replications per gender per room). The GIT data were collected on d 27 - 28 (6 males per lighting program, euthanized at 2 h intervals for 24 h). Production {{data were analyzed using}} SAS Proc Mixed as a 4 (dark) x 2 (gender) factorial arrangement and GIT segment data as a 4 (dark) x 12 (time) factorial arrangement, with lighting program nested within room. Dark data were analyzed using regression analyses and analysis of variance. Differences were significant when P≤ 0. 05. At 31 d, regression analyses showed no effect on body weight, however numerically birds raised on 4 D and 7 D were heaviest. The highest feed consumption was observed under 4 D. Birds on 10 D were the most feed efficient (linear response). A quadratic effect on mortality was found, with the highest mortalities under 4 D and 7 D. Birds on 10 D had the heaviest empty crops (% of body weight (BW). Crop content (% BW) changed quadratically, with peaks prior to dark under 4 D, 7 D, and 10 D, suggesting anticipation of darkness. The empty gizzard weight (% BW) increased linearly as dark increased. Behaviour was examined as a 4 (dark) x 2 (age (2, 4 wk) x 2 (gender) factorial arrangement with lighting program nested within room. Five males and females per room were marked and focally observed. Statistical analyses were performed similar to the production data. As dark increased, feeding bout frequency increased and feeding bout interval decreased linearly. Total time spent at the feeder decreased linearly as dark increased. As birds aged, feeding frequency decreased and feed bout length and interval increased. Males visited the feeder more frequently and had shorter bout intervals. Birds anticipated dark periods > 4 h and increased their feeding activity prior to dark. Broilers adapt their feeding behaviour in response to dark exposure, which alters GIT segment and content weights, and likely <b>feed</b> <b>passage</b> rates, in turn affecting feed efficiency and digestibility...|$|E

At the same time, the effect of grit on the performance of broilers and gizzard development was investigated in this study. 252 one-day-old broiler chickens were randomly allocated in 4 pens. The birds were fed commercial starter from 1 - 10 days, grower diets from 11 to 18 days and starter diet diluted with 15 % of whole wheat from 18 - 22 days. The experiment consisted of four treatments: one control group, one zeolite group, one granite group and one marble group. At 5 days of age, four birds were randomly placed in each of 48 quail cages. At 5, 7 and 9 days of age, 8 g, 15 g and 15 g of each type of grit were fed on the feed to each of 12 cages. At 18, 19 and 20 days of age, 1 g of grit per bird was given. On day 5, 11, 13, 18, 21 and 22, birds were weighed either groupwise or individually for calculating the weight gain. On day 11, 13, 18 and 21, the feed and excreta were removed and collected. The feed and remaining grit stones in the feed were measured to calculating grit consumption and feed intake. The excreta were collected for observing grit excretion. On day 13, 18 and 21, randomly selected bird from each cage was killed. The crop content and gizzard content were collected and frozen for later laboratory analysis. The empty gizzard weight and full gizzard weight were measured. Small intestine was also collected and frozen for later laboratory analysis. On day 22, two birds from each treatment were killed at 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min and 180 min after commencement of feeding to measure the feed flow rate.

Aim: The study was aimed to survey prevalent enteral nutrition practices in the trauma intensive care unit, nurses′ perception, and their knowledge of enteral feeding. Study Design: The study was conducted in the ICU of a level 1 trauma center, Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. The study design used an audit. Materials and Methods: Sixty questionnaires were distributed and the results analyzed. A database was prepared and the audit was done. Results: Forty-two (70 %) questionnaires were filled and returned. A majority (38) of staff nurses expressed awareness of nutrition guidelines. A large number (32) of staff nurses knew about nutrition protocols of the ICU. Almost all (40) opined enteral nutrition to be the preferred route of nutrition unless contraindicated. All staff nurses were of opinion that enteral nutrition is to be started at the earliest (within 24 - 48 h of the ICU stay). Everyone opined that the absence of bowel sounds is an absolute contraindication to initiate enteral <b>feeding.</b> <b>Passage</b> of flatus was considered mandatory before starting enteral nutrition by 86 % of the respondents. Everyone knew that the method of Ryle′s tube feeding in their ICU is intermittent boluses. Only 4 staff nurses were unaware of any method to confirm Ryle′s tube position. The backrest elevation rate was 100 %. Gastric residual volumes were always checked, but the amount of the gastric residual volume for the next feed to be withheld varied. The majority said that the unused Ryle′s tube feed is to be discarded after 6 h. The most preferred (48 %) method to upgrade their knowledge of enteral nutrition was from the ICU protocol manual. Conclusion: Information generated from this study can be helpful in identifying nutrition practices that are lacking and may be used to review and revise enteral feeding practices where necessary...|$|R

40|$|Inhomogeneous density {{distributions}} after {{die filling}} are a ubiquitous problem in powder technological part production. In this paper, numerical simulations of the die filling process in realistic, three-dimensional (3 D) cavities are presented using the discrete element method with both multi-sphere and single sphere grain models. Good agreement {{was found between}} calculated and experimentally measured density distributions. The formation of an inhomogeneous distribution is discussed by a time-resolved analysis of the filling process. Grain rearrangement and densification during subsequent <b>feeding</b> shoe <b>passages</b> are characterized. The shoe velocity was tested for its influence on the density homogeneity. Suggestions for density homogenization with the application of cavity oscillations or volumetric filling are given. A density homogeneity index is introduced. The application of a coarse graining scheme circumvents the intrinsic difficulty of non-manageable grain numbers in 3 D filling simulations. The validity and limitations of this scheme are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Modern text {{collections}} often contain large {{documents that}} span several subject areas. Such documents are problematic for relevance feedback since inappropriate terms {{can easily be}} chosen. This study explores the highly effective approach of <b>feeding</b> back <b>passages</b> of large documents. A less-expensive method that discards long documents is also reviewed and found to be effective if there are enough relevant documents. A hybrid approach that feeds back short documents and passages of long documents {{may be the best}} compromise. 1 Introduction As the amount of on-line text has increased, so has the size of individual documents in those collections. Information retrieval methods that could easily be applied to the full text of abstracts or short documents are sometimes less effective or prohibitively expensive for large documents. This problem has led to a resurgence of interest in techniques for handling large texts, including passage retrieval, theme identification, document summarization [...] ...|$|R

It is unfortunate that the child was not diagnosed earlier, at a younger age, because the younger the age at which the diagnosis is made and thyroid replacement therapy initiated, the better the prognosis regarding mental development. This child had the classical picture of congenital hypothyroidism i. e. coarse facies, hoarse voice, lethargy, hypotonia, umbilical hernia with constipation. The clinical identification of the newborn with hypothyroidism is often difficult.

In single oral dose experi ments, more than 95 % of the isotopes administered was {{recovered from the}} gastro intestinal tract 3 hours after dosing. B 1 Crwas higher in blood than the other isotopes tested. When the isotopes were fed continuously, the ratio of MYto mCe changed little throughout the gastrointestinal tract. However, the ratio of 91 Yto ^Cr was higher in the crop and gizzard and lower in the duodenum than in the <b>feed.</b> Thus, <b>passage</b> time was shorter for 61 Cr in the crop and gizzard and longer in the duodenum than that of "Y.

40|$|A tapered-roller {{bearing test}} machine was designed, {{fabricated}} and successfully operated at speeds to 20, 000 rpm. Infinitely variable radial loads to 26, 690 N (6, 000 lbs.) and thrust loads to 53, 380 N (12, 000 lbs.) {{can be applied}} to test bearings. The machine instrumentation proved to have the accuracy and reliability required for parametric bearing performance testing and has the capability of monitoring all programmed test parameters at continuous operation during life testing. This system automatically shuts down a test if any important test parameter deviates from the programmed conditions, or if a bearing failure occurs. A lubrication system was developed {{as an integral part of}} the machine, capable of lubricating test bearings by external jets and by means of <b>passages</b> <b>feeding</b> through the spindle and bearing rings into the critical internal bearing surfaces. In addition, provisions were made for controlled oil cooling of inner and outer rings to effect the type of bearing thermal management that is required when testing at high speeds...|$|R
50|$|In 1951 {{the marsh}} was {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its biological characteristics. Some {{of the reasons}} for its designation include providing a <b>feeding</b> ground for <b>passage</b> waders and wintering birds, a breeding pair of the nationally scarce Cetti's warbler (Cettia cetti), rare plants such as pillwort (Pilularia globulifera) and a high number of dragonfly species. The site is owned by the St Aubyn Estates and in 1990 they met with the RSPB to draw up a lease for the management of the site. At that time the reed bed was drying out, with the buildup of dead leaves and stems, and suffering from natural succession into willow scrub. In that year the reed bed was in poor condition with the hot dry summer and emergency measures were taken to flood the site. Within three days a large pool appeared and 154 individuals of 11 species of dragonfly were counted in the next few weeks.|$|R
