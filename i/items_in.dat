5000|$|To {{illustrate}} the concepts, {{we use a}} small example from the supermarket domain. The set of items is [...] and in the table is shown a small database containing the <b>items,</b> where, <b>in</b> each entry, the value 1 means {{the presence of the}} <b>item</b> <b>in</b> the corresponding transaction, and the value 0 represents the absence of an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> that transaction.|$|R
5|$|Note: This list {{does not}} include records from the Quebec Nordiques (WHA & NHL). <b>Items</b> <b>in</b> bold are NHL records. Records as of April 9, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Pitchstone {{deposits}} on {{the island}} were used locally for making various <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the Mesolithic era. In the Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age pitchstone from the Isle of Arran or items made from it were transported around Britain.|$|E
5|$|The six Collins-class {{submarines}} are {{the most}} expensive <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the Australian Defence Force inventory. The annual cost of operating and maintaining the class was estimated at A$100 million in 2000, and at A$322 million in 2008.|$|E
50|$|Standard menu {{items at}} German McDonald's include the Hamburger Royal TS, Caesar salads, one Veggieburger called Veggie Clubhouse, and Caesar, honey mustard, and Ranch chicken wraps. The McRib sandwich, a {{seasonal}} <b>item</b> <b>in</b> most countries, {{is a permanent}} menu <b>item</b> <b>in</b> Germany.|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{priority}} <b>item</b> <b>in</b> a min-heap (or {{the maximum}} priority <b>item</b> <b>in</b> a max-heap) may always {{be found at}} position 0 of the array. To remove this item from the priority queue, the last <b>item</b> x <b>in</b> the array is moved into its place, {{and the length of}} the array is decreased by one. Then, while item x and its children do not satisfy the heap property, item x is swapped with one of its children (the one with the smallest priority in a min-heap, or the one with the largest priority in a max-heap), moving it downward in the tree and later in the array, until eventually the heap property is satisfied. The same downward swapping procedure may be used to increase the priority of an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> a min-heap, or to decrease the priority of an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> a max-heap.|$|R
5000|$|Once a dataset {{is bound}} to a document, use of D3.js {{typically}} follows a pattern wherein an explicit [...] function, an implicit [...] "update," [...] and an explicit [...] function is invoked for each <b>item</b> <b>in</b> the bound dataset. Any methods chained after the [...] command will be called for each <b>item</b> <b>in</b> the dataset not already represented by a DOM node in the selection (the previous [...] ). Likewise, the implicit update function is called on all existing selected nodes {{for which there is}} a corresponding <b>item</b> <b>in</b> the dataset, and [...] is called on all existing selected nodes that do not have an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> the dataset to bind to them. The D3.js documentation provides several examples of how this works.|$|R

5|$|Users {{can also}} search for {{keywords}} in specific tabs, close all tabs {{with a single}} click, and reopen recently closed tabs by long-pressing on the plus icon. Users can also search for <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the Bookmarks and Reading List.|$|E
5|$|After 1949, the Museum {{conducted}} a new audit {{as well as}} a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important <b>items.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace Museum's collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public.|$|E

50|$|Searching for an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> a 2-3 tree {{is similar}} to searching for an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> a binary search tree. Since the data {{elements}} in each node are ordered, a search function will be directed to the correct subtree and eventually to the correct node which contains the item.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{partially}} ordered set P, the sequence space containing all sequences of elements from P, where sequence a precedes sequence b if every <b>item</b> <b>in</b> a precedes the corresponding <b>item</b> <b>in</b> b.

Tintin's image {{has been used to}} sell a wide variety of products, from alarm clocks to underpants. Countless separate items related to the character have been available, with some becoming collectors' <b>items</b> <b>in</b> their own right.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} what {{significance}} the classic Maya gave to the 13th b'ak'tun. Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations. Two <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention {{the end of the}} 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.|$|E

5|$|S. C. Hawkes {{argues that}} the eight <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the hoard were found in {{different}} graves, basing this on x-ray and fluorescent analysis of the coins. However, the historian Philip Grierson thought {{that the possibility of}} two graves from different time periods both containing coins of the same period was so small as to make the likelihood of the hoard coming from two graves slim.|$|E
5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the most important and powerful <b>items</b> <b>in</b> Norse mythology. Lindow further states that it may be easy to lose sight of the central role Sif plays in the creation of these objects.|$|E
