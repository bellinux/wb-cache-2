25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Speechless" [...] after a water balloon {{fight with}} {{children}} in Germany. It took him 45 minutes. In an interview with [...] Vibe magazine, the musician commented, [...] "I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote 'Speechless'. Fun inspires me. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that, because it's such a romantic song." [...] He added, [...] "But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and I wrote it in its entirety right there. I felt {{it would be good}} enough for the album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and creativity." [...] Jackson would consider [...] "Speechless" [...] to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible.|$|E

500|$|Urlacher dislocated {{his wrist}} in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He {{underwent}} surgery, {{and went on}} to miss the remainder of the season. [...] Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve. Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury. The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team's identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, [...] "Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but the guy is a winner, and that formula worked for us. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, but that's the truth." [...] Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.|$|E
500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

5000|$|To build {{interest}} in the toy, Parker Brothers licensed the character to Marvel Comics, which created a comic book featuring Rom. The comic expanded {{on the premise that}} Rom was a cyborg and gave him an origin, personality, set of supporting characters and villains, as well as interaction within the Marvel Universe. The comic was written by Bill Mantlo and initially illustrated by artist Sal Buscema. Buscema stated in a 2010 interview, [...] "I liked the character. And I liked what they did with it. I thought the concept was quite good. It was unique. It made it attractive <b>to</b> do. <b>I</b> almost <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this, but it was pretty easy to draw, too." [...] Buscema was the main artist for the series from its creation through 1984. Steve Ditko took over for the final two years of the original run.|$|R
60|$|Henry B. Fuller, {{who came}} along {{one day in}} January, proved a joy and comfort to me. His {{attitude}} toward Washington amused me. Assuming {{the air of a}} Cook tourist, he methodically, and meticulously explored the city, bringing to me each night a detailed report of what he had seen. His concise, humorous and self-derisive comment was literature of a most delightful quality, and I repeatedly urged him to write of the capital as he talked of it to me, but he professed to have lost his desire to write, and though I did not believe this, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> hear him <b>say</b> it, for I valued his satiric humor and his wide knowledge of life.|$|R

5000|$|I’m an actress…but I’m also {{religious}}; I can’t help it. I {{can justify}} my actress self to my religious self: but I can’t justify {{the things that}} you can’t separate from the actress, the publicity, the feeling of being considered public property even off the stage. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> that. <b>I</b> don’t like when I walk down the street, to have men looking at me and speculating about me. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> hear them <b>say,</b> [...] "That’s Tittell Brune" [...] and I feel their eyes boring into my back when I’m past. It makes me feel common and I loathe it. If I can’t disguise myself I’ve got to put up with it. But that kind of publicity revolts me. It really does, because I am religious - I’m half a nun.|$|R
5000|$|During the trial, {{public figures}} freely {{expressed}} their opinions. [...] "Jodi Arias {{has stated that}} she follows me on Twitter so <b>I</b> really <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> that she is guilty but sadly, she is as guilty as it gets", Donald Trump wrote. He also offered Arias legal advice on how she could avoid the maximum sentence. [...] "Jodi should try but the govt. should not make a deal - no jury could be dumb enough to let her off (but you never know, look at OJ & others)," [...] Trump suggested. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer told reporters after an unrelated press event that she believed Arias to be guilty. She sidestepped a question about whether she believed the one-time waitress guilty of manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder, but said [...] "I don't have all the information, but I think she's guilty." ...|$|R
