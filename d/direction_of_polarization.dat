40|$|The {{electronic}} and magnetic properties of TbMnO 3 leading to its ferroelectric (FE) polarization were investigated {{on the basis}} of relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In agreement with experiment, we show that the spin-spiral plane of TbMnO 3 can be either the bc- or ab-plane, but not the ac-plane. As for the mechanism <b>of</b> FE <b>polarization,</b> our work reveals that the "pure electronic" model by Katsura, Nagaosa and Balatsky (KNB) is inadequate in predicting the absolute <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> FE <b>polarization.</b> For the ab-plane spin-spiral state of TbMnO 3, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> FE <b>polarization</b> predicted by the KNB model is opposite to that predicted by DFT calculations.

The Raman spectra were in-situ recorded at selected crack tips {{before and after the}} indentations, as well as after the applications of external electric field.

50|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, the {{analyzing}} filters are constructed of a quarter-wave plate (QWP) and a linearly polarized filter (LPF). The QWP always transforms circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light. However, the angle of polarization of the linearly polarized light produced by a QWP depends on the handedness of the circularly polarized light entering the QWP. In the illustration, the left-handed circularly polarized light entering the analyzing filter is transformed by the QWP into linearly polarized light which has its <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> along the transmission axis of the LPF.

50|$|The ferroic {{properties}} are {{closely linked to}} symmetry and can be characterized by their behavior under space inversion and time reversal (see table). The operation of space inversion reverses the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> P while leaving the magnetization M invariant. As a result ferromagnets and ferroelastics are invariant under space inversion whereas ferroelectrics are not. The operation of time reversal, on the other hand, changes the sign of M, while the sign of P remains invariant. Therefore ferroelastics and ferroelectrics are invariant under time reversal whereas ferromagnets are not.|$|E

50|$|When an {{external}} electric field is applied, {{the distance between}} charges within each permanent dipole, which is related to chemical bonding, remains constant in orientation polarization; however, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> itself rotates. This rotation occurs on a timescale {{that depends on the}} torque and surrounding local viscosity of the molecules. Because the rotation is not instantaneous, dipolar polarizations lose the response to electric fields at the highest frequencies. A molecule rotates about 1 radian per picosecond in a fluid, thus this loss occurs at about 1011 Hz (in the microwave region). The delay of the response to the change of the electric field causes friction and heat.|$|E
5000|$|Todorokite is biaxial, as are all monoclinic (and orthorhombic) minerals.

When todorokite is rotated between crossed polars it appears dark and light in turn, being dark when the crystal face or cleavage face is parallel to one <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization.</b> This is called parallel extinction. All uniaxial minerals display parallel extinction, but so do orthorhombic biaxial minerals such as olivine and orthopyroxenes. The refractive index of todorokite has not been determined, except insofar as it is very high; the original report gave it as greater than 1.74, and a later investigation put it even higher, greater than 2.00. [...] For comparison, diamond has a refractive index of 2.42 and quartz 1.54. A biaxial crystal has three mutually perpendicular optical directions, X, Y and Z, with different refractive indices α, β and γ for light vibrating in planes perpendicular to these directions. The birefringence is the numerical difference between the greatest and the least of these indices; for todorokite it is nearly 0.02. [...] Todorokite is distinctly pleochroic, appearing dark brown when viewed along the X direction, and yellowish brown when viewed along the Z direction 3, but the strength of the effect varies from faint to strong in material from different localities.
