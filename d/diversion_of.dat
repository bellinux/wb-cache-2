5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force. The option was cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E

5|$|Fighting colonial wars in Portuguese colonies {{had absorbed}} forty-four {{percent of the}} overall Portuguese budget. This led to an obvious <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> funds from {{necessary}} infrastructural developments in Portugal itself. This contributed to the growing unrest in the European nation. Portugal's GDP growth during the colonial war period (1961–1974), was strong and reached a 6% rate (a percentual GDP growth which were not achieved in any other comparable period after 1974).|$|E
5|$|HMS Lord Nelson {{was laid}} down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Jarrow on 18 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 4 September 1906.

5|$|The Germans {{refrained from}} {{attempts}} {{to recapture the}} lost ground at Lens, due {{to the demands of}} defensive operations of the Third Battle of Ypres and the need to avoid the <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> forces from the main effort.

5|$|Administrative reforms {{during the}} 19th century {{included}} {{the replacement of}} oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, {{and the establishment of}} four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies. Knowledge of Ancient Greek was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.|$|E
5|$|Although several German states {{initially}} {{sided with}} Austria, they {{stayed on the}} defensive and failed to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating the situation for Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria's southern border required a <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea. The day-long Battle of Königgrätz, {{near the village of}} Sadová, gave Prussia an uncontested and decisive victory.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Communally, {{conditions}} for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance. Economic problems became exacerbated under wartime conditions; new war and non-war industries and business continued {{to discriminate against}} blacks. Though new projects such as the Harlem River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing had deteriorated as new construction slowed due to <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> efforts to the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.|$|E

She was laid down on 15 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 23 June 1906 before the dockyards themselves were finished. Her completion was greatly delayed by labour troubles and by the <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> the 12-inch (305mm) guns intended for her to expedite completion of HMS Dreadnought, and she was not finally completed until June 1908, six months before her sister Lord Nelson.|$|E

5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} {{was introduced}} to the San Joaquin Valley in the late 19th century, and led to the construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. <b>Diversion</b> <b>of</b> water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth.

The II Corps asked for a delay until 19 November, to move artillery forward, five divisions were transferred to Italy and four divisions on the coast were sent to take over French positions south of the Somme.
