25|$|The forming {{machines}} {{hold and}} move the parts that form the container. The machine consist of basic 19 mechanisms in operation to form a bottle and generally powered by compressed air (high pressure - 3.2 bar and low pressure - 2.8 bar), the mechanisms are electronically timed to coordinate all movements of the mechanisms. The most widely used forming machine arrangement is the individual section machine (or <b>IS</b> <b>machine).</b> This machine has a bank of 5–20 identical sections, each of which contains one complete set of mechanisms to make containers. The sections are in a row, and the gobs feed into each section via a moving chute, called the gob distributor. Sections make either one, two, three or four containers simultaneously. (Referred to as single, double, triple and quad gob). In the case of multiple gobs, the shears cut the gobs simultaneously, and they fall into the blank moulds in parallel.|$|E

2500|$|One notable {{exception}} {{to the design of}} BFAs for recoil operated firearms <b>is</b> <b>machine</b> guns based on short recoil designs, such as the German MG 34 and its descendants. [...] These designs use a muzzle booster to add energy to the recoiling parts, and muzzle brakes for these designs simply replace the muzzle booster with one that provides far more boost with blank cartridges. [...] The M2 heavy machine gun, while it does not use a muzzle booster normally, can use a similar muzzle-booster-derived BFA.|$|E

2500|$|Common {{understanding}} has it {{that the}} purpose of the Turing Test is not specifically to determine whether a computer is able to fool an interrogator into believing that it is a human, but rather whether a computer could imitate a human. While there is some dispute whether this interpretation was intended by Turing, Sterrett believes that it was and thus conflates the second version with this one, while others, such as Traiger, do not– this has nevertheless led to what can be viewed as the [...] "standard interpretation." [...] In this version, player A is a computer and player B a person of either sex. The role of the interrogator is not to determine which is male and which is female, but which is a computer and which is a human. The fundamental issue with the standard interpretation is that the interrogator cannot differentiate which responder is human, and which <b>is</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] There are issues about duration, but the standard interpretation generally considers this limitation as something that should be reasonable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A micro dimple <b>machining</b> <b>is</b> {{presented}} {{to control the}} surface functions with the micro-scale structures on the solid surfaces. The micro dimples <b>are</b> <b>machined</b> in milling with the inclined ball end mill. When an inclined two flutes end mill removes the material in a depth of cut less than the tool radius, the air cutting time during neither edges contact with the workpiece appears in a rotation of cutter. When the tool is fed at a high feed rate so that the removal areas of an edge and another edge do not overlap each other, the concave dimples <b>are</b> <b>machined.</b> A mechanistic model is {{presented to}} control the shape {{and the size of}} the dimples to <b>be</b> <b>machined.</b> The micro dimples <b>were</b> <b>machined</b> to verify the mechanistic model in milling. The micro asperities were also formed in molding using the dimpled surface. As applications of the functional surfaces, wettability and friction coefficient were measured on the surfaces with the dimples and the asperities. The surface functions change with the alignments of the dimples and the asperities...|$|R
