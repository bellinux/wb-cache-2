50|$|Eiswerth {{worked as}} a {{researcher}} in Malawi villages, and wrote her dissertation there. Upon her return to Tucson, she noticed rotting fruit that had fallen from trees and began the <b>harvesting</b> <b>work</b> for which Iskashitaa is known. Her background in environmental science and land management combined with her experience in Africa inspired her to start the <b>harvesting</b> <b>work</b> for which Iskashitaa is known. “As an environmental scientist, the road to sustainability is using what we have right here,” she says. “We can do the right thing, which is not let food go to waste.”In 2002, Eiswerth launched a project through the Tucson Youth Work Enhancement program to educate local high school teens about food resources. Together, they mapped 162 homes with 296 fruit-producing trees. Unwanted fruit harvested from these trees was then distributed to local farmers’ markets and soup kitchens.In 2003, Eiswerth recruited refugee {{students to participate in}} a project identifying locations of produce that was going to waste in Tucson, as she had with the high school students. The refugee youth harvested and redistributed this food. After organizing two more youth mapping programs, Eiswerth received a grant from the United Way of America to begin regularly harvesting with refugees.|$|E

50|$|From {{the early}} times, the most {{important}} occupation of the islanders was farming. All available area, {{about half of the}} island was converted to fields; from the remaining half, a quarter was rocky and the rest occupied by swamps. On one occasion in the 18th century, two villages were moved from Kizhi island to the nearby infertile mainland to free land for farming. Until 1970, the island had about 96 hectares of fields yielding various grains and potato, and combine harvesters and tractors for field cultivation. The farming was stopped in 1971 by a government directive. Some fields were reconstructed in 2004 as part of the Kizhi museum.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis "Fire Prevention in <b>Harvest</b> <b>Work</b> in Agricultural Enterprises" I chose because of the extreme increase of fires during the <b>harvest</b> <b>works</b> in 2015 compared to the last 5 years. This bachelor thesis solves the research question whether the <b>harvesting</b> <b>works</b> {{from the point of}} view of fire protection are protected in accordance with legal regulations. The aim of the thesis is to evaluate PO safety during <b>harvest</b> <b>works</b> and to propose measures to reduce the risk of fires occurring in these activities. The thesis is also focused on technical measures in the course of their own work and providing sufficient water resources for fire fighting. The practical part deals with the problems of fires in agriculture, statistics of fires for the period 2011 - 2015 and their causes. Part of the statistics is the comparison of temperatures and precipitation in the territory of the South Bohemian region for the period 2011 - 2015, which was published by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, which confirms the connection of excessive drought with an increased number of fires. The Bachelor's thesis also mentions the most extensive fire in the South Bohemian region in 2015 - Bavorov, Tourov. The results of the monitored statistics in the practical part show the highest increase of the negligence fires, the technical defects of the harvesting mechanization and the sparkling of the foreign object outside and inside the combines during the drought. For this reason, this thesis compares the current laws, decrees, regulations and standards with already invalid legislation related to the security of these works. As a result, it can be concluded that during the harvest season in 2015, these jobs were not sufficiently secured and the legislation did not deal with them in detail...|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} massed labor at harvest time meant hop-growing {{had a big}} social impact. Around the world, the labor-intensive <b>harvesting</b> <b>work</b> {{involved}} large numbers of migrant workers who would travel for the annual hop harvest. Whole families would partake and live in hoppers' huts, with even the smallest children helping in the fields. The final chapters of W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage and {{a large part of}} George Orwell's A Clergyman's Daughter contain a vivid description of London families participating in this annual hops harvest. In England, many of those picking hops in Kent were from eastern areas of London. This provided a break from urban conditions that was spent in the countryside. People also came from Birmingham and other Midlands cities to pick hops in the Malvern area of Worcestershire. Some photographs have been preserved.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century saw {{numerous}} appearances of lacebark items in industrial exhibitions, possibly because the British perceived a potential for expanded production in Jamaica. There were also some experiments in making paper out of lacebark. However, commercial-scale production never took off, and by the 1880s, most lacebark appears to have been shifted into the creation of tourist souvenirs such as doilies, fans, and ornamental whips. One travel writer referred to these souvenirs as works of art that [...] "exhibit refined taste and excellent workmanship." [...] Objects such as fans sometimes had a lacebark substrate to which dried specimens of local flora were attached. Production of lacebark items (even as souvenirs) started tailing off in the early 20th century, largely because of the increasing rarity of the trees but also partly because of the labor-intensive nature of <b>harvesting</b> <b>work</b> and (after World War II) a decline of interest in traditional crafts. Lacebark crafts had nearly vanished by the 1960s, and an attempted revival in the 1980s sputtered out for a variety of reasons, among them the continuing threats to lacebark habitat that made it difficult to establish reliable supply chains.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 it was {{discovered}} that the blue green algae natural to Lake Texcoco's alkaline waters (which had previously been filtered and discarded) could instead be deliberately cultivated in the El Caracol basin, collected with screens and processed into dry nutritional supplement powder for commercial sale. Proudly branded as [...] "Spirulina Mexicana", the idea resurrected the ancient agricultural practices of the Aztecs, who had collected and traded the edible algae from Lake Texcoco since pre-Columbian times. In 1973 the world's first commercial spirulina plant was opened at El Caracol with a production capacity of 1 ton per day, eventually expanding to a series of plants producing 200 tons a day. Salt production effectively ceased during the 70s and 80s, as it was considerably more profitable to keep the basin full and agitated at all times during the optimal summer growing season rather than using the summer heat to evaporate salts. The Spirulina Mexicana brand remained the world's largest through the 1980s and was one of SOSA Texcoco's most profitable assets; unfortunately, the famous snail shape and repurposed nature of the evaporation basin actually hindered efficient aquaculture operations and forced much of the <b>harvesting</b> <b>work</b> to be done by hand. The company also found itself unable to expand further within Mexico City, as the population had quadrupled in size since El Caracol was built in the 1940s and now effectively surrounded the facility. As the price for spirulina spiked, other companies—primarily Earthrise Nutritionals in California and Cyanotech in Hawaii—invested heavily in technology, abandoning the single pond aquaculture system for the (still used) system of individual symmetrical ponds, serviced entirely by automatic equipment and optimized to produce upwards of 350-400 tons a day with far lower labor costs than the Mexicans could match. Spirulina Mexicana, unable to compete, rapidly lost its initial market share, eventually becoming just as unprofitable as the salt operations had been.|$|E
