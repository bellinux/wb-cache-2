5|$|According to Rajamouli, {{the film}} unit {{consulted}} a 3D {{video of the}} storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording procedures were done with simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime lens, and Scorpio and Strada cranes {{were used for the}} principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum <b>f-stop</b> of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E
5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest <b>f-stop</b> they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
25|$|Light falloff is also {{sensitive}} to <b>f-stop.</b> Many wide-angle lenses will show a significant light falloff (vignetting) {{at the edges}} for large apertures.|$|E
30|$|Concerning {{the local}} {{martingale}} analogue of Proposition 2.8, the main {{difficulty is that}} a local (G,P)-martingale need not be localized by a sequence of <b>F-stopping</b> times.

25|$|In 2002, {{he began}} his {{association}} with Oni Press by writing the five-issue miniseires Three Days in Europe (with art by Mike Hawthorne). After this initial mini-series, Johnston penned a number of graphic novels for Oni Press – Spooked (with Sophie Campbell), Julius (with Brett Weldele) and Closer (with Mike Norton) released between February and May 2004; The Long Haul (with Eduardo Barreto) and <b>F-Stop</b> (with Matthew Loux) released in February and April 2005.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way as one <b>f-stop</b> {{corresponds}} to a factor of two in light intensity, shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, the shutter would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of reciprocity. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, where we have reciprocity failure. Aperture, shutter speed, and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the aperture area (one stop), halving the shutter speed (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has the same effect on the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.|$|E

2500|$|The {{f-number}} [...] of {{an optical}} system {{such as a}} camera lens is {{the ratio of the}} system's focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil. It is a dimensionless number that is a quantitative measure of lens speed, and an important concept in photography. [...] It is also known as the focal ratio, f-ratio, or <b>f-stop.</b> It is the reciprocal of the relative aperture. The f-number is commonly indicated using a hooked f with the format N, where N is the f-number.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern lenses use a {{standard}} <b>f-stop</b> scale, {{which is an}} approximately geometric sequence of numbers that corresponds to the sequence of {{the powers of the}} square root of 2: [...] 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64, 90, 128, etc. Each element in the sequence is one stop lower than the element to its left, and one stop higher than the element to its right. [...] The values of the ratios are rounded off to these particular conventional numbers, to make them easier to remember and write down.|$|E

50|$|The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II is {{a digital}} interchangeable-lens camera {{announced}} in February 2015. It features a new 40-megapixel high-resolution mode that uses sensor shift to generate overlapping 16-megapixel images to then compute a 40-megapixel composite. It is the successor of the Olympus OM-D E-M5. Compared to that earlier model from 2012 and flagship OM-D E-M1 released in 2013, {{both of which}} are claimed to have 4 <b>f-stops</b> of shake compensation when shooting handheld, Olympus claims the OM-D E-M5 II can compensate 5 <b>f-stops.</b>|$|R

By convention, [...] "#" [...] is treated as a single symbol, and specific values of # are written by replacing the number sign with the value. The two ways to increase the <b>f-stop</b> are to either decrease {{the diameter of}} the entrance pupil or change to a longer focal length (in the case of a zoom lens, this can be done by simply adjusting the lens). Higher f-numbers also have a larger depth of field due to the lens approaching the limit of a pinhole camera which is able to focus all images perfectly, regardless of distance, but requires very long exposure times.|$|E
2500|$|Image {{sharpness}} {{is related}} to f/number through two different optical effects: aberration, due to imperfect lens design, [...] and diffraction {{which is due to}} the wave nature of light. The blur optimal <b>f-stop</b> varies with the lens design. For modern standard lenses having 6 or 7 elements, the sharpest image is often obtained around 5.6–8, while for older standard lenses having only 4 elements (Tessar formula) stopping to 11 will give the sharpest image. The larger number of elements in modern lenses allow the designer to compensate for aberrations, allowing the lens to give better pictures at lower f-numbers. Even if aberration is minimized by using the best lenses, diffraction creates some spreading of the rays causing defocus. To offset that use the largest lens opening diameter possible (not the f/ number itself).|$|E
2500|$|Scotty, Crane's {{son with}} Olson, {{challenged}} the film's accuracy in an October 2002 review. [...] "During the last 12 {{years of his}} life," [...] he wrote, [...] " [...] went to church three times: when I was baptized, when his father died, {{and when he was}} buried." [...] Crane was a sex addict long before he became a star, he said, and may have begun recording his sexual encounters as early as 1956. [...] There was no evidence, he claimed, that Crane engaged in BDSM; none was portrayed in any of his hundreds of home movies, and Schrader admitted that the film's BDSM scene was based on his own personal experience (while writing Hardcore). [...] Scotty Crane and Olson had shopped a rival script alternately titled <b>F-Stop</b> and Take Off Your Clothes and Smile, but interest ceased after Auto Focus was announced.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Pen F had a double-stroke {{film advance}} and a distinctive logo rendered in a gothic font. The later Pen FT added a single-stroke film advance, and an uncoupled, integrated light meter, which used {{a system of}} exposure numbers rather than <b>f-stops.</b> The exposure numbers {{were added to the}} aperture rings of later Pen F lenses; the rings could be pulled out and rotated to show conventional <b>f-stops</b> instead. A side-effect of the FT's light meter was a dimmer viewfinder. The Pen FV was essentially a Pen FT with the light meter deleted and the F's brighter viewfinder reinstated.|$|R

50|$|For scale, {{note that}} 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.4, and 2.0 are each 1 <b>f-stop</b> apart (2× as fast), as an <b>f-stop</b> {{corresponds}} to a factor of square root of 2, about 1.4. Thus around 1.0, a change of 0.1 {{corresponds to a}}bout 1/4 of an <b>f-stop</b> (by linear approximation): 1.0 is about 50% faster than 1.2, which is about 50% faster than 1.4.|$|E
