5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws.

Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>automobile,</b> or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at Sandy Hook.|$|E
