The koalas, Kobi and Tekin, are two males {{on loan from}} the San Diego Zoo. Kobi and Tekin {{spend most of their}} time <b>dozing</b> in a eucalyptus tree within their climate-controlled exhibit. The zoo is currently one of only ten in the nation to exhibit koalas.|$|E
25|$|The Nazi {{fascination with}} Wagner was largely {{inspired}} by Hitler, sometimes {{to the dismay}} of other high-ranking Nazi officials, including Joseph Goebbels. In 1933, for instance, Hitler ordered that each Nuremberg Rally open with a performance of the overture from Rienzi. He also issued one thousand free tickets for an annual Bayreuth performance of Meistersinger to Nazi functionaries. When Hitler entered the theater, however, he discovered that it was almost empty. The following year, those functionaries were ordered to attend, but they could be seen <b>dozing</b> off during the performance, so that in 1935, Hitler conceded and released the tickets to the public.|$|E
25|$|In narcolepsy, {{the order}} and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep {{occurring}} at sleep onset instead of {{after a period of}} NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of <b>dozing</b> and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} Como was signed, movie musicals {{were on the}} wane and he became a studio {{contract}} player, where the actors or actresses worked only when the studio needed {{to fill out a}} schedule. Though his last movie, Words and Music, was made for prestigious Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Como fared no better. Less than two weeks before the film's release, Walter Winchell wrote in his syndicated column, [...] "Someone at MGM must have been <b>dozing</b> when they wrote the script for Words and Music. In most of the film Perry Como is called Eddie Anders and toward the end (for no reason) they start calling him Perry Como."

500|$|Time (The Revelator) {{received}} extensive critical praise, most {{of which}} focused {{on the evolution of}} lyrics from mountain ballads. For Michael Shannon Friedman of The Charleston Gazette, [...] "Welch's soul-piercing, backwoods quaver has always been a treasure, but on this record her songwriting is absolutely stunning." [...] Critics compare the last track, the 15-minute [...] "I Dream a Highway", to classics by Bob Dylan and Neil Young. Zac Johnson of Allmusic described I Dream... as akin to [...] "sweetly <b>dozing</b> in the [...] current like Huck and Jim's Mississippi River afternoons". [...] No Depressions Grant Alden wrote, [...] "Welch and Rawlings have gathered ... fragments from across the rich history of American music and reset them as small, subtle jewels adorning their own keenly observed, carefully constructed language." [...] Time finished thirteenth in the 2001 Village Voice Pazz & Jop music critic poll. [...] Time (The Revelator) appeared in best of decade lists of Rolling Stone, Paste, Uncut, The Irish Times, and the Ottawa Citizen. The album was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, but lost to Bob Dylan's Love and Theft. [...] Time peaked at No.7 on the Billboard Independent Album chart.|$|E

500|$|On {{researching the}} history of UCL's Egyptology department, the {{historian}} Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was [...] "remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students. A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt." [...] Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours. The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield, who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a [...] "diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age". Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings [...] "she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady <b>dozing</b> peacefully, {{and then in the}} middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not one word of the argument". The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society [...] "remember her fondly", adding that Murray had been [...] "especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas".|$|E
500|$|In 2005, [...] "Girl" [...] {{was part}} of the set list of the group's final tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It. The {{performance}} was preceded by a video interlude, during which Beyoncé, Williams and Rowland appeared on the screen on the stage. The former two started discussing about the latter's relationship who also joined them after hearing their opinions. Their discussions were similar to the lyrical content of the song with the two trying to convince her the relationship is wrong and the latter defending her love interest. After the interlude finished, the group appeared onstage performing [...] "Girl" [...] mixing it with [...] "I'll Take You There". While reviewing a concert in the UK, Adenike Adenitire of MTV News praised the performance, concluding [...] "They borrowed the 'Sex and the City' theme for the 'Girl' video, but they lean more toward 'Girlfriends' when taking it on the road, with a light comedy moment that may see TV execs thinking seriously about a Destiny's Child sitcom." [...] In contrast, Barbara Ellen of The Observer criticized the segment during which [...] "Girl" [...] was performed, writing [...] "... no amount of 'girlpower' rabble-rousing can disguise the fact the songs are wet-paper-bag weak; giving the impression of three bored young women <b>dozing</b> off at a slumber party, whining in their jim-jams about men who 'done them wrong', or men who 'done someone else wrong', or just men doing wrong, period." [...] The song was included on the track listing of the group's live album Destiny's Child: Live in Atlanta (2006) chronicling a concert from the tour in that city.|$|E

2500|$|Another anecdote recounts how while Seongcheol {{was staying}} in Mangwolsa in Dobong mountain, an old monk {{by the name}} of Chunseong refused to believe this. [...] He wanted to catch Seongcheol <b>dozing</b> off to sleep, so spied on him {{secretly}} throughout one night. [...] But having witnessed the truth of the rumor, Chunseong was struck with amazement and himself started employing the technique. [...] It is said that the stress of the practice and the old age at which he started the technique caused all of his teeth to fall out later in life.|$|E
2500|$|Pangolins {{have also}} been {{reported}} to roll away from danger by self-powered methods. Witnessed by a lion researcher [...] in the Serengeti in Africa, a group of lions surrounded a pangolin, but could not get purchase on it when it rolled into a ball, and so the lions sat around it waiting and <b>dozing.</b> Surrounded by lions, it would unroll itself slightly and give itself a push to roll some distance, until by doing this multiple times it could get {{far enough away from}} the lions to be safe. Moving like this would allow a pangolin to cover distance while still remaining in a protective armoured ball.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to access efficiency, power conservation {{is critical for}} mobile nodes owing to limited battery capacities [17 – 19]. To facilitate power saving, {{it is necessary for}} mobile devices to support two operation modes: the active mode and the <b>doze</b> mode [20]. Mobile clients normally operate in the active mode, and they can switch to the energy-saving <b>doze</b> mode when mobile devices become idle. Thus, keeping mobile devices in the <b>doze</b> mode {{for as long as possible}} could be achieved through the application of an air index technique.|$|R

Beside them a seated Saint Joseph is dressed in red with a long head-dress, <b>dozing</b> as he leans on a staff.

2500|$|President Roosevelt died at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1945. In {{the minutes}} after his death, Fala behaved very strangely.

He had been <b>dozing</b> {{in a corner of the}} room. For a reason beyond understanding, he ran directly for the front screen door and bashed his black head against it. The screen broke and he crawled through and ran snapping and barking up into the hills. There, Secret Service men could see him, standing alone, unmoving, on an eminence. This led to the quiet question: 'Do dogs really know?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gospel book as {{a medium}} for heavily {{illustrated}} manuscripts declined in the West from the Romanesque period, {{and with it the}} use of the Evangelist portrait. In the Eastern Orthodox world, the Gospel Book remained a primary focus for illumination, and Evangelist portraits, derived from contemporary Byzantine versions, are heavily represented among the earliest illuminations from the new Slav national traditions, such as the 11th-century Ostromir Gospels and the Khitrovo Gospels of about 1390 from Muscovy. [...] In the West the portraits continued to be found in Bibles, more often as the picture within a historiated initial at the start of each Gospel. [...] Other books sometimes contained them as well. [...] Similar compositions began to be used for other saint-authors, especially for St Jerome, who is often shown in a book-lined study, often with his symbol, a lion, <b>dozing</b> at his feet. Similarly St Gregory the Great may be shown with a dove, representing his inspiration from the Holy Spirit, whispering in his ear.|$|E

2500|$|Wang's {{sighting}} {{was the key}} to {{the discovery}} of Mallory's body 24 years later in the same general area, though Wang's reported description of the body he found, face up, with a [...] "hole in cheek", is not consistent with the condition and posture of Mallory's body, which was face down, its head almost completely buried in scree, and with a golf-ball-sized puncture wound on his forehead. The 2001 research expedition discovered Wang's campsite location and made an extensive search of its surroundings. Mallory's remained the only ancient body in the vicinity. Some argue it must have been Mallory, not Irvine, that Wang had found in 1975, despite the variations in body posture. Zhang said that Wang had only been gone about 20 minutes but he had waited while <b>dozing</b> in his sleeping bag, so Wang's stroll could have been of longer duration.
