The new head office building brought all of the administration departments under the same roof for the first time. This new building was also one of the first of the new large office blocks to open as part of the redevelopment of the huge area south of the River Aire in Leeds city centre, in the Holbeck district, West Yorkshire during the late 1980s. Asda has more recently also leased space in [...] "The Mint" [...] office development adjacent to the main head office site, and has taken office space as part of the redevelopment of the former Carlsberg-Tetley brewery site across the road to support its ever-growing administration and <b>IT</b> <b>operations.</b> Asda also built new Britannia House in Morley on the site of one of its old head office sites. This building is directly behind the Morley superstore, and the customer service team based at Asda's South Bank head office relocated to new Britannia House in February 2016.
