500|$|Public {{reception}} to the IAU {{decision was}} mixed. Many accepted the reclassification, but some sought {{to overturn the}} decision with online petitions urging the IAU to consider reinstatement. A resolution introduced by {{some members of the}} California State Assembly facetiously called the IAU decision a [...] "scientific heresy". The New Mexico House of Representatives passed a resolution in honor of Tombaugh, a longtime resident of that state, that declared that Pluto will always be considered a planet while in New Mexican skies and that March 13, 2007, was Pluto Planet Day. The Illinois Senate passed a similar resolution in 2009, on the basis that Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto, was born in Illinois. The resolution asserted that Pluto was [...] "unfairly downgraded to a 'dwarf' planet" [...] by the IAU." [...] Some members of the public have also rejected the change, citing the disagreement within the scientific community on the issue, or for sentimental reasons, maintaining that they <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> Pluto as a planet {{and will continue to do}} so regardless of the IAU decision.|$|E
500|$|Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club {{remarked that}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] has [...] "boilerplate lyrics" [...] {{that would fit}} {{perfectly}} in a Hayley Mills film. Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote in his review of the album that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] has the [...] "most interesting lyrics" [...] of the entire record. In a separate review of [...] "If I Were a Boy", Levine awarded it four stars out of five, writing that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are passionate. He praised the lyrics for not being overwritten and commended their [...] "emotional punch" [...] and [...] "very strong melody" [...] which he said can make people feel that they <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> the song. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal called [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] an [...] "effective and affecting gender-bender". Allmusic writer Andy Kellman felt that though the ballad sounds like [...] "the watery backdrop for a singing competition finale", {{it is the most}} outstanding song on I Am... Sasha Fierce thanks to its lyrics and Beyoncé's tormented performance. Colin McGuire of PopMatters felt that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was the highlight of the first disc of the double album.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} The Great Shark Hunt, Thompson refers to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as [...] "a failed {{experiment}} in the gonzo journalism" [...] he practiced, {{which was based on}} William Faulkner's idea that [...] "the best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism — and the best journalists <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> this". [...] Thompson's style blended the techniques of fictional story-telling and journalism.|$|E

2500|$|Although, in {{the first}} place, {{it is not for}} this court in any {{circumstance}} to indulge in discussing whether the action of the defendant mentioned above constitutes a deviation from Islamic tradition and its prohibitions, it is necessary to note that human societies <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> – since the advent of religions until this day – forms of behavior that touched the various aspects of life while not always observing all religious rules or abiding by them without that necessarily forming a desecration of the religious sanctity of the texts from which these rules have emerged.|$|E
2500|$|... {{has been}} of central {{significance}} {{to the development of}} human society. It can be the beginning, not only of individual knowledge, information and awareness, but also a holistic strategy for development and change. Education is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on the basis of equality with others and to achieve the important social good of self-respect. It is important, as well, to mobility (through access to jobs and the political process) and to health and life (through the connection to bodily integrity). Education can allow women to participate in politics so they can ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and addressed in the public policy. It is also crucial for women's access to the legal system. Although it must be considered that religion and traditions of the Pakistani affect women's education. Some women may choose to keep the traditional roles because that is what they <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>known</b> and are used to. It would be a great opportunity if women were able to make their choice on their own, though. They should at least have the knowledge of both sides to be educated or to stay with the traditional ways.|$|E
