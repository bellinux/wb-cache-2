5|$|A pure browser, {{the lesser}} kudu feeds on <b>foliage</b> from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs, and herbs. Despite {{seasonal}} and local variations, <b>foliage</b> from {{trees and shrubs}} constitute 60–80% of the diet throughout the year. The lesser kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. The lesser kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur {{at any time of}} the year. The lesser kudu inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E

5000|$|Trichostema laxum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mint family, known by the common name turpentine weed from the <b>foliage's</b> scent.|$|R
5|$|Annual growth {{increases}} exponentially for {{the first}} eight years or so, but then slows down as resources are diverted into reproduction and the greater density of <b>foliage</b> results in reduced photosynthetic efficiency.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush {{where they are}} usually {{obscured}} by <b>foliage.</b> In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according to George it {{may be reluctant to}} flower in cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green <b>foliage.</b> George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the <b>foliage,</b> which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new <b>foliage</b> and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
50|$|Baguette — Thin, {{half-round}} molding, {{smaller than}} an astragal, sometimes carved, and enriched with <b>foliages,</b> pearls, ribbands, laurels, etc. When enriched with ornaments, {{it was also}} called chapelet.|$|R

5|$|Banksia aculeata, {{commonly}} known as prickly banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, it has dense <b>foliage</b> and leaves with very prickly serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the <b>foliage</b> and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981—by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oligantha is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit. Its <b>foliage</b> is also not as prickly as that of B.cuneata.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by <b>foliage.</b> It tolerates light pruning not below the green <b>foliage,</b> except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the <b>foliage,</b> although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E

50|$|Melaleuca capitata is a shrub in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is {{endemic to}} New South Wales. It has scaly bark, a densely <b>foliaged</b> habit and {{attractive}} heads of creamy-yellow {{flowers on the}} ends of its branches in summer.|$|R
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the <b>foliage</b> and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new <b>foliage</b> afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Imperator carrots. This {{cultivar}} has vigorous <b>foliage,</b> is of high sugar content, and {{has long}} and slender roots, tapering to a pointed tip. Imperator types {{are the most}} widely cultivated by commercial growers. Cultivars include 'Imperator 58' and 'Sugarsnax Hybrid'.|$|E
5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's <b>foliage.</b> Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of <b>foliage</b> per day.|$|E

50|$|Eremophila pterocarpa, {{commonly}} known as silver poverty bush or winged-fruited eremophila, is a plant in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae and is endemic to Western Australia. It is a densely <b>foliaged,</b> upright shrub with most of its parts covered with a silvery powder.|$|R
50|$|Kisii town {{enjoys a}} {{highland}} climate. It generally receives rain {{all year round}} thanks to its positioning in the Lake Victoria lake basin and the heavily <b>foliaged</b> Kisii highlands. Due to its unique positioning within hills, Kisii town has never experienced flooding.|$|R
5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the <b>foliage</b> include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the <b>foliage</b> and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green <b>foliage</b> and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly <b>foliage</b> makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E

40|$|The stepped-bed system, with a step-like {{longitudinal}} profile, {{is typical}} morphology in steep headwater streams. These systems {{are created by}} a series of coarse sediments or instream wood (steps with supercritical flows) interspaced with finer material (forming pools with subcritical flows). In the case of well-developed steps and pools, the resulting channel-reach morphology is referred to as “step-pool” morphology. In this study, we identify a previously undescribed type of step-pool formation, the “foliaged step-pool”, in the high-gradient Stoligy Stream of the Moravskoslezské Beskydy Mountains. The defining feature of this formation is the significant presence of leaves in the step structure. The geometry of the steps and pools was measured and the parameters that characterise the distribution, amount and function of leaves acting in these areas were defined. Statistical results showed differences between non-foliaged and <b>foliaged</b> step-pool formations, in which the latter showed a significant increase in storage level, influencing the channel’s hydrodynamics. Particle-size analyses demonstrated that <b>foliaged</b> step-pool formations had finer sediment in the pools, which indicates that there are differences in sediment transport processes between <b>foliaged</b> and non-foliaged formations. These results offer new insights into stepped-bed and step-pool morphology, providing directions for further research on small streams in deciduous forested regions...|$|R

5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having <b>foliage</b> that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves {{at the end}} of the growing season and then having a dormant period without <b>foliage.</b> Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy. A sapling is a young tree.|$|E
5|$|Allan Cunningham sent seed of G.juniperina to England in 1820; it {{was grown}} there the {{following}} year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense <b>foliage</b> is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense <b>foliage.</b> Plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. Direct contact with the plant may cause a skin rash.|$|E
