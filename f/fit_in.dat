5|$|BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve {{was passed}} <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> {{the days leading}} up to the race. At the Brazilian Grand Prix, Villeneuve {{suffered}} back injury after his seat became loose during the race and the effects became worse and it caused him to withdraw from testing in Barcelona. He was also required to undergo physiotherapy. BAR had their official test driver Darren Manning available to replace Villeneuve should the need arise.|$|E
5|$|In April 1980 the {{locomotive}} again {{took to the}} rails and thereafter was employed in hauling many enthusiasts' trains. After a substantial overhaul, the Duchess was declared <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> 1990 to continue working on the national network {{and at the same}} time the museum purchased it outright from Butlins. In 1998, however, {{the locomotive}} returned to static display at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E

5|$|Loitering munitions <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles {{in that they}} are designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition is intended to be expended in an attack and has a built-in warhead.|$|E
5|$|Loitering weapons first {{emerged in}} the 1980s {{for use in the}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role against surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs), and were deployed for the SEAD role in a number of military forces in the 1990s. Starting in the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for additional roles ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short range battlefield systems that <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> a backpack.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were mostly positive, with most reviewers commenting that the book was well {{researched}} and provided a solid history of the show. Critics felt that the final chapters, in which Ortved gives his opinion of {{the current state of}} the show, were out of place and did not <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> with the rest {{of the book}}.|$|E
50|$|The charabanc of the 1920s {{tended to}} last {{only a few}} years.

50|$|It was {{originally}} planned to equip the lines with smoothbore guns; however, {{it appears the}} guns may never have been <b>fitted.</b> <b>In</b> 1886 the lines were equipped {{with a mix of}} RML 7 inch guns and RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns on Moncrieff mountings <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> newly constructed concrete emplacements. Further RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns were <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> the original casements. The guns were removed in 1903. A QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss was mounted on the lines during World War 1. A small number of guns were mounted on the lines during World War II.|$|R

5|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, {{there are certain}} protocols that are sometimes used and loosely <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> the session and presentation layers, most notably the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential. Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as HTTP (web browsing), POP3 (e-mail), FTP (file transfer), IRC (Internet chat), BitTorrent (file sharing) and XMPP (instant messaging).|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Barringer, Berg {{enrolled}} in New York University. He spent two semesters there and played baseball and basketball. In 1919 {{he transferred to}} Princeton University and never again mentioned that he had attended NYU for a year, presenting himself exclusively as a Princeton man. Berg received a B.A., magna cum laude in modern languages. He had studied seven languages: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Sanskrit, studying with the philologist Harold H. Bender. His Jewish heritage and modest finances combined to keep him {{on the fringes of}} Princeton society, where he never quite <b>fit</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E
