25|$|Once {{inside the}} host cell, the virus {{must find a}} way to uncoat. The virus {{particles}} enter the cell in a structure known as an <b>endosome</b> (also called an endolysosome). Disassembly is a stepwise process. Uncoating requires a low pH, which is provided by the help of endocytic proteases. Acidification of the <b>endosome</b> removes the outer-capsid protein σ3. This removal allows membrane-penetration mediator μ1 to be exposed and attachment protein σ1 goes through a conformational change. After uncoating is completed, the active virus is released in the cytoplasm where replication of the genome and virion takes place.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the virus}} has {{successfully}} gained entry into the host cell, the <b>endosome</b> acidifies, which alters virus topology by causing capsid components to disband. These changes, {{as well as the}} toxic nature of the pentons, destroy the <b>endosome,</b> resulting in the movement of the virion into the cytoplasm. With the help of cellular microtubules, the virus is transported to the nuclear pore complex, whereby the adenovirus particle disassembles. Viral DNA is subsequently released, which can enter the nucleus via the nuclear pore. After this the DNA associates with histone molecules. Thus, viral gene expression can occur and new virus particles can be generated.|$|E
30|$|In the {{previous}} sections, different possible uptake pathways of NPs and the parameters {{that affect the}} efficacy of uptake has been discussed. Following uptake, the next crucial matter is the intracellular trafficking of NPs which determines its final destination within cellular compartments, its cytotoxicity and its therapeutic efficacy [158, 159]. After NPs are internalized by the cells, they will first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early <b>endosomes.</b> <b>Endosomes</b> formed at the plasma membrane are categorized into three types; early <b>endosomes,</b> late <b>endosomes</b> and recycling <b>endosomes</b> [106, 160 – 163].|$|R

25|$|The viruses infect, amongst others, monocytes, macrophages, and {{dendritic}} cells. They {{attach to}} the cell surface via specific receptors and are taken up by an endosomal vesicle. Inside the <b>endosome,</b> the decreased pH induces the fusion of the endosomal membrane with the virus envelope. The capsid enters the cytosol, decays, and releases the genome. Receptor binding, as well as membrane fusion, are catalyzed by the protein E, which changes its conformation at low pH, causing a rearrangement of the 90 homodimers to 60 homotrimers.|$|E
25|$|Papillomaviruses {{gain access}} to {{keratinocyte}} stem cells through small wounds, known as microtraumas, in the skin or mucosal surface. Interactions between L1 and sulfated sugars on the cell surface promote initial attachment of the virus. The virus is then able to get inside from the cell surface via interaction with a specific receptor, likely via the alpha-6 beta-4 integrin, and transported to membrane-enclosed vesicles called endosomes. The capsid protein L2 disrupts the membrane of the <b>endosome,</b> allowing the viral genome to escape and traffic, along with L2, to the cell nucleus.|$|E
40|$|APPL <b>endosomes</b> are a {{recently}} identified subpopulation of early <b>endosomes</b> {{characterized by the}} presence of two homologous Rab 5 effector proteins APPL 1 and APPL 2. They exhibit only limited colocalization with EEA 1, another Rab 5 effector and a marker of the canonical early <b>endosomes.</b> Although APPL <b>endosomes</b> appear to play important roles in cargo trafficking and signal transduction, their protein composition and biochemical properties remain largely unknown. Here we employed membrane fractionation methods to characterize APPL <b>endosomes</b> biochemically. We demonstrate that they represent heterogeneous membrane structures which can be discriminated from the canonical EEA 1 -positive early <b>endosomes</b> by their partly different physical properties and a distinct migration pattern in the continuous density gradients. In search for other potential markers of APPL <b>endosomes</b> we identified Annexin A 2 as an interacting partner of both APPL 1 and APPL 2. Annexin A 2 is a Ca 2 + and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate binding protein, previously implicated in several endocytic steps. We show that Annexin A 2 co-fractionates and colocalizes with APPL <b>endosomes.</b> Moreover, silencing of its expression causes solubilization of APPL 2 from <b>endosomes.</b> Although Annexin A 2 is not an exclusive marker of APPL <b>endosomes,</b> our data suggest that it has an important function in membrane recruitment of APPL proteins, acting in parallel to Rab 5...|$|R
40|$|Mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) {{signaling}} is regulated by assembling distinct scaffold complexes at the plasma membrane and on <b>endosomes.</b> Thus, spatial resolution might {{be critical to}} determine signaling specificity. Therefore, we investigated whether epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) traffic through the endosomal system provides spatial information for MAPK signaling. To mislocalize late <b>endosomes</b> to the cell periphery we used the dynein subunit p 50 dynamitin. The peripheral translocation of late <b>endosomes</b> resulted in a prolonged EGFR activation on late <b>endosomes</b> and a slow down in EGFR degradation. Continuous EGFR signaling from late <b>endosomes</b> caused sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p 38 signaling and resulted in hyperactivation of nuclear targets, such as Elk- 1. In contrast, clustering late <b>endosomes</b> in the perinuclear region by expression of dominant active Rab 7 delayed the entry of the EGFR into late <b>endosomes,</b> which caused a delay in EGFR degradation and a sustained MAPK signaling. Surprisingly, the activation of nuclear targets was reduced. Thus, we conclude that appropriate trafficking of the activated EGFR through <b>endosomes</b> controls the spatial and temporal regulation of MAPK signaling...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{mammalian}} cells, macromolecules internalized by endocytosis are transported via <b>endosomes</b> for digestion by lysosomal acid hydrolases [1 – 3]. The {{mechanism by}} which <b>endosomes</b> and lysosomes exchange content remains equivocal [2 – 9]. However, lysosomes are reusable organelles because they remain accessible to endocytic enzyme replacement therapies [10] and undergo content mixing with late <b>endosomes</b> [5, 6]. The maturation model, which proposes that <b>endosomes</b> mature into lysosomes [9], cannot explain these observations. Three mechanisms for content mixing have been proposed. The first is vesicular transport, best supported by a yeast cell-free assay [11]. The second suggests that <b>endosomes</b> and lysosomes engage in repeated transient fusions termed “kiss-and-run” [4]. The third is that <b>endosomes</b> and lysosomes fuse completely, yielding hybrid compartments from which lysosomes reform [3, 5, 6, 7, 8], termed “fusion-fission” [2]. We utilized time-lapse confocal microscopy to test these hypotheses in living cells. Lysosomes were loaded with rhodamine dextran by pulse-chase, and subsequently late <b>endosomes</b> were loaded with Oregon green 488 dextran. Direct fusions were observed between <b>endosomes</b> and lysosomes, and one such event was captured by correlative electron microscopy. Fluorescence intensity analyses of <b>endosomes</b> that encountered lysosomes revealed a gradual accumulation of lysosomal content. Our data are compatible with a requirement for direct contact between organelles before content is exchanged...|$|R
25|$|Most cell types take up iron {{primarily}} through receptor-mediated endocytosis via transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and GAPDH. TFR1 has a 30-fold higher affinity for transferrin-bound iron than TFR2 {{and thus is}} the main player in this process. The higher order multifunctional glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) also acts as a transferrin receptor. Transferrin-bound ferric iron is recognized by these transferrin receptors, triggering a conformational change that causes endocytosis. Iron then enters the cytoplasm from the <b>endosome</b> via importer DMT1 after being reduced to its ferrous state by a STEAP family reductase.|$|E
25|$|SARA {{is present}} in an early <b>endosome</b> which, by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, internalizes the {{receptor}} complex. SARA recruits an R-SMAD. SARA permits the binding of the R-SMAD to the L45 region of the Type I receptor. SARA orients the R-SMAD such that serine residue on its C-terminus faces the catalytic region of the Type I receptor. The Type I receptor phosphorylates the serine residue of the R-SMAD. Phosphorylation induces a conformational change in the MH2 domain of the R-SMAD and its subsequent dissociation from the receptor complex and SARA.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequential}} {{stages of}} HSV entry are analogous {{to those of}} other viruses. At first, complementary receptors on the virus and the cell surface bring the viral and cell membranes into proximity. Interactions of these molecules then form a stable entry pore through which the viral envelope contents are introduced to the host cell. The virus can also be endocytosed after binding to the receptors, and the fusion could occur at the <b>endosome.</b> In electron micrographs the outer leaflets of the viral and cellular lipid bilayers have been seen merged; this hemifusion may be on the usual path to entry or it may usually be an arrested state more likely to be captured than a transient entry mechanism.|$|E
40|$|Hrs and the endosomal sorting {{complexes}} {{required for}} transport, ESCRT-I, -II, and -III, {{are involved in}} the endosomal sorting of membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies and lysosomes or vacuoles. The ESCRT complexes are also required for formation of intraluminal endosomal vesicles and for budding of certain enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV. Here, we show that Hrs binds to the ESCRT-I subunit Tsg 101 via a PSAP motif that is conserved in Tsg 101 -binding viral proteins. Depletion of Hrs causes a reduction in membrane-associated ESCRT-I subunits, a decreased number of multivesicular bodies and an increased size of late <b>endosomes.</b> Even though Hrs mainly localizes to early <b>endosomes</b> and Tsg 101 to late <b>endosomes,</b> the two proteins colocalize on a subpopulation of <b>endosomes</b> that contain lyso-bisphosphatidic acid. Overexpression of Hrs causes accumulation of Tsg 101 on early <b>endosomes</b> and prevents its localization to late <b>endosomes.</b> We conclude that Hrs mediates the initial recruitment of ESCRT-I to <b>endosomes</b> and, thereby, indirectly regulates multivesicular body formation...|$|R
40|$|The sorting {{machinery}} {{in early}} <b>endosomes</b> {{is crucial for}} intracellular homeostasis and signal transduction and its disruption leads {{to the development of}} various diseases. In spite of its significance, the molecular mechanism underlying this machinery remains largely unknown. Actin filaments are implicated in intracellular trafficking, including membrane fission at endocytosis, membrane stretching at the Golgi complex, and maturation of <b>endosomes.</b> We have recently found that actin is required for receptor sorting in early <b>endosomes</b> and identified cortactin as a candidate for actin regulation in early <b>endosomes.</b> Inhibition of actin dynamics leads to enlargement of early <b>endosomes</b> and impairment of the sorting; the latter is also observed in cortactin-depleted cells. The endosomal localization of cortactin was enhanced by dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor that effectively inhibits endosomal sorting, indicating that cortactin is involved in the sorting machinery in early <b>endosomes.</b> Here we discuss the role of actin filaments in early <b>endosomes</b> and other molecules implicated in endosomal trafficking...|$|R
40|$|Using {{horseradish}} peroxidase (HRP) as a fluid-phase endocytic tracer, we observed through the electron microscope numerous tubular <b>endosomes</b> with {{a diameter of}} 30 - 50 nm and lengths of greater than 2 microns in thick sections (0. 2 - 0. 5 microns) of AtT 20 cells. These tubular <b>endosomes</b> are multibranching and form local networks but not a single reticulum throughout the cytoplasm. They are sometimes in continuity with vesicular endosomal structures but have not been observed in continuity with AtT 20 cell late <b>endosomes.</b> Tubular endosomal networks are not uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but are particularly abundant in growth cones, in patches below the plasma membrane of the cell body, and surrounding the centrioles and microtubule organizing center (MTOC). Tubular <b>endosomes</b> at all these locations receive HRP within the first 5 min of endocytosis but approximately 30 min of endocytosis are required to load the tubular endosomal networks with HRP so that their full extent can be visualized in the electron microscope. After 10 min of endocytosis, complete unloading occurs within 30 min of chase, but between 30 and 60 min are required to chase out all the tracer from the tubular <b>endosomes</b> loaded to steady state during 60 min endocytosis of 10 mg/ml HRP. In interphase cells, neither the loading nor unloading of tubular <b>endosomes</b> depends on microtubules but in cells blocked in mitosis by depolymerization of the mitotic spindle with nocodazole, HRP does not chase out of tubular <b>endosomes.</b> The thread-like shape of tubular <b>endosomes</b> is not dependent on microtubules. Furthermore, HRP is delivered to AtT 20 tubular <b>endosomes</b> at 20 degrees C. All these properties indicate that AtT 20 cell tubular <b>endosomes</b> are an early endocytic compartment distinct from late <b>endosomes.</b> Tubular <b>endosomes</b> like those in AtT 20 cells have been seen in cells of the following lines: PC 12, HeLa, Hep 2, Vero, MDCK I and II, CCL 64, RK 13, and NRK; they are particularly abundant {{in the first three}} lines. In contrast, tubular <b>endosomes</b> are sparse in 3 T 3 and BHK 21 cells.

25|$|Receptor {{desensitization}} {{is mediated}} {{through a combination}} phosphorylation, β-arr binding, and endocytosis as described above. Downregulation occurs when endocytosed receptor is embedded in an <b>endosome</b> that is trafficked to merge with an organelle called a lysosome. Because lysosomal membranes are rich in proton pumps, their interiors have low pH (≈4.8 vs. the pH≈7.2 cytosol), which acts to denature the GPCRs. In addition, lysosomes contain many degradative enzymes, including proteases, which can function only at such low pH, and so the peptide bonds joining the residues of the GPCR together may be cleaved. Whether or not a given receptor is trafficked to a lysosome, detained in endosomes, or trafficked back to the plasma membrane depends {{on a variety of}} factors, including receptor type and magnitude of the signal.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin is a three-protein {{exotoxin}} secreted by virulent {{strains of}} the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis—the causative agent of anthrax. The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954. Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protective antigen (PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components are endocytosed. In the <b>endosome,</b> the enzymatic components of the toxin translocate into the cytoplasm of a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration. The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed for macrophage cells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade the immune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the host animal. Research on anthrax toxin also provides insight into the generation of macromolecular assemblies, and on protein translocation, pore formation, endocytosis, and other biochemical processes.|$|E
25|$|Entry {{of adenoviruses}} into the host cell {{involves}} {{two sets of}} interactions between the virus and the host cell. Most of the action occurs at the vertices. Entry into the host cell is initiated by the knob domain of the fiber protein binding to the cell receptor. The two currently established receptors are: CD46 for the group B human adenovirus serotypes and the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) for all other serotypes. There are some reports suggesting MHC molecules and sialic acid residues functioning in this capacity as well. This {{is followed by a}} secondary interaction, where a motif in the penton base protein interacts with an integrin molecule. It is the co-receptor interaction that stimulates entry of the adenovirus. This co-receptor molecule is αv integrin. Binding to αv integrin results in endocytosis of the virus particle via clathrin-coated pits. Attachment to αv integrin stimulates cell signaling and thus induces actin polymerization resulting in entry of the virion into the host cell within an <b>endosome.</b>|$|E

40|$|Semliki forest virus (SFV) is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, {{and transported}} via early <b>endosomes</b> to late <b>endosomes</b> and lysosomes. The {{intracellular}} pathway taken by individual fluorescently labeled SFV particles was followed using immunofluorescence in untransfected cells, and by video-enhanced, triple-color fluorescence microscopy in live cells transfected with GFP- and RFP-tagged Rab 5, Rab 7, Rab 4, and Arf 1. The viruses progressed from Rab 5 -positive early <b>endosomes</b> to {{a population of}} early <b>endosomes</b> (about 10 % of total) that contained both Rab 5 and Rab 7. SFV were sequestered in the Rab 7 domains, and they were sorted away from the early <b>endosomes</b> when these domains detached as separate transport carriers devoid of Rab 5, Rab 4, EEA 1, Arf 1, and transferrin. The process was independent of Arf 1 and the acidic pH in early <b>endosomes.</b> Nocodazole treatment showed that the release of transport carriers was assisted by microtubules. Expression of constitutively inactive Rab 7 T 22 N resulted in accumulation of SFV in early <b>endosomes.</b> We concluded that Rab 7 is recruited to early <b>endosomes,</b> where it forms distinct domains that mediate cargo sorting {{as well as the}} formation of late-endosome-targeted transport vesicles...|$|R
5000|$|Another unique {{identifying}} {{feature that}} differs {{between the various}} classes of <b>endosomes</b> is the lipid composition in their membranes. Phosphotidyl inositol phosphates (PIPs), {{one of the most}} important lipid signaling molecules, is found to differ as the <b>endosomes</b> mature from early to late. PI(4,5)P2 is present on plasma membranes, PI(3)P on early <b>endosomes,</b> PI(3,5)P2 [...] on late <b>endosomes</b> and PI(4)P on the trans Golgi network.

25|$|The viruses bind to a cell through {{interactions}} between its hemagglutinin glycoprotein and sialic acid sugars on {{the surfaces of}} epithelial cells in the lung and throat (Stage 1 in infection figure). The cell imports the virus by endocytosis. In the acidic <b>endosome,</b> part of the haemagglutinin protein fuses the viral envelope with the vacuole's membrane, releasing the viral RNA (vRNA) molecules, accessory proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into the cytoplasm (Stage 2). These proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the cell nucleus, where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive-sense cRNA (Steps 3a and b). The cRNA is either exported into the cytoplasm and translated (step 4), or remains in the nucleus. Newly synthesised viral proteins are either secreted through the Golgi apparatus onto the cell surface (in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, step 5b) or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles (step 5a). Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell, including degrading cellular mRNA and using the released nucleotides for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting translation of host-cell mRNAs.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin protein {{components}} must assemble into holotoxin complexes to function. In {{order for}} LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize {{to the cell}} and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can translocate EF and LF into the cell (Fig. 2). This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped oligomer. This ring-shaped oligomer {{is often referred to}} as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA oligomer may then bind with up to three or four molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell. The low pH encountered in the <b>endosome</b> causes the PA63 pre-channel to convert into a cation-selective channel. EF and LF are driven through the channel by a pH gradient, allowing the enzyme factors to enter the cytosol.|$|E
