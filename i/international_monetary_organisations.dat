Despite dismal accuracy in absolute terms and only slightly better accuracy in relative terms, particularly concerning turning points, the forecasts show surprising similarities, especially regarding forecast revisions {{and the influence of}} US and German forecasts on forecasts in other countries. On average, the forecast record of the four institutions is also quite similar, with minor differences attributable to different forecast production dates. We found no evidence of so-called 'home advantages' for the institutions.

40|$|Wei (Environ Resour Econ 60 : 579 – 581, 2015) {{presents}} a novel derivation {{of the accounting}} price for an exhaustible resource in a non-optimal economy subject to an allocation mechanism. We show that Wei (2015) and Hamilton and Ruta (Environ Resour Econ 42 : 53 – 64, 2009) are in fact employing different and mutually exclusive allocation mechanisms for the economy, and this explains {{the differences between the}} respective accounting prices. Because accounting prices must be defined subject to the allocation mechanism for the economy, the prices derived in the two papers are equally valid within their respective allocation domains. Further analysis shows that if there is declining marginal product of factors, a ‘Hartwick investment rule’ for the model economy (set investment just equal to depletion, valued at the accounting price) will lead to declining consumption for the Wei (2015) accounting price, and increasing consumption for the Hamilton and Ruta (2009) accounting price. This result is extended to consider the accounting standards recommended in the UN SEEA (System of environmental-economic accounting 2012 : central framework.

40|$|By {{the fall}} of 1990 the {{economic}} position of the USSR had deteriorated {{to the point where}} the Gorbachev government sought the advice and assistance of the major Western international financial institutions: the <b>International</b> <b>Monetary</b> Fund, the <b>Organisation</b> for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. These IFIs were asked to diagnose the situation and recommend measures to assist in the transition from plan to market. The reform of industrial and manufacturing enterprises was a key issue among the many analyzed. This article's author, from the World Bank, worked on the enterprise reform team. Drawing on extensive notes from 1990 and 1991 interviews with Soviet and Russian officials, reformers and enterprise managers, this article portrays in detail the extent of the economic — and political — dislocation of the Soviet Union in 1990, the acutely uncertain policy and legal environments in which enterprise managers and government overseers tried to function, and the various and sometimes desperate means by which those in the enterprise sector struggled to position themselves for survival in the newly emerging economy. A major theme is the widespread but ultimately fruitless effort on the part of the Soviet and then Russian reformers to find a gradualist, minimally painful way to carry out the transition of enterprises to market operations. One result of that failure was the much-criticized Russian privatization program. The conclusion is that for political as much as economic reasons, the pace of enterprise reform adopted was unavoidable...|$|R
