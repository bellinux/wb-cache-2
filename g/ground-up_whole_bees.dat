However, in mammals the principle factors contributing to addiction are long-term adaptive responses to repeated drug use.

Repeated topical treatment with a low dose of cocaine rendered bees resistant to the deleterious motor effects of a higher cocaine dose, indicating the development of physiological tolerance to cocaine in bees. Cocaine inhibits biogenic amine reuptake transporters, but neither acute nor repeated cocaine treatments caused measurable changes in levels of biogenic amines measured in <b>whole</b> <b>bee</b> brains.

40|$|Traditional venom {{immunotherapy}} uses {{injections of}} <b>whole</b> <b>bee</b> venom in buffer or adsorbed in Al (OH) (3) in an expensive, time-consuming way. New strategies {{to improve the}} safety and efficacy of this treatment with a reduction of injections would, therefore, be of general interest. It would improve patient compliance and provide socio-economic benefits. Liposomes have a long tradition in drug delivery because they increase the therapeutic index and avoid drug degradation and secondary effects. However, bee venom melittin (Mel) and phospholipase (PLA(2)) destroy the phospholipid membranes. Our central idea was to inhibit the PLA(2) and Mel activities through histidine alkylation and or tryptophan oxidation (with pbb, para-bromo-phenacyl bromide, and/or NBSN-bromosuccinimide, respectively) to make their encapsulations possible within stabilized liposomes. We strongly believe that this formulation will be nontoxic but immunogenic. In this paper, we present the <b>whole</b> <b>bee</b> venom conformation characterization during and after chemical modification and after interaction with liposome by ultraviolet, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopies. The PLA(2) and Mel activities were, measured indirectly by changes in turbidity at 400 (nm), rhodamine leak-out, and hemolysis. The native <b>whole</b> <b>bee</b> venom (BV) presented 78. 06 % of alpha-helical content. The alkylation (A-BV) and succynilation (S-BV) of BV increased 0. 44 and 0. 20 % of its alpha-helical content. The double-modified venom (S-A-BV) had a 0. 74 % increase of alpha-helical content. The BV chemical modification induced another change on protein conformations observed by Trp that became buried {{with respect to the}} native whole BV. It was demonstrated that the liposomal membranes must contain pbb (SPC:Cho:pbb, 26 : 7 : 1) as a component to protect them from aggregation and/or fusion. The membranes containing pbb maintained the same turbidity (100 %) after incubation with modified venom, in contrast with pbb-free membranes that showed a 15 % size decrease. This size decrease was interpreted as membrane degradation and was corroborated by a 50 % rhodamine leak-out. Another fact that confirmed our interpretation was the observed 100 % inhibition of the hemolytic activity after venom modification with pbb and NBS (S-A-BV). When S-A-BV interacted with liposomes, other protein conformational changes were observed and characterized by the increase of 1. 93 % on S-A-BV alpha-helical content and the presence of tryptophan residues in a more hydrophobic environment. In other words, the S-A-BV interacted with liposomal membranes, but this interaction was not effective to cause aggregation, leak-out, or fusion. A stable formulation composed by S-A-BV encapsulated within liposomes composed by SPC:Cho:pbb, at a ratio of 26 : 7 : 1, was devised. Large unilamellar vesicles of 202. 5 nm with a negative surface charge (- 24. 29 mV) encapsulated 95 % of S-A-BV. This formulation can, now, be assayed on VIT.

The arrays reveal distinct, developmentally-specific signaling profiles between bees with differential susceptibility to infestation by Varroa mites. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially phosphorylated peptides indicates that the differential susceptibility to Varroa mite infestation does not reflect compromised immunity; rather, there is evidence for mite-mediated immune suppression within the susceptible phenotype that may reduce the ability of these bees to counter secondary viral infections. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of more diverse viral infections in mite-infested, susceptible adult bees.

Both nematode products caused ≥ 80 % mortality within the 96 h test period when bees were exposed to soil containing entomopathogenic nematodes at the recommended field concentration of 50 nematodes per cm 2 soil.

40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a tick-borne, multi-systemic disease, caused by the {{bacterium}} Borrelia burgdorferi. Though antibiotics are used as a primary treatment, relapse often occurs after the discontinuation of antimicrobial agents. The reason for relapse remains unknown, however previous studies suggest the possible presence of antibiotic resistant Borrelia round bodies, persisters and attached biofilm forms. Thus, there is an urgent need to find antimicrobial agents suitable to eliminate all known forms of B. burgdorferi. In this study, natural antimicrobial agents such as Apis mellifera venom and a known component, melittin, were tested using SYBR Green I/PI, direct cell counting, biofilm assays combined with LIVE/DEAD and atomic force microscopy methods. The obtained results were compared to standalone and combinations of antibiotics such as Doxycycline, Cefoperazone, Daptomycin, which were recently found to be effective against Borrelia persisters. Our findings showed that both bee venom and melittin had significant effects on all the tested forms of B. burgdorferi. In contrast, the control antibiotics when used individually or even in combinations had limited effects on the attached biofilm form. These findings strongly suggest that <b>whole</b> <b>bee</b> venom or melittin could be effective antimicrobial agents for B. burgdorferi; however, further research is necessary to evaluate their effectiveness in vivo, {{as well as their}} safe and effective delivery method for their therapeutic use...|$|R

Their ability to induce the production of cytokines TNFα, IL- 1 β and IL- 6 in phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA) -treated U 937 cells was assessed. The levels of the three cytokines produced by stimulation with the four fractions and crude BV without LPS were not significantly different from negative control values. However, co-stimulation of the cells with LPS and Fraction 4 (F- 4) induced a 1. 6 -fold increase in TNF-α level (p < 0. 05) compared to LPS alone.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Across Europe {{conservation}} {{actions have}} been implemented to mitigate the decline of pollinators in agricultural landscapes. However, recent concerns have appeared about their efficiency to promote pollinator diversity. To increase the efficiency of these interventions, one must acquire a better knowledge of the target species diversity patterns and its sources of variations at different spatial and temporal scales. This study sets out to identify the main sources of variation in wild bee assemblages at a regional scale (450 km 2) in mass-flowering crops and semi-natural habitats. During three consecutive sampling years, we monitored bee diversity and its temporal and spatial turnovers. We show that an intensive agricultural landscape in western France can hold nearly 200 wild bee species at a regional scale, i. e. 20 % of the <b>whole</b> <b>bee</b> fauna known in mainland France. Wild bee diversity was 3 – 4 times lower in oleaginous crops than in semi-natural habitats, with {{a substantial number of}} these being social and gregarious species. Spatial and seasonal species turnover in semi-natural habitats explained 28. 6 and 34. 3 %, respectively, of regional species richness. Given the importance of the spatial component of the bee diversity turnover, we suggest wild bee conservation efforts should be carried out at relevant spatial scales. The spatial turnover was estimated to be steeper within 50 km 2 scales. This provides an order of magnitude for the spatial extent of relevant conservation units within which one may concentrate conservation efforts in order to optimise the number of species promoted per surface area...|$|R

Clinical features included intravascular haemolysis, respiratory distress with ARDS, hepatic dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis (with myoglobinaemia and myoglobinuria), hypertension and myocardial damage (perhaps explained by release of endogenous catecholamines by venom phospholipase A 2 and mellitin), shock, coma, acute renal failure and bleeding. Laboratory findings included gross neutrophil leucocytosis, elevated serum enzymes [AST, ALT, LDH, CPK (predominantly CPK-MM) ] and creatinine. Clotting times were slightly prolonged.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{the spread of the}} ectoparasitic mite Varroa {{destructor}} has become the most serious threat to worldwide apiculture. In the model presented here we extend the bee population dynamics with mite viral epidemiology examined in an earlier paper by allowing a bee-dependent mite population size. The results of the analysis match field observations well and give a clear explanation of how Varroa affects the epidemiology of certain naturally occurring bee viruses, causing considerable damages to colonies. The model allows only four possible stable equilibria, using known field parameters. The first one contains only the thriving healthy bees. Here the disease is eradicated and also the mites are wiped out. Alternatively, we find the equilibrium still with no mite population, but with endemic disease among the thriving bee population. Thirdly, infected bees coexist with the mites in the Varroa invasion scenario; in this situation the disease invades the hive, driving the healthy bees to extinction and therefore affecting all the bees. Coexistence is also possible, with both populations of bees and mites thriving and with the disease endemically affecting both species. The analysis is in line with field observations in natural honey bee colonies. Namely, these diseases are endemic and if the mite population is present, necessarily the viral infection occurs. Further, in agreement {{with the fact that the}} presence of Varroa increments the viral transmission, the <b>whole</b> <b>bee</b> population may become infected when the disease vector is present in the beehive. Also, a low horizontal transmission rate of the virus among the honey bees will help in protecting the bee colonies from Varroa infestation and viral epidemics...|$|R

In addition the PLA- and peptide-induced secretion of type 2 (IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13), as well as type 1 (IL- 2 and IFN-gamma) cytokines were abolished, whereas tetanus toxoid-induced cytokine production and proliferation remained unchanged. By culturing PBMC with Ag {{in the presence of}} IL- 2 or IL- 15 the specifically tolerized T cell response could be restored with respect to specific proliferation and secretion of the type 1 T cell cytokines, IL- 2 and IFN-gamma.

In spite of the allergen-specific tolerance in T cells, in vitro produced anti-PLA IgE and IgG 4 Ab and their corresponding serum levels slightly increased during immunotherapy, while the PLA-specific IgE/IgG 4 ratio changed in favor of IgG 4. These findings indicate that bee venom immunotherapy induces a state of peripheral tolerance in allergen-specific T cells, but not in specific B cells. The state of T cell tolerance and cytokine pattern can be in vitro modulated by the cytokines IL- 2, IL- 4, and IL- 15, suggesting the importance of microenvironmental cytokines leading to success or failure in immunotherapy...|$|R

The protective effect of all inhibitors depends on whether they {{have been added to the}} media before or after the cells. When added before the cells they reduced significantly the rate of peptide-induced haemolysis and shape transformation. The effect was maximal when agents acted simultaneously after introduction of the cells into the media containing both inhibitors and peptides. Incubation of the cells in isotonic solution before the addition of peptides enhanced 2 - 3 -fold the RBC susceptibility (i. e. rate of haemolysis) to lytic action of the same amount of peptides, and increased the order of the haemolytic reaction, although the power law coefficient did not exceed a value of 2 for all peptides, suggesting that haemolysis is attributable to the monomeric or dimeric forms of the peptides. Partition coefficients were of the order of approximately 10 (6) M- 1, and P 14 A possessed a value 3 -fold larger compared with melittin and bee venom, which correlated with its enhanced haemolytic activity. The protective action of inhibitors against peptide-induced haemolysis has been explained on the basis of their ability to compete with peptide binding at an early stage of peptide-membrane interaction, and not as a result of inhibition of a pre-existing peptide-induced pore. Whereas melittin increased the volume of RBC during haemolysis, P 14 A, melittin in the presence of phospholipase A 2 or bee venom, reduced the volume in a concentration-dependent manner. The present data reveal the significant role of the initial stage of peptide-membrane interaction and peptide structure in the mechanism of haemolysis. These data are not consistent with a lipid-based mechanism of peptide-induced haemolysis, indicating that the mode of peptide-protein interaction is an important and decisive step in the haemolytic mechanism. It should be noted that data (in the form of three additional Tables) on the ability of inhibitors to protect cells from haemolysis when inhibitor and peptide act simultaneously are available.

Honey bees are arguably the world's most iconic pollinator. The presence of honey bees in our landscapes has long invoked images of vitality, diligence, and cooperation. Unfortunately, {{the current state}} of honey bee health and productivity paints a rather different picture for this beneficial insect. The survival of honey bees, as well as the livelihoods of those who benefit from their labor (e. g., beekeepers, growers, and ranchers) is under threat from the culmination of a number of detractors to bee health. Exposure to pesticides, poor forage, mite parasites, and pathogens has resulted in heavy annual death of honey bee colonies in the U. S., Europe, {{and other parts of the}} world. Among the suspects thought to contribute to bee decline, the fungal pathogen, Nosema ceranae, is found at high prevalence in both healthy and declining/dead colonies. Since N. ceranae is thought to be a novel pathogen of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, much remains unknown about its pathology at the individual and colony levels, as well as how infection may interact to form synergisms with other factors thought to be responsible for declining honey bee populations. Here, I review the breadth of research conducted on Nosema infection of honey bees in general. I give particular attention to observations on the detection of infection, cytopathology, viability and infectivity of spores, and incidence and geographic distribution. I rely on what is known about a similar and long-recognized pathogen of A. mellifera, N. apis, for context on the host-parasite relationship of Nosema infection of honey bees. As one part of my dissertation research, I applied background information about the effects of infection on the different castes to show how this may disrupt the social structure of a honey bee colony and contribute to its decline. The level of a honey bee colony or even a <b>whole</b> <b>bee</b> are complicated systems to study intracellular microbes such as Nosema that threaten honey bee health and productivity. Continuous cell lines have been lacking to further our understanding of the pathogenicity of Nosema infection in a simplified environment removed from the confounding effects of other factors such as poor nutrition or pesticides. For the second part of my dissertation research, I addressed this deficiency in honey bee research by developing an in vitro system derived from host cells that could be utilized for observing infection in a simplified environment. Whenever possible, I provide suggestions for future research that could broaden our understanding of this pathogen and ultimately improve honey bee health...|$|R

Whether bees are {{susceptible}} of feeling and capable of thought is a question which cannot be dogmatically answered. As a pious opinion, I am disposed to deny them more than the merest rudiments of consciousness.* But it is curious to reflect that a thoughtful drone (workers and queens would have no leisure for speculation) with a turn for ethical philosophy, must needs profess himself an intuitive moralist of the purest water. He would point out, with perfect justice, that the devotion of the workers to a life of ceaseless toil for a mere subsistence wage, cannot be accounted for either by enlightened selfishness, or by any other sort of utilitarian motives; since these bees begin to work, without experience or reflection, as they emerge from the cell in which they are hatched. Plainly, an eternal and immutable principle, innate in each bee, can alone account for the phenomena. On the other hand, the biologist, who traces out all the extant stages of gradation between solitary and hive bees, as clearly sees in the latter, simply the perfection of an automatic mechanism, hammered out by the blows of the struggle for existence upon the progeny of the former, during long ages of constant variation.|$|R
40|$|In {{recognizing}} a pattern, honeybees, Apis mellifera, may focus {{either on}} its ventral frontal part, {{or on the}} whole frontal image. We asked whether the conditioning procedure used to train the bees to a pattern determines the recognition strategy employed. Bees were trained with the same patterns presented vertically on the back walls of a Y maze. Conditioning was either absolute, that is, bees should learn to choose a rewarded pattern {{when there is no}} alternative, or differential, that is, bees should learn to choose a rewarded pattern that is paired with a different, nonrewarded one. Bees used different pattern recognition strategies depending on the conditioning procedure: absolute conditioning restricted recognition to the lower half whilst differential conditioning extended it to the <b>whole</b> pattern. <b>Bees</b> trained with absolute conditioning saw and learned the features of {{the upper part of the}} trained patterns, but assigned more weight to the lower part. Bees trained with differential conditioning learned not only the features of the reinforced stimulus in an excitatory way, but also those of the nonreinforced one in an inhibitory way. Thus, conditioning tasks that involve not only excitatory acquisition of the conditioned stimulus per se, but also discrimination of nonreinforced stimuli, result in an increase in the visual field assigned to the recognition task. Conditioning tasks that involve only excitatory acquisition of the rewarded stimulus result in a higher weighting of the lower pattern half and thus in a more reduced field assigned to the recognition task. This difference may reflect;that existing between a conditioned and an incidental behavioural modificatio...|$|R

In {{this second}} paper, data on {{systematic}} entities of the Apidae family (sensu PAGLIANO, 1995) are presented; {{many hundreds of}} specimens collected by the Authors or conserved in University and Museum collections were studied. For some species, in particular belonging to the genus Bombus LATREILLE, regularly collected for several years in the same places, the flowering plants visited are also reported. In the <b>whole,</b> 48 <b>bee</b> species or subspecies of the genera Xylocopa LATREILLE (3), Ceratina LATREILLE (6), Bombus LATREILLE (29), Psithyrus LEPELETIER (9) and Apis LINNAEUS (1) were examined. The species Bombus gerstaeckeri MORAWITZ, B. jonellus martes GERSTAECKER and Psithyrus quadricolor meridionalis RICHARDS are recorded {{for the first time}} to the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. Bombus distinguendus MORAWITZ and B. pomorum PANZER - correctly unmentioned in the Checklist of the species of the Italian fauna - were collected in surrounding areas (Istria) of Friuli Venezia Giulia. Other four species, including in the genera Ceratina, Bombus and Psithyrus, mentioned in the literature but not found by the Authors in the examined collections, are separately mentioned. Some modifications to the Checklist of the species of the Italian fauna are also proposed. By the evaluation of several data on the flowering plants visited by wild bees, it is possible to point out that almost all the species including in the genus Bombus are polilectic, favoring the pollination not only of cultivated plants but also of spontaneous ones, included those of natural interest. Only B. gerstaeckeri, among the considered Apidae, seems to be a oligoleptic species, specialized on Aconitum spp. (Ranunculaceae) ...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} {{results of a}} three-year study to {{determine}} the fate of imidacloprid residues in hive matrices and to assess chronic sublethal effects on <b>whole</b> honey <b>bee</b> colonies fed supplemental pollen diet containing imidacloprid at 5, 20 and 100 μg/kg over multiple brood cycles. Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 μg/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 μg/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85. 7, 72. 4, 61. 2 and 59. 2 % in the control, 5, 20 and 100 μg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 μg/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 μg/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 μg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines...|$|R
5000|$|The {{combat in}} the [...] "Battle" [...] is {{interrupted}} by the interpolated allegory of the spider and the bee. A spider, [...] "swollen {{up to the first}} Magnitude, by the Destruction of infinite Numbers of Flies" [...] resides like a castle holder above a top shelf, and a bee, flying from the natural world and drawn by curiosity, wrecks the spider's web. The spider curses the bee for clumsiness and for wrecking the work of one who is his better. The spider says that his web is his home, a stately manor, while the bee is a vagrant who goes anywhere in nature without any concern for reputation. The bee answers that he is doing the bidding of nature, aiding in the fields, while the spider's castle is merely what was drawn from its own body, which has [...] "a good plentiful Store of Dirt and Poison." [...] This allegory was already somewhat old before Swift employed it, and it is a digression within the Battle proper. However, it also illustrates the theme of the <b>whole</b> work. The <b>bee</b> is like the ancients and like authors: it gathers its materials from nature and sings its drone song in the fields. The spider is like the moderns and like critics: it kills the weak and then spins its web (books of criticism) from the taint of its own body digesting the viscera.|$|R

The old hands took very little; {{they knew what they}} were about. The fresh ones from Narvaez's army loaded {{themselves}} with gold and jewels, and had to pay dear for them. Cortez, I ought to tell you, took good care of Dona Marina. He sent her forward under a strong guard of Tlascalans, with all the other women. The great street was crossed by many canals. Then the causeway across the lake, two miles long, was crossed by more canals, and at every one of these the Indians had taken away the bridges. Cortez knew that, and had made a movable bridge; but he had only time to make one, and that of course had to be taken up at the rear, and carried forward to the front every time they crossed a dyke; and that made endless delay. As long as they were in the city, however, all went well; but the moment they came out upon the lake causeway, out thundered the serpent-skin drums from the top of every temple, the conch shells blew, and out swarmed the <b>whole</b> hive of <b>bees,</b> against the one brave wasp who was struggling. The Spaniards cleared the dyke by cavalry and artillery, and got to the first canal, laid down the bridge, and over slowly but safely, amid a storm of stones and arrows. They got to the second canal, fifteen or twenty feet broad. Why, in God's name, was not the bridge brought on? Instead of the bridge came news from the rear. The weight of the artillery had been too great for the bridge, and it was jammed fast. And there they were on a narrow dyke fifty feet broad, in the midst of the lake, in the dark midnight, with countless thousands of Indians, around, before, behind, and the lord have mercy on them! ...|$|R
40|$|The Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, is an {{economically}} important insect, {{responsible for a}} large portion of global pollination services. They live in densely populated colonies, which give the optimum chance for opportunistic pathogens and parasites to spread. Honeybees, like all organisms, are subject {{to a wide range of}} threats, from viruses to parasites. The immune response of A. mellifera to these threats relies on a fast acting non-adaptive immunity, with effectors such as cellular defences and the release of antimicrobial peptides. The defence against invading pathogens and parasites is important not only for the individual bee, but for the colony as a <b>whole.</b> Many <b>bee</b> diseases have been shown as capable of causing collapse of honeybee colonies. The first section of this thesis examines the occurrence and prevalence of four honeybee viruses (Deformed wing virus, Chronic bee paralysis virus, Acute bee paralysis virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus), the microsporidian parasite Nosema, and the parasitic tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi. The results from all seasons indicated a very low prevalence of the tracheal mite, with only 2 % of the colonies testing postive in the Spring sampling, with none positive in the Summer or Autumn samples. Deformed wing virus was detected at very high levels throughout the year, with Israeli acute paralysis virus detected in the Autumn round of sampling in 3 % of the tested colonies. The other two viruses were not detected. Levels of Nosema were also high throughout the year, at 18 %, 6 % and 12 % of the colonies testing positive in the Spring, Summer and Autumn respectively. The results indicated no obvious disease variations present in the colonies tested from apiaries that lost more than 20 % of their hives during the Winter post sampling than those that had lost less than 20 %. The next section was to examine the mechanisms by which one of the most serious threats to the honeybee, the parasitic mite V. destructor, has developed resistance to pyrethroid chemicals. Varroa are thought to have a negative impact in the overall health and vitality of the bee, transmitting viruses through haemolymph feeding and possibly weakening the immune response of the bee. Proteomic analysis was used to compare the proteomic profile of sensitive and resistant mites, in order to observe any variations that may be conferring the resistant phenotype. The comparison showed that a number of proteins were detected at higher levels of abundance in the resistant mites, such as heat shock proteins and detoxifying enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenase. A number of proteins present at lower levels include cuticle proteins involved in cuticle structure. The altered levels of these proteins in the resistant Varroa could be conferring resistance through decreased penetration and increased metabolism of the pyrethroid. In the final section, the full effect that parasitization by Varroa has on the bee was examined. Parasitized Winter bees were compared to unparasitized and the proteomic profiles were analysed for changes. Hexmerin was present at lower levels in the bees that were parasitized, as was enolase-like protein. The decreased level of these proteins indicates Varroa parasitisation could lead to insufficient energy metabolism. Drone pupae that were parasitized by Varroa were compared to unparasitized drones using proteomic analysis. Cuticle proteins decreased in abundance which could indicate a compromised healing response following parasitization. A number of proteins involved in energy and nutrition such as hexamerin were also present at lower levels of abundance in the parasitized drone pupae. Similar proteins decreased in abundance in parasitized workers. Cuticle structure proteins were present at lower levels of abundance, with proteins involved in the stress response present at higher levels in the parasitized workers. Quantitative PCR analysis of parasitized drone and worker pupae indicated a reduced level of two immune genes – Abaecin and Defensin, with two other immune related genes increased in expression: Phenoloxidase and Hymenoptaecin. Changes in the expression of immune related genes following parasitization indicates that Varroa are affecting how the immune reposnse functions. To idenitify whether or not this change in the immune reponse was caused by salivary effectors secreted by the mite during feeding, the haemolymph from parasitized pupae was compared using label free proteomics to haemolymph from unparasitized pupae. A number of proteins were found exclusive to the parasitized haemolymph, including a mettalloendopeptidase which is found in other blood feeding insects and could be functioning in the digestion of haemolymph. Sox 14, a regulator of transcription, was also exclusively present in the parasitized haemolymph. The work presented throughout this thesis offers a comprehensive analysis of the diseases found in honeybee colonies, the effect that parasitization by Varroa has on adult and developing pupae, and analysis of the pyrethoid resistant phenotype. The results offer an explanation as to why Varroa are considered one of the most serious honeybee threats, and highlights the importance of controlling infestation levels in colonies...|$|R
