5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior <b>gripping</b> <b>surface</b> when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
500|$|Classic skis: Designed for {{skiing in}} tracks. For adult skiers (between 155cm/50kg and 185cm/75kg), {{recommended}} lengths are between 180 and 210 centimetres (approximately 115% of the skier's height). Traction {{comes from a}} [...] "grip zone" [...] underfoot that when bearing the skier's weight engages either a textured <b>gripping</b> <b>surface</b> or a grip wax.

40|$|Abstract The {{adaptation}} of the grip forces to the fric-tional condition between the digits and an object relies on feedforward sensorimotor mechanisms that use tactile afferent input to intermittently update a sensorimotor memory that controls the force coordination, i. e., the ra-tio between grip force (normal to the <b>grip</b> <b>surface)</b> and load force (tangential to the <b>grip</b> <b>surface).</b> The present study addressed {{the development of these}} mechanisms. Eighty-nine children and 15 adults lifted an instrumented object with exchangeable <b>grip</b> <b>surfaces</b> measuring the <b>grip</b> and load forces. Particularly in trials with high fric-tion (sandpaper), the youngest children used a high grip force to load force ratio. Although this large safety mar-gin against slips indicated an immature capacity to adapt to the frictional condition, higher grip forces were pro...|$|R

40|$|The {{difficulty}} of a climbing hold was attempted to be quantified based on fractal dimensions. The difficulty {{was confined to}} the change of a single value, namely the inclination of the <b>grip</b> <b>surface,</b> by increasing the overhang of the wall. Sixteen climbers of different experience levels participated in this experiment and had to climb a route equipped with an instrumented hold repeatedly until they failed at a specific degree of overhang. The forcetime signals served to calculate the Hausdorff dimension. Subsequently, the Hausdorff dimension was normalised to force and time by a power fit. The normalised Hausdorff dimension increases significantly with the {{difficulty of}} a climbing hold, which is - in this study - the inclination of the <b>grip</b> <b>surface.</b> Weaker climbers produced larger normalised Hausdorff dimensions. If the climber fails at the instrumented hold, the force-time signal shows smaller normalised Hausdorff dimensions.

Unlike the current M240's solution of minimizing the heat transfer, Barrett uses a free floating handguard system, where they bolted the handguard directly to the receiver of the machine gun, instead of to the gas tube assembly. The handguard also has Keymod rail sections at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions, with the side sections being separated from the bottom by a <b>gripping</b> <b>surface</b> for the operator.|$|E
50|$|The body {{is solid}} {{aluminium}} with a textured plastic coating {{made in the}} same form as the live grenade, the textured coating ensuring a good <b>gripping</b> <b>surface.</b> A hole drilled {{up from the bottom}} indicates an empty store as well as ensuring the drill grenade is of the same weight as a live grenade. A bushing on top of the grenade has a dummy fuze mechanism permanently attached with a slot for the pull ring to clip into to prevent it being accidentally pulled. The fuze mechanism, under the plastic cover is very similar in appearance to the American fuze mechanisms. Internally there is an extension on the striker to allow it to be re-cocked during training and there is a leaf spring safety that clips around the safety lever and neck of the grenade preventing the lever from rotating even if the safety pin is pulled.|$|E
