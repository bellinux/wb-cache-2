40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{securitisation}} of an issue can involve not only negative, exclusionary and repressive extraordinary measures but also more positive, inclusionary and productive strategies of engagement. It also argues that such bifurcated strategies of security can evoke a spectrum of responses that sets limits {{on the process of}} securitisation. It examines these two arguments through the lens of the securitisation of <b>development</b> <b>NGOs</b> post- 9 / 11. <b>Development</b> <b>NGOs</b> have become associated as a potential ‘second-order’ security issue related to the macro-securitisation of the War on Terror. After the launch of President Bush's War on Terror, US and allied governments shifted their approach to <b>development</b> <b>NGOs</b> from one of enthusiastically courting them as co-producers of development and security to an approach that cast greater suspicion on their activities. Aware that <b>development</b> <b>NGOs</b> still had a positive role to play in development and security, Western governments adopted a bifurcated strategy of containment and engagement towards <b>development</b> <b>NGOs.</b> State attempts to restrict <b>development</b> <b>NGOs</b> have evoked a spectrum of responses, ranging from ready compliance to outright resistance that has led to only partial success in securitising <b>development</b> <b>NGOs...</b>|$|R

We draw upon a literature review and case studies of two Northern <b>development</b> <b>NGOs</b> and their Southern counterparts in Ghana, India and Nicaragua. Our findings show that managerialist ideas and practices clash with a number of values, views and goals that "traditionally" have been widely shared in the private aid channel. To ensure that their actual practices remain consistent with their belief systems, Northern <b>development</b> <b>NGOs</b> cannot avoid making tough choices that will have key consequences for their future relevance and identity...|$|R

Assuming an actor oriented approach allows for insights in the multiple directions and dimensions of the concept of NGO legitimacy. The micro-politics of NGO practices stand {{at the base of the}} giving of meaning to symbols relating to legitimacy and the legitimating processes itself. This in turn is shaped by the multiple discourses that the NGO is engaged in, in respect to its different stakeholders. This thesis suggests a framework for analysing legitimacy of small <b>development</b> <b>NGOs,</b> based on the micro-politics and multiple discourses of these NGOs...|$|R
