40|$|In recent years, the {{lifetime}} of an <b>insulated</b> railroad <b>joint</b> in the field has decreased due to increasing wheel loads. The goal {{of this research is}} to investigate possible changes in <b>insulated</b> rail <b>joint</b> design in order to improve the performance of the <b>insulated</b> <b>joint.</b> The finite element program ABAQUS is used to model the supported butt joint. In this model, the rail, joint bars, epoxy, and ties surrounding the joint are modeled using solid elements. The remaining ties are modeled as an elastic foundation. The rail is subjected to a tensile load, as well as a vertical wheel load that is applied to the rail using Hertz contact theory. Parametric studies are performed by varying the tie width, joint bar length, and joint bar dimensions. Two different wheel load locations are also investigated: centered about the end post, and halfway between the tie under the end post and the tie just {{to the left of the}} end post. The vertical displacement of the rail and <b>insulated</b> <b>joint</b> is one measure used to determine the effect of the parameters on the <b>insulated</b> <b>joint.</b> However, since the most common cause of failure in <b>insulated</b> rail <b>joints</b> is the debonding of the epoxy, this research also focuses on the stresses present in the epoxy when the joint is subjected to a static wheel load. The two out-of-plane shear stresses as well as the normal peel stress are used to compare the various designs of th...|$|R

40|$|Bonded (glued) <b>insulated</b> rail <b>joints</b> {{are widely}} used in {{continuously}} welded railroad track. These joints frequently develop problems in which the epoxy debonds from the fishing surfaces of the rail and joint bars, leading to problems such as pull-aparts and electrical failures. <b>Insulated</b> <b>joint</b> problems can be disruptive to railroad operations, and may in some cases {{increase the risk of}} train derailments. This paper describes the results of computer modeling of the effects of epoxy debonding on the stresses and strains in a bonded <b>insulated</b> <b>joint</b> subjected to longitudinal force. The primary goal of this research is to identify measurable changes in the joint’s strain distribution that correlate with the extent of debonding, to serve as the basis of a non-destructive monitoring and evaluation technique. The results of the modeling show that, under thermal tensile loads, strains {{at the center of the}} outer surface of the joint bar tend to increase as debonding begins near the endpost. The strain at this point tends to stabilize after the debonding reaches the innermost bolt hole. Strain at a point between the outermost and middle bolt holes start...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Track {{circuits}} {{are used}} for traffic control on {{a large portion of}} North American mainline track. These require insulated rail joints every several kilometers in order to electrically isolate sections of the rail. Such <b>insulated</b> <b>joints</b> have short service lives compared to other track components, but current methods for monitoring their condition and detecting defects are either too involved for everyday use or insufficiently ac-curate. We are researching a new system based on low-cost smart sensor technology that will enable railroads to monitor the condition of <b>insulated</b> <b>joints,</b> plan for their maintenance or replacement, respond faster to problems, and collect statistical data about their performance. The system uses strain gauges to track the me-chanical characteristics of a joint over time. By understanding how these properties change as the joint de-grades, we can detect and report problems in a timely manner...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{were carried}} out to evaluate the performance of <b>insulating</b> <b>joints</b> in railway tracks. Although <b>insulating</b> <b>joints</b> are considered weak spots on the track due to the imposed rail discontinuity, they are nevertheless essential to monitor and control train traffic. All simulations presented were conducted using the commercial FE code Abaqus. Results were extracted, processed and plotted {{with the help of}} the programming languages Python and Matlab. No dynamic effects were included in the simulations. This study consists of three major parts: The first part was to compare hyper-elastic Neo-hookean and linear elastic material models for the insulating layer in the joint. The simulations showed that there was no significant difference in stresses or displacements between the two models. Investigating the effects of increasing the stiffness of the insulating material was performed in the second part. The investigation showed that increased stiffness decreases the plastic deformation in the steel. However when increasing the stiffness the interfacial shear stress increases. This will promote failure of the glue that ties insulation and rail together. The effect of having an inclined <b>insulating</b> <b>joint</b> was analyzed. Four different inclination angles θ, were tested ranging from 0 ◦ (no inclination) to 60 ◦. By increasing the angle the plastic deformation in the steel on both sides of the insulating layer increased under pure rolling conditions. Inclination did not seem to cause any significant changes in interfacial shear stresses. Finally a comparison was made of the vertical displacement of the wheel cen- ter between the quasi-static ABAQUS simulations and approximations derived from Newtonian physics. These approximations indicate that the time that it takes for the wheel to travel over the gap is not sufficient to allow for the wheel displacements predicted by the quasi-static simulations when traveling on a speed exceeding roughly 85 km/h...|$|R

40|$|Progressive epoxy {{debonding}} is {{a common}} factor in many failures of bonded, <b>insulated</b> <b>joints</b> (IJ) in heavy-axle-load railroad service. This paper describes a study in which <b>insulated</b> <b>joints</b> with different amounts of debonding were visually inspected and measured and then disassembled. The shape and area of the debonded region for each insulated joint was quantified and variability between joints recorded. Due to some degree of ambiguity in the visual appearance of the interior surfaces, two different criteria for identifying {{the boundaries of the}} debonded region are described and applied. Debonding usually extends farther along the upper and lower portions of the rail / joint-bar interface, resulting in a “V”- or “U”-shaped debonded region. Additionally, debonding tends to be more extensive {{on one end of the}} joint than the other, although it appears that debonding is generally about equal on the field and gage sides. The total debonded area was compared to several linear measurements of damage to the externally visible top edge of the epoxy / insulator layer – the part that is available for inspection in an in-service insulated joint. There is a strong correlation between the total debonded area in the joint and the total extent of damaged (missing or loose) top insulator edge. The debonde...|$|E

This paper presents a framework, fault maintenance trees (FMTs), integrating maintenance into the industry-standard formalism of fault trees. By translating FMTs to priced timed automata and applying statistical model checking, we can obtain system dependability metrics such as system reliability and mean time to failure, as well as costs of maintenance and failures over time, for different maintenance policies. Our framework is flexible and can be extended to include effects specific to the system being analysed.

40|$|Joints in {{railway track}} are {{vulnerable}} to failure, so most modern rail is welded. However, many signalling systems rely on sections of rail being electrically isolated from adjacent sections so <b>insulated</b> <b>joints</b> are necessary. At these joints several millimetres of insulation material, an “end post”, separates {{the ends of the}} rails. To support the rail two pieces of steel (known as fish-plates) are bolted {{on either side of the}} rail web. All steel components are separated from each other by insulation material. Conventional designs of rail joints are known to suffer from a range of failure modes: bolt failures, rail breaks, fish-plate failure, insulation degradation, and lipping (in which plastic flow in the rail ends bridges the gap between the rail ends). To assist in developing improved designs accelerated test procedures and sophisticated finite element models have been developed; this paper describes both.

40|$|<b>Insulated</b> rail <b>joints</b> are {{designed}} {{in a similar}} way to butt jointed steel structural systems, the difference being a purpose made gap between the main rail members to maintain electrical insulation for the proper functioning of the track circuitry at all times of train operation. When loaded wheels pass the gap, they induce an impact loading with the corresponding strains in the railhead edges exceeding the plastic limit significantly, which lead to metal flow across the gap thereby increasing the risk of short circuiting and impeding the proper functioning of the signalling and broken rail identification circuitries, of which the joints are a critical part. The performance of <b>insulated</b> rail <b>joints</b> under the passage of the wheel loading is complex due to the presence of a number of interacting components and hence is not well understood. This paper presents a dynamic wheel-rail contact-impact modelling method for the determination of the impact loading; a brief description of a field experiment to capture strain signatures for validating the predicted impact loading is also presented.

40|$|Degradation {{and failure}} of <b>insulated</b> <b>joints</b> (IJ’s) {{is a major}} {{railroad}} maintenance problem today. Current techniques for monitoring IJ condition and detecting defects are either too labor-intensive for everyday use or too inaccurate for efficient planning of IJ replacement. While it is nontrivial to directly measure the extent of problems such as epoxy debonding or loss of resistance, such degradation also causes other, more measurable changes in certain properties of the joint. For instance, loss of epoxy bonding near the endpost changes the strain distribution within the joint bars. This paper describes several ways in which simple measurements of such properties can be correlated with common joint problems. The emphasis is on properties that can be measured using inexpensive, fully automatic monitoring systems. The potential application of “smart sensors ” (wireless, self-contained, auto-networking measurement devices) and other technology is discussed. Computer modeling and laboratory testing have confirmed that the strain response of an IJ changes as the epoxy layer debonds from the metal surfaces. Field testing will be conducted to verify that these changes can be reliably detected and distinguished from the normal variation experienced by a healthy joint. Tests to date also suggest that simple voltage measurements, collected automatically and without interference to track circuit operation, could give an indication of intermittent failure in the joint’s insulating capability. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Adhesively bonded {{insulated}} rail joints {{are used to}} electrically isolate sections of track into discrete blocks to detect the positions of trains, and are sometimes useful in detecting rail breaks. Recent advances in high-strength rails allow {{for the use of}} higher-weight cars. With this increased axle loading of the freight lines, bonded rail joints are encountering early breakdown through either electrical or mechanical failure. Service lives as short as 12 – 18 months have been reported on some rail lines, significantly lower than the lifetime of other railway components. The cost of replacing the joints has significantly increased the desire for a joint with improved durability. Commercially available bonded rail joints are typically double butt-strap joints consisting of two steel reinforcing joint bars, bonded to the rails with an epoxy adhesive that may contain a fibreglass or aramid cloth layer. This paper investigates a tapered bonded joint that was proposed to reduce the high stresses that can result in the more typical butt-strap joint configuration. The first type of analysis models the rails and joint bars as beams, and the adhesive and ground as distributed elastic springs. Approximate solutions are obtained {{with the use of the}} Rayleigh–Ritz method. The finite-element method is used in the second type of analysis. Deflections, bending moments, andstresses areobtained. Basedon theseanalyses, tapered <b>insulated</b> <b>joints</b> shouldpro-vide some advantages over conventional {{insulated rail}} joints, such as lower deflections, bending moments, and shear stresses in the adhesive...|$|E
