40|$|Although {{weather is}} a {{significant}} determinant of agriculture production, {{it is not a}} common practice in production analysis to investigate on its direct impact on the level of final production. We assume that the problem is methodological, since it is difficult to find a proper proxy variable for weather in these models. Thus, in the common production models, the weather is often included into a set of unmeasured determinants that affects the level of final production and farmers productivity (statistical noise, random error). The aim of this dissertation is to solve this methodological issues and find the way to define weather and its impacts in a form of proxy variable, to include this variable into proper econometric model and to apply the model. The purpose of this dissertation is to get beyond the empirical knowledge and define econometric model that would quantify weather impacts as a part of mutually (un) conditioned factors of final production, to specify the model and apply it. The dissertation {{is based on the assumption}} that the method of stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) represents a potential opportunity to treat the weather as a specific (though not firm-controllable) factor of production and technical efficiency. SFA is parametric method based on econometric approach. Its starting point is the stochastic frontier production function. The method was presented in the work of Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meusen and van den Broeck (1977). Unlike commonly used econometric models, SFA is based on analysis of production frontier that is formed by deterministic production frontier function and the compound error term. The compound error term consists of two parts [...] random error (statistical noise, error term) and technical inefficiency. Technical inefficiency represents the difference in the actual level of production of the producer, and the maximum attainable (possible) level that would be achieved if the producer used a particular combination of production factors in a maximum technically efficient way. Over time, it has been developed on a number of aspects - see time variant and invariant inefficiency, heteroscedasticity, measurement and unmeasured heterogeneity. Along with the DEA, SFA has become the preferred methodology in the area of production frontier and productivity and efficiency analysis in agriculture. Lately, it has been applied for example by Bakusc, Fertő and Fogarasi (2008) Mathijs and Swinnen (2001), Hockmann and Pieniadz (2007), Bokusheva and Kumbhakar (2008) Hockmann et al. (2007), Čechura a Hockmann (2011, 2012), and Čechura et al. (2014 a, b). We assume that the weather impacts should be analysed with regard to technical efficiency, rather than as a part of statistical noise. Implementation of weather in part of deterministic production function rather than in the statistical noise {{is a significant}} change in the methodical approach within the stochastic frontier analysis. Analysis of the weather impacts on the changes in the level of TE has not been greatly recorded in the associated literature and is, therefore, considered as the main contribution of this work for the current theory of production frontier estimation, or the technological effectiveness, in the field of agriculture. Taking into account other variables that are important for the relationship and whose inclusion would enhance the explanatory power of the model was part of the objective of this work. Thus, the possible effect of heterogeneity was taken into account when models were formulated and final results discussed. The paper first defined and discussed possible ways how to incorporate the effects of the weather into production frontier model. Assessing the possibility of inclusion of weather in these models was based on the theoretical framework for the development of stochastic frontier analysis, which defines the concept of technical efficiency, distance functions theory, stochastic production function theory and the methodology and techniques that are applied within the framework of SFA, which were relevant for the purpose of this work. Then, the weather impacts on the shape and shift of production frontier and technical efficiency of czech cereal production in the years 2004 - 2011 was analyzed. The analysis was based on the assumption that there are two ways how to define variables representing weather in these models. One way is to use specific climatic data, which directly describe the state of the weather. For the purpose of this thesis, the variables mean air temperature (AVTit) and sum of precipitation (SUMPit) in the period between planting and harvest of cereals in the individual regions of Czech republic (NUTS 3) were selected. Variables were calculated from the data on monthly mean air temperatures and monthly sums of precipitation on the regional levels provided by Czech hydro-meteorological institute CHMI. Another way to define weather variable is to use a proxy variable. In this dissertation, the calculation of climatic index (KITit) was applied. Climatic index was calculated as a sum of ratios between the actual yield levels and approximated yield levels of wheat, barley and rye, weighted by the importance of each plant in a cereal production protfolio in each region of the Czech republic. Yield levels were approximated by the linear trend functions, yield and weights were calculated with the use of data on regional production and sown area under individual grains by year at the level of regional production (NUTS 3) provided by Czech Statistical Office. Both ways of weather definition are associated with some advantages and disadvantages. Particular climatic data are very precise specificatopn of the actual weather conditions, however, to capture their impacts on the level of final production, they must be implemented into model correctly along with the number of other factors, which have an impact on the level of final production. Climatic index, on the other hand, relates the weather impacts directly to the yield levels (it has been based on the assumption that the violation from yield trends are caused by the weather impacts), though, it does not accomodate the concrete weather characteristics. The analysis was applied on unbalanced panel data consisting of the information on the individual production of 803 producers specialized on cereal production, which have each the observations from at least two years out of total 8 -years time serie. Specialization on crop production was defined as minimum 50 % share of cereal production on the total plant production. Final panel consists of 2332 observations in total. The values of AVTit, SUMPit a KITit has been associated with each individual producer according to his local jurisdiction for a particular region. Weather impacts in the three specified forms were implemented into models that were defined as stochastic production frontier models that capture the possible heterogeneity effects. The aim is to identify the impact of weather on shift and shape of production frontier. Through the defined models, the production technology and technical efficiency were estimated. We assume that the proposed inclusion in weather impacts will lead to a better explanatory power of defined models, as a result of weather extraction from a random components of the model, or from a set of unmeasured factors causing heterogeneity of the sample, respectivelly. Two types of models were applied to estimate TE - Fixed management model (FMM) and Random parameter model (RPM). Models were defined as translogarithmic multiple-output distance function. The analyzed endogene variable is cereal production (expressed <b>in</b> <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR).</b> Other two outputs, other plant production and animal production (both expressed <b>in</b> <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR)</b> are expressed as the share on cereal production and they appear on the right side of the equation together with the exogene variables representing production factors labour (in AWU), total utilized land (in acres), capital (sum of contract work, especially machinery work, and depreciation, expressed <b>in</b> <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR),</b> specific material (represented by the costs of seeds, plants, fertilisers and crop protection, expressed <b>in</b> <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR),</b> and other material (<b>in</b> <b>thousands</b> of <b>EUR).</b> The values of all three outputs, capital, and material inputs were deflated by the the country price indexes taken from the EUROSTAT database (2005 = 100). In Random parameter model, heterogeneity is captured in random parameters and in the determinants of distribution of the technical inefficiency, uit. All production factors were defined as a random parameters and weather in form of KITit enters the mean of uit and so it represents the possible source of unmeasured heterogeneity of a sample. In fixed management model, heterogeneity is defined as a special factor representing firm specific effects, mi. This factor represents unmeasured sources of heterogeneity of sample and enters the model in interaction with other production factors and the with the trend variable, tit. Trend variable represents the impact of technological change at a time t for each producer i. The weather impacts in form of variables AVTit a SUMPit is, together with production factors, excluded from the set of firm specific effects and it is also numerically expressed. That way weather becomes a measured source of heterogeneity of a sample. Both types of models were estimated also without the weather impacts specification in order to obtain the benchmark against which the effects of weather impacts specification on production frontier and technical efficiency is evaluated. Easier interpretation of results was achieved by naming all five estimated models as follows: FMM is a name of fixed management model that does not include specified weather variables, AVT is a name for fixed management model including weather impacts in form of average temperatures AVTit, SUMP is name of|$|R
