5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions <b>in</b> <b>Man</b> and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We studied first {{admission}} {{rates for}} major mental illness {{in order to}} explore links {{with an increase in}} psychiatric morbidity and mortality <b>in</b> <b>men.</b> Method: Patient discharge data from Scottish Mental Health Units during 1980 – 1995 were analysed.

In 1228, Olaf battled Raghnall at Tynwald and the latter was slain. On 21 May 1237, Olaf died on St Patrick's Isle, and was succeeded by his three sons who all ruled the kingdom in turn: Harald (reigned 1237–48), Ragnvald (1249), and Magnus (1252–65). Magnus Olafsson was the last of the Norse kings to rule Mann, which was absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland on his death.|$|E

5|$|Puzzled by the {{geographical}} distribution of wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions <b>in</b> <b>Man</b> and Animals (1872).

5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will <b>in</b> <b>Man</b> were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
40|$|Osteoporosis remains underrecognized and undertreated {{but more}} so <b>in</b> <b>men,</b> adding {{considerably}} to fracture burden and costs.

IntroductionAwareness {{of osteoporosis}} <b>in</b> <b>men</b> is improving, although it remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. A European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) workshop was convened to discuss osteoporosis <b>in</b> <b>men</b> {{and to provide a}} report by a panel of experts (the authors). MethodsA debate with an expert panel on preselected topics was conducted. Results and conclusionsAlthough additional fracture data are needed to endorse the clinical care of osteoporosis <b>in</b> <b>men,</b> consensus views were reached on diagnostic criteria and intervention thresholds. Empirical data <b>in</b> <b>men</b> display similarities with data acquired in women, despite pathophysiological differences, which may not be clinically relevant. Men should receive treatment at a similar 10 -year fracture probability as in women. The design of mixed studies may reduce the lag between comparable treatments for osteoporosis in women becoming available <b>in</b> <b>men...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain <b>in</b> <b>man,</b> and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to find an}} {{academic}} job in Australia, Childe remained in Britain, renting a room in Bloomsbury, Central London, and spending much time studying at the British Museum and the Royal Anthropological Institute library. An {{active member of the}} London socialist movement, he associated with leftists at the 1917 Club in Gerrard Street, Soho, and befriended members of the Marxist Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), contributing to their publication, Labour Monthly; however he had not yet openly embraced Marxism. Having earned a reputation as an excellent prehistorian, he was invited to other parts of Europe in order to study prehistoric artefacts. In 1922 he travelled to Vienna, Austria to examine unpublished material about the painted Neolithic pottery from Schipenitz, Bukovina held in the Prehistoric Department of the Natural History Museum; he published his findings in the 1923 Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Childe used this excursion to visit a number of museums in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, bringing them to the attention of British archaeologists in a 1922 article published <b>in</b> <b>Man.</b> Returning to London, in 1922 Childe became a private secretary for three Members of Parliament, including John Hope Simpson and Frank Gray, both members of the centre-left Liberal Party.
