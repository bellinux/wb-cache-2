60|$|When {{first the}} virgin soils of America came into bearing, the {{proportions}} {{of the population of}} those continents themselves, and consequently of their own local requirements, to those of Europe were very small. As lately as 1890 Europe had a population three times that of North and South America added together. But by 1914 the domestic requirements of the United States for wheat were approaching their production, and the date was evidently near when there would be an <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus</b> only in years of exceptionally favorable harvest. Indeed, the present domestic requirements of the United States are estimated at more than ninety per cent of the average yield of the five years 1909-1913.[5] At that time, however, the tendency towards stringency was showing itself, not so much in a lack of abundance as in a steady increase of real cost. That is to say, taking the world as a whole, there was no deficiency of wheat, but in order to call forth an adequate supply it was necessary to offer a higher real price.

40|$|Abstract: Although the Tiwanaku state (500 AD- 1000 AD) {{is often}} said to have planted colonies in the coastal valleys of {{southern}} Peru and northern Chile, recent systematic survey and excavation in three potential colony sites finds no evidence of Tiwanaku state colonies in the coastal Osmore valley, not even at Loreto Viejo, a frequently cited "colony". Instead, immigrants from the Tiwanaku settlements in the middle Osmore valley moved to the coast as or after Tiwanaku collapsed. Radiocarbon dates, site descriptions, and excavated material support a preliminary reconstruction of the repercussions that Tiwanaku's collapse had on the southern Peruvian coast. In 1985, Elias Mujica confidently wrote that " [...] . it is accepted that Tiwanaku access in coastal valleys was by colonies", citing six respected scholars to support his point. These coastal colonies were presumably established to produce <b>exportable</b> <b>surpluses</b> of coastal crops and marine products for exchange with the highland core of the Tiwanaku state.

Useful tools in this regard, the Gini-coefficient, used to examine the degree of concentration for fish exports, and the intra-industrial trade coefficient (IIT), and used to examine the balance of international fish trade by South Africa. The Gini-coefficient for fish exports shows that fish export by South Africa is highly concentrated. The trend in concentration appears to have remained constant, and therefore the South African fisheries industry may boast a competitive advantage. However, cognisance should be taken of the fact that such a high level of concentration may render the South African fisheries industry vulnerable to exogenous changes. The IIT analysis shows that, after 1985, the fisheries industry underwent substantial changes in that it has increased <b>exportable</b> <b>surpluses,</b> probably as a result of increased specialization and competitiveness. The analysis conducted does not pertinently explain the factors that sustain the levels of concentration, nor does it highlight specific factors that may underpin the competitiveness of the industry, and hence further analysis in this regard is necessary.

40|$|Consuming foods rich in {{anthocyanins}} like blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), {{can help}} prevent various diseases due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity. Being a perishable fruit and no significant <b>exportable</b> <b>surpluses,</b> an alternative use and consumption would be by making wine. However, low sugar content can limit vinification, having to supplement it with exogenous sugars, known as chaptalization procedure, which also can improve the extraction of anthocyanins due to its high solubility in ethanol.

40|$|Free trade {{benefits}} are not well-harnessed despite the WTO {{because of the}} regional groupings. Such groupings have, in fact, resulted in a chaos. Pakistan {{has been a member}} of the SAARC and the ECO. In both the groups, intra-regional trade accounts for only four percent of total trade. The present study briefly reviews and identifies constraints to intra-regional trade and other modes of economic cooperation in the region. The SAFTA agreement and the possibilities of greater economic cooperation are also examined. Comparative advantage and low trade complementarity are found to be the main impediments to trade. Other obstacles such as limited capacity to generate <b>exportable</b> <b>surpluses,</b> restrictive trade policies, and political problems have also inhibited the growth of intra-regional trade. Higher trade levels can be achieved through intra-industry trade, vertical specialisation, joint export marketing of competing regional export products, deepening trade liberalisation, promoting monetary cooperation, and encouraging joint industrial ventures. It is imperative for the success of SAFTA that the negative list is kept quite small and the countries are prepared for closure of a few industries.

60|$|Such {{definite}} data as {{we possess}} {{do not add}} much, perhaps, to the general picture of decay. But I will remind the reader {{of one or two}} of them. The coal production of Europe as a whole is estimated to have fallen off by 30 per cent; and upon coal the greater part of the industries of Europe and the whole of her transport system depend. Whereas before the war Germany produced 85 per cent of the total food consumed by her inhabitants, the productivity of the soil is now diminished by 40 per cent and the effective quality of the live-stock by 55 per cent.[145] Of the European countries which formerly possessed a large <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus,</b> Russia, as much by reason of deficient transport as of diminished output, may herself starve. Hungary, apart from her other troubles, has been pillaged by the Romanians immediately after harvest. Austria will have consumed the whole of her own harvest for 1919 {{before the end of the}} calendar year. The figures are almost too overwhelming to carry conviction to our minds; if they were not quite so bad, our effective belief in them might be stronger.|$|E
60|$|The most {{elementary}} {{failure in}} Russia is {{in regard to}} food. In a country which formerly produced a vast <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus</b> of cereals and other agricultural produce, and in which the non-agricultural population is only 15 per cent. of the total, {{it ought to be}} possible, without great difficulty, to provide enough food for the towns. Yet the Government has failed badly in this respect. The rations are inadequate and irregular, so {{that it is impossible to}} preserve health and vigour without the help of food purchased illicitly in the markets at speculative prices. I have given reasons for thinking that the breakdown of transport, though a contributory cause, is not the main reason for the shortage. The main reason is the hostility of the peasants, which, in turn, is due to the collapse of industry and to the policy of forced requisitions. In regard to corn and flour, the Government requisitions all that the peasant produces above a certain minimum required for himself and his family. If, instead, it exacted a fixed amount as rent, it would not destroy his incentive to production, and would not provide nearly such a strong motive for concealment. But this plan would have enabled the peasants to grow rich, and would have involved a confessed abandonment of Communist theory. It has therefore been thought better to employ forcible methods, which led to disaster, as they were bound to do.|$|E
6000|$|But {{this is not}} yet {{the whole}} problem. If France and Italy are to make good their own {{deficiencies}} in coal from the output of Germany, then Northern Europe, Switzerland, and Austria, which previously drew their coal in large part from Germany's <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus,</b> must be starved of their supplies. Before the war 13,600,000 tons of Germany's coal exports went to Austria-Hungary. Inasmuch as nearly all the coalfields of the former Empire lie outside what is now German-Austria, the industrial ruin of this latter state, if she cannot obtain coal from Germany, will be complete. The case of Germany's neutral neighbors, who were formerly supplied in part from Great Britain but in large part from Germany, will be hardly less serious. They will {{go to great lengths}} in the direction of making their own supplies to Germany of materials which are essential to her, conditional on these being paid for in coal. Indeed they are already doing so.[49] With the breakdown of money economy the practice of international barter is becoming prevalent. Nowadays money in Central and South-Eastern Europe is seldom a true measure of value in exchange, and will not necessarily buy anything, with the consequence that one country, possessing a commodity essential to the needs of another, sells it not for cash but only against a reciprocal engagement {{on the part of the}} latter country to furnish in return some article not less necessary to the former. This is an extraordinary complication as compared with the former almost perfect simplicity of international trade. But in the no less extraordinary conditions of to-day's industry it is not without advantages as a means of stimulating production. The butter-shifts of the Ruhr[50] show how far modern Europe has retrograded in the direction of barter, and afford a picturesque illustration of the low economic organization to which the breakdown of currency and free exchange between individuals and nations is quickly leading us. But they may produce the coal where other devices would fail.[51] ...|$|E

This variability in Asia has and will continue to impact all sectors, from national and economic security to human health, food production, infrastructure, water availability, and ecosystems. Thus, many large Asian cities have become vulnerable, as more countries are unable to feed themselves and fewer countries produce <b>exportable</b> <b>surpluses</b> (Yin et al. 2011). In Asia, where most of the urban growth has concentrated in metropolitan areas, the problem of basic infrastructure and access is becoming more acute. In these urban centers, uneven distribution of incomes, the prevalence of poverty, diminishing farmlands, inefficient distribution systems, and rising expectations have all contributed to increasingly critical problems, particularly as they affect the urban poor (Dewan and Yamaguchi 2009 a). A recent World Bank study maintained that as many as 360 million inhabitants of cities in developing nations suffer from chronic calorie deficits (Wu et al. 2013). Five of every six urban families in India typically spend 70  % of their income on basic needs. Even in relatively prosperous Kuala Lumpur, between 45 and 50  % of total household expenditure goes to basic needs or twice the proportion spent in the UK. Consequently, the lower-income groups in cities of Asia are often worse off nutritionally than their rural counterparts (Dewan et al. 2012).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} to what extent such a strategy is appropriate for the low income rice-based countries of the Indochina-Myanmar Region 1 (IMR). On the one hand, the arguments in favor of agricultural diversification and agrofood based rural industrialization seem even more pressing than for the lower-middle income countries of Southeast Asia. The predominantly agrarian structure of these economies makes the need to increase income in rural areas more urgent, given the extreme difficulties that the urban and industrial sector will face to absorb a growing rural labor force in the medium term. With 80 percent or more of the population in rural areas in countries which have mostly reached rice self-sufficiency and boast a high potential for <b>exportable</b> rice <b>surplus,</b> the acceleration of growth and income in rural areas in the future will have to come from non-rice agricultural commodities and rural non-farm activities.

40|$|The {{world is}} facing two {{fundamental}} problems. The first {{problem is a}} rapidly increasing demand for energy. The second problem is increasing greenhouse gas emissions that are directly resulting from our energy consumption. The primary greenhouse gas in question here is carbon dioxide produced from the burning of fossil fuels. It has been demonstrated through scientific articles and studies that carbon dioxide is directly linked to rising atmospheric temperatures. Buildings represent {{a significant percentage of}} this CO 2 production. Many architectural theses and treatises have been written advocating architecture that is more energy efficient and which uses sustainable materials and processes as necessary steps towards solving the global warming crisis. With the threat of global warming looming, everyday architecture must go through a transformation. Sustainable buildings should not be limited to rarefied architectural gems. Instead, sustainable architecture should become a commonplace condition in the built environment. In order to achieve this, we need sustainable architecture that not only addresses the environmental issues but also pays for itself and pays the building owner for taking on such a task. To answer this need, I intend to design a mixed-use multifamily building that exists in the environment as a living system. As all living things, it must function utilizing the resources available in that environment. It must have a practical and economically viable on-site energy production and storage methodology that is environmentally benign and takes advantage of freely available natural resources. It must react to changes in the environment to better manage its resources and it must be able to store resources for later use. Lastly, it should foster sustainable living practices of its occupants. By building in this way, architecture can take on a new role as symbiant rather than parasite in the environment, producing its own pollution free energy and clean water. Each building acts as a life support system for its inhabitants but is also part of a macro scale biosphere. If resources are managed carefully, an <b>exportable</b> energy <b>surplus</b> can be generated representing an economic benefit to the owner.

40|$|Onion, {{tomato and}} chilies are {{most common and}} {{important}} kitchen items in Pakistan. The consumption of tomato and onion has high-income elasticity of demand, while the demand for chilies is almost inelastic. Thus, increased demand for tomato and onion is anticipated with economic development and urbanization. Further, the demand for these vegetables will also increase with population growth. Per capita consumption of vegetables in Pakistan is currently very low {{when compared to other}} countries of the region and world. People in upper income strata consume well above the national calculated average, while the bulk of rural population and large percentage of poorer strata among the urban population consume very few vegetables. For sustainability of vegetable enterprise, it is a prerequisite that the production and marketing system is profitable and efficient. Pakistan has unique but complex network of up to five or six intermediaries between the primary producer and the end user. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of vegetable production and marketing system determines the level and extent of production efficiency and market perfections. Realizing the importance of structure of vegetable enterprise and its efficiency and with a view to access the complexity of vegetable production and marketing for profitable production and efficient distribution system, the present study was designed and conducted. The main purpose was to conduct a detailed investigation of the present vegetable production and marketing system in Pakistan for analyzing production and marketing efficiency. For this study, primary data were collected from farmers by conducting surveys in three districts of Sindh, namely Hyderabad, Thatta and Mirpurkhas. Hyderabad was selected for onion crop, Thatta for tomato crop, and Mirpurkhas for chilies. Sixty farmers for each vegetable were randomly selected from these districts so the total sample size was 180 farmers for this study. Besides, 130 market intermediaries were also interviewed. Primary data were collected by survey method using a pre-tested questionnaire and secondary data were gathered from statistical bulletins. Time series panel data on market prices in four spatial markets of Pakistan for the selected vegetables was used to investigate long run market relationships. Similarly time series data of production of these vegetables was used for forecast estimates. A combination of analytical techniques including the measurement of growth rates of area and production of vegetables in Pakistan and across provinces, returns to scale analysis through using Cobb-Douglas production function, estimation of technical efficiency and technical efficiency rating across farms, marketing margins, market integration, and production forecast were used to assess the production and marketing system of onion, tomato and chilies in Sindh. Positive growth in area of vegetables in Pakistan was noted with higher growth of area in Punjab and Balochistan followed by North West Frontier and Sindh provinces, while the production of Punjab depicted a growth rate of 1. 6 percent followed by Sindh (1. 3 %) and Balochistan (0. 9 %). The growth rate of NWFP in vegetable production was negative during 1986 - 87 to 2004 - 05. The growth rate of vegetable production and corresponding comparisons of area clearly indicated that the vegetable yields in Sindh had remained and grown higher than rest of the provinces of Pakistan. Cobb-Douglas production function was estimated to measure elasticity of production and the degree of returns to scale for onion, tomato and chilies producing farms in Hyderabad, Thatta and Mirpurkhas districts of Sindh. Coefficients of elasticity of production indicated significant contribution of land, labor and capital inputs in production of these crops. For returns to scale, the t-test was applied for testing the null hypothesis that degree of homogeneity equals 1. Null hypothesis was maintained at 5 % significance level for each of onion, tomato and chilies crops. The results showed that the onion, tomato and chilies production exhibited constant returns to scale. These results indicated that if all inputs were increased proportionately, the output could be increased with the same proportion. The efficiency rating based on corrected intercept of the estimated production function indicated that a reasonably big number of farmers were using their inputs inefficiently. Thus, under the present standardized cultural practices, the vegetable growers seem to be operating at a lower level of production possibility curve in technological terms. The mean efficiency of chilies, tomato and onion was 0. 83, 0. 74 and 0. 59 respectively. The results further revealed that chilies growers were more efficient when compared to the onion and tomato farmers, while, tomato growers were found more efficient than onion farmers. The relationships across marketing chains involved in the selected vegetable were studied by investigating marketing margins, distribution of costs and net returns across the functionaries. The results of price spread across marketing chain revealed that share of producer in consumer rupee was 58, 66 and 65 percent for onion, tomato and chilies respectively, while the rest goes to commission agents, wholesalers and retailers. The results further revealed that the average returns of retailer on capital employed were three times higher in onion business and almost two times higher in tomato and chilies. Spatial price relationship is an important indicator of overall market performance. In spatially integrated markets, competition among arbitragers usually ensures that a unique equilibrium is achieved since local prices in regional markets differ by no more than transportation and transaction costs. The results of empirical evaluation of spatial price linkages among four regional markets of Pakistan using monthly wholesale real prices of onion, tomato and chilies indicated that these markets were efficient as their speed of adjustment for reaching an equilibrium level was higher. The difference in per unit prices of onion, tomato and chilies was due to transaction and transportation cost, thereby confirming the spatial integration of regional vegetable markets in Pakistan. The results of unit root test for onion and tomato show that the production time series is represented as a random walk model with drift, which indicates that the shocks to production in a year have permanent effect on the level of future production, while the time series of chilies production showed a pure random process. The forecast results show that production of tomato and onion, respectively, is expected to grow by 12825 and 40226 tonnes per annum, which results in little growth in per capita production of these vegetables. The efficiency of long run relationship across regional vegetable markets confirmed that price information flow is adequate. The higher returns on capital employed by the market agents including wholesalers, and commission agents indicated a collusive oligopoly among market intermediaries and they were not operating as competitive and efficient institutions. The vegetable forecast results revealed that per capita onion and tomato production would maintain upto 2020, and chilies production would not decline upto 2020. The outcome of the present research was tosuggest policy measures for government and to extend recommendations for further research. The results have revealed that the yields of vegetables in Sindh have grown at higher rate when compared to other provinces, perhaps due to higher demand based on the urbanizations. Sindh is major producer of chilies as it produces 75 percent of chilies in the country. Results reveal that other provinces have also started increasing its areas as well as production of chilies. Punjab province is also increasing onion production for reducing its dependence on Sindh and Balochistan provinces. As Sindh and Balochistan are relatively efficient in onion production, and Punjab province has neither comparative nor competitive advantage on Sindh and Balochistan provinces to produce onion. Hence, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, Government of Pakistan may intervene in giving guidelines for promoting efficient production of onion and optimum land use in Pakistan. Onion and chilies production is highly elastic to labor inputs, which indicates the significance of labor and their skills in production of these crops. Better vocational and skills training and technology transfer to laborers in onion and chilies production may help not only in increasing level of efficiency for producing these crops but it may change the steady state of production function by its upward movement. The vegetable production exhibited constant returns to scale and inefficiencies across farms; therefore, it was suggested that agricultural extension, support services, credit and technology transfer may be improved to increase output and generate <b>exportable</b> <b>surpluses.</b> It was also suggested that agrarian reforms be introduced including asset redistribution on selective basis to maximize the benefits of growth across households and reduce poverty through high value vegetable crops. Further inter-provincial trade may be promoted by developing road and other infrastructure in order to reduce transport and other transaction costs. It was further suggested that the Government may formulate an appropriate policy to invest in research and development for enhancing the yields of these vegetables. Major investment in supportive infrastructure was recommended to facilitate marketing and trade of vegetables including onion, tomato and chilies. Need was established for collaboration between private and public research and development programs to improve management practices, particularly the use of available technology for timely and efficient production. The analysis highlighted that farmers need to move the production upward and change the steady state of the function in order to attain the yield levels of experimental stations, which may, in turn, develop new production frontiers for vegetable production and quality enhancement. The results of this study indicated that the vegetable production system is partially efficient, while the marketing system is moderately efficient. An important role may, therefore, be envisioned for government as facilitator and promoter of an efficient production and marketing system. Government has also a role to play for stabilizing prices of perishable commodities to protect producers in the short run, and establish market infrastructures including cool chains as a long term solution. Government should also give incentives for growth and promotion of input industry required for onion, tomato and chilies production and to industries like packaging, processing, transportation and storage to promote trade along with employment. Profits of middlemen may also be rationalized through regulation and selective control. Government role needs to be invoked, wherever necessary, to remove market imperfections in the interest of producer and consumer. Pakistan needs to focus on vegetable exports particularly onion, tomato and chilies. The study pinpointed the need for maintaining time series data for different indicator so as to create a reliable management information system for planning, appraisal, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of production, marketing, imports, and exports for vegetables in the long run...|$|R

50|$|A plan {{suggested}} by George Peek and Hugh S.

Taylor, head of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, rallied behind the plan, which {{formed the basis for}} the bill introduced by McNary of Oregon and Representative Haugen of Iowa, both Republicans. The basic idea of the bill was an equalization fee. The government was to segregate the amounts required for domestic consumption from the <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus.</b> The former were to be sold at the higher domestic price (the world price plus the tariff), using the full advantage of the tariff rates on exportable farm products, and the latter at the world price. The difference between the higher domestic price and the world price received for the surplus was to be met by the farmers of each commodity {{in the form of a}} tax or equalization fee, which would be paid by American consumers in the form of higher food prices. The legislation was before Congress from 1924 to 1928. It received powerful and united support from agricultural interests in 1927 and in 1928, respectively, when it passed both houses. Gleason (1958) shows that most leading businessmen opposed the bill on the grounds that it was contrary to economic law and would cost money and involve the government in business. Farmers were urged to reduce production, practice crop diversification, and support the cooperative movement. The plan was opposed also on the moral ground that it destroyed the farmer's self-reliance. President Calvin Coolidge listened to business and killed the bill twice with vigorous vetoes.|$|E

The model provides the analytical capability to monitor the industry interactions for various policy alternatives over a forty five year time horizon. The North American regional gas model was applied in this thesis to analyze a number of current issues of concern to the Canadian natural gas industry. These include a long-range analysis of the consequences of moving to a free market business environment and an analysis of the recently implemented regional floor pricing system. Specific analysis for two series of policy cases was also done. The first examined the effects of changes to Canada's <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus</b> test while the second focused on the effects of a series of staged border taxes on Canadian gas exports. Throughout the analysis, specific regional effects, particularly related to Canadian exports, were also highlighted. The analysis results show that the outlook for the Canadian gas industry is extremely promising in terms of market volumes, revenues and profitability. Under all policies, the potential for significant increases in production is evident. The trend towards the free market business environment is of significant benefit to the welfare of both the industry and the country. Consistent with this, it was found that the national interest is best served by the relaxation of Canada's <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus</b> reserve test and by minimal price distinction between gas bound for export and domestic markets...|$|E
40|$|India {{is known}} for its {{livestock}} wealth and ranks high among the nations having bovine population. However, despite having huge livestock population, India stands insignificant in the world trade of livestock products. The recent concerted efforts made by the government in the era of liberalization after opening up of the national economy to the international market have certainly boosted India’s export trade of livestock products to newer heights. The dairy industry of India is already at a take-off stage and the entry of the corporate sector following the liberalized policies of government is bound to complement the efforts of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to usher in a white revolution. The most important achievement of the dairy industry is the near-self sufficiency in milk production. Nonetheless, the possibility of India emerging as a potential exporter of various livestock products will largely depend on India’s own ability to exploit her potential in this sector and generate <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus</b> of these commodities, aside her competitive strength in the world market. ...|$|E
40|$|Livestock {{trade is}} more {{competitive}} and functions better within countries (domestic segment) than between countries (cross-border segment). This is mainly {{due to high}} capital outlay, lack of credit and the increased risk of losing animals associated with cross-border trade. • Transportation and handling costs are the single largest component of marketing costs. These can be reduced through re-duction of tariffs on new trucks and spares and the reduction of official taxes, including fuel tax. Elimination of illegal taxation along the trade routes could also contribute to improved market performance. • Value-added processing will {{eliminate the need for}} handling costs incurred during cross-border transportation. • Beef production and value of livestock trade can be substantially increased through fattening schemes in response to the premium being paid by export traders for high quality beef. This should also pave the way for the region to achieve <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus</b> and earn foreign exchange. • Market integration is low. Livestock market information systems have to be developed and effectively deployed at national and regional levels to overcome this problem. • Market institutions such as livestock traders ’ associations and intermediaries, both at local and national levels (sociétés de convoyage), have emerged to play roles, which should ordinarily be undertaken by the public sector. These roles are aimed at lowering transactions costs and facilitating livestock trade and regional integration...|$|E
40|$|In this article, the {{environmental}} issue in contemporary rurality emerges {{as one of}} the principal sociopolitical inquiries of developed societies instigating scientists and investigators in the natural sciences and, later, in the humanities. The industrialization of agriculture in European countries in the post-war period unquestionably resulted in expressive productivity increases, creating over supply of food in domestic markets and <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus.</b> Legitimated by its quantitative success, modernization, however,created serious unbalance both at ecosystem and preservation of natural, social, and cultural resources levels. The example provided is the marked modernization occurring in French agriculture, followed by a discussion of the model implemented in that country, the instruments that made it viable, and the social, economic, and environmental crisis it generated. Next, is shown how this intensive agriculture is counterpoised to a growing environmental awareness, expressed in a vigorous political and cultural movement, based on small and medium size farmers, united in social urban movements. Finally, the article suggests proposals for new directions and perspectives for further research on rural societies and the environment. What are the social and political conditions needed so that agriculture can fulfill a new contract with society? Parallel to that, the new contributions of the natural sciences and the currentdebates in the agronomical and social sciences context are discussed. Summing up, the defeat of the intensive industrial agricultural model is pinpointed, and suggestions are made on issues hinging around,on one hand, new agricultural production concepts based on ecological foundations, and the contribution of new scientific approaches used as grounds for a sustainable agricultural model allowing social andnatural resources reproduction, on the other...|$|E
40|$|India {{is known}} for its {{livestock}} wealth and ranks high among the nations having bovine population. However, despite having huge livestock population, India stands insignificant in the world trade of livestock products. The recent concerted efforts made by the government in the era of liberalization after opening of the national economy to the international market have certainly boosted India’s export trade of livestock products to newer heights. The findings of this study show considerable increase in the export trade of India in meat and meat products and also in respect of milk and milk products, both in quantity and value terms. The export trade of India in milk and milk products got a real boost only after the early nineties period, i. e., in the era of liberalization. The estimates in this study also show an increasing trend in export trade of India in processed livestock products. The increase in livestock exports of India witnessed after the early nineties period is chiefly because of liberalization of trade and several trade policy changes coupled with surge in international prices of many livestock based products. The upswing in livestock exports of India in due course of time has also filtered into significant increase in her share not only in Asia but also in world export trade. But, {{the results of this study}} still indicate a marginal presence of India in world trade of majority of the livestock products. It is only in the case of bovine meat and also sheep and goat meat that India has shown a considerable share in the global trade of the same. The findings of this study also indicate that there will neither be any <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus</b> for milk nor meat and eggs in the near future. However, India still has enormous untapped potential in its livestock sector which if tapped in the desired manner and direction can lead us to emerge as the leading producer of milk and meat in the world in the years to come, but not in exports. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAgriculture is an {{important}} source of income for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq (ISIS), which currently rules over large parts of the breadbaskets of the two countries. It has received limited attention compared to other sources of ISIS revenues such as oil, looting, ransom, foreign donations and various forms of taxation. We estimate winter crops production of wheat and barley in ISIS-controlled areas in both Syria and Iraq for the years 2014 – 2015 and irrigated summer crops production (cotton) in Northeast Syria. We show that remote sensing can give a credible estimation of agricultural production in the absence of statistics. With evidence from MODIS Aqua and Terra Satellites as well as Landsat imagery, we find that agricultural production in ISIS-controlled Syrian and Iraqi zones has been sustained in 2014 and 2015, despite the detrimental impact of conflict. After a drought in 2014 production was able to capitalize on improved rainfalls in 2015. First indications show that the winter grain harvest of 2016 in Iraqi territories of ISIS was significantly above pre-conflict mean and below pre-conflict mean in its Syrian territories. We also show how water flows along the Euphrates have impacted production. We estimate the revenue that ISIS can derive from wheat and barley production and the likely magnitude of an <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus.</b> Agricultural production gives the group a degree of resilience, although its economy is not sustainable in the longer run and could be affected by military collapse. Taxation of recurrent income streams such as agriculture will become more important for ISIS as its extractive sources of revenues show signs of dwindling. Beside non-grain food imports, agricultural production is crucial for its political legitimacy by ensuring food provision to the broader population. Food security considerations would require a high priority in any post-ISIS reconstruction effort and would need to include the rehabilitation of supply chains for agricultural inputs such as quality seeds and fertilizers...|$|E
40|$|If ACP {{countries}} are {{to improve their}} agricultural productivity they must do so through their rural people. And, if full employment, food self-sufficiency and an <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus</b> of agricultural products are to be achieved, rural people must tee motivated. Owner ship of land is a powerful incentive, especially among young people who see no future for themselves as hired labour but who arewilling to work atbuilding up their own family holding. In the majority of Caribbean countries, widespread land ownership is very recent but, in several countries where land reform and re-distribution has begun, the benefits are already evident. For much of their modern history most Caribbean countries were developed as plantation economies, where {{the mass of the}} population worked as labour on monoculture estates owned by a minority of landowners or foreign-based companies. However, many foreign-based companies, and even some large local landowners, found the combination of poor prices for the main plantation crops (banana, citrus, cocoa, coconut and sugar) and rising labour costs and unrest in the 1970 s too problematic, and either sold up or abandoned their estates. As a result, governments gained possession and were provided with the opportunity to offer the land in small blocks to previously landless people. Privatization in Grenada In Grenada, by 1983 a succession of governments had acquired 36 estates, ranging from 17 - 105 hectares (40 - 250 acres). In 1986 it was decided by the Government to 'divest' these estates: to divide them into economically viable units and to offer them for private ownership. In common with the majority of islands in the Caribbean, Grenada has a very steep terrain so at divestment, farmers were encouraged to continue to grow one of the major crops - banana, cocoa and nutmeg but to diversify by growing other crops for food and for sale. In order to do this without encouraging erosion, a programme of soil and water conservation was started in which the farmers were involved. With FAO technical assistance, settlers were helped to build bench terraces, of eyebrow terraces, access roads and dams. A wide range of fruit trees was planted, while leucaena and Honduran Pine were planted on the steepest land as conservation forest The idea was to provide improved income, long-term security and to involve the new settlers in sustainable production techniques. Considerable progress has been made: people in Grenada are increasingly aware of the need for food self-sufficiency and import-substitution; more locally produced foods are available in markets and for the thriving tourist industry; and surplus fruit is processed for jams, jellies and confectionery. There has been a deliberate policy to choose young people as new settlers and {{there is no shortage of}} applicants: there are 30 - 40 applicants for each farm that becomes available, of whom 80 %- 90 % are in the 25 - 30 age group. Dominica diversifies Similar success has been achieved in Dominica, where the main plantation crops were banana and limes. Again, these remain the major crops on the small farms that have been carved from the big estates. Where banana still offers a good return, some far' mers continue to specialize in the crop, but others have diversified into vegetables and tubers for the local market, ginger for export and also flowers such as ginger lily. In the drier south of the island limes were and remain the major crop but, because of the depressed price over several years, farmers settled here have diversified and grow passion fruit, Aloe vera and forage grasses for feeding to one or two milk cows and 10 - 15 sheep and goats. Some farmers are also keeping one or two breeding pigs. However, land redistribution is seldom sufficient when carried out in isolation, so in Grenada and Dominica, new farmers have been provided with technical advice and assistance with marketing their crops. In Dominica the marketing of new crops has been well developed through the Dominican Export and Import Agency, DEXIA (See Spore N 20). There is a processing facility for limes on the island and a factory for coconut products, such as oil and soap. Aloe vera, a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives on dry, porous soils, is purchased by the Windward Island Aloe Company and is used in a wide range of cosmetics and body-care products. All these marketing intitiatives have resulted in firm markets, increased local employment and added value to products, to the benefit of farmers and the national economy. Integrated development Credit has also played an important role in developing the small-farmer economy in Dominica, as has the construction of feeder roads into previously inaccesible parts of the island. The United Nations lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development has assisted by providing funds for credit while IFAD and the European Development Fund have financed access roads. It is clearly evident that without an integrated approach of technical advice, credit, availability of inputs, access roads and marketing, land redistribution alone would not have had the desired impact and might even have resulted in stagnant production, frustration and a decline in standards of soil and water conservation.

40|$|The facts presented, both {{statistically}} and graphically, in {{the following}} pages are of significance, showing international trade in hog products as they do, and giving special emphasis to the American export outlet. Inasmuch {{as they have been}} presented without a great deal of refined analysis, no attempt to prove anything as to the future of this trade and the significance of it to the Iowa hog producer is justified. Nevertheless, it is possible safely to draw the following conclusions: 1. It is quite evident that the foreign outlet for hog products, and particularly for lard, supports the domestic prices of these products and therefore the domestic price of hogs to the original producers, thus enabling the Corn Belt farmer to use a larger percentage of corn and of his corn growing resources in a more remunerative way than would be possible if this source of demand were cut off.. 2. The periodic rise and fall in the volume of exports of these products leads us to believe that the export outlet serves as a buffer against the price depressions which might otherwise result from the cyclical nature of our hog production. It is during the time when farmers in the United States are producing the largest number of hogs and slaughter house products are available in largest quantity that the export movement comes in to relieve the glut and save the price situation to some extent. 3. There seems to be evidence in the statistics herein presented and in other information which shows, in connection with our type of farming studies and other investigations, that our <b>exportable</b> <b>surplus</b> of hog products is not a temporary thing but will continue to characterize our international trade. This is evident not only from the present very substantial volume of these movements but from the potential increases in production in this country. It seems safe to say that the Corn Belt could increase its hog output materially if production should be stimulated by a sufficiently broad demand. Therefore, if the home market expands, it is reasonable to suppose that the larger supply will come from expansion of domestic production rather than from curtailment of exports. The extent to which this movement will go is, of course, dependent upon the profitableness of alternative uses of our feeds and our feed producing farm lands. The essential point is that at present the margin between the pork producing uses of these resources and alternative opportunities for use in other directions is sufficiently great to stimulate further production even on the basis of current prices. 4. In view of the above observations, it seems reasonable to conclude that it is important for hog producers and others interested in the pork producing industry to cultivate good will for their products abroad...|$|E
