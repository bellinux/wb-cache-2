5|$|A {{programme}} {{to convert}} A320 and A321 aircraft into freighters {{was set up}} by Airbus <b>Freighter</b> Conversion GmbH. Airframes would be converted by EADS EFW in Dresden, Germany, and Zhukovsky, Russia. The launch customer AerCap signed a firm contract on 16 July 2008 to convert 30 of AerCap's passenger A320/A321s into A320/A321P2F (passenger to <b>freighter).</b> However, on 3 June 2011, Airbus announced all partners would end the passenger to <b>freighter</b> programme, citing high demand for used airframes for passenger service.|$|E
5|$|For {{her fifth}} patrol, U-38 would again depart from Wilhelmshaven with Heinrich Liebe in command on 6 June 1940. She was {{to patrol the}} waters off {{southern}} Ireland. During this operation, Liebe would hit six ships, two of which were sailing in convoy at the time. On 14 June, U-38 sank the Greek steam <b>freighter</b> SS Mount Myrto. The next day, U-38 sank two ships, both sailing as part of Convoy HX-47, sailing from Halifax to England. First sunk was the Canadian steam <b>freighter</b> SS Erik Boye, followed by the Norwegian motor tanker MV Italia. Five days later, on 20 June, the Swedish steam <b>freighter</b> SS Tilia Gorthon was torpedoed and sunk. The Belgian steam <b>freighter</b> SS Luxembourg was destroyed on 21 June, followed by the Greek steam <b>freighter</b> SS Neion the following day. After three weeks at sea, U-38 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 2 July.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise {{enters the}} neutral zone, to {{investigate}} the distress call of a Talarian <b>freighter.</b> The <b>freighter</b> is badly damaged, and three life forms are detected aboard. An away team beams over and finds three Klingons: Korris (Vaughn Armstrong); Konmel (Charles Hyman); and Kunivas (Robert Bauer), who is wounded. The away team returns {{with them to the}} Enterprise before the <b>freighter</b> explodes. Kunivas is taken to sickbay and Korris meets with Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). The Klingon explains that they were passengers when the <b>freighter</b> was attacked by a Ferengi ship; the Klingons took over the <b>freighter</b> to fend off and destroy the Ferengi ship, but the damage sustained left the <b>freighter</b> adrift and faltering. As Korris and Konmel are shown to quarters, they are surprised to hear about a fellow Klingon, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), who is serving within Starfleet.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the accident, the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was the only tri-jet {{airliner}} in production.

The last MD-11 overall was delivered to Lufthansa Cargo in 2001, as a <b>freighter.</b>|$|E

50|$|During the 2000s (decade), {{the makeup}} of the UPS Airlines fleet saw {{extensive}} change. In 2000, the first Airbus A300 <b>freighters</b> entered service. Marking the entry of the first non-Boeing/Douglas aircraft to the fleet, the airline ordered 90 of the <b>freighters.</b> In 2001, after disappointing results, UPS withdrew its 727 quick-change <b>freighters</b> from charter service. The same year, UPS began its first flights to China, six days a week.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{aircraft}} promises improved operating economics compared to older <b>freighters,</b> airlines have viewed the 777F {{as a replacement}} for <b>freighters</b> such as the 747-200F, MD-10, and MD-11F. [...] The first 777F was delivered to Air France on February 19, 2009. As of July 2017, 130 <b>freighters</b> had been delivered to 16 different customers, with 31 unfilled orders.

5|$|For {{her first}} patrol from Lorient and her seventh overall, U-38 would again {{be under the}} command of Heinrich Liebe. She {{departed}} on 25 September, for the Northwest Approaches. She would attack five ships on this patrol, sinking four of them. On 1 October, the British motor <b>freighter</b> MV Highland Patriot was torpedoed. After two weeks of no victories, U-38 was successful against the Greek steam <b>freighter</b> SS Aenos on 17 October, sailing as part of Convoy SC 7, from Sydney, Nova Scotia to England. The following day, the British steam <b>freighter</b> SS Carsbreck was damaged, but not sunk, while traveling with the SC-7 convoy from Sydney to Grimsby, England. On 19 October, two ships were hit, both sailing as part of the HX 79 convoy: the Dutch SS Bilderdijk and the British steam <b>freighter</b> SS Matheran. Following these victories, U-38 returned to Lorient on 24 October 1940.|$|E

Bristol <b>Freighters</b> were operated briefly by the Pakistan Air Force. After withdrawal, some of the Pakistan aircraft were bought by SAFE Air and used in New Zealand. The Royal Canadian Air Force used five <b>Freighters</b> to carry spares and supplies between the United Kingdom and their bases in France and West Germany.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the time}} Coulby retired in 1924, he had {{expanded}} the [...] "Steel Trust Fleet" [...] {{into the most}} dominant on the Great Lakes. Under his supervision, the company built 26 600 ft <b>freighters</b> and four 500 ft, and purchased three 600 ft <b>freighters</b> and six 400 ft <b>freighters.</b> These ships, known as [...] "tin stackers" [...] for the silver color of their funnels, {{were part of a}} fleet which continued to dominate Great Lakes shipping into the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|Seven ships {{reported}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Carlotta, peaking at 46mph (74km/h); the lowest pressure recorded by ship was 1,008mbar. Offshore, waves reached 40feet (12m) in height. The Lithuanian <b>freighter</b> Linkuva, en route to Long Beach, California, encountered the waves and strong winds as the hurricane was undergoing its period of rapid intensification. After an engine failure, the <b>freighter</b> was lost about 220miles (355km) southwest of Acapulco. A naval vessel from both the United States Navy and the Mexican Navy searched for the <b>freighter</b> for three days, though the crew was lost and presumed killed.|$|E

25|$|In early 2014, the {{director}} general of the International Air Transport Association noted that slower economic growth, following the Great Recession, had led to lower demand for air <b>freighters.</b> The world's air cargo fleet in 2012 was smaller than it was in 2003. However, the proportion of very large <b>freighters</b> in that fleet has increased, and Boeing's dominant position in large, fuel-efficient <b>freighters</b> has offered the company an opportunity to protect its market share and its product line despite the market weakness.|$|R

The following year, the yard completed another two passenger <b>freighters</b> for the struggling U.S. and Brazil Mail Company, the 4,000-ton passenger <b>freighters</b> Seguranca and Vigilancia. These new vessels did not improve the Brazil Line's fortunes and it went bankrupt in 1893.|$|R
