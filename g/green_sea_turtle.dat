5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} sea turtle {{including}} the Atlantic <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the {{leatherback sea turtle}} (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{gull-billed tern}} is an opportunist predator, taking {{a wide variety}} of prey from marine, {{freshwater}} and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.|$|E

25|$|Like other <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> migrate long {{distances}} between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide {{are known as}} Turtle Island due to <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests and lay eggs during the night. Later, hatchlings emerge and scramble into the water. Those that reach maturity may live to 80 years in the wild.|$|R

25|$|The <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{a member}} of the tribe Chelonini. A 1993 study {{clarified}} the status of genus Chelonia with respect to the other marine turtles. The carnivorous Eretmochelys (hawksbill), Caretta (loggerhead) and Lepidochelys (Ridley) were assigned to the tribe Carettini. Herbivorous Chelonia warranted their status as a genus, while Natator (flatback) was further removed from the other genera than previously believed.|$|E
25|$|Despite recent {{declines in}} the sea turtle populations, five species are known to nest in Burma at well known island and {{mainland}} beaches known as turtle-banks. These are the {{olive ridley sea turtle}} (Lepidochelys olivacea), the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chelonia mydas), the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea).|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> extends {{throughout}} tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. The two major subpopulations are the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific subpopulations. Each population is genetically distinct, with {{its own set of}} nesting and feeding grounds within the population's known range. Their native range includes tropical to subtropical waters along continental coasts and islands between 30°N and 30°S. Since green sea turtles are a migrating species, their global distribution spans into the open ocean. The <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> is estimated to inhabit coastal areas of more than 140 countries, with nesting sites in over 80 countries worldwide throughout the year. In the United States Atlantic coast, green sea turtles can be found from Texas and north to Massachusetts. In the United States Pacific coast, they have been found from southern California north to the southernmost tip of Alaska. The largest populations of green sea turtles within the United States coastline are in the Hawaiian Islands and Florida. Globally, the largest populations of sea turtles are in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Caribbean islands.|$|E

25|$|The <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chelonia mydas), {{also known}} as the green turtle, black (sea) turtle or Pacific green turtle, is a large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. It is the only species in the genus Chelonia. Its range extends {{throughout}} tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the Indian Ocean. The common name comes from the usually green fat found beneath its carapace; these turtles' shells are olive to black.|$|E
25|$|The <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> can {{generally}} be {{found throughout the}} Atlantic Ocean. Individuals have been spotted {{as far north as}} Canada in the western Atlantic, and the British Isles in the east. The subpopulation's southern range is known until past the southern tip of Africa in the east and Argentina in the western Atlantic. The major nesting sites can be found on various islands in the Caribbean, along the eastern shores of the continental United States, the eastern coast of the South American continent and most notably, on isolated North Atlantic islands.|$|E
25|$|Galápagos green turtles {{have been}} {{recorded}} and observed in the Galápagos {{as far back as}} the 17th century by William Dampier. Not much attention has been paid to them due to the overwhelming research done on the Galápagos giant tortoises. Only over the last 30 years have extensive studies been performed covering the behaviors of the Galápagos green turtles. Much of the debate that has surrounded them recently is over the binomial classification of the species. It is the only subpopulation of <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> to be given premise for separate species delineation, proposing Chelonia agassizii as a separate species. At this time, no distinctions have been made, mainly due to analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of 15nesting beaches. This analysis has showed little distinction between the populations of the East Pacific waters and those of other nesting areas.|$|E

25|$|A ki' pohaku ({{petroglyph}}) of {{a turtle}} (or honu) {{can be found}} on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this petroglyph shows its importance dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home time after time. This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds of miles to lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle who could {{take the form of a}} girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.|$|E
25|$|Galápagos green turtles, grouped {{with all}} populations of Chelonia mydas, are {{listed on the}} IUCN Red List of {{threatened}} species. They {{were placed on the}} list in the mid 1980s and have remained under protection since. One of the major problems that have led to their decline is the slow growth rate and long period from juvenile to sexual maturity. Chelonians average a period of 26–40 years to maturity; the Galápagos green turtle averages 33years. The <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> has been shown to have the slowest growth rate of any species of sea turtle and is generally long-lived if left undisturbed. Overall, populations of C. mydas have had a decrease of about 48–67% of nesting females, but the population that nests in the Galápagos has remained quite steady with little to no change. The population of nesting females recorded in the Galápagos from 1976–1982 was roughly 1400individuals and after further evaluation in 1999–2001, around 1400nesting females were found.|$|E
25|$|Green {{sea turtles}} move across three habitat types, {{depending}} on their life stage. They lay eggs on beaches. Mature turtles {{spend most of their}} time in shallow, coastal waters with lush seagrass beds. Adults frequent inshore bays, lagoons and shoals with lush seagrass meadows. Entire generations often migrate between one pair of feeding and nesting areas. Green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, are classified as an aquatic species and are distributed around the globe in warm tropical to subtropical waters. The environmental parameter that limits the distribution of the turtles is ocean temperatures below 7 to 10 degrees Celsius. Within their geographical range, the green sea turtles generally stay near continental and island coastlines. Near the coastlines, the green sea turtles live within shallow bays and protected shores. In these protected shores and bays, the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> habitats include coral reefs, salt marshes, and nearshore seagrass beds. The coral reefs provide red, brown, and green algae for their diet and gives protection from predators and rough storms within the ocean. The salt marshes and seagrass beds contain seaweed and grass vegetation, allowing ample habitat for the sea turtles.|$|E

Living in {{the marine}} environment and laying eggs on the beach, they are mainly threatened by human activities (poaching, fisheries bycatch, habitat destruction, etc.). In Reunion Island, the Kélonia observatory and IFREMER develop various scientific programs to study and protect <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b> One of them consists in studying migrations of <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> for mating purpose. As existing mathematical models struggle to take spatial dimension into account, we propose an agent-based model to study some of the numerous questions regarding <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> migrations. Coming with high expectations, experts in <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> also provide many heterogeneous but incomplete data. Considering available or obtainable data {{in one hand and}} the various questions of experts in the other hand, we defined an innovative modelling process in which we simultaneously conduct discussion with experts and prototyping.
