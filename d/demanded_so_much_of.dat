He brewed, no doubt, good beer, without a taste in it beyond malt and hops;--no man in the county brewed better beer; but he couldn't make a speech. He got up, dressed in a big white waistcoat, and a face as red as his son's hunting-coat, {{and said that he}} hoped his boy would make a good husband.

But there were foolish voices about me less reticent; while the literature, illustrated and otherwise, provided in those days for serious-minded youth, answered all questionings with blunt brutality. If you did wrong you burnt in a fiery furnace for ever and ever. Were your imagination weak you could turn to the accompanying illustration, and see at a glance how you yourself would writhe and shrink and scream, while cheerful devils, well organised, were busy stoking. I had been burnt once, rather badly, in consequence of live coals, in course of transit on a shovel, being let fall upon me. I imagined these burning coals, not confined to a mere part of my body, but pressing upon me everywhere, not snatched swiftly off by loving hands, the pain assuaged by applications of soft soap and the blue bag, but left there, eating into my flesh and veins. And this continued for eternity. You suffered for an hour, a day, a thousand years, and were no nearer to the end; ten thousand, a million years, and yet, as at the very first, it was for ever, and for ever still it would always be for ever! I suffered also from insomnia about this period.|$|R
40|$|Community Psychiatry in India is an {{upcoming}} branch {{in the field}} ofpsychiatry as well as Community Medicine. The need for this discipline has dawned {{in a big way}} recently on account of increasing deviant human behaviour resulting from the exuberant mental stress and strain of rapid industrialization and urbanization. The earlier concept ofpsychiatric illnesses and other psychosomatic conditions have changed a great deal over the years. The term lumatic or insane is no more considered a sophisticated terminology for describing a person who is mentally ill. The euphemism which is in vogue nowadays ensures that even those who are mentally sick deserve a place in society and have the fundamental right to live a life of dignity and respect. Psychiatry today is perhaps more concerned with the modern life style resulting in the so called mental wear and tear, rather than exclusive organic lesions causing a pathological mental state. The boundries of psychiatry are no more confined or restricted to marked mental derangement manifesting as Manic Depresive Psychosis, Schizophrenia, Paranoia and other serious mental illnesses, but also envisages situations heralding the onset of an alteration in normal human behaviour. The spectrum of mental illnesses may range from mild infrequent anxiety and simple depression to very serious psychosis. The pendulum can swing either way resulting at times in creating paradoxical situations, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>so</b> that the manifestation of such a disorder can be diagnosed only by a qualified psychiatrist. It will be very much relevant to mention at this juncture that what may appear as a simple case of social withdrawl or decreased performance at school or work, could be due to major psychosis, which later on {{may turn out to be}} extremely detrimental for the patient as well as his associates. The changing social, economic and cultural pattern, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> prevalent in the country today may be at times responsible for various mental disorders, which earlier did not <b>demand</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> medical attention. Psychiatric consultations are becoming increas­ingly more frequent in the industrialised countries of the world. It seems that in not too distant future it should become an important component ofthe health care delivery system in nearly all developing countries ofthe world, including India. During yesteryears, there was a social stigma attached to people suffer ing from mental disorders. Persons once declared insane, were either admitted in lunatic asylums or ostracized. However, when one goes down the memory lane, he will appreciate that graually the awareness created in the modern society has changed the perception of psychiatri...|$|R

60|$|It may be said, perhaps, that a fall in {{the price}} of our corn and labour, affords the only chance to our {{manufacturers}} of retaining possession of the foreign markets; and that though the produce of the country may not be increased by the {{fall in the}} price of corn, such a fall is necessary to prevent a positive diminution of it. There is some weight undoubtedly in this argument. But {{if we look at the}} probable effects of returning peace to Europe, it is impossible to suppose that, even with a considerable diminution {{in the price of}} labour, we should not lose some markets on the continent, for those manufactures in which we have no peculiar advantage; while we have every reason to believe that in others, where our colonies, our navigation, our long credits, our coals, and our mines come in question, as well as our skill and capital, we shall retain our trade in spite of high wages. Under these circumstances, it seems peculiarly advisable to maintain unimpaired, if possible, the home market, and not to lose the <b>demand</b> occasioned by <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the rents of land, and of the profits and capital of farmers, as must necessarily be destroyed by the check to our home produce.|$|R
40|$|RECENT EVENTS BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER the {{publication}} of Lord Justice Leveson’s Report into regulatory aspects of the newspaper industry in Britain have tended to concentrate on ethical and professional issues as manifested in the practices of {{a substantial number of}} British national papers. Of less immediate concern – but, it could be argued, of some significance in the longer term – has been the relationship between proprietors and editors. It can reasonably be suggested that because the issues surrounding journalism practice are at least as cultural as they are legal or regulatory, and because culture within organisations flows down from the top rather than seeps up from the bottom, these relationships are deserving of further study than they have received to date. In the specific British context, the role of the effective proprietor of the News International group of newspapers has been evident in two sharply contrasting ways: in Mr Murdoch’s doughty, if behind-the-scenes, defence of Rebekah Wade, until the pressure of events forced her resignation from the editorship of the News of the World; and in the extraordinary removal of the editor of The Times, James Harding, and his replacement by James Witherow – actions carried out without the prior approval of that newspaper’s independent directors, whose rights to oversee and approve such dismissals and appointments had been specifically written into the agreement by which Mr. Murdoch had assumed ownership and control of these newspapers. The appointment and dismissal of editors of national newspapers is, with few exceptions, a process remarkable, {{on either side of the}} Irish Sea, for its opacity. As important questions of reputation are involved, this is perhaps to be expected; but it is still remarkable that an industry which <b>demands</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> transparency <b>of</b> others manages, in this respect at least, to keep its cards so close to its chest. This essay is an attempt to elucidate and document, on the basis of a previously unavailable collection of papers, the issues involved in such a process in the case of the appointment and dismissal of one Irish national newspaper editor almost half a century ago. Whether they are relevant to today’s controversies is for others to decide...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{starting}} point {{of this study was}} the experience of great problems with persons on long-term sick leave in the county of Västerbotten. In order to illuminate the situation we designed a study of the actors most involved who dealt with persons on long-term sick leave. These actors were the medical doctors; the employers: the social insurance officials; and members of the board of social insurance and persons reporting on the cases to the board. One aim was to describe and analyse the situation for persons on sick leave. Another aim was to describe and analyse the perception of the role the different actors played when dealing with persons on long-term sick leave. The third aim was to describe and analyse the different actors' views of each other, and of the co-operation around the persons on long-term sick leave. Method and material: Interviews with persons on sick leave, employers, social insurance officials and medical doctors. Questionnaires were sent to persons on sick leave, doctors {{and the members of the}} board of social insurance and those reporting on the cases. The interviews were audio- taped and transcribed word by word. Coding and analysis of collected data was done simultaneously by performing new interviews, using an adjusted form of grounded theory with the purpose of trying to find patterns and contexts. The aim was to describe the subjective experiences of how the actors look upon their situation and their way of coping with it. Results: The interviews with the employers showed great differences in attitudes and ways of treating employees, which also led to different models for dealing with work environment, sickness absence and rehabilitation. We divided the employers into five different "ideal types". Two of them could be described as "well-functioning" with regard to rehabilitation, and three of them as "less well-functioning". A high degree of flexibility characterises the successful employer, and he also takes good care of his personnel. The good employer also co-operates with other actors. The employers that are not well-functioning are not engaged in making adjustments, and have little confidence in their staff; the unions within their field are weak. Interviews with medical doctors revealed that they felt lonely, and that the demands were frustrating to them. They also had feelings of losing the locus of control. The doctors showed lack of knowledge of the labour market and the social insurance legislation, which made their work harder. They experienced that their lack of time made sickness periods longer. Among the results from the interviews with social insurance officials can be mentioned that they had good knowledge about laws, but sometimes it was difficult to use their knowledge and methods due to lack of flexibility. They experienced feelings of loneliness and had great difficulty in making decisions. Co-operation with partners often did not work out - the officials did not <b>demand</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their co-actors. The results of the questionnaire directed towards the members of the board of social insurance and those who reported on the cases did not show statistically significant differences between the three counties. The members of the board had almost the same proposals for decision as those who reported on the cases. There were no significant differences between men and women in decision-making. As a whole the members of the board seemed to be skilled in their knowledge of how to use the social insurance legislation. The results of the interviews with persons on sick leave showed that those persons had difficulties in asking for help and support. They felt such loyalty to their employers that they did not ask for adjustments of working places when needed. At the same time they were disappointed that the employers were not sufficiently involved in making it possible to come back to work again. More than half of the respondents had not received enough support from the employers, the medical doctors or the social insurance officials. Most of them felt frustrated, with little or no hope for the future. The results of the questionnaire to persons on long-term sick leave showed that women took a greater responsibility for their own rehabilitation, while the employers showed an earlier interest in sick male employees than in sick female employees. The employers were also keener to adjust the working places for men than for women. Despite those factors, women more often met their employers than men did, and they also had a more positive attitude to social insurance officials and doctors than men had. People with longer education took greater responsibility for their rehabilitation than those with shorter education. Compared to older people, younger persons were more optimistic about their future health and work, and also expressed that work was not so stressful. digitalisering@um...|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationThe {{secondary}} school English curriculum {{was determined by}} groups outside schools during the period 1944 - 1974. External domination of teaching content and methodology was ensured by a system of Public and Matriculation Examinations which empowered agents of the universities to prescribe courses and to assess students' performance in those courses. The University of Melbourne exercised these functions through its Professorial Board and the Schools Board before relinquishing its powers to the Victorian Universities and Schools Examination Board in 1965. Statute and tradition allowed these bodies to establish themselves as a centre apart from schools, and to legitimise their authority through the institutionalised processes of prescription, examination and review of performance. The effect of these processes was to subordinate schools, teachers and pupils. There was immense inertia in the Victorian system of external prescription and examination. Courses and examination papers remained essentially unmodified for long periods. Significant development in the conception and content of English courses occurred, effectively, only at Year 12 in response to social and educational pressures which had previously led to the withdrawal of Public Intermediate and Leaving Examinations. Broadening the goals of H. S. C. English did not, however, signal diminished control over curriculum from the centre. The fact of competitive examinations {{at the end of}} {{secondary school}}ing continued to shape content and methodology in the earlier years. Competitive examinations engendered in schools, teachers and pupils a narrow conformity, the results of which can most clearly be seen in the failure of the Class A system to produce school-based curriculum initiatives of any substance. The effect of external prescription and examination of English courses was profound. Relationships between teachers and pupils were strongly mediated by the system, reducing the autonomy of both by subjugating their intentions to the instrumental <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> evaluation. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a student's 'life chance' depended upon examination success that teachers and taught were continually constrained to focus their attention on the tasks expected in examinations. Fragmentation, in line with the different sections of examination papers, rather than integration became, therefore, the organising principle for teaching aimed at developing those techniques believed to be essential for success in the examination game. External examinations dictated that the English classroom was a place where pupils met to prepare for their encounters with examinations rather than to explore the nature and richness of experience through literature and their own use of language for real ends. The system of Public and Matriculation Examinations established in 1944 was a potent influence on the secondary school English curriculum. The system rested upon a powerful, conservative centre whose legitimacy was so thoroughly entrenched that it was able to admit reform only on its own terms. Thus, it was possible after twenty-five years of relative stasis to negotiate evolution in the details of the school English curriculum without alteration to the essential power relationships. After thirty years, English teachers were still without autonomy. Year 12 English courses continued to exert the pressures and to exact the dependence which had constrained mother tongue studies throughout secondary schools since 1944.
