Helensburgh near Glasgow was laid out in 1776 on a grid-iron plan. Small new towns on a <b>gridiron</b> <b>plan</b> in the period 1770–1830 included Cuminestown, New Pitsligo, Tomintoul and Aberchirder. At Fochabers, from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a grid plan, with a central square focused on Bellie Church (1795–97), still following in the tradition of Gibbs, with a tetrastyle portico and steeple. From 1800, Robert Owen's New Lanark, designed as a self-contained community, combining industry with ordered and improved living conditions, was an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning. Housing was combined with generous communal and living spaces, a children's school and community education centre. It also introduced a village store that supplied good at lower prices and became the model for the co-operative movement.

500|$|With {{industrialisation}} Glasgow {{became the}} [...] "second {{city of the}} Empire", growing from a population of 77,385 in 1801 to 274,324 by 1841. Between 1780 and 1830 three middle class [...] "new towns" [...] were laid out on <b>gridiron</b> <b>plans,</b> {{similar to those in}} Edinburgh, to the south and west of the old town. The other side of increasing wealth and planned architecture for the aristocracy and middle classes was the growth of urban sprawl. In Glasgow the growing workforce was left to the mercy of market forces as sub-urban tenements were thrown up, particularly to the east of the city, like those of the Gorbals to the south, where overcrowding, lack of sanitation and general poverty contributed to disease, crime, and very low life expediency.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principle}} Structure and Coincidence remains relevant until now, {{both for}} housing schemes and urban planning. For housing schemes the following images were influential: the perspective {{drawing of the}} project [...] "Fort l'Empereur" [...] in Algiers by Le Corbusier (1934) and the isometric drawing of the housing scheme [...] "Diagoon" [...] in Delft by Herman Hertzberger (1971). At city level, important projects were: the Tokyo Bay Plan of Kenzo Tange (1960) and the fascinating images of {{the model of the}} Free University of Berlin by Candilis Josic & Woods (1963). Also, worth mentioning are the utopias of Metabolism, Archigram and Yona Friedman. In general, instruments for urban structuring are: traffic lines (e.g. <b>gridiron</b> <b>plans),</b> symmetries, squares, remarkable buildings, rivers, seashore, green areas, hills etc. These methods were also used in previous cities.|$|R

From the mid-eighteenth century this growing wealth and confidence was reflected in a classically inspired building boom focused on Edinburgh's New Town.

Most residences were built as tenement flats, divided horizontally, with different occupants sharing a common staircase, in contrast to the houses used in contemporaneous building in England. The smallest might have only one room; the largest, several bedrooms and drawing rooms. Common features of neo-classical building included columns, temple fronts, rounded arches, flanking wings and domes.

There was a lull in building after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses. Isolated examples included the houses that combined modern and traditional elements, designed by Basil Spence and built at Broughton Place (1936) and Gribloch (1937–9). After World War Two a shortage of building materials further reduced the number of large luxury houses. Isolated examples included Logan House, designed by David Style in the 1950s. In the 1960s there was Basil Hughes's design at Snaigow for the earl of Cadogan and the remodelling of Gask House by Claude Phillimore.

5|$|In the Middle Ages cruck timber {{construction}} {{was used in}} cottages, but the most common building material was stone. From the twelfth century, burghs contained the houses of significant inhabitants, but little has survived of the urban housing of the poor. In the early modern era most {{of the population was}} housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. Most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets, with temporary sheilings becoming permanent settlements. The standard layout of a house was a byre-dwelling or long house, with humans and livestock sharing a common roof. Cottages in the Highlands tended to be cruder while those from the Lowlands had distinct rooms and were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In towns, traditional thatched half-timbered houses occurred beside the larger, stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. In the eighteenth century new farm buildings replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. The Industrial Revolution transformed the scale of Scottish towns. <b>Gridiron</b> <b>plans</b> were used to lay out new towns in Edinburgh, Glasgow and smaller burghs. In Glasgow the growing workforce was lived in squalid sub-urban tenements like those of the Gorbals.

This culminated {{in the construction of}} Fort George, near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts. Scotland produced some of the most significant architects of this era, including: Colen Campbell (1676–1729), James Gibbs (1682–1754), James (1732–94), John (1721–92) and Robert Adam (1728–92) and William Chambers (1723–96), who all created work that to some degree looked to classical models. Edinburgh's New Town was the focus of this classical building boom in Scotland. From the mid-eighteenth century it was laid out according to a plan of rectangular blocks with open squares, drawn up by James Craig and built in strong Craigleith sandstone which could be precisely cut by masons. Most residences were built as tenement flats, where, in contrast to contemporary building in England where buildings were divided vertically into different houses, they were divided horizontally, with different occupants sharing a common staircase.

The <b>gridiron</b> <b>plan,</b> building forms and the architectural detailing would be copied by many smaller towns, although rendered in locally quarried materials. Despite this building boom, the centralisation of much of the government administration, including the king's works, in London, meant that a number of Scottish architects spent most of all of their careers in England, where they had a major impact on Georgian architecture.|$|E

40|$|In this {{overview}} of city planning in Graeco-Roman times, starting with Greek <b>gridiron</b> street <b>planning</b> and functional city zoning in the 9 th century BC, {{emphasis is placed}} on those aspects related to urban health and recreational activities. Etruscan-Roman expertise in hydraulic engineering facilitated the availability of ample water supplies, e. g. for public baths and latrines, and for efficient drainage systems, which had been problematic in the earlier Greek era. The Pax Romana obviated the need for defensive city walls and also potentiated the establishment and maintenance of long distance water supplies. Before the xenodocheia of the Christian era the only hospitals were Roman military institutions (valetudinaria) and some latifundia for sick slaves on large farms. Doctors practiced from very basic consulting facilities (iatreia, later tabernae). Graeco-Roman concepts of “death pollution” restricted structural burial facilities to a minimum, and situated outside the city walls. Greek recreation revolved around athletic sports practiced in stadia, gymnasia and occasionally in urban agoras; dramas were performed in open air theatres. The Romans preferred horse races and blood-thirsty sports in huge amphitheatres in which gladiators fought each other to the death...|$|R

The new gridiron plans were spectacular in their inefficiency and waste. By usually failing to discriminate sufficiently between main arteries and residential streets, the first were not made wide enough while the second were usually too wide for purely neighborhood functions... as for its contribution to the permanent social functions of the city, the anonymous <b>gridiron</b> <b>plan</b> proved empty." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this book is misleading. If the work carries one {{persistent}} message, {{it is that the}} cities of the American West were not planned at all. Conceived as speculations in land, yes; almost always designed {{in the form of a}} repetitive <b>gridiron,</b> yes; but <b>planned</b> in any twentieth-century sense of the word, definitely not. Only the southwestern Spanish towns and the Mormon towns of Deseret come close to being examples of 2 ̆ 2 urban planning. 2 ̆ 2 City planning, after all, only came along early in the twentieth century, and Reps clearly illustrates that few towns were established after 1890. The term planning, as Reps uses it, can perhaps best be defined as 2 ̆ 2 the determination of the initial physical layout of a town. 2 ̆ 2 Urban design would have been a better word choice. Though Reps notes that this volume is 2 ̆ 2 an elaboration of an unpublished 1977 conference paper, 2 ̆ 2 its parentage is clearly his major 1969 work, Cities of the American West: A History of Frontier Urban Planning (Princeton University Press, 795 pp. + index). It is from this work that Reps draws both reproductions and text, a fact he does not attempt to hide, as he often cites the 1969 work. The value of this newer volume therefore lies in its streamlined format. Compared to the encyclopedic, comprehensive parent volume, it is a highly readable book, with much of its space devoted to map reproductions of good quality. Reps points out, as other scholars do, that cities and towns were the stepping-stones of civilization on the frontier, and that 2 ̆ 2 new towns preceded or occurred simultaneously with the opening of lands for farming and ranching 2 ̆ 2 (p. 1). The book examines a series of 2 ̆ 2 detached frontiers 2 ̆ 2 -the Southwest, Texas, the Pacific Northwest, the mining frontier, the plains, railroad towns, towns of Zion, and the Oklahoma frontier. In any book, there are interpretations with which others will take issue. Here, for instance, Reps writes that 2 ̆ 2 the desire for some kind of urban order, however primitive, was deeply instilled in the minds of those who flocked 2 ̆ 2 to mining sites (p. 59). Yet the text makes it abundantly clear elsewhere that it was in fact the operation of the rent gradient and speculation in land, rather than some primordial psychological urge for order, that created the pattern of the towns. There are -few such unsupported statements, for the text is more encyclopedic than interpretative in nature. This quality is, indeed, the principal failure of the volume, for one is better drawn to the 1969 book for details; a bit more interpretation would have been useful. But the slighter volume makes a good supplemental reader in an urban history course. For this it can be highly recommended, and Reps merits praise for his efforts in making us aware of the initial physical layout of the American city...|$|R
