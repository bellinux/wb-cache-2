40|$|The {{relaxation}} process of one dimensional surface modulations is re-examined. Surface evolution {{is described in}} terms of a standard step flow model. Numerical evidence that the surface slope, D(x,t), obeys the scaling ansatz D(x,t) =alpha(t) F(x) is provided. We use the scaling ansatz to transform the <b>discrete</b> <b>step</b> model into a continuum model for surface dynamics. The model consists of differential equations for the functions alpha(t) and F(x). The solutions of these equations agree with simulation results of the <b>discrete</b> <b>step</b> model. We identify two types of possible scaling solutions. Solutions of the first type have facets at the extremum points, while in solutions of the second type the facets are replaced by cusps. Interactions between steps of opposite signs determine whether a system is of the first or second type. Finally, we relate our model to an actual experiment and find good agreement between a measured AFM snapshot and a solution of our continuum model. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures in 9 eps file...|$|R

They {{were used for the}} same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term [...] "voice coil" [...] in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back and forth, something like a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} Bonhoeffer–van der Pol (BVP for short) oscillator {{is transformed}} into a map-based BVP model by using the forward Euler scheme. At first, the bifurcations and chaos of the map-based BVP model are investigated when the step size varies as a bifurcation param-eter. By using the fast-slow decomposition technique, a two-parameter bifurcation diagram is obtained to give insight into the effect of the step size on bifurcations and chaos of the map-based BVP model. The investigation shows that the period-doubling bifurcation is dependent on the step size, while the saddle-node bifurcation is independent of the step size. Second, when the fast–slow decomposition technique cannot be used, we rigorously prove that in the map-based BVP model there exists chaos in the sense of Marotto when the <b>discrete</b> <b>step</b> size varies as a bifurcation parameter. These results show that the <b>discrete</b> <b>step</b> sizes play a vital role between the continuous-time dynamical system and the corresponding discrete dynamical system.

40|$|This work {{provides}} a {{ground for a}} quantitative interpretation of experiments on step bunching during sublimation of crystals with a pronounced Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) barrier in the regime of weak desorption. A strong step bunching instability takes place when the kinetic length {{is larger than the}} average distance between the steps on the vicinal surface. In the opposite limit the instability is weak and step bunching can occur only when the magnitude of step-step repulsion is small. The central result are power law relations of the between the width, the height, and the minimum interstep distance of a bunch. These relations are obtained from a continuum evolution equation for the surface profile, which is derived from the <b>discrete</b> <b>step</b> dynamical equations for. The analysis of the continuum equation reveals the existence of two types of stationary bunch profiles with different scaling properties. Through a mathematical equivalence on the level of the <b>discrete</b> <b>step</b> equations {{as well as on the}} continuum level, our results carry over to the problems of step bunching induced by growth with a strong inverse ES effect, and by electromigration in the attachment/detachment limited regime.
