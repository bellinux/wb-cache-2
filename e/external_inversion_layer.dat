40|$|Deposition of thin {{material}} films by sputtering is {{an increasingly}} common {{process in the}} field of silicon (Si) -based photovoltaics. One of the recently developed sputter-deposited materials applicable to Si photovoltaics comprises Si nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in a Si-based dielectric. The particular case of Si nanocrystals in a Silicon Dioxide (SiO 2) matrix was studied by fabricating metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) devices, in which the insulating layer consists of a single layer of Si NCs in SiO 2 deposited by sputtering (Si:NC-MIS devices). These test structures were subjected to impedance measurements. The presence of Si NCs was found to result in two distinct capacitance peaks. The first of these peaks is attributable to the small signal response of states at the insulator/substrate interface, enhanced by the presence of fixed charge associated with the NC layer. The second peak, which occurs without precedent, is due to <b>external</b> <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> coupling, in conjunction with a transition between tunnel-limited and semiconductor-limited electron current. Si:NC-MIS devices are also potential test structures for energy-selective contacts, based on SiO 2 /Si NC/SiO 2 double barrier structures fabricated by sputtering. Using a one-dimensional model, current-voltage (I-V) curve simulations were performed for similar structures, in which the Si NCs are replaced by a Si quantum well (QW). The simulations showed that for non-degenerately doped Si substrates, the density of defects in the SiO 2 layers can strongly influence the position of I-V curve structure induced by QW quasi-bound states. Passivation of crystalline Si (c-Si) surfaces by sputter-deposited dielectric films is another major application of sputtering for Si photovoltaics. This application was explored for the cases of sputtered SiO 2 and hydrogenated Silicon Oxy-Carbide (SiOC:H). For the case of sputtered SiO 2, an effective surface recombination velocity of 146 cm/s was achieved for an injection level of 1 E 15 cm&# 8722; 3. The investigated SiOC:H films were found to be unsuitable for surface passivation of Si, however their passivation performance could be slightly improved by first coating the Si surface with a chemically-grown or sputtered SiO 2 layer. The investigations performed into specific aspects of sputter-deposited SiO 2, Si NCs, and SiOC:H have highlighted important properties of these films, and confirmed the effectiveness of sputtering as a deposition technology for Si photovoltaics...|$|E

40|$|Silicon {{solar cells}} with induced {{junctions}} {{were created by}} forming an <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> near {{the surface of the}} silicon by supplying a sheet of positive charge above the surface. This charged layer was supplied through three mechanisms: (1) supplying a positive potential to a transparent electrode separated from the silicon surface by a dielectric, (2) contaminating the oxide layer with positive ions, and (3) forming donor surface states that leave a positive charge on the surface. A movable semi-infinite shadow delineated the extent of sensitivity of the cell due to the inversion region. Measurements of the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> cell response to light of different wavelengths indicated it to be more sensitive to the shorter wavelengths of the sun's spectrum than conventional cells. Theory of the conductance of the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> vs. strength of the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> was compared with experiment and found to match.

The results for the n-channel <b>inversion</b> <b>layers</b> of III-V, ternary and quaternary materials form a special case of our generalized analysis. The DMR for n-channel <b>inversion</b> <b>layers</b> of II-VI, IV-VI and stressed materials has been investigated by formulating the respective 2 D electron dispersion laws.

The well-known expression of the DMR for wide gap materials has been obtained as a special case under certain limiting conditions and this compatibility is an indirect test for our generalized formalism.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{crystalline}} silicon (c-Si) {{solar cells}} based on p-type substrates, <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> emitters {{have been proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} high-temperature phosphorus diffusion. Dielectric film deposition at low temperature (≤ 400 ºC) is widely used for c-Si surface passivation and in this case emitters are induced by the positive fixed charge, Qf, at the c-Si/dielectric interface. In this work, we use 2 -D simulations to explore solar cell structures with <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> emitters placed between local n+-emitters. The local diffusions could be defined by laser processing, resulting in potentially low-temperature processed structures. From simulation results, the low conductivity of <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> emitters obligates to short contact spacing and, hence, dense front grids and high shadow losses. However, placing the emitter at the back reduces these penalties, increasing the efficiency about 1 % absolute. Furthermore, taking advantage of the fully metallized back surface, <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> emitters can be assisted by the workfunction difference between the c-Si substrate and the metal (typically aluminum) over the dielectric. As a result, the necessity of a high positive Qf value is relaxed...|$|R

The GPS data are organized according to {{the height of the}} thermal tropopause in each profile, and a temperature <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> above the tropopause (with an average magnitude of 3 – 5 K) is found to be a ubiquitous, climatological feature. The GPS data show that the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> is present for all seasons in both hemispheres, spanning the subtropics to the pole, and there is not strong longitudinal structure. Dependence of the <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> on upper-troposphere vorticity is studied; while anticyclones exhibit a substantially stronger inversion than cyclones (as expected from balanced dynamics), the inversion is evident for all circulation types. Radiative transfer calculations indicate that strong gradients in both ozone and water vapor near the tropopause contribute to the inversion. Significant absorption of both longwave and shortwave radiation by ozone occurs, warming the region above the tropopause. Water vapor near and immediately above the tropopause contributes to cooling, effectively enhancing the inversion. 1...|$|R

A numerical model {{is used to}} quantify the role of cold-air-pooling processes in the dispersion of air pollution in a developing cold-air pool within an alpine valley under decoupled stable conditions. Results indicate that the negatively buoyant downslope flows transport and mix pollutants into the valley to depths that depend on the temperature deficit of the flow and the ambient temperature structure inside the valley. Along the slopes, pollutants are generally entrained above the cold-air pool and detrained within the cold-air pool, largely above the ground-based <b>inversion</b> <b>layer.</b> The ability of the cold-air pool to dilute pollutants is quantified. The analysis shows that the downslope flows fill the valley with air from above, which is then largely trapped within the cold-air pool, and that dilution depends on where the pollutants are emitted {{with respect to the}} positions of the top of the ground-based <b>inversion</b> <b>layer</b> and cold-air pool, and on the slope wind speeds. Over {{the lower part of the}} slopes, the cold-air-pool-averaged concentrations are proportional to the slope wind speeds where the pollutants are emitted, and diminish as the cold-air pool deepens.
