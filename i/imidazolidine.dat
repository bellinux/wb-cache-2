40|$|In this dissertation, {{two main}} ligandclasses have been studied: chiral diene ligands and chiral imidate ligands. We {{developed}} a novel route to synthesize chiral disubstituted bicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptadienes (R= i-Bu, c-Hex, Benzyl and allyl) starting from enantiomerically pure bistriflate. The synthesized diene ligands {{were tested in}} the rhodium(I) -catalyzed 1, 4 -addition of phenylboronic acids to cyclic enones (up to 96 % ee) and α-acetamido acrylic ester and in the rhodium(I) -catalyzed 1, 2 -addition of phenylboronic acids to benzaldehydes (up to 48 % ee). We introduced chiral imidates as a novel nitrogen-based ligand family. These imidates, with an exocyclic nitrogen, have never before been reported in literature. We showed that these imidate ligands could be obtained readily via a one-step synthesis starting from a central precursor in excellent yields. Moreover, imidate ligands could further be fine-tuned when substituents were put on the aromatic ring of the imidate ligand precursor. The synthesized monodentate and bidentate ligands were tested in several asymmetric test reactions. In the copper(I) -catalyzed asymmetric aziridinations, we obtained usually high yields (up to 90 % yield) and moderate enantioselectivity (51 % ee) with a bidentate imidate ligand. The asymmetric addition of diethylzinc to benzaldehyde resulted in high yields (up to 87 % yield) and good enantioselectivities (up to 76 % ee). However, the best result was obtained in the asymmetric allylic alkylation with an imidate with a binaphtylbackbone: a moderate yield (53 % yield) with an excellent selectivity (95 % ee). Futhermore, we developed successfully hybrid imidate-phosphane ligands as {{a new type of}} P,N ligands. These ligands are easily accessible in one step via a condensation of a commercially available aminophosphane and an imidate ligand precursor. The ligands were demonstrated to be highly valuable in palladium-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions. Excellent performance of this catalyst system was observed in the allylic alkylation of 1, 3 -diphenyl- 2 -propenyl acetate with various nucleophiles (up to 99 % yield and > 99 % ee). Moreover, the allylic alkylation of linear unhindered and cyclic substrates resulted in good conversions and enantioselectivities.
