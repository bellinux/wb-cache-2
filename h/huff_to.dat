5|$|The Giants {{finished}} with an 11–3 record in 1963 {{and faced the}} Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field in Chicago, the Giants' defense played well, but the Bears newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times and battered him throughout the game. Sherman resisted calls from players such as linebacker Sam <b>Huff</b> <b>to</b> replace the struggling Tittle. The Giants defense held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat.|$|E
5|$|The Giants made Garko a {{free agent}} {{following}} the 2009 season, but they signed Aubrey <b>Huff</b> <b>to</b> play first base. As a result, Ishikawa spent most of 2010 pinch-hitting, backing up Huff, and entering as a defensive replacement at first base late in games. Ishikawa hit his first home run of the year on April 7, against Jeff Fulchino of the Astros in a 104 victory at Minute Maid Park.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez was {{announced}} as the starter for the Eagles Week 11 {{game against the}} Buccaneers after {{it was revealed that}} Bradford suffered a separated shoulder and a concussion. Sanchez's opening drive was excellent, completing 100% of his passes and ending it with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Josh <b>Huff</b> <b>to</b> make the score 7-0. Sanchez continued to play well {{for the majority of the}} 1st half, and threw a second touchdown pass to Darren Sproles, but the Buccaneers offense had already scored 21 points. However, after that drive, Sanchez started to crumble, throwing an interception near the end of the second quarter. Sanchez finished the game with 3 interceptions, 1 of which was returned for a touchdown, in a humiliating 45-17 blowout. His 2 touchdown passes were the only points scored by the offense.|$|E

5|$|Dickinson {{went through}} knee surgery during the offseason, {{but there was}} still concern about whether he had a future in the NFL. That was set aside when he was {{considered}} to be progressing well in his recovery as of early July 1977. During the Buccaneers' offseason, the quarterbacks on the roster changed entirely, with Dickinson being the only holdover; Gary Huff was now the starter, and Dickinson was fighting for a backup role alongside Mike Boryla and Randy Hedberg. After the Buccaneers lost Boryla and <b>Huff</b> <b>to</b> injuries, the former for the season, Dickinson ended up being the starting quarterback for the team's final preseason game against the Bills. In the game, Dickinson completed 2 of 12 passes for -2yards and was sacked three times in a 176 loss. A week after the game against the Bills, Dickinson was released by the Buccaneers along with four other players. The Buccaneers re-signed him after Huff got injured in late October, but Dickinson was again released a couple weeks later.|$|E
25|$|Dennis Fryzel, {{coach of}} the Buccaneers’ much-criticized special teams, was {{replaced}} by USC offensive line coach Skip Husbands, who became the fifth USC assistant to join McKay in Tampa. Head trainer Dave Kendall was replaced by Northwestern University trainer Tom Oxley. Oxley was immediately given the task of rehabilitating the previous season's seventeen players who finished the year on injured reserve. A surprise trade brought Chicago Bears backup quarterback and Tampa native Gary <b>Huff</b> <b>to</b> the team, while incumbent quarterback Steve Spurrier was placed on waivers. Spurrier and McKay had often feuded during the previous season. McKay stated that cutting Spurrier meant {{that he would have}} a choice of teams with whom to sign. A rumored attempt to make a deal for Cleveland Browns quarterback Mike Phipps was denied, although a trade was later made for Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Mike Boryla.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{a protest}} was started when Andy Flower was taken by a friend, Nigel <b>Huff,</b> <b>to</b> see a farm {{impacted}} by the government's land reforms. In 2000, Robert Mugabe and the Zimbabwean government had begun a plan of land reforms for redistribution of 3,000 farms, and began compulsorily seizing land from white farmers, with forced evictions and arrests {{on the basis of}} [...] "illegally occupying their land". By 2002, it was estimated that around 80% of the 4,500 farms that had been white-owned had been forcibly seized. Another related issue was human rights abuses and violence, particularly against political opponents in the leadup to the 2002 Zimbabwe presidential election. The EU had imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's ruling elite, which, as of 2017, are still in place. Flower was particularly appalled by the torture of Zimbabwean MP Job Sikhala.|$|E

2500|$|The New Orleans Saints {{did not get}} a {{first down}} until midway through the second quarter, and did not get past midfield until nearly the end of the half. The Buccaneers began their first five drives in Saints territory, scoring on two Dave Green field goals, and a five-yard pass from Gary <b>Huff</b> <b>to</b> Morris Owens that capped off a 71-yard drive. Mike Washington made it 20–0 early in the second half, {{returning}} an interception 45 yards for a touchdown. The Buccaneers also recovered a fumble, and had six interceptions in all. Their three interception return touchdowns, with Richard Wood and Greg Johnson also scoring, tied an NFL record. Before the game, John McKay had read the team an article in which Saints’ quarterback Archie Manning stated that it would be disgraceful to lose to Tampa Bay. Inspired by the statements, the Buccaneer defense yelled, [...] "It's disgraceful! It's disgraceful!" [...] at him as the clock wound down. Saints coach Hank Stram was so outraged at the defeat he allegedly ordered the game film burned.|$|E
2500|$|The Detroit Lions gained 404 {{yards in}} the Buccaneers’ worst {{defensive}} performance since 1976. Horace King became only the third running [...] back in two seasons to gain 100 yards against the Buccaneers. Three defenders missed tackles on his 75-yard touchdown run. Gary Danielson completed 15 of 24 passes for 206 yards and two touchdowns, both to David Hill. John McKay blamed the poor performance on mental errors, such as three defenders covering one receiver while the other remained open. The Lions also {{took advantage of the}} inexperience of middle linebacker Rik Bonness, who was playing at the unfamiliar outside linebacker position due to injuries to Cecil Johnson and Dana Nafziger. The depletion of the linebacker corps required a shift to a 4–3 defense, which the players had difficulty adjusting to. McKay said, [...] "If I had a gun, I would have shot our guys", of all the receivers left open. Buccaneers quarterbacks were sacked eight times, five times by Bubba Baker. The Buccaneers scored on touchdown passes from Mike Rae to Jim Obradovich and from Gary <b>Huff</b> <b>to</b> George Ragsdale. Neil O'Donoghue kicked three field goals, including a club-record 49-yarder. The loss left the Buccaneers and Lions tied for last place in the NFC Central.|$|E

6000|$|Thus a titillating {{fortnight}} {{was passed}} by young Stockdale, during which time things proceeded much as such matters have done ever {{since the beginning of}} history. He saw the object of attachment several times one day, did not see her at all the next, met her when he least expected to do so, missed her when hints and signs as to where she should be at a given hour almost amounted to an appointment. This mild coquetry was perhaps fair enough under the circumstances of their being so closely lodged, and Stockdale put up with it as philosophically as he was able. Being in her own house, she could, after vexing him or disappointing him of her presence, easily win him back by suddenly surrounding him with those little attentions which her position as his landlady put it in her power to bestow. When he had waited indoors half the day to see her, and on finding that she would not be seen, had gone off in a <b>huff</b> <b>to</b> the dreariest and dampest walk he could discover, she would restore equilibrium in the evening with 'Mr. Stockdale, I have fancied you must feel draught o' nights from your bedroom window, and so I have been putting up thicker curtains this afternoon while you were out;' or, 'I noticed that you sneezed twice again this morning, Mr. Stockdale. Depend upon it that cold is hanging about you yet; I am sure it is--I have thought of it continually; and you must let me make a posset for you.' ...|$|E
