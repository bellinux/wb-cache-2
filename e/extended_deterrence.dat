25|$|Some {{scholars}} hypothesized the PRC {{backed down}} {{in the face of}} American nuclear brinksmanship and in light of the lack of willingness by the Soviet Union to threaten nuclear retaliation for an attack on the PRC. Others see the case as an example of effective application of <b>extended</b> <b>deterrence</b> by the United States. In any case, the Red Chinese government stated on April 23, 1955, that it was willing to negotiate. On May 1 the PLA temporarily ceased shelling Kinmen and Matsu. The fundamental issues of the conflict remained unresolved, however, and both sides subsequently built up their military forces on their respective sides of the Taiwan Strait leading to a new crisis three years later. There are strong indications that Mao used the crisis in order to provoke the United States into making nuclear threats. Other scholars have argued that Mao and the Soviet leadership carefully pursued a limited aims strategy to boost morale and for domestic political gain by seizing the Dachens and had no intention to escalate the conflict with the United States.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{qualitative}} case study {{analysis of the}} whether the nuclear policies of President Obama has weakened the U. S. <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> credibility on the Korean Peninsula. To answer this, the thesis employs two strategies: First, two variables are discussed; a nuclear capabilities-variable; and a nuclear policy-variable. The purpose is {{to assess the impact}} the New START treaty has on U. S. nuclear capabilities, and to assess the implications of Obama`s nuclear policy, expressed in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), for <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> credibility. Second, the deterrence situation on the Korean Peninsula is examined in detail. This is done in an effort to uncover evidence of weakened <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> credibility. By first analyzing the hostile actions of North Korea, the thesis discusses whether the actions since 2008 are caused by internal or external factors. Thereafter, the South Korean responses to the 2010 NPR are discussed, and considerable time is devoted to the calls for redeployment of U. S. tactical nuclear weapons, and whether these calls can be attributed to weakened <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> credibility. The discussions of the two variables, and the deterrence situation on the Korean Peninsula, paint a clear picture: President Obama`s nuclear policies, as expressed in the 2010 NPR and New START, have not weakened the <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> credibility on the Korean Peninsula. First, the impact of New START on the U. S. strategic nuclear arsenal is small, and all war-waging abilities remain the same, as well as secure second-strike capability. Second, the 2010 NPR, although attempting to reduce the salience of nuclear weapons in U. S. strategic thinking, reaffirms the commitment to defend allies with nuclear weapons. Furthermore, North Korea is exempt from the Negative Security Assurance provided in the NPR. And third, the actions of North Korea are generated by internal, not external factors, and the South Korean calls for redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons are generated by the North Korean actions, not by weakened U. S. <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> credibility...|$|R

The US-led alliances that rest on <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> have been characterized as hegemonic in the forty years of Cold War in the Gramscian sense of hegemonic, that is, allied elites accepted US leadership based on its legitimating ideology of <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence,</b> institutional integration, and unique American nuclear forces that underpinned the alliances. 2 A crucial aspect of American nuclear hegemony in Asia was the guarantee that the hegemon would ensure that no adversary could break out of the system after China&# 039;s 1964 successful nuclear test, as expressed by the Non Proliferation Treaty and IAEA safeguard system. The failure of the United States to stop and now reverse the DPRK nuclear over the previous two decades threatens its hegemonic leadership in Northeast Asia, and is linked to the decreasing ability of American power to shape events in other proliferation-prone regions such as South and West Asia...|$|R

50|$|As {{outlined}} by Huth, {{a policy of}} deterrence can fit into two broad categories being (i) preventing an armed attack against a state's own territory (known as direct deterrence); or (ii) preventing an armed attack against another state (known as <b>extended</b> <b>deterrence).</b> Situations of direct deterrence often occur {{when there is a}} territorial dispute between neighboring states in which major powers like the United States do not directly intervene. On the other hand, situations of <b>extended</b> <b>deterrence</b> often occur when a great power becomes involved. It is the latter that has generated the majority of interest in academic literature. Building on these two broad categories, Huth goes on to outline that deterrence policies may be implemented in response to a pressing short-term threat (known as immediate deterrence) or as strategy to prevent a military conflict or short term threat from arising (known as general deterrence).|$|E

The plans envision Deveselu Air Base hosting land-based Standard Missile- 3 (SM- 3) interceptors by 2015, {{as part of the}} Aegis Ashore (AA) System. This vision is important because the United States, Romania, and other NATO allies face ballistic missile threats, particularly amid the increasingly unsettled situation in the Middle East. The EPAA also marks a major development in the broader context of policy and strategy, both within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and between NATO and other states in the regions, as NATO and the United States thereby both significantly <b>extend</b> <b>deterrence</b> in expanding their BMD reach.

40|$|This study {{advances}} four propositions on {{the role}} of nuclear weapons in national security in the twenty-first century strategic environment. First, the primary role of nuclear weapons now and in the foreseeable future is basic or central deterrence. Nuclear weapons also prevent blackmail, preserve strategic autonomy (freedom to act), and provide insurance to cope with unanticipated developments in a changing strategic environment. Second, although deterrence continues to be the dominant role and strategy for the employment of nuclear weapons, the conception and practice of deterrence is different from the mutual assured destruction condition that characterized the Soviet-American nuclear confrontation during the Cold War and varies across countries. Deterrence in the contemporary era is largely asymmetric in nature with weaker powers relying on nuclear weapons to deter stronger adversaries. Third, the absence of severe confrontations and the limited capabilities of the relatively small Asian nuclear arsenals have resulted in general deterrence postures. The United States seeks capabilities to deal with a wide array of threats, but it does not confront an immediate conflict or crisis situation that warrants actor-specific threats that could result in nuclear retaliation. Finally, <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> continues to be important to the national security of U. S. allied states in East Asia. China and certainly India and Pakistan do not have the capability or the strategic imperative to provide strategic protection to an ally against a threat from another nuclear power. Russia has the capability and plans to <b>extend</b> the <b>deterrence</b> function of its nuclear arsenal to protect Byelorussia and Armenia...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the Nautilus Institute&# 039;s exploration of two inter-linked but highly contested aspects of the strategic nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula: the complexity and uncertainty associated with US assurances of nuclear <b>extended</b> <b>deterrence</b> to South Korea (and Japan), and the potential contribution of a nuclear-weapon-free zone to shifting the current impasse concerning North Korean nuclear weapons. The theoretical inquiry into the current state of nuclear <b>extended</b> <b>deterrence</b> is followed by an examination of the necessity, viability and desirability of reformed versions of nuclear <b>extended</b> <b>deterrence</b> (such as collective deterrence), and of three conceivable generic alternatives to reliance upon nuclear extended deterrence: namely nuclear rejection, nuclear recession, and conventional deterrence (possibly combined with existential nuclear deterrence). A bilateral nuclear-weapon-free zone, with the door held open to North Korea to join at a later stage, would act as a circuit-breaker in the stalemated nuclear confrontation; prefigure a US negative security guarantee to North Korea in a future rapprochement; and reduce ongoing regional anxieties by locking both South Korea and Japan into a legally binding non-nuclear security postur...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{developments in}} the system of United States nuclear hegemony in East Asia deriving from North Korea’s drive for nuclear weapons. Hayes argues that “the nuclear threat projected by the US in this hegemonic system drove the DPRK to adopt a nuclear weapons proliferation strategy that was aimed at compelling the United States to change its policies towards the DPRK. The latter’s successful nuclear breakout demonstrates that today, the hegemon has no clothes, that is, it is not capable of stopping nuclear breakout by a key adversary. ” Arguing that the reinforcing of guarantees of <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> will be unsuccessful and “will lead to eventual nuclear proliferation by the allies themselves”, Hayes concludes that only conventional deterrence “is likely to curb the DPRK’s nuclear threat, head off long-run proliferation by the ROK and Japan, and by realigning its legitimating ideology (“Global Abolition”) with alliance institutions and force structures, restore the now rapidly dwindling US hegemony in the region. ”  Image: 2 ̆ 7 North Korean Nuclear Reactor Construction Site 2 ̆ 7, Podknox / flick...|$|R

United States foreign policy towards the Asia - Pacific region is set to be fundamentally altered by two d evelopments in Washington’s defence policy. The first, much publicised change is the announcement of a so - called pivot towards the region in terms of overall defence strategy. The second, largely going unnoticed but occurring {{at roughly the same}} time, is a move towards a far greater role for advanced conventional weaponry in the US defence posture and the subsequent effect on <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence</b> thinking and practice. This article analyses the interaction of these two trends and discusses a central tension between short - term and long - term challenges for the United States arising from this situation, and suggests that contrary to current developments, either a freeze in the deployment of a number of advanced conventional weapons programmes or a return to a strategy underpinned by traditional notions of nuclear deterrence may provide the most productive basis for future regional security and stability.

Such a policy could easily be {{construed}} as an example of almost automatic confidence in the US nuclear umbrella, yet only on the surface did <b>extended</b> <b>deterrence</b> appease Italian anxieties about the uncertainties of the American nuclear guarantee. The Italian rationale for accepting a large array of US nuclear weapon s did as a matter of fact involve a complex mix of reasons, ranging from trying to ensure that the Italian government would be consulted in the event of a major crisis, to willingness to enhance the country’s profile inside any Western multilateral fora. The paper will investigate this policy by looking at how the Italian government behaved at the height of the NATO nuclear sharing debate, between 1957 and 1962, arguably one of the historical moments in the Cold War when the concept of <b>extended</b> <b>deterrence</b> was most intensely discussed.

Extended nuclear assurance, all too frequently confused with <b>extended</b> nuclear <b>deterrence,</b> faces a daunting series of challenges: a US strategic mainstream fractured on the roles and purposes of nuclear weapons; an Asia where assurance demands are high {{during a period of}} strategic uncertainty; and a US theatre- and tactical-range nuclear arsenal much depleted from its heyday. Meanwhile, nuclear latency is growing in Asia as more countries reach the technological level that the US attained in 1945, as nuclear skill sets become more prevalent, and as delivery vehicles appropriate to nuclear weapons become more typical in regional arsenals. The US now provides extended nuclear assurance to nearly 40 countries worldwide, agreeing to run nuclear risks on behalf of its allies and friends. The bulk of those assurances derive from the NATO alliance, but it is the non-NATO-related assurances-and settings-that seem likely to be the more controversial ones over the next decade or two. Asia is coming into its own at a time when extended nuclear assurance needs reinvigoration as a key ingredient in US strategic policy.

An {{increasing number of}} information security breaches in organisations presents {{a serious threat to}} the confidentiality of personal and commercially sensitive data. While recent research shows that humans are the weakest link in the security chain and the root cause of a great portion of security breaches, the extant security literature tends to focus on technical issues.

The methodology adapted for this study draws on the analytical grounded theory approach employing a constant comparative method. Findings: This paper demonstrates that procedural security countermeasures and organisational culture tend to affect security behaviour in organisational settings. Research limitations/implications: This paper fills the void in information security research and takes its place amongst the very few studies that focus on behavioural as opposed to technical issues.
