Several old and hideous princesses who are enormously poor have proposed for your hand, and I think it high time you began to think of making one of them unhappy.|$|E

25|$|The term fly {{is applied}} by sea {{fishermen}} {{to a certain}} arrangement of feathers, wax, etc., which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to describe the manufacture of, and which may be used with considerable success in mackerel, basse, and pollack fishing. I am not disposed to think, however, that such baits are ever mistaken by the fish which {{they are intended to}} capture for flies; but the number used, {{the way in which they}} are mounted, viz., several on one trace, and the method of their progress through the water, rather leads me to the belief that they are mistaken for a number of small fry, and treated accordingly.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of separating the prefix of the infinitive mode from the verb, by {{the intervention of}} an adverb, is not unfrequent among uneducated persons… I am not conscious, that any rule has been heretofore given in relation to this point… The practice, however, of not separating the particle from its verb, is so general and uniform among good authors, and the exceptions are so rare, that the rule which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to propose will, I believe, prove to be as accurate as most rules, and may be found beneficial to inexperienced writers. It is this :—The particle, TO, which comes before the verb in the infinitive mode, must {{not be separated from}} it by the intervention of an adverb or any other word or phrase; but the adverb should immediately precede the particle, or immediately follow the verb.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Budan's theorem was of such great importance, the {{appearance}} of Sturm's theorem in 1827 gave it (and Vincent's theorem) the death blow. Sturm's theorem solved the real root isolation problem, by defining the precise number of real roots a polynomial has in a real open interval (a, b); moreover, Sturm himself, p.108, acknowledges the great influence Fourier's theorem had on him: « C'est en m'appuyant sur les principes qu'il a posés, et en imitant ses démonstrations, que j'ai trouvé les nouveaux théorèmes que je vais énoncer. » which translates to «It is by relying upon the principles he has laid out and by imitating his proofs that I have found the new theorems which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to present.» Because of the above, the theorems by Fourier and Sturm appear in almost all the books on the theory of equations and Sturm's method for computing the real roots of polynomials {{has been the only}} one widely known and used ever since – up to about 1980, when it was replaced (in almost all computer algebra systems) by methods derived from Vincent's theorem, the fastest one being the Vincent–Akritas–Strzeboński (VAS) method.|$|E

[...] For her six years in Congress, Ferraro had an average 78percent [...] "Liberal Quotient" [...] from Americans for Democratic Action and an average 8percent rating from the American Conservative Union. The AFL-CIO's Committee on Political Education gave her an average approval rating of 91percent.|$|E

In November, she posted a note on her Facebook account stating: [...] "Writing Pure Heroine was my way of enshrining our teenage glory, putting it up in lights forever so that part of me never dies, and this record— well, this one is about what comes next. ...The party is about to start. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to show you the new world." ...|$|E

500|$|The Duke and Duchess {{settled in}} France.

In it he appealed for peace, saying [...] "I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I am convinced that could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war." [...] The broadcast was heard across the world and by millions in America. It was widely seen as supporting appeasement, and the BBC refused to broadcast it. It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radio and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.|$|E
500|$|Days after President George W. Bush {{nominated}} Second District Congressman Rob Portman to be United States Trade Representative in March 2005, McEwen {{announced he}} would run for Portman's seat. He then moved {{from his home in}} Fairfax Station, Virginia and purchased a second residence, a condominium in Hamilton County's Anderson Township, east of Cincinnati. McEwen drew upon his connections and quickly had high-profile endorsements from Focus on the Family leader James Dobson, former United States Attorney General Edwin Meese, Cincinnati Bengals player Anthony Muñoz, American Family Association president Donald Wildmon, Citizens for Community Values anti-pornography crusader Phil Burress, and former New York congressman Jack Kemp, who came to the district to campaign for him. Kemp said in a rally in Clermont County on May 20 that [...] "Bob and his wife Liz are like part of our family." [...] Dobson wrote in his endorsement letter, [...] "I have rarely been more excited about a candidate running in a highly significant race than <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> Bob McEwen for Congress... If Bob returns to the House of Representatives, he will once again emerge as a tireless champion for the family and for traditional conservative values." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the family's keenest {{customers}} was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, {{a wealthy}} collector from Lincolnshire, who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became {{disturbed by the}} family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, {{they were at the}} point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf. He wrote to the palaeontologist Gideon Mantell on 5 March that year to say that the sale was [...] "for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost all the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied." [...] The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised £400 (worth the equivalent of over £26,000 in 2010). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.|$|E

Nunn reinforced that agenda during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School on October 21, 2008, saying, [...] "I’m much more concerned about a terrorist without a return address that cannot be deterred than <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> deliberate war between nuclear powers.
