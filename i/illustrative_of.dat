5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence {{has found that}} the pendant was made from a highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper. It is likely that the gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is <b>illustrative</b> <b>of</b> the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-1970s, the Conservative Party {{was mostly}} {{controlled}} by one-nation conservatives. The {{rise of the}} New Right in conservative politics led to a critique of one-nation conservatism which contended that Keynesian economics and welfarism had damaged the economy and society. The Winter of Discontent of 1978–79 was portrayed by the New Right as <b>illustrative</b> <b>of</b> the overextension of the state. Figures such as Margaret Thatcher believed that to reverse the national decline, {{it was necessary to}} revive old values of individualism and challenge the dependency culture created by the welfare state.|$|E
5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. <b>Illustrative</b> <b>of</b> this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E

5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively <b>illustrative</b> <b>of</b> the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E

25|$|Every apology is, however, due to {{the reader}} for the hasty and {{imperfect}} execution of the plates. Having much more serious work in hand, and desiring merely to render them <b>illustrative</b> <b>of</b> my meaning, I have sometimes very completely failed even of that humble aim; and the text, being generally written before the illustration was completed, sometimes naively describes as sublime or beautiful features which the plates represents by a blot.

25|$|Evelyn's Diary {{remained}} unpublished as {{a manuscript}} until 1818. It is in a quarto volume containing 700 pages, covering {{the years between}} 1641 and 1697, and is continued in a smaller book – which brings the narrative down to within three weeks of its author's death. A selection from this was edited by William Bray, {{with the permission of}} the Evelyn family, in 1818, under the title of Memoirs <b>illustrative</b> <b>of</b> the Life and Writings of John Evelyn, comprising his Diary from 1641 to 1705/6, and a Selection of his Familiar Letters.

25|$|The Shahnameh {{provides}} a poetic {{account of the}} prehistory and history of Iran, beginning {{with the creation of}} the world and the introduction of the arts of civilization (fire, cooking, metallurgy, law), and ending with the Islamic Conquest of Persia. The work is not precisely chronological, but there is a general movement through time. Some of the characters live for hundreds of years but most have normal life spans. There are many shāhs who come and go, as well as heroes and villains, who also come and go. The only lasting images are those of Greater Persia itself, and of a succession of sunrises and sunsets, no two ever exactly alike, yet <b>illustrative</b> <b>of</b> the passage of time.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Samuel Maverick ever owned any other cattle and no other stock at all, beyond a few horses. One can reasonably doubt that a man who was not in the cattle business and who did not work with or live near his herd would have been engaged in branding strays. The record suggests that it was nothing more than lack of interest in property he never wanted that led to his name becoming associated {{with one of the most}} enduring terms of the Old West and a natural subject for every manner of speculation and inventive tale. The accounts conveyed by other contributors have been left unaltered, to be taken, together with Mrs. Maverick's material, as <b>illustrative</b> <b>of</b> this phenomenon.|$|E
