5|$|Wax {{resist dyeing}} of <b>fabric</b> <b>is</b> an ancient art form. It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, {{where it was}} used to wrap mummies; linen was soaked in wax, and {{scratched}} using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal. These African version however, uses cassava starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of beeswax.|$|E

25|$|BMW {{said the}} flexible, {{stretchable}} water resistant translucent man-made fabric skin– polyurethane-coated Spandex, is resilient and durable. It resists {{high or low}} temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not slacken or damage the fabric. The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The <b>fabric</b> <b>is</b> stretched over a moveable frame; essential shapes are formed beneath the skin by an aluminium wire structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used. The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators; for example, the headlights are revealed when small motors pull the fabric back in an eyelid like fashion. As the <b>fabric</b> <b>is</b> translucent the taillights shine through it.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{a highly}} {{texturized}} fiberglass fabric {{was invented by}} Bal Dixit, called Zetex.

25|$|A further {{possibility}} is mercerizing {{during which the}} <b>fabric</b> <b>is</b> treated with caustic soda solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or shrinkage will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on grey cloth, or after bleaching.|$|E
40|$|Many {{biological}} {{plants have}} bifacial leaves with an adaxial sur{{face and a}}n abaxial surface. These two surfaces can often have different morphologies and properties, and they serve different functions in plant growth. This has inspired us to develop novel bifacial fabrics, with a knitted structure on one face and a woven structure on the other. Bifacial <b>fabrics</b> <b>were</b> produced on a purpose-built machine, using wool, acrylic and polyester yarns, with the woven structure being plain weave, and the knitted structure being single jersey. In this study, the moisture properties of these <b>fabrics</b> <b>were</b> compared with conventional woven and knitted fabrics. The water contact angles of the bifacial <b>fabrics</b> <b>were</b> similar to knitted and woven fabrics, but the absorption time on the woven <b>fabric</b> <b>was</b> {{much higher than the}} other fabrics. Liquid moisture transfer properties on both faces of the bifacial <b>fabrics</b> <b>were</b> different, with water spreading and absorption on the woven face being quicker than on the knitted face. These unique properties of bifacial fabrics show that these <b>fabrics</b> could <b>be</b> used as moisture management fabrics, without the need for any additional treatments...|$|R

50|$|Woven ceramic fabrics {{allow for}} the {{opportunity}} to create new, imaginative solutions for previously impossible problems. These <b>fabrics</b> <b>are</b> utilized for thermal, mechanical and electrical applications for a variety of reasons. Ceramic-impregnated <b>fabrics</b> <b>are</b> most importantly used in three main fields: aerospace, electronic, and industrial.

Ceramic-impregnated <b>fabrics</b> <b>are</b> utilized in aerospace because they have low thermal conductivity and can be fabricated into high temperature thermal insulators. In the electronic industry, the <b>fabrics</b> <b>are</b> used primarily for insulation and seals, because of its low porosity. Ceramic fabric's industrial uses include furnace linings, furnace zone dividers, door seals, tube seals, gaskets, and expansion joints. In addition to being an effective thermal insulator, these fabrics do not shrink or elongate with high temperature changes, making them useful for industrial uses that involve high temperatures.|$|R
