5|$|General {{relativity}} can {{be understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics.

5|$|For surfaces, the {{generalization}} from {{the geometry of}} a plane –a flat surface– {{to that of a}} general curved surface had been described in the early 19th century by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This description had in turn been generalized to higher-dimensional spaces in a mathematical formalism introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s. With the help of Riemannian geometry, Einstein formulated a <b>geometric</b> <b>description</b> of gravity in which Minkowski's spacetime is replaced by distorted, curved spacetime, just as curved surfaces are a generalization of ordinary plane surfaces. Embedding Diagrams are used to illustrate curved spacetime in educational contexts.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{consistency}} between a quantum description {{of matter and}} a <b>geometric</b> <b>description</b> of spacetime, {{as well as the}} appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate description of the interior of black holes, and of the very early universe, a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics. Despite major efforts, no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known, even though a number of promising candidates exist.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{universality}} of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion {{under the influence of}} the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time—in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary Euclidean geometry. However, spacetime as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not integrable. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting Newton–Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system. In this <b>geometric</b> <b>description,</b> tidal effects—the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall—are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to give a <b>geometric</b> <b>description</b> of some inversive planes, indeed, of all known inversive planes. An ovoid in PG(3,q) {{is a set of}} q2+1 points, no three collinear. It can be shown that every plane (which is a hyperplane since the geometric dimension is 3) of PG(3,q) meets an ovoid O in either 1 or q+1 points. The plane sections of size q+1 of O are the blocks of an inversive plane of orderq. Any inversive plane arising this way is called egglike. All known inversive planes are egglike.|$|E
