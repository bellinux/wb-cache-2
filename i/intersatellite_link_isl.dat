40|$|In many recent low {{earth orbit}} (LEO) {{satellite}} networks, line-of-sight (LOS) wireless <b>links,</b> called <b>intersatellite</b> <b>links</b> (<b>ISL's),</b> are used to enhance the capability of the networks.

In this paper, we propose a call admission control scheme that aims {{to reduce the number}} blocked ongoing calls that occur {{at the time of the}} topological change. To estimate the number of blocked ongoing calls, which is needed to control the admission of new calls, the proposed scheme uses two techniques: traffic recasting and traffic projection.

40|$|In LEO mobile {{satellite}} network, the L/S frequency availability is {{an essential}} task for global communication but entails several major technical challenges: high sampling rate required for wideband sensing, limited power and computing resources for processing load, and frequency-selective wireless fading.

In this paper, we propose {{to add a}} spaceborne annular beam antenna for receiving the global positioning system (GPS) and global navigation satellite system (GLONASS) signals; therefore, the BDS satellites may be capable of determining their orbits by GPS/GLONASS signals. Firstly, the spectrum selection, the power isolation, the range of Doppler frequency shift, and changing rate {{are taken into account}} for the feasibility. Specifically, the L 2 band signals are chosen for receiving and processing in order to prevent the overlapping of the receiving and transmitting signals. Secondly, the minimum number of visible satellites (MNVS), carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N 0), dilution of precision (GDOP), and geometric distance root-mean-square (gdrms) are evaluated for acquiring the effective receiving antennas’ coverage ranges.

40|$|The <b>intersatellite</b> <b>links</b> (<b>ISL's)</b> at {{geostationary}} orbit {{is currently a}} missing link in commercial satellite services. Prior {{studies have found that}} potential application of ISL's to domestic, regional, and global satellites will provide more cost-effective services than the non-ISL's systems (i. e., multiple-hop systems). In addition, ISL's can improve and expand the existing satellite services in several aspects. For example, ISL's can conserve the scarce spectrum allocated for fixed satellite services (FSS) by avoiding multiple hopping of the relay stations. ISL's can also conserve prime orbit slot by effectively expanding the geostationary arc. As a result of the coverage extension by using ISL's more users will have direct access to the satellite network, thus providing reduced signal propagation delay and improved signal quality. Given the potential benefits of ISL's system, it is of interest to determine the appropriate implementations for some potential ISL architectures. Summary of the selected ISL network architecture as supplied by NASA are listed. The projected high data rate requirements (greater than 400 Mbps) suggest that high frequency RF or optical implementations are natural approaches. Both RF and optical systems have their own merits and weaknesses which make the choice between them dependent on the specific application. Due to its relatively mature technology base, the implementation risk associated with RF (at least 32 GHz) is lower than that of the optical ISL's. However, the relatively large antenna size required by RF ISL's payload may cause real-estate problems on the host spacecraft. In addition, because of the frequency sharing (for duplex multiple channels communications) within the limited bandwidth allocated, RF ISL's are more susceptible to inter-system and inter-channel interferences. On the other hand, optical ISL's can offer interference-free transmission and compact sized payload. However, the extremely narrow beam widths (on the order of 10 micro-rad) associated with optical ISL's impose very stringent pointing, acquisition, and tracking requirements on the system. Even if the RF and optical systems are considered separately, questions still remain as to selection of RF frequency, direct versus coherent optical detection, etc. in implementing an ISL for a particular network architecture. These and other issues are studied...|$|R
