40|$|Introduction: Androgenetic {{alopecia}} (AGA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common dermatologic disorders with a multifactorial etiology. Inflammatory activators such as Demodex infestation may play a role in the pathogenesis of some cases of androgenetic alopecia that do not respond to common treatments such as minoxidil and finasteride. The goal of this study is to evaluate the relationship between Demodex infestation and AGA. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 41 patients with AGA referred to the Dermatology Clinic of Imam Reza Hospital and 33 healthy individuals were evaluated as control. All of them were between 20 and 40 years old men. In order to identify Demodex infestation they were referred to the Parasitology laboratory. Results: Demodex was detected in 19. 5 &#x 0025; of patients and 15. 2 &#x 0025; of controls; therefore, there was no significant relationship between them statistically (P = 0. 0787). Most of patients (85. 4 &#x 0025;) had greasy hair. The most common pattern of baldness was <b>II</b> <b>degree</b> in Hamilton <b>scale.</b> Conclusion: There is no relation between AGA and Demodex...|$|R
40|$|Mapping of {{projective}} creations {{which includes}} the <b>II</b> <b>degree</b> surfaces in the projective, general collinear spaces is complex. In order to simplify it, firstly the characteristic parameters must be constructively determined: vanishing planes, axes and centers of spaces. All <b>II</b> <b>degree</b> surfaces are mapped using the common elements of absolute conic and infinitely distant conic of quadrics in the infinitely distant plane of space, which provide the determination of parameters of any surface of <b>II</b> <b>degree.</b> The common elements of their associated pair of conics in vanishing plane of space are used. The paper analyzed the conditions of choice of general surface of <b>II</b> <b>degree</b> in the first space to be mapped into the respective general surface of <b>II</b> <b>degree</b> in the second collinear space. The mapping is biunivocal. A sphere is chosen in the first space, and it was analyzed {{how it should be}} placed in respect to the characteristic parameters of the space, so that it would be mapped in rotating or triaxial general surfaces of <b>II</b> <b>degree</b> in the second space...|$|R
