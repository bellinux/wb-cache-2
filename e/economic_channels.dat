40|$|The chapter {{characterizes the}} Chinese migrant {{economic}} integration in Italy in three ways. First, in a globalized world, migration flows are not discrete processes, but create permanent international links through different <b>economic</b> <b>channels.</b> We identify investments, remittances, and international trade {{as examples of}} these ties. Second, migrant integration occurs at different territorial scales, with the local level being the most interesting. Chinese firms and migrant remittances are embedded in a local context, and follow the geography of territorial change. Third and most important, liabilities and outsidership are ambivalent. The statistical analysis shows that Chinese communities would not have filled the gap left in Italian industrial districts by the industrial decline in the textile sector without their connection to their homeland. The growth of second-generation migrants and their embeddedness in the local communities of the receiving country is strategic, drawing {{a picture of a}} transilient migrant community...|$|E
40|$|Married {{people live}} longer than singles but {{how much of the}} {{longevity}} differential is causal and what the particular mechanisms are is not fully understood. In this paper we propose a new approach, based on counterfactual computational experiments, in order to asses how much of the marriage gap can be explained by public-goods sharing and collective bargaining of partners with different preferences and biology. For that purpose we integrate cooperative decision making of a couple into a biologically-founded life-cycle model of health deficit accumulation and endogenous longevity. We calibrate the model with U. S. data and perform the counterfactual experiment of preventing the partnership. We elaborate three <b>economic</b> <b>channels</b> and find that, as singles, men live 8. 5 months shorter and women 6 months longer. We conclude that about 30 % of the marriage gain in longevity of men can be motivated by economic calculus while the marriage gain for women observed in the data is attributed to selection or other (non-standard economic) motives...|$|E

40|$|George Tauchen, Adrien Verdelhan {{for their}} helpful {{comments}} and suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. Risk and Return in Bond, Currency and Equity Markets We develop a general equilibrium long-run risks model that can simultane-ously account for key asset price puzzles in bond, currency and equity markets. Specifically, we show that the model can explain the predictability of returns and violations of the expectations hypothesis in bond and foreign exchange markets. It also accounts for the levels and volatilities of bond yields and exchange rates, and the well-known risk premium and volatility puzzles in equity markets. The model matches the observed consumption and inflation dynamics. Using domestic and foreign consumption and asset markets data we provide robust empirical support for our models predictions. We argue that key <b>economic</b> <b>channels</b> featured in the long-run risks model — long-run growth fluctuations and time-varying uncertainty, along with a preference for early resolution of uncertainty — provide a coherent framework to simultaneously explain a rich array of asset market puzzles. ...|$|E

Many experts {{have tried to}} explain {{the root causes of}} these uprisings and predict their democratization prospects. This thesis claims that the economic dimension is the main cause of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, and the Arab Spring more generally. Neoliberal economic policies adopted in the liberalization period in Tunisia and Egypt constituted a failed state-led development paradigm. The economies of both countries achieved positive growth rates over years, yet sustainable development was not reached. In addition, authoritarian governance facilitated the emergence of crony capitalism, where rent derived from economic growth did not trickle down to all social structures. The adopted development model was linked to the global economy through political and <b>economic</b> <b>channels,</b> which translated continuous cyclical economic downturns. The thesis also proposes policy recommendations for a new development paradigm in the Arab world. 1 hard copy: ix, 87 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} recent {{empirical research}} on the determinants of subjective well-being, and sketches possible implications for public policy. Results from national and international samples suggest that measures of social capital, including especially the corollary measures of specific and general trust, have substantial effects on well-being beyond those flowing through <b>economic</b> <b>channels,</b> as measured by incomes and employment status. Additionally, the international samples of well-being data (supported by parallel analysis of suicide data) show the importance of several measures {{of the quality of}} government. More recently, use of well-being data to estimate the income-equivalent value of a variety of non-financial aspects of the workplace produces numbers so large as to suggest the existence of unexploited opportunities to improve both employee satisfaction and enterprise efficiency. In short, recent well-being results suggest renewed policy emphasis, in both the public and private sectors, on the social and institutional contexts within which firms and governments operate. Beyond this potentially vast, but largely unstudied, set of proces...|$|E

30|$|The {{main results}} of the study show that the long run {{economic}} situation proxied by the wealth index is a main channel of transmission {{from one generation to the}} next. A potential concern with this variable stems from the fact that household assets could be directly linked to the age of the parents. If older parents have systematically more of these goods and therefore a higher wealth index, then we might actually capture an age effect rather than an effect of the <b>economic</b> <b>channel.</b> In the regressions, I control for the parental age to deal with this concern. Nevertheless, a closer look at the relationship between the wealth index and parental age can help us to reduce the concerns even more.|$|R

To mingle thoughts about inhabitant’s experience and about the dynamics of PAS, three theoretical backgrounds are refered to. The italian territorialist approach which twins agriculture, sustainability and the city; socio-economic research on place-based agro-food systems and the social geography which considers community gardens as ‘espaces-enjeux’ (spatial issues). From 27 semi-structured interviews of gardeners and association leaders, a content analysis of discourses and a lexicometric analysis using the IraMuTeQ software are presented. At the individual level, ties and places are built from agricultural and food practices whereas they are motivating the commitment. At the PAS level, the process of territorialization is that the social interactions, flows and networks that are committed, more than the localism of <b>economic</b> <b>channels.</b> Lexicometric analysis points out strong linkages between individual practices and economic flows, between the garden’s places and the dynamics of associative networks, between interindividual ties and stakeholders conflictuality...|$|E
40|$|Economists {{have long}} debated whether an {{abundance}} of natural resources adversely affects long term economic performance. Focusing on three <b>economic</b> <b>channels</b> discussed in the literature, I investigate whether resource abundance slows down industrialization or the accumulation of education, or whether it raises inequality. I examine these channels using geological variation in oil abundance in the Southern United States. In 1890 oil abundant counties were mostly agricultural and similar to other nearby counties, but after oil was discovered they began to specialize in its production. From 1940 - 1990 oil abundant counties developed a manufacturing sector that was smaller {{in terms of its}} share of employment, but not in terms of its absolute size. At the same time, these counties enjoyed a better educated workforce and higher per capita income, and attracted population at a faster rate. By 1990 these advantages had diminished, but oil abundant counties still had slightly higher per capita income without suffering from worse inequality. Taken together, my results suggest that while resource based specialization involves some long term costs, it can serve as an important lever for development...|$|E

Setting the Stage Although I and many other economists are newcomers {{to the study of}} well-being, the field has had many illustrious contributors over the centuries. Thus I have been lucky enough to act as research assistant for both Aristotle, in How’s Life?, Helliwell (2003), and Durkheim (Helliwell, 2004).

Since fires clear land for agriculture, higher pollution will correlate with more agricultural land which will lead to more hours worked in the absence of the negative effects of pollution.
