40|$|When {{examining}} {{the history of}} fairy tale iconography in advertising, folklore scholar Donald Haase’s fairy tale encyclopedia compared the Pied Piper of Hamelin to a symbol of advertising who could “play his pipe ever so sweetly and the consumers following him without resisting his charming and manipulative music. ” In contrast, a 2012 episode of Mad Men, advertising luminary Don Draper shoots down a shoe commercial pitch featuring Cinderella, calling the idea “cliché”. The temptation for advertisers to rely on fairy tale figures and iconography continues today and many ignore Don’s aversion for cliché because it still gets the job done. However, there are some ads featuring fairy tales which avoid cliché and are truly innovative for their time.

40|$|Competitive {{electrochemical}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays {{based on}} disposable screen-printed electrodes {{have been developed}} for quantitative determination of ochratoxin A (OTA). The assays were carried out using monoclonal antibodies in the <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>format.</b> OTA working range, 150 and detection limits were 0. 05 - 2. 5 and 0. 1 - 7. 5 mu g L- 1, 0. 35 (+/- 0. 04) mu g L- 1 and 0. 9 (+/- 0. 1) mu g L- 1, 60 and 100 mu g L- 1 in the direct and indirect assay format, respectively. The immunosensor in the <b>direct</b> <b>format</b> was selected for the determination of OTA in wheat. Samples were extracted with aqueous acetonitrile and the extract analyzed directly by the assay without clean-up. The 150 in real samples was 0. 2 mu g L- 1 corresponding to 1. 6 mu g/kg in the wheat sample with a detection limit of 0. 4 mu g/kg (calculated as blank signal - 3 sigma). Within- and between-assay variability were less than 5 and 10 %, respectively. A good correlation (r = 0. 9992) was found by comparative analysis of naturally contaminated wheat samples using this assay and an HPLC/immunoaffinity clean-up method based on the AOAC Official Method 2000. 03 for the determination of OTA in barley.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to our results, Leuschner et al. (4) have reported {{the absence of}} autoantibodies to either cTnI or cTnT (titer 1 : 160) in a healthy population. In their study of car-diomyopathy patients, the anti-cTnI positive rate increased to 7 %– 9. 2 %, whereas the anti-cTnT rate remained very low (0. 5 %– 1. 7 %). We attribute the lower sensitivity in detecting anti-cTnT to the dif-ferences between the indirect sand-wich assay format used by those authors vs the <b>direct</b> <b>format</b> we used in this report. To date, the effect of circulat-ing autoantibodies to cTnT, either as an interfering factor in cTnT immunoassays or a pathophy-siological indicator, {{has yet to be}} elucidated.

5000|$|WALR-FM {{became the}} last {{remaining}} urban station owned by Cox Radio in Atlanta when sister station WBTS flipped from rhythmic contemporary to news-talk as a simulcast of WSB-AM on August 16, 2010. Another station was WFOX-FM (now classic hits as WSRV), which was urban contemporary 97-1 Jamz until 2006. Even so, WALR did not return its format back to urban AC until June 2011. At that time, it added more contemporary R&B music after spending eight years being a classic and gold-based R&B and soul format. This allowed for the station to restrengthen itself as a competitive radio force in Atlanta, especially against longtime rival WVEE and <b>direct</b> <b>format</b> rival WAMJ/WUMJ. The station's logo and slogan was modified as well from [...] "Atlanta's Old School R&B Station" [...] to [...] "Atlanta's R&B," [...] plus the branding was shortened to simply [...] "Kiss 104", omitting the [...] ".1". Also, with the format phasing, WALR no longer airs any weekend mix shows; it has expanded its nighttime slow jams show in the vein of major R&B stations elsewhere.
