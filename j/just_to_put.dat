5|$|On April 13, 2013, during at the 2013's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Pusha T {{announced}} that he would be going to Paris later this week, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on some final touches on the album, afterwards he would announce a release date. In June 2013, Pusha T had been set to turn in the album to Def Jam for mastering, however, Kanye West presented Pusha with some additional beats. This resulted in Pusha going back to the studio to continue the recording. In early stages in the recording process, he began working on the album with Kanye West, Symbolyc One, The Neptunes, Bangladesh, and Ryan Leslie. Since then, he has confirmed that he was working with The-Dream, Just Blaze, No I.D., Nottz, Don Cannon, Nashiem Myrick, Carlos Brody (of The Hitmen), DJ Mano, Swizz Beatz, Rico Beats, Travi$ Scott, Hudson Mohawke, Young Chop, and Sham, amongst others on the album's production. On August 4, 2013 he {{announced that}} the song he wants to be the album's intro is produced by Joaquin Phoenix. On August 22, 2013, Pusha T appeared on MTV's RapFix and told Sway Calloway that the bulk of the album's production would be handled by Kanye West, while confirming production by Pharrell, Swizz Beatz, The-Dream, Nottz, and Don Cannon to be featured on the album.|$|E
25|$|Finally, we {{actually}} don't need uDummy because it's there <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all unmatched vertices of U in queue when BFS starts. That {{we can do}} as just as initialization. The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and initialize default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which {{is the end of}} our augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.|$|E
500|$|The {{material}} on Bleed American was more accessible and aggressive than its predecessor, {{which had a}} more [...] "layered, sprawling sound." [...] In regard to the stylistic approach of the album, frontman Jim Adkins said, “Things still got pretty gnarly in the studio as far as experimentation, {{but it was always}} to an end that was complimentary to the song. We wanted to really make sure that we weren’t doing things, like, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a wacky keyboard sound in. It had to be doing something constructive for the song.” Critics have described the genres of the album as alternative rock, emo, emo pop, pop punk, and power pop.|$|E

500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the published script of Viet Rock, Richard Schechner says, [...] "performance, action, and event are the key terms of our theatre – and these terms are not literary." [...] In the 1950s, Off-off Broadway theaters began experimenting with non-traditional theater roles, blurring the lines between playwright, director, and actor. [...] The playwright's job was not <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> words on a page, but to create a theatrical experience based on a central idea. [...] By 1967, theaters such as The Living Theatre, La MaMa E.T.C. and The Open Theatre were actively devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space, rather than following a traditional script.|$|E

[...] Wittenberg is also involved with programs to prevent childhood obesity, and was a guest of Michelle Obama's at the White House for the President's Task Force on Childhood Obesity. [...] The New York Daily News wrote in an article, [...] "Wittenberg is emphatic in her conviction that her job isn't <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on top pro races, but to cultivate healthy living and be a force for good in the community." [...] The many programs, events and races that the NYRR administers draws more than 300,000 yearly participants.|$|E
500|$|In late 1909, the German {{military}} attache to the Ottoman Empire began {{a conversation with}} the Ottoman Navy about the possibility of selling German warships to the Ottomans to counter Greek naval expansion. After lengthy negotiations, including Ottoman attempts to buy {{one or more of the}} new battlecruisers , , and , the Germans offered to sell the four ships of the Brandenburg class at a cost of 10million marks. The Ottomans chose to buy Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg, since they were the more advanced ships of the class. The two battleships were renamed after the famous 16th-century Ottoman admirals, Hayreddin Barbarossa and Turgut Reis. They were transferred on 1 September 1910, and German crews took the ships to Constantinople, along with four new destroyers also purchased from Germany. The Ottoman navy, however, had great difficulty equipping the Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis; the navy had to pull trained enlisted men from the rest of the fleet <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> together crews for them. Both vessels suffered from condenser troubles after they entered Ottoman service, which reduced their speed to [...]|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} from xx were {{licensed}} by XL to television programs in the UK and North America. [...] "Intro" [...] became widely used as theme music in television, including sports highlights, episodes of series such as Law & Order and Cold Case, an advertisement for AT, and BBC's coverage of the 2010 British general election. Along with their placement in television, songs from the record were used by North American chain stores such as Starbucks and Urban Outfitters as background music at their locations. According to McCormick, these marketing strategies helped the xx develop enough media presence to garner [...] "over half a million sales around the world without ever having anything as vulgar as a hit". Kris Chen, XL's A senior vice president, believed the exposure was desired and necessary for promoting an album that was not [...] "driven by pop radio". Although the band realised their music had to be marketed somehow, Croft expressed reservations about [...] "putting our music on everything, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it to anything {{just for the sake}} of money".|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind of choose your roster [...] depending on what kind of fight you want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in a little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E
