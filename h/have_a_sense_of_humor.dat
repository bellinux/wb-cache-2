500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, and he knows that I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and he feels that people don't recognize that about me. And I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why is she doing that? Why is she doing the treadmill with her high heels on?"

In 1967 alone, the year I {{supposedly}} made that comment, we recorded Wild Honey, an R album that was entirely different from anything we'd ever done, and I cowrote ten songs and sang three leads." [...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great. He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I thought your lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except who the fuck knows what you're talking about!' That's exactly how I talk to him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, so I get labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Damsker from Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna's beating vibrato {{sometimes}} {{makes her}} sound so robotic in the album." [...] Lou Papineau, while writing for The Providence Journal, said that [...] "In Like a Virgin, Madonna proves she's shallow, but spunky." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a positive review, saying [...] "Though not as innovative as her debut, Like a Virgin stands {{as one of}} the most definitive pop artifacts from the indulgent Reagan Era. The mid-tempo ballad 'Shoo-Bee-Doo' and a soulful cover of Rose Royce's 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' proved Madonna could churn out more than just novelty hits, while the sugary 'Angel' and the irresistible 'Dress You Up' contributed to the singer's record-breaking list of consecutive Top 5 hits (16 in all). The retro-infused 'Stay' and the percussive 'Over and Over' are the album's hidden gems." [...] Ed Stevenson from People felt that [...] "Madonna does <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> though she is buried under so many layers of self-parody it's hard to tell sometimes... She is backed on this by the reliable rhythmic touch of veteran Nile Rodgers, whose contributions have helped her create a tolerable bit of fluff. Hugo Mistry from Chicago Tribune felt that [...] "Like a Virgin was Madonna's breakthrough, playing off her self-conscious campiness with a series of hot dance tracks, attention-grabbing lyrics and steamy videos." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike his {{comic book}} counterpart, Snake Eyes {{did not play}} a major role in the Sunbow's [...] TV series, with the {{exception}} of the first miniseries [...] "The M.A.S.S. Device", where some of his origins were explored. He was always portrayed as a trusted and loyal teammate, and even proved to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> as seen when he broke into a break-dancing routine on-stage, and later in a disguise resembling Boy George in the [...] "Pyramid of Darkness" [...] miniseries. In the first miniseries, Snake Eyes appeared in his [...] "V1" [...] uniform, but for all of his later appearances he wore a bluish-grey version of his [...] "V2" [...] uniform. Additionally, he does not have a rivalry with Storm Shadow in the cartoon, who instead fights with such characters as Spirit and Quick Kick. Although Snake Eyes does not speak, the vocal effects of Snake Eyes' wolf Timber were provided by Frank Welker.|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{publication}} {{took place}} in Spencer, Indiana, and upon its release was shipped to retail chains such as Fry's Electronics, Egghead Software and CompUSA. The design of the game cover closely mimicked that of the Windows 95 packaging. During development, Parroty Interactive had planned to promote the game at the COMDEX computer expo by Fall in 1997. The presentation was to include a Bill Gates lookalike. However the staff were expelled by security from the convention and the distribution plan was shut down. Despite this setback, the company presented their product at the Macworld expo in Silicon Valley, San Francisco next January, receiving praise from Macintosh users. At the event they demoed the CEO-themed Tamagotchi spoof [...] "Billagotchi", and [...] "Windows Exploder" [...] game where players blows away error messages. CD copies of the game were sold in a booth for $20 each. Microsoft also debuted some new products at Macworld such as Office 98 and Internet Explorer 4.0. While noting that he was yet to examine the Palladium Interactive title, Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray commented that [...] "ours are probably a little more serious" [...] than Microshaft Winblows 98, and that the corporation [...] "tr to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> about this sort of thing".|$|E

2500|$|When {{the caller}} noted {{that she was}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "n-word" [...] by the individuals in question, Schlessinger complained that blacks are fine with cordially using the slur among themselves, but that it was wrong when whites used it to slur them. In doing so, she uttered [...] "nigger" [...] eleven times, albeit not directed at the caller. She discussed the word and its use by blacks and in black media. Her profuse use of the slur was mimicking the frequency of the word's use among black stand-up comics. When Hanson asked, [...] "Is it ever OK to say that word?" [...] Schlessinger responded, [...] "It depends how it’s said. Black guys talking to each other seem to think it’s OK." [...] After the call Schlessinger said, [...] "If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> don't marry out of your race." [...] Early that evening she wrote an apology to Los Angeles Radio People online journalist Don Barrett. A day later, as soon as she was back on the air, Schlessinger apologized. Hanson questioned the motivation and sincerity of Schlessinger's apology, believing it to be result of being [...] "caught." [...] Hanson also said that Schlessinger did not apologize for her comments on interracial marriage.|$|E

40|$|What {{is it like}} to be a {{clinical}} educator? How do clinical educators experience and describe their continuing journey of becoming {{a clinical}} educator? Within the model developed in this research, dimensions of being a clinical educator were identified. These dimensions include (<b>a)</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self (and the impact of bringing self into the clinical educator’s role), (b) <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> relationship with others (and the place of this ‘‘interactive self’’ as a central feature of clinical education), (c) <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> clinical educator (and how this understanding relates to the previous two dimensions), (d) <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency (which is vital to the performance of many clinical education roles), (e) seeking dynamic self-congruence, and (e) growth as a clinical educator.
