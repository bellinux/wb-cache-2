5|$|British Railways {{undertook}} a massive programme to establish itself by repainting all its locomotives {{with their new}} BR numbers and replacing their previous corporate identity with its own. Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies' logos, emblems and even coats of arms, {{to be replaced by}} the stark 'BRITISH RAILWAYS' lettering. The enormity of this task meant that the necessary repainting was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> this process by the end of 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives. Only thirteen locomotives out of the 29 received new liveries to accompany their renumbering.|$|E

5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed a few basic tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E
5|$|Pricing {{was central}} to the {{marketing}} strategy, as it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> Sinclair's career. The ZX81 had been designed to meet a £70 price point and was launched at a price of £69.95 (built) or £49.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals – the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from £630 {{in the case of}} the Apple II Plus to just £70 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, King Christian VIII of Denmark {{died and}} his only son, Frederick ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> two {{unsuccessful}} marriages, and {{was assumed to}} be infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and the succession rules of each territory differed. In Holstein, the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the great powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Braathens SAFE started {{negotiations}} {{to purchase the}} Swedish airline Transwede Airways from its owners, Transpool. After SAS had bought Linjeflyg, Transwede had become the second-largest domestic airline in Sweden, operating five Fokker 100s. In 1995, Braathens SAFE had a revenue of NOK4 billion, with a profit of NOK242 million. The same year, Transwede had lost NOK200 million with a revenue of NOK1.2 billion. The company had been split in two, a charter and a scheduled company, and Braathens SAFE started negotiating to purchase the scheduled company. Transwede's scheduled services were at the time form Stockholm-Arlanda Airport to Halmstad, Jönköping, Luleå, Sundsvall and Umeå, plus a service from Luleå to Sundsvall. It had a 13% market share, transporting 800,000 people in 1995, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> a major restructuring the year before, where the fleet had been reduced from seven to five aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E

A systematic campaign of conquest and pacification was undertaken by the Portuguese. One by one the local kingdoms were overwhelmed and abolished.|$|E

Members of the Royal Family continued their duties as honoraries, visiting troops in Canada and Afghanistan, as well as attending memorials.|$|E

25|$|Salvatore Giuliano is a 1962 Italian film {{directed}} by Francesco Rosi. Shot in a neo-realist documentary, non-linear style, it follows {{the lives of}} those involved with Giuliano. When Rosi came to Sicily in 1961 to re-enact the Portella Della Ginestra sequence massacre for the film, the trauma from 14 years earlier was still fresh. He asked 1,000 peasants to go back and enact exactly what they, their friends and relatives <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>through.</b> Events nearly slipped out of control. When the gunfire sound effects started, the crowd panicked and knocked over one of the cameras in rush to escape; women wept and knelt in prayer; men threw themselves to the ground in agony. One old woman, dressed entirely in black, planted herself before the camera and repeated in an anguished wail, 'Where are my children?' Two of her sons had died at the hands of Giuliano and his band.|$|E
25|$|Zaman's {{downfall}} {{was triggered}} by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>through</b> {{the support of the}} Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the Nurzai and the Alizai Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the Qizilbash clan. Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's older brother, Mahmud Shah. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.|$|E
