Further speaking with AMH TV, {{he went on to say}} that [...] "e spent two months...composing new stuff, composing new songs. And we feel very optimistic about the future. We're already enjoying a lot of the new stuff. We want to make the strongest album we can do. I mean, all the bands say they try to make the strongest album, but this time, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> really do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Warnock {{was also}} full of praise for his counterpart, Jim Platt, commenting that [...] "He {{should be made}} manager {{of the year for}} what he's done at that club". Citing Darlington's {{financial}} worries [...] "Everyone thought they would blow up, but they didn't - they got within an ace. Unfortunately, someone has to lose". Platt, a former Northern Ireland international, was equally optimistic. He said [...] "My side is very young - nearly all of them in their early 20s. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be here again next season or go up automatically - if we can keep the side together".|$|E
500|$|Bernie Ecclestone, the F1 {{commercial}} rights holder, said if {{the unrest}} has [...] "not quietened down by Wednesday, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> have to cancel the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix probably." [...] On 21 February the race was postponed and then canceled later. Human Rights Watch called on the Bahraini government to stop attacking peaceful protesters and start probes into the deaths. Amnesty International similarly condemned the government crackdown and asked for an independent investigation into the events. Anonymous, an online hackers grouping, issued a statement condemning the crackdown and expressed its solidarity with the protesters: [...] "By interfering with the freedom to hold peaceful protests, the Bahrainian [...] government has made itself a clear enemy of its own citizens and of Anonymous. The actions of this regime will not be forgotten, nor will they be forgiven." ...|$|E

500|$|The brigade was {{advancing}} in quarter column {{as directed}} by Methuen's orders. [...] The soldiers advanced packed as closely together as possible, with each ordered to grasp his neighbour {{to prevent the}} men losing {{contact with each other}} in the darkness. As first light approached, the storm abated and the Brigade was on course, but the delays put them [...] from the line of hills. Wauchope's guide, Major Benson of the Royal Artillery, suggested to Wauchope that it was no longer safe to continue in closed formation and that the Brigade should deploy. Wauchope replied [...] "... I'm afraid my men will lose direction. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> go a little further." [...] Still in quarter column, the Highlanders advanced further towards the unknown enemy lines, when an advancing British soldier tripped an alarm on the fence in front of the Boer trench.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I think you should do it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
500|$|Steven Lisberger stated on October 28, 2010, {{before the}} film's release, that a sequel was in {{planning}} and that Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, screenwriters for Tron: Legacy, were {{in the early stages}} of producing a script for the new film. Perry Nemiroff of Cinema Blend speculated that Tron 3 could be the first installment in a new trilogy. On January 13, 2011, Ain't It Cool News reported that the film was close to having its sequel announced as part of Disney's plan for Tron future. On January 21, 2011, Tron-Sector reported an unsourced rumor that a sequel to Tron: Legacy had been green-lit and a teaser trailer would debut on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of Tron and Tron: Legacy. Harry Knowles reported on the teaser, calling it a [...] "DVD Extra" [...] and noting that it had been filmed before Thanksgiving (i.e. before November 2010). On April 8, 2011, director Joseph Kosinski talked about the sequel: [...] "We're working on the story right now. Once we get a script we're all really happy with, we'll take it to the powers that be and see if we can go back to the grid. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> pick up with where Tron: Legacy left off with Sam and Quorra in the real world and what does that mean and the possibilities it opens up for the next chapter. It's that relationship between the two of them that's the next step." [...] On March 31, Kosinski said that the film's script was expected to be finished in two weeks and its working title is Tr3n.|$|E

2500|$|In 1982 came a 4-song EP called £1.10 or Less {{and then}} their fourth studio album, Now Then... (actually their fifth album, as they had {{released}} a live LP, Hanx, as their official third album between Nobody's Heroes and Go for It). Now Then was the first album for former Tom Robinson band's drummer Dolphin Taylor. In the face of low sales and concert attendances, they broke up in 1983, when Burns said: [...] "Our last LP Now Then was to my mind the best album we have made. But it is also unfortunately the best <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> ever make. So I have decided {{to call it a}} day." [...] The band later revealed the original split had been somewhat acrimonious, with band members apparently having fistfights rather than talking through their differences.|$|E
