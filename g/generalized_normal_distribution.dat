30|$|The idea of {{generating}} skewed <b>distributions</b> from <b>normal</b> {{has been of}} great interest among researchers for decades. This paper proposes four families of <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> using the T-X framework. These four families of distributions are named as T-normal families arising from the quantile functions of (i) standard exponential, (ii) standard log-logistic, (iii) standard logistic and (iv) standard extreme value distributions. Some general properties including moments, mean deviations and Shannon entropy of the T-normal family are studied. Four new <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> are developed using the T-normal method. Some properties of these four <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> are studied in detail. The shapes of the proposed T-normal distributions can be symmetric, skewed to the right, skewed to the left, or bimodal. Two data sets, one skewed unimodal and the other bimodal, are fitted by using the generalized T-normal distributions.|$|R

5000|$|This {{version of}} the <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> {{has been used in}} {{modeling}} when the concentration of values around the mean and the tail behavior are of particular interest. [...] Other families of distributions can be used if the focus is on other deviations from normality. If the symmetry of the distribution is the main interest, the skew normal family or version 2 of the generalized normal family discussed below can be used. If the tail behavior is the main interest, the student t family can be used, which approximates the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom grows to infinity. The t distribution, unlike this <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution,</b> obtains heavier than normal tails without acquiring a cusp at the origin.|$|E

30|$|The <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used distribution in both statistical theory and applications. The generalization of the <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> is studied using the T - X framework proposed by Alzaatreh et al. (2013). Four types of <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> families from the quantile functions of the (i) exponential, (ii) log-logistic, (iii) logistic, and (iv) extreme value distributions are proposed. Some general properties are studied. Four <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> are described and some of their properties investigated. It is noticed that the shapes of GN distributions can be symmetric, skewed to the right, skewed to the left or bimodal. This gives the families some flexibility in fitting real world data. Because the GN <b>distributions</b> include the <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> as a special case, using the GN distributions to fit data enables one to check if the additional parameters characterize the deviation from the <b>normal</b> <b>distribution.</b> Many types of generalizations of the <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> can be derived using the methodology described in this paper. Due to the fact that GN distributions are natural extensions from the <b>normal</b> <b>distribution,</b> statistical modeling by assuming the error term follows some form of GN distribution will be an interesting topic for future research.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We use {{anisotropic}} diffusion {{processes to}} <b>generalize</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> to manifolds and {{to construct a}} framework for likelihood estimation of template and covariance structure from manifold valued data. The procedure avoids the linearization that arise when first esti-mating a mean or template before performing PCA in the tangent space of the mean. We derive flow equations for the most probable paths reach-ing sampled data points, and we use the paths that are generally not geodesics for estimating {{the likelihood of the}} model. In contrast to exist-ing template estimation approaches, accounting for anisotropy thus re-sults in an algorithm that is not based on geodesic distances. To illustrate the effect of anisotropy and to point to further applications, we present experiments with anisotropic distributions on both the sphere and fi-nite dimensional LDDMM manifolds arising in the landmark matching problem...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The Standardized Precipitation Index was {{developed}} as a probability-based index able to monitor rainfall deficit in a standardized or normalized way. Thus, the performance of this drought index {{is affected by the}} use of a distribution that does not provide an appropriate fit for the rainfall data. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the adjustment of the gamma distribution for the rainfall amounts summed over several time scales (Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), to assess the goodness-of-fit of alternative distributions to these rainfall series and to evaluate the normality assumption of the Standardized Precipitation Index series calculated from several distributions. Based on the Lilliefors test and on a normality test, it is verified that the gamma distribution is not suitable for calculating this Index in several timescales. The <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> presented the best performance among all analysed distributions.

In assessing the correctness of the estimates of the shape of the distribution function accurately, we often use a Monte Carlo simulation study; thus, a fast and efficient random number generation method for the distribution function is needed. However, the method for generating the random numbers of the distribution seems not easy and not yet to have been developed.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} “forests” show {{great promise}} {{in a variety}} of applications, from supercapacitors to fuel cells, but the realization of such materials for functional devices relies on a better control over processing routes such that targeted structures and associated properties can be reproducibly obtained. The orientation distribution of the nanotubes is a critical structural property affecting both electrical and mechanical response, yet it remains a challenging characteristic to quantify. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a technique well suited to investigate the vertical alignment of nanotubes. Here we show that the orientation distribution obtained from SAXS is not satisfactorily represented by the normal distribution or the Lorentzian, which have been used until now. Instead, an excellent agreement between model and data is found with the <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> (GND).

40|$|How {{frequent}} {{are large}} disagreements in human judgment? The substantial literature relating to expert assessments of real-valued quantities and their aggregation almost universally assumes that errors follow a jointly normal distribution. We {{investigate this question}} empirically using 17 datasets that include over 20, 000 estimates and forecasts. We find incontrovertible evidence for excess kurtosis, that is, of fat tails. Despite {{the diversity of the}} analyzed datasets as regards to the degree of uncertainty about the quantity being assessed and to the level of expertise and sophistication of those making the assessments, we find consistency in the frequency with which an expert is in large disagreement with the consensus. Fitting a <b>generalized</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> to the data, we find values for the shape parameter ranging from 1 to 1. 6 (where 1 is the double-exponential distribution, and 2 the normal distribution).
