40|$|International {{guidelines}} (<b>IMO</b> <b>MSC.</b> <b>Circ</b> 1533) specify that evacuation models used {{to certify}} evacuation performance of passenger ships must {{demonstrate that the}} calculated representative evacuation time, the sample 95 th percentile time τS, is lower than a prescribed Pass/Fail Criterion Time (PFCT). In this paper a Confidence Interval Convergence Test (CICT) method is presented that minimises the computational burden required to demonstrate that a model design has passed/failed by calculating a CI for the population 95 th percentile time, τP, rather than simply relying on τS determined from an arbitrary sample of 500 simulations as specified in the current guidelines. The CICT has comparable pass/fail accuracy to using 500 simulations whilst significantly {{reducing the number of}} simulations required when the PFCT is far from the τP. In addition, the proposed method has superior accuracy to the convergent method described in the IMO guidelines. Furthermore, the methodology described in the guidelines fails to identify situations where there may be uncertainty in the pass/fail status due to proximity of τP to PFCT. The CICT identifies these situations and provides a means of resolving the uncertainty. The CICT can be applied to any stochastic evacuation model to determine parameter convergence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research that}} eas carried-out under the EU FP 7 project SAFEGUARD {{to develop a}} fire benchmark evacuation scenario for large passenger ships that could be incorporated within a modified form of the IMO evacuation analysis guidelines. The analysis has involved detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) fire modelling analysis of fire scenarios, analysis of experimental data relating to fires in passenger ships and extensive evacuation simulation using two established ship based evacuation modelling tools. {{the aim of the}} fire benchmark scenario was to include the impact of the fire on the evacuating passengers without introducing the need to undertake a full fire simulation. The primary impact of the generation and spread of fire hazards considered in the benchmark analysis is the reduction in travel speeds of passengers due to smoke obscuration and a change in the evacuation procedures associated with the fire zone containing the fire. As a result of this work it is proposed that a new degraded scenario be introduced into <b>IMO</b> <b>MSC</b> <b>Circ</b> 1238 that requires the passengers in the identified MVZ to evacuate from the zone horizontally into the neighbouring MVZs. The proposed fire becnhmark scenario is demonstrated using a lasrge cruise ship geometry...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{realistic}} and robust maritime evacuation procedures, {{it is vital to}} understand how passengers behave in emergency situations. An essential component of this understanding is the collection and characterization of human performance data. However, little data relating to passenger response time or fullscale validation data in maritime environments exists. Although the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) evacuation protocol Maritime Safety Committee (<b>MSC)</b> <b>Circ.</b> 1033 and its successor, <b>MSC</b> <b>Circ.</b> 1238, are of great use, it is known in the industry that the existing data is not representative of passenger ships in general. The SAFEGUARD project addresses the IMO Fire Protection Sub Committee’s requirement to collect full-scale data for calibration and validation of ship-based evacuation models, as well as proposing and investigating additional benchmark scenarios to be used in certification analysis. Funded through the European Commission’s 7 th Framework Programme, the Newfoundland and Labrador Research and Development Corporation and Transport Canada (Marine Safety), SAFEGUARD has brought together leading industry experts and the project findings will play an integral role in framing the next iteration of international guidelines for ship evacuation analysis. This essay describes the methodology undertaken within the full-scale assembly trials that were carried out – one of which included the largest ever real-life assembly trial on a passenger ship. The main findings are presented and highlight what this will mean for the future of ship evacuation...|$|R
40|$|We hereby {{comment on}} {{document}} D- 4. 5. 2 - 2005 - 10 - 21 -DNV (entitled “Risk Evaluation Criteria ” and {{produced in the}} context of the SAFEDOR project 3).

40|$|In {{anticipation}} of the forthcoming new harmonised regulations for damage stability, SOLAS Chapter II- 1, proposed in <b>IMO</b> <b>MSC</b> 80 and due for enforcement in 2009, a number of ship owners and consequentially yards and classification societies are venturing to exploit the new degrees of freedom afforded by the probabilistic concept of ship subdivision. In this process, designers are finding it rather difficult {{to move away from}} the prescription mindset that has been deeply ingrained in their way of conceptualising, creating and completing a ship design. Total freedom it appears is hard to cope with and a helping hand is needed to guide them in crossing the line from prescriptive to goal-setting design. This will be facilitated considerably with improved understanding of what this concept entails and of its limitations and range of applicability.

In the <b>IMO</b> <b>MSC</b> 82 [2006] meeting {{a great deal of}} emphasis was placed on the role human elements play in the cause of accidents at sea, focusing particularly on how human errors have led to great losses of life and property.

40|$|The modern ships {{particularly}} {{container and}} fuel carrying vessels {{are becoming increasingly}} automated. The automation has brought with it two problems, one concerning the inadequacy of existing seafarers ‟ education and training viz., that if any aspects of automation fails the crew often are not trained to use alternative systems and hence respond to it effectively (<b>IMO</b> <b>MSC</b> 82, 2006; Ziarati, 2006). The second problem has arisen from {{the review of the}} arguments from recent IMO Maritime Safety Committee (reports MSC 82 / 15 / 2 and MSC 82 / 15 / 3, 2006) namely that the human operators rarely understand all the characteristics of automatic systems and these systems ‟ weaknesses and limitations which have now been found {{to be one of the}} main causes of major accidents. Also, concerns were expressed about the English language competency of seafarers of various ranks. These reports concluded that there is a need to improve the content of all maritime training to include knowledge, skills and understanding of automation and that teaching of English in maritime institutions should be improved.

40|$|The Reason for the Project The {{international}} standards for merchant navy {{education and training}} (MET) currently in place were introduced in 1995 (IMO STCW- 95). Since 1995, there has been rapid revolution in design of ships and the equipment used in the navigation and propulsion systems on board these ships and yet {{there has been no}} serious attempt to revise the STCW and/or the International model courses such as IMO 7. 03, 7. 04, 7. 01 and 7. 02. One very important development has been the introduction of automation in operating a ship. The modern ships particularly container and fuel carrying vessels are becoming increasingly automated. The automation has brought with it two problems, one concerning the inadequacy of existing seafarers ‟ education and training viz., that if any aspects of automation fails the crew often are not trained to use alternative systems and hence respond to it effectively (<b>IMO</b> <b>MSC</b> 82, 2006; Ziarati, 2006).

40|$|A {{careful study}} of the {{accident}} reports reveals that 85 % of all accidents are either directly initiated by human error or are associated with human error by means of inappropriate human response (Ziarati, 2006). This {{is in line with}} the findings of a recent paper (IMO, 2005) that 80 % of accidents at sea are caused by human error. Turkish Government is also aware that collision is {{the most common type of}} accident in Turkey and this was again confirmed by the latest data published by the Main Search and Rescue Coordination Centre of Turkey in 2009. Collision amounted to 60 % of all accidents if grounding and contacts are included. The research shows that mistakes are usually made not because of deficient or inadequate regulations, but because the regulations and standards, that do exist, are often ignored. The <b>IMO</b> <b>MSC</b> (Ziarati, 2006) clearly indicates the causes of many of the accidents at sea are due to deficiencies in maritime education and training (MET) of seafarers or disregard for current standards and regulations. Ziarati also reports (2007) that majority of accidents and incidents are related to collisions or groundings. The International Regulations for Preventing collisions at Sea 1972 (Colregs) are rules to be followed by Deck/Navigation officers. It was initially designed to update the Collision Regulations of 1960 and entered into force in 1977. The last amendments were made in 2007. It is one of the most important International Conventions that all seagoing officers must have full knowledge of it before taking charge of a ship. How...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the modelling of human factors {{and how they}} can impact ship design. Two different but related applications areas are considered; passenger ship evacuation analysis and naval vessel normal operations and evacuation analysis. In the first instance, this thesis investigates the impact of the current regulatory specified passenger response time distributions upon evacuation analysis and then recommends a more realistic passenger response time distribution which should be implemented when performing an evacuation analysis of a passenger RO-RO vessel. This realistic passenger response time distribution is based upon the results of sea trials. The results of this analysis have been adopted by the IMO and form part of the new guideline document, <b>IMO</b> <b>MSC</b> 1238. In addition, this thesis {{addresses the}} analysis of the human factors’ performance of a naval vessel. Naval vessels are built primarily for undertaking assigned missions in times of war and conflict. While the safety of those on board is important, the ability of the vessel to function and complete its assigned mission is of paramount importance. This thesis utilises an evacuation model, maritimeEXODUS, which was extended to incorporate the functionality of modelling non-evacuation scenarios, to assess the human factors’ performance of a naval vessel during both normal operations and evacuation scenarios. This thesis develops a methodology for simultaneously assessing the human factors’ performance of both a range of normal operation scenarios and evacuation scenario on board a naval vessel. The methodology, called the Human Performance Metric (HPM), is discriminating, diagnostic, systematic, transparent and reproducible in nature. This thesis then implements the HPM methodology into {{the early stages of the}} design cycle for a new naval vessel. The thesis presents the software modifications required to implement the methodology in to the design cycle as well as presenting a demonstration of the new system...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{saving and}} low carbon {{emission}} in shipping have already become an attractive and important subject in the shipping industry driven by the increasing full oil price and considerations of reduction of green house gas emission.

The constraints are weather, sea conditions and the safety constrains defined in the <b>IMO</b> guidance <b>MSC.</b> 1 /Circ. 1228. Compared with the traditional dynamic programming methods, the newly developed weather routing method is more accurate and practical. Simulation results from a case study have shown that the newly developed method is able to save several tons of fuel compared with that of the traditional methods for one North Atlantic voyage. As a result, it can offer much CO 2 emission reduction...|$|R
40|$|Interest in ship {{manoeuvrability}} {{has increasingly}} grown during last decades, both for merchant and naval ships; {{resulting in the}} adoption by <b>IMO</b> of RESOLUTION <b>MSC</b> 137 (76) and in publication by NATO of ANEP 70.

40|$|A {{high-level}} user need {{recognized by}} the <b>IMO</b> in <b>MSC</b> 85 / 26 Annex 20 is the resilient provision of position, navigation, and time data (PNT) to ship-side applications such as Automatic Identification System (AIS), Electronic Chart Display Information System (ECDIS), and Integrated Navigation System (INS). Resilience {{is the ability of}} the PNT system to detect and compensate external and internal sources of disturbances, malfunction and breakdowns in parts of the system. This shall be achieved without loss of PNT data provision and preferably without degradation of their performance. Within this context a modular, scalable and open concept for a maritime Integrated PNT system is under development to enable the stepwise fulfillment of such user needs as e. g. improvement of reliability, indication of reliability and automatic assessment of all navigation relevant data. Furthermore the proposed PNT concept supports the exploitation of modernization processes in radio navigation systems (space-based and terrestrial), ship-side sensors and shore-side services. The PNT system has to be considered as an open framework supporting the usage of any sensors, services and data sources improving the accuracy or assessing the integrity of provided PNT data and applied components. Within the presentation we describe the crossover from the classical approach operating with stand-alone equipment aboard a vessel to a modular PNT unit approach capable to work in stand-alone mode too as well as specific CCRS module of the Integrated Navigation System. It consist the introduction into the concept for an on-board maritime PNT module as well as a discussion of the enhanced opportunities for integrity monitoring, which are enabled by a PNT module.

40|$|With the {{ratification}} of <b>IMO’s</b> resolution <b>MSC.</b> 99 (73) on 1 st July 2002, in many classification societies, fire ship codes are shifting from prescriptive (rules in SOLAS) to performance-based (as long as an adequate level of safety is maintained) for technical, {{economic and social}} reasons. This change is made possible by progress in fire safety technologies, including the development of engineering tools that are required to implement performance codes. The performance-based design is a design activity that is based, on the analysis of a “phenomenon”, developed in case of fire event, and on the verification of adopted providences. The success of performance-based codes depends {{on the ability to}} establish performance criteria that will be verifiable and enforceable. The performance criteria should be such that designers can easily demonstrate, using engineering tools, that their designs meet them and that the classification societies can enforce them. This paper firstly presents and discusses the fire models for ships, deriving from those ones of buildings, which can be utilized to simulate the development of a fire event in a compartment or groups of compartments. Successively a study on the performance criteria, which can be currently used by fire protection engineers in designing fire safety in ships, is carried out. This includes deterministic and probabilistic design criteria as well as safety factors. The deterministic criteria relate mainly to life safety levels, fire growth and spread levels, fire exposure and structural performance. The probabilistic criteria focus on the incident severity and incident likelihood. Additionally, the inclusion of safety factors permits a conservative design and allows for a smaller margin of error due to uncertainty in the models and the input data. Finally, two examples demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed performance criteria and their practical engineering relevance...|$|R
