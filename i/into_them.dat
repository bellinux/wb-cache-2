5|$|In the end, Henry Holt {{abandoned}} the litigation, as the ongoing legal costs were becoming unsupportable. The print run of Bare-faced Messiah in the U.S. was ended after only 14,000 copies were printed. Many went to public libraries, but, according to Miller, numerous library {{copies of the}} book went missing or had inserts pasted <b>into</b> <b>them</b> by Scientologists.|$|E

5|$|King's End was {{developed}} as a residential road in the early 1900s. By 1907, {{the first of the}} new homes were completed and residents began to move <b>into</b> <b>them.</b> The road was named King's End Avenue, though reverted to the original name of King's End later in the century.|$|E
5|$|Project Stormfury was {{an attempt}} to weaken {{tropical}} cyclones by flying aircraft <b>into</b> <b>them</b> and seeding with silver iodide. The project was run by the United States Government from 1962 to 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were frequently}} politicised, {{either by the}} debates over their construction and design, or by the symbolism incorporated <b>into</b> <b>them.</b> Even where {{attempts were made to}} ensure political neutrality, as in France where the inscriptions on memorials were usually deliberately neutral, avoiding political controversy, national politics influenced the symbolism and messages incorporated into the memorials.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations <b>into</b> <b>them</b> were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit {{aggressive}} behavior and will drive off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs <b>into</b> <b>them.</b> Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E
5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so instead of using a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved <b>into</b> <b>them,</b> with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite {{the grandeur of the}} building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms and fitted the large reception rooms for community use. Biddulph also built some cottages {{at the site of the}} old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time.|$|E

5|$|Crash has {{the ability}} to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies off-screen, slide across the ground, and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Crash can jump higher than he {{normally}} can if he jumps immediately following a slide. All of these techniques can be used as offensive measures against most enemies, whom serve to deter Crash's progress. Enemies with deadly topsides cannot be jumped on, while enemies that attack from the front or have side spikes must be jumped on or undergo a body slam. Enemies with sharp necklines (such as frill-necked lizards or long-legged robots with heated circumferences) can only be defeated if Crash slides <b>into</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply by people throwing debris <b>into</b> <b>them</b> while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the graves}} {{are marked by}} plain {{triangular}} stones set at one end. These are not carved or inscribed with names as in Christian cemeteries, but are similar to markers found in pagan cemeteries. Some graves are interrupted by stakeholes cut <b>into</b> <b>them,</b> possibly indicating the presence of wooden poles that might have served as markers or supported wooden structures within the graves. This is unusual {{in the north of}} England, though comparable examples have been found in Kent in the south-east.|$|E

5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs {{in which they can}} jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels are open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging <b>into</b> <b>them</b> to find power-ups.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of poor weather and low cloud cover, the two pilots circled the palace at altitudes of around , periodically diving {{out of the}} clouds to re-attack before darting back <b>into</b> <b>them.</b> The airstrike caught the Saigon garrison off guard and, in the confusion, {{they were unable to}} determine whether the aircraft were acting alone or with ground forces. Loyalist tanks and armoured personnel carriers rushed to their battle stations and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, nearly hitting the loyalist aircraft from Bien Hoa Air Base in pursuit of the two rebel planes. Two tanks and a number of jeeps armed with 50-calibre machine guns patrolled the smoke-filled streets as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas <b>into</b> <b>them.</b> According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E

5|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} to be able to maintain a garrison when required and was well furnished. The ground floor and second floor had fireplaces, with the first and second floors also having garderobes. The ground floor may have formed a dining area, with the floors above being used for military purposes and sleeping accommodation. The walls of the ground floor have chasing and sockets cut <b>into</b> <b>them.</b> It is unclear what these were: theories include that they contained timbers to support brickwork that in turn supported the first floor; that they were held timbers that supported the joists of the first floor; or they are the remains of an ammunition store, retrofitted in the tower in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The virgin forests cooled {{the land}} and streams. The creeks and runs flowed more evenly year-round, since centuries of {{accumulated}} organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall <b>into</b> <b>them.</b> Pine Creek was home to large numbers of fish, including trout, but dams downstream on the Susquehanna River have eliminated the shad, salmon, and eels once found here by blocking their migrations. Habitat for land animals was destroyed by the clearcutting of forests, {{but there was also}} a great deal of hunting, with bounties paid for large predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{winners of}} the 1910 Gordon Bennett Cup, Alan R. Hawley and Augustus Post, set a {{distance}} and duration record of 1,173 miles in 44 hours and 25 minutes, but the pair of experienced balloonists landed in a remote section of Canadian wilderness in Quebec. After a week passed with no word from the team, search parties were formed by the Aero Club of America, but many newspapers reported that the men were likely dead. Instead they emerged after ten days, assisted by two local trappers who had been out on a hunting trip and happened to run <b>into</b> <b>them.</b> Hawley had injured a knee, but otherwise the pair were unharmed and received a hero's welcome upon their safe return.|$|E
