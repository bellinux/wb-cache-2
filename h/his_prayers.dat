5|$|The tale of Nandanar is retold {{numerous}} times in folk tales, folk music, plays, films and literature in Tamil society. While Nandanar {{is included in}} Nayanar list since the 8th century CE, the 12th century CE Periya Puranam gives a full hagiographical account of his life. The tale focuses on two miracles attributed to him. In Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur; <b>his</b> <b>prayers</b> {{are said to have}} moved a giant stone bull, which still appears in the moved position in the temple. Nandanar is said to have ritually purified himself by fire at Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram. Nandar's tale features in temple lore and religious literature related to both these temples.
