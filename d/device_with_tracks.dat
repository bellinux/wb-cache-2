Thus, {{it is important to}} correctly identify the status of deterioration by inspections and to carry out repairs at an appropriate timing. At JR East, we measure dynamic displacement (track irregularity when train load applied) by electric and track inspection cars (East-i) every three months. Material deterioration is periodically inspected by track patrolling on foot and mechanically by inspection <b>devices.</b> <b>With</b> <b>track</b> irregularity for example, when track irregularity exceeds the specified threshold (standard for repair), we estimate the timing for repair based on past experience and car body vibration inspection data to conduct systematic repair. But, even at locations where measurement results have not reached such a threshold, track irregularity may rapidly progress due to factors such as condition of the ballas...|$|R

Our system measures two angular coordinates and the length of a string.

We integrated this idea of a three-dimensional position tracker into two different setups. Our first setup is a free standing <b>device</b> <b>with</b> a <b>tracked</b> handle. The handle is attached to a separate tracking unit at each end, which provides us with a total of five degrees of freedom.

Several solutions {{have been proposed}} to adopt a single location sensing technology that fits in both situations. This paper aims to track a user position in both indoor and outdoor environments by using a single wireless <b>device</b> <b>with</b> minimal <b>tracking</b> error. RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) technique together with enhancement algorithms is proposed to cater this solution. The proposed RSSI-based tracking technique {{is divided into two}} main phases, namely the calibration of RSSI coefficients (deterministic phase) and the distance along with position estimation of user location by iterative trilateration (probabilistic phase). A low complexity RSSI smoothing algorithm is implemented to minimize the dynamic fluctuation of radio signal received from each reference node when the target node is moving. Experiment measurements are carried out to analyze the sensitivity of RSSI. The results reveal the feasibility of these algorithms in designing a more accurate real-time position monitoring system...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} method for estimating the rigid-body motion of arbitrary interaction <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> an infrared-optical <b>tracking</b> system involves attaching pre-defined geometric constellations of retroreflective or light-emitting markers, {{commonly referred to}} as “targets”, to all tracked objects. Optical markers of the same type are typically indistinguishable from each other, requiring the tracking system to establish their identities through known spatial relationships. Consequently, the specific geometric arrangement of markers across multiple targets has a considerable impact on the system’s overall performance and robustness. In this paper, we propose a simple new methodology for constructing optically tracked rigid-body targets. Our practicallyoriented approach employs an optimization heuristic to compute near-optimal marker arrangements. Using prefabricated mounting fixtures, the assembly step requires only basic hobbyist tools and skills...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{availability}} of individual-level spatio-temporal disease data, particularly due to the use of modern communicating <b>devices</b> <b>with</b> GPS <b>tracking</b> functionality. These detailed data have been proven useful for inferring disease transmission to a more refined level than previously. However, there remains a lack of statistically sound frameworks to model the underlying transmission dynamic in a mechanistic manner. Such a development is particularly crucial for enabling a general epidemic predictive framework at the individual level. In this paper we propose a new statistical framework for mechanistically modelling individual-to-individual disease transmission in a landscape with heterogeneous population density. Our methodology is first tested using simulated datasets, validating our inferential machinery. The methodology is subsequently applied to data that describes a regional Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014 - 2015). Our results show that the methods are able to obtain estimates of key epidemiological parameters that are broadly consistent with the literature, while revealing a significantly shorter distance of transmission. More importantly, in contrast to existing approaches, we are able to perform a more general model prediction that takes into account the susceptible population. Finally, our results show that, given reasonable scenarios, the framework can be an effective surrogate for susceptible-explicit individual models which are often computationally challenging...|$|R

Conducting and semiconducting latent tracks may emerge directly from swift heavy ion irradiation. Etched tracks in insulators can be filled with adequate materials to make them conducting or semiconducting. For this purpose metallic or semiconducting nanoclusters were deposited. We have denoted termed these <b>devices</b> made <b>with</b> latent <b>tracks</b> as “tunable electronic anisotropic material on semiconductor ” (TEAMS), if based on latent ion tracks, and as “tunable electronic material in pores in oxide on semiconductor ” (TEMPOS), if based on etched tracks.

Both devices show negative differential resistances. This should enable tunable tunneldiodes. TEAMS or TEMPOS structures can be controlled by various external physical and/or chemical parameters leading to sensors. It is even possible to combine different input currents and/or external parameters according to AND/OR logics.
