50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, some {{surgeons}} had become proficient in performing the tracheotomy procedure. The main instruments used were:“Two small scalpels, one short grooved director, a tenaculum, two aneurysm needles {{which may be}} used as retractors, one pair of artery forceps, haemostatic forceps, two pairs of <b>dissecting</b> <b>forceps,</b> a pair of scissors, a sharp-pointed tenotome, a pair of tracheal forceps, a tracheal dilator, tracheotomy tubes, ligatures, sponges, a flexible catheter, and feathers”.Haemostatic forceps were used to control bleeding from separated vessels that were not ligatured because of the urgency of the operation. Generally, they were used to expose the trachea by clamping the isthmus thyroid gland on both sides. To open the trachea physically, a sharp-pointed tentome allowed the surgeon easily to place the ends into the opening of the trachea. The thin points permitted the doctor a better view of his incision. Tracheal dilators, such as the “Golding Bird”, were placed through the opening and then expanded by “turning the screw to which they are attached.” Tracheal forceps, as displayed on the right, were commonly used to extract foreign bodies from the larynx. The optimum tracheal tube at the time caused very little damage to the trachea and “mucus membrane”.|$|E
50|$|No-scalpel vasectomy was {{developed}} in China by Dr. Li Shunqiang {{with the aim of}} reducing men’s fear related to the incision and increasing vasectomy use in China. Over time, the technique gained popularity and it is now a preferred method of male sterilization in many countries. The procedure is done under local anesthesia, usually in an outpatient clinic. Certain diseases of the male genital system, including infections, filariasis and large hydrocoele are contraindications for no-scalpel vasectomy. These diseases should be treated before no-scalpel vasectomy is performed. The vas is isolated by three-finger technique on both sides. The ideal entry point for the needle is midway between the top of the testes and the base of the penis. Usually, 100 mg lidocaine (without epinephrine) is injected to create a wheal. Afterwards, a ringed clamp is used to puncture the scrotal skin and elevate the vas deferens. A <b>dissecting</b> <b>forceps</b> is used to spread the tissue, pierce the wall of the vas and deliver it outside. It is then occluded and ligated. This procedure has less pain, bleeding and infection than conventional vasectomy. NSV can be done in less time and the individual is able to return to sexual activity sooner than traditional vasectomy surgery.|$|E

Two factors are critical in the design. The opening at the lips should be 0. 23 mm., and {{the underside of the}} forceps at the tips must be flared to prevent contact with the posterior sticky end of the egg.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the three-dimensional architecture of the brain is a fundamental condition to the anatomist and the neurosurgeon, especially during their training in basic or surgical neuroanatomy. Demonstrate through the Klingler’s technique the anatomical three-dimensional disposition of white matter tracts. According to the Klingler’s method (Atlas Cerebri Humani - The inner structure of the brain), is preconized that the material should be fresh. A solution of commercial formalin (5 %) and distilled water (95 %) should be prepared; the material should be immersed and after the course of 4 weeks immersed in the fixing solution, it {{should be placed on}} a tray in the freezer (- 10 °C) during 8 days. Once removed from the freezer, the material must remain in a formalin 3 % solution. We worked with 10 brains prepared as the previously described technique. Our main instruments are: delicate type <b>dissecting</b> Adson <b>forceps</b> without teeth and watchmaker’s forceps, and wooden spatulas with a diameter of 2 and 4 mm. We obtained pieces for the demonstration of various tracts that they are located from the cortex to the depth with a description from the external, medial and basal cerebral aspect. While the dissection of white matter is not a new technique that is used for the study and {{understanding of}} the brain, remains extremely useful. The training in this anatomical analysis technique has an essential importance for each neurosurgeon...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} a new hemostatic method using hemostatic forceps to prevent perforation and perioperative hemorrhage during colonic endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). METHODS: We studied 250 cases, in which ESD for colorectal tumors was {{performed at the}} Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine or Nara City Hospital between 2005 and 2010. We developed a new hemostatic method using hemostatic forceps in December 2008 for the efficient treatment of submucosal thick vessels. ESD was performed on 126 cases after adoption of the new method (the adopted group) and the new method was performed on 102 of these cases. ESD was performed on 124 cases before {{the adoption of the}} new method (the unadopted group). The details of the new method are as follows: firstly, a vessel was coagulated using the hemostatic forceps in the soft coagulation mode according to the standard procedure, and the coagulated vessel was removed using the forceps in the “endocut” mode without perioperative hemorrhage. Secondly, the partial surrounding submucosa was <b>dissected</b> using the <b>forceps</b> in the endocut mode. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of this method. RESULTS: Coagulated vessels were successfully removed using the hemostatic forceps in all 102 cases without severe perioperative hemorrhage. Moderate perioperative hemorrhage occurred in five cases (4. 9 %); however, it was stopped by immediately reuse of the hemostatic forceps. The partial surrounding submucosa was <b>dissected</b> using the <b>forceps</b> in all 102 cases. In the adopted group, the median operation time was 105 min. The proportion of endoscopic en bloc resection was 92. 8 % (P < 0. 01) compared to 80. 6 % in the unadopted group. The postoperative hemorrhage and perforation rates were 2. 3 % and 2. 3 %. The rate of perforation was significantly lower than that in the unadopted group (9. 6 %, P < 0. 01). We evaluated the ease of use of this method by allowing our three trainees to performed ESD on 46 cases, which were accomplished without any severe hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: The new method effectively treated submucosal thick vessels and shows promise for the prevention of perforation and perioperative hemorrhage in colonic ESD...|$|R

30|$|The {{ancillary}} trocars {{are placed}} lateral to the epigastric artery at about two fingers’ width from the anterior superior iliac spine; a third ancillary trocar is placed centrally. The preliminary step is {{the preparation of}} the extraperitoneal hysterectomy according to Kadar [19]. The round ligament is opened at the pelvic side wall, but little or no dissection of the bladder is performed. After the broad ligament is opened and the ureter is dissected at the pelvic brim, the pararectal space is formed. The internal iliac artery is visualized, and the ureter is followed to the cross with the uterine artery. The medial leaf of the broad ligament is left intact. After identification of the uterine artery at its root, bipolar coagulation of the vessel is performed. Frequently, the uterine veins are also visualized and coagulated. However, the whole vascular bundle is respected, without cutting. To dissect the farther part of the ureter, the forceps contralateral to the side of dissection strongly pull the uterus at the round ligament or at the utero-ovarian ligament so that the ureter can be seen in its length. The two other instruments for freeing the ureter from the anterior parametrium should now be scissors or a <b>dissecting</b> <b>forceps</b> and bipolar coagulation. The dissection—as much as the operator can perform—must follow the ureter directly on its adventitia into the anterior parametrium, starting from its lateral and superior aspect and advancing toward the bladder (Figs.  1 and 2). The uterine artery must not be severed at this phase. The upper part of the anterior parametrium is gently separated from the ureter, and the tunnel is formed, keeping all the tissue above.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND In {{contrast}} to female sterilisation in India, a very less {{percentage of the}} couples opt for male sterilisation. This is in spite of male sterilisation being a shorter, simpler procedure fraught with lesser complications, having a shorter recovery time and has less failure rate. The barriers to adoption of male sterilisation in India are profound with reasons ranging from unfounded fears among males characterising vasectomy with physical weakness, loss of virility, manhood and inability to enjoy intercourse. The aim {{of the study is}} to compare the effectiveness of No-scalpel vasectomy (NSV) with fascial interposition of the stumps of vas with non-interposition MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted in the family planning unit of the Department of O & G, Govt. Medical College, Kottayam. The period of study was one year from November 2015 to October 2016. The number of vasectomies during this period was 46. Acceptors posted for vasectomy were divided into 2 groups on a one-to-one basis. Hence, 22 were without fascial interposition and 24 with fascial interposition of the stumps of vas. After the vas is excised to 1 cm, the ligature of the testicular end is cut. The cut ends are passed into the scrotum. The uncut ligature of the prostatic end is pulled out through the wound. With the <b>dissecting</b> <b>forceps,</b> the fascial sheath of the vas deferens is grasped. The fascial membrane is tied below the tie of the prostatic end and then the stump of the prostatic end is slipped back into the scrotum. Hence, the stump of the testicular end is inside the fascial sheath, while the prostatic end is outside. During followup, satisfaction with the procedure was measured on the following domains - pain involved, time required to return to work after the procedure, problems in sexual life, by a questionnaire. A semen analysis was also done after 3 months. RESULTS No significance in the acceptor’s satisfaction between the two groups in terms of pain, return to work or sexual life. No significant difference in the failure rates (p > 0. 05). CONCLUSION Both techniques of vasectomy had no significant difference. However, there was a slight increase in the operating time in the fascial interposition technique...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{change the}} gasless fetoscopy {{technique}} {{in order to}} reduce the diameter of entry orifices in the myometrium. Methods: Seven pregnant ewes were submitted to fetoscopy for repairing a large skin defect measuring 4. 0 x 3. 0 cm, created in the fetal lumbar region at the gestational age of 100 days. The defect was repaired through continuous suture of the skin with approximation of borders. Gasless fetoscopy was used for performing the suture with three orifices to allow entry of the trocar into the myometrium. A 5. 0 -mm optical trocar, and 3. 5 -mm grasping, <b>dissecting</b> and suturing <b>forceps</b> were used. After surgery, pregnancy was maintained until the animals were euthanized on the 133 rd day of gestation, and the fetuses were evaluated. Results: Seven pregnant ewes underwent surgery; the first two cases were characterized as the Pilot Group, in which the endoscopic technique was modified and caliber reduction was possible in two out of three entry orifices in the myometrium. In the five remaining cases (Study Group), the repair was successfully carried out in all the fetuses, and the mean duration of fetoscopy was 98 minutes. There was a case of maternal death attributed to intrauterine infection. Mean intrauterine permanence after surgery was 12 days. Conclusions: The technique was successfully modified, allowing reduction of the uterine orifices necessary to perform the repair of a skin defect in the fetal lumbar region through a new fetoscopy technique. The impact of this modification in repair of myelomeningocele in human fetuses should be studied...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Blanche Capel and Jordan Batchvarov Corresponding author ([b. capel@cellbio. duke. edu](b. capel@cellbio. duke. edu)) ### INTRODUCTION It can {{be useful}} to assay {{migration}} between any two adjacent tissues during development. This protocol assays cell migration between the gonad and mesonephros using tissue recombination between genetically marked and unmarked tissue, combined with an organ culture technique. First, agar blocks are prepared in a custom-built mold. The {{size and shape of}} the wells are important to maintain the authentic three-dimensional morphology of the organ; the molds here are designed specifically to accommodate the gonad/mesonephros complex. Freshly dissected organs are then transferred to grooves within the agar blocks, where they are allowed to grow over 24 - 48 h. Using this protocol, organs develop with good morphology, and show only an ~ 12 -h delay relative to in vivo development. ### RELATED INFORMATION Details on the techniques used in this procedure have been described previously (Martineau et al. 1997; Tilmann and Capel 1999; Brennan et al. 2002, 2003). An overview of the preparation of recombinant organ cultures is presented in Figure 1. The sex of the embryos can be determined by [Sex Chromatin Staining in Amnion Cells]([URL] (Capel and Batchvarov 2008). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Overview of experimental plan. The gonad/mesonephros complex is dissected from wild-type (CD 1) and genetically marked mice (ROSA 26). Gonads and mesonephroi are separated, and wild-type gonads are recombined with transgenically marked mesonephroi and cultured for 24 - 48 h in agar blocks. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Bacto Agar - Buffer for DNA extraction - DMEM containing 10 % fetal calf serum and 50 μg/mL ampicillin (organ culture medium) - Dulbecco’s Minimal Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), prewarmed to 37 °C for Step 17 - Embryos, mouse, 11. 5 - 16. 5 days post-coitum (dpc) - *Obtain embryos from pregnant mice of both a wild-type strain and a transgenic strain expressing a constitutive marker in all of its cells (e. g., β-gal [Gt(ROSA) 26 Sor/J] or EGFP [Cg-Tg(CAG-EGFP) B 5 Nagy/J]; both lines are available from the Jackson Laboratory.) * - Ethanol (optional; see Step 8) ### Equipment ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **. (A) Dimensions of machined mold for casting agar blocks (in.). (B) Finished mold. This mold has three ridges of slightly different dimensions. 1. Agar-block molds - *The dimensions of the wells are important to maintain the morphology of the organ. Design wells specifically for the organ under study, and have them custom-made in a good machine shop. For the recombinant gonad culture presented here, use the dimensions in Figure 2 *. - Autoclave - Beaker - Dishes (tissue culture; 30 -, 60 -, and 100 -mm) - Erlenmeyer flask (500 -mL) - Forceps (# 5; see Step 16) - Hood (tissue culture) - Incubator (tissue culture) preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 - Micropipettor with tips (20 -μL, 200 -μL) - Microscope (dissecting) - Needles (30 -gauge) - Pipettes (glass, hand-pulled) - *The diameters of the openings should be slightly larger than the mesonephroi or gonads, as appropriate; see Steps 21 and 24 *. - Pipettes (plastic, transfer) - *Trim tips to accommodate the urogenital complex comfortably*. - Plates (tissue culture; four-, 12 - or 24 -well) - Razor blade (sterile) - Soap for washing agar-block molds - Stir bar - Stirrer/heater - Tubes (heatproof, 15 mL) - Tubes (microcentrifuge, 1. 5 -mL) (for 11. 5 dpc wild-type embryos; see Step 15. i) ### METHOD **Preparation of the Agar** 1. Add 1. 5 g of Bacto Agar to 100 mL of DMEM in a 500 -mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add a stir bar. - Place the flask into a beaker of H 2 O to make a double boiler. Heat while stirring on a stirrer/heater until the agar is dissolved completely. - *Do not microwave; it will overflow*. - Transfer the flask directly to the heat. Boil the agar for 3 - 5 min. - *Monitor carefully; this boils over easily*. - Aliquot the agar into 15 -mL heatproof tubes in convenient quantities. - *Use 5 - 9 mL, depending on the number of blocks needed for an experiment. Each block requires 1. 5 mL*. - Store the agar aliquots at 4 °C. **Preparation of the Agar Blocks** 6. Wash the agar-block molds with soap and water. Rinse 10 times with tap H 2 O and 10 times with distilled H 2 O. 7. Autoclave the molds. - *Alternatively, just before use, dip the blocks in ethanol and flame them*. 8. Reheat an aliquot of agar in a beaker of H 2 O until it melts completely, then remove from heat and keep in a beaker of warm H 2 O. 9. Working in a tissue culture hood, place a mold with the trench side up into a 100 -mm tissue culture dish. 10. Slowly pipet 1. 5 mL of melted agar onto the top of the mold (surface tension will keep the agar on the block). 11. Cover the tissue culture dish to avoid dehydration. Allow the agar to set for ~ 10 min. 12. Using a sterile razor blade, loosen the agar around the edges. Peel the agar off of the block, inverting it into a 30 -mm tissue culture dish. - *Peel the agar from the block {{in the same direction as}} the trenches are running or the agar will break along the trenches*. 13. Cover the agar with 1. 5 mL of organ culture medium. Allow the agar to equilibrate for at least 2 h (or overnight) in the incubator. **Assembling Recombinant Gonad Organ Cultures** 14. Collect embryos from wild-type or transgenic mice at the developmental stage of interest. Place each embryo in a single well of a tissue culture plate (four-, 12 - or 24 -well). 15. For 11. 5 -dpc wild-type embryos, follow these additional steps: - i. Collect the amnions into 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice. - ii. Catalog each amnion with the well number containing the associated urogenital complex (see Step 17). - iii. Determine the sex of the embryos using the protocol [Sex Chromatin Staining in Amnion Cells]([URL] (Capel and Batchvarov 2008). - *This is a quick method for identifying XX samples by the presence of cells with a condensed chromatin body*. - iv. Reserve a bit of each embryo’s tail for confirmation of the sex by PCR. - *Tail tips are stable in a dry tube on ice for several hours during dissection. Alternatively, they can be processed immediately for DNA extraction or stored at - 20 °C in buffer for DNA extraction*. 16. Using # 5 <b>forceps,</b> <b>dissect</b> the entire bilateral urogenital complex (see Fig. 3) along with the dorsal aorta from all of the embryos. ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") **Figure 3 **. The entire urogenital complex at 11. 5 dpc contains the left and right gonad (G) /mesonephroi (M) and the dorsal aorta (DA), which lies at the midline. Separate the left and right gonad/mesonephros from the complex when you are ready to assemble to avoid tissue curling. Separate the gonad and mesonephros using a 30 -gauge needle. 17. Place each complex back into the individual well of the tissue culture plate containing prewarmed DMEM. Keep tissues at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. - *Four-well plates are preferred: You can remove one plate at a time from the incubator for fine dissection while the rest of the samples stay at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 *. 18. After determining the sex of the wild-type embryos, transfer each urogenital complex to a 60 -mm dish using a plastic transfer pipette (trimmed to accommodate the urogenital complex). 19. Using a 30 -gauge needle, separate the mesonephroi from the urogenital complexes of the embryos carrying a transgenic label. 20. Using a micropipettor with a 200 -μL tip, remove all but 100 - 200 μL of medium from the dish holding the agar block (from Step 13). - *It is much easier to assemble the recombination tissues in a dry well*. 21. Using a pulled glass pipette that has a diameter slightly larger than the mesonephros, transfer the transgenic mesonephroi into the grooves of the agar blocks. - *Each groove can hold approximately three mesonephroi*. - *Dissect one pair of mesonephroi at a time and transfer them to an agar block to prevent curling of the organ*. - *See Troubleshooting*. 22. Position mesonephroi into the groove under a dissecting microscope (see Fig. 3). - *Do not crowd samples; they are easier to work with if they are positioned far apart*. 23. Using a fresh 30 -gauge needle, separate the gonads from the wild-type urogenital complexes. - *To prevent curling, dissect only one or two wild-type gonads before transferring them to the agar and immediately assembling with a mesonephros*. 24. Using a pulled glass pipette that has a diameter slightly larger than the gonads, transfer gonads to an agar groove containing a mesonephros. - *When drawing the gonads into the pipette, keep track of the “cut” side, so that you can deposit the cut side toward the cut side of the mesonephros in the well*. *See Troubleshooting*. 25. Assemble the cut edges of the gonad and mesonephros together (Fig. 4). ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. (A) Agar block with three trenches, equilibrated, medium removed, and ready for loading samples with pulled glass mouth-pipette. (B) Four gonad/mesonephros cocultures are loaded in the top trench, and one is loaded in the middle left. (C) Higher magnification of coculture positioned in trenches; (left) gonad oriented downward; (right) gonad facing up. - *See Troubleshooting*. 26. Once all the samples are assembled completely, use a micropipettor with a 20 -μL tip to remove the remainder of the DMEM. - *Removing medium from the grooves will promote adhesion between the mesonephroi and gonads once you are satisfied with their position*. 27. Add 350 - 400 μL of fresh organ culture medium to the bottom of the 30 -mm tissue culture dish. Incubate for 1 - 2 h in the incubator. - *Do not disturb the samples until they have had time to adhere*. 28. Incubate the agar blocks in closed tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2. - *Placing the 30 -mm dishes inside 100 -mm culture dishes makes them easier to handle when transferring in and out of the incubator*. 29. Change the organ culture medium in the bottom of the dish daily. - *Cultures maintain good morphology for at least 48 h. See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The gonads or mesonephroi stick to the inside of the glass pipette **[Steps 21 and 24]** - **Solution**: Be sure to pick up a small volume of liquid in your pipette before you pick up the organ. - **Problem**: The gonads and mesonephroi are not properly aligned. [Step 25] - **Solution**: The organs are very sticky. Consider the following: - 1. Use pulled glass pipettes that are just slightly larger than the organ. This will provide better control as you pick up and orient the two tissues. - 2. Make sure that the cut sides of the organs are facing one another. - 3. If organs fail to align properly, add some DMEM to the trough and allow the organs to float apart. Then remove most of the medium (i. e., all but 100 - 200 μL) and use a pulled glass pipette or a needle to reassemble the gonads and mesonephroi. - **Problem**: Cultures are not growing optimally. **[Step 29]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Cultures can be improved by pipetting a drop of medium atop each organ to wash it each time you change the medium. Remove the excess washing medium from the well before returning samples to the incubator. - 2. There are differences in serum batches that affect viability and migation efficiency. When changing serum, test three or four batches to determine the best lot. - **Problem**: Mixed organ cultures become contaminated. **[Step 29]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Replace the medium each day to help control contamination. - 2. In general, additional antibiotics and fungicides take a toll on the tissue, but they might be required under some conditions. - 3. Spread the samples among multiple plates so that all the work is not lost if one plate becomes contaminated. - **Problem**: Labeling of plate is lost and it is not possible to distinguish the top and bottom groove on the plate - **Solution**: Always load the plate asymmetrically (e. g., four samples in the top groove, two in the middle, and three on the bottom). Document the location and details of each sample in a diagram in your notebook for reference in case labels on the plates are smudged or lost. ### REFERENCES 1. Brennan J., Karl J., Capel B.

We describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, {{the isolation of}} epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting, and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing. The dissection and dissociation of prostate tissue and the preparation of cells for plating takes 8 - 9 hours. Organoids that can be quantified and analyzed are obtained after 7 - 10 days. Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of both normal and transformed organoids, and should be useful for studies of normal prostate as well as prostate cancer. ### Introduction Three-dimensional “organoid” culture techniques {{have been used for}} culture of stem/progenitor cells from tissues including the small intestine, stomach, liver and pancreas (1 - 4). We have developed a novel method for the culture of prostate epithelial organoids that display tissue architecture resembling that of the normal prostate (5). Our culture system supports the growth and serial passaging of prostate luminal cells, which have historically been difficult to grow, and differs from previous “prostasphere” conditions, which favor the growth of prostate basal cells and fail to display a response to androgen deprivation (6). In particular, our organoid culture conditions allow for the growth of prostate organoids from single luminal stem/progenitor cells, as well as mouse tumor organoids, and thus should be widely applicable for studies of prostate biology. Notably, our culture methods are distinct from recently published conditions for prostate organoid culture using defined media conditions (7, 8). In the following protocol, we describe the digestion and dissociation of prostate tissue into single-cell suspensions containing both prostatic epithelial and stromal cells, the isolation of epithelial cells from the parental population via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using antibodies against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, also CD 326) and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin, also CD 324), and the plating conditions and medium for prostate organoid culture using supplemented hepatocyte medium with 5 % Matrigel. We also describe the serial passaging and freezing of cultures, which can resume growth after thawing. ### Materials 1. 1 Prostate dissection and collagenase digestion 1. 1 or 2 male C 57 BL/ 6 mice (or mice of interest) - PBS (for dissection) - 10 x collagenase/hyaluronidase solution (STEMCELL Technologies # 07912) - Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F- 12 (DMEM/F- 12, Gibco # 10565) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) 1. 2 Enzymatic dissociation to single cell suspension 1. 0. 25 % Trypsin/EDTA (STEMCELL Technologies # 07901) - Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution Modified (HBSS, STEMCELL Technologies # 37150), supplemented with 2 % FBS - Dispase 5 mg/mL (STEMCELL Technologies # 07913) - DNaseI 1 mg/mL (STEMCELL Technologies # 07900) - Trypan blue solution 0. 4 % (Gibco # 15250 - 061) - HBSS + 2 % FBS + 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 (STEMCELL Technologies # 07171) (Critical: We recommend purchasing ROCK inhibitor from STEMCELL Technologies for consistent results.) 1. 3.

Check in advance for availability.) - 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; comes with Corning # 3555056) - Heat-inactivated, charcoal stripped FBS (Gibco # 12676) (Critical: Charcoal-stripped FBS must be heat-inactivated prior to use by heating in 55 °C water bath for 60 min. Heat-inactivated charcoal-stripped FBS can be aliquoted and stored at - 20 °C.) - 100 x Glutamax (Gibco # 35050) - Thawed matrigel (Corning # 354234) (Critical: After removal of Matrigel from storage at - 20 °C, it must remain on ice at all times until use to prevent polymerization. We recommend placing Matrigel on ice in a 4 °C refrigerator overnight to thaw and keeping it on ice until it is added to media. Unused Matrigel can be refrozen, but avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.) - 5 mM ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 - 10 - 5 M dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in ethanol (Sigma #A- 8380) - 100 x antibiotic-antimycotic (Caution: We recommend culturing without antibiotics, but antibiotics can be added during the initial culture period or if there is concern for contamination from other sources.) 1. 5. Passaging and freezing organoids 1. Cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) - 0. 25 % Trypsin/EDTA - HBSS + 2 % FBS - Prepared organoid media (see 2. 4) - Heat-inactivated, charcoal stripped FBS - Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma #D 2650) ### Equipment 1. CO 2 euthanasia chamber - Dissecting microscope - Micro-dissecting instruments - Water baths set at 37 °C and 55 °C - Sterile petri dishes - Eppendorf tubes (1. 5 mL) - Incubator, humidified at 37 °C, with 5 % CO 2 - Laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet - Centrifuges (for Eppendorf and Falcon tubes) - Falcon tubes (15 and 50 mL) - Orbital shaker - Cell strainer 40 uM (Corning # 352340) - Hemocytometer - BD FACSAria cell sorter (or similar) ### Procedure Critical: The volumes detailed below are for dissociation of an intact prostate from an 8 - 12 week wild type mouse. For larger prostate samples such as those from aggressive tumor models, all reagents should be increased proportionally from the volumes suggested below. For example, if a prostate tumor is approximately twice the size of a wild type prostate, 2 x the volume of suggested reagents should be used. 2. 1. Prostate dissection and collagenase digestion 1. In tissue culture hood, combine 200 µL 10 x collagenase/hyaluronidase mixture with 1. 8 mL DMEM/F 12 + 5 % FBS. Place in 37 °C water bath until ready to use. - Resect mouse prostates and transfer to sterile petri dish containing cold PBS for dissection 6. Using a <b>dissecting</b> microscope, fine <b>forceps,</b> and sharp scissors, remove residual fat from prostate tissue. - Fill 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of diluted pre-warmed collagenase/hyaluronidase solution and transfer prostate tissue into the tube. - Using small, sharp sterile scissors, macerate the prostate tissue by rapidly opening and closing the scissors inside the tube to cut the tissue into small pieces. Fill the tube with an additional 400 - 500 µL dilute collagenase/hyaluronidase solution until almost full. - Incubate in 37 °C incubator for 3 hours. (Tip: The Eppendorf tube may be placed on its side in a sterile petri dish to maximize the surface area of prostate tissue exposed to collagenase/hyaluronidase solution. Periodic shaking of the tube to redistribute prostate tissue is helpful.) 2. 2. Enzymatic dissociation to single cell suspension 1. Centrifuge digested tissue at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend pellet in 1. 5 mL cold 0. 25 % trypsin-EDTA and transfer to 50 mL conical tube. Incubate in 4 °C refrigerator for 1 hour. (Caution: To minimize cell death, keep trypsin ≤ 4 °C prior to and during use. Trypsin can be gently thawed overnight with Matrigel and kept on ice. An orbital shaker can be used during the trypsinization step for optimal digestion.) - During trypsinization, place 900 µL dispase in 37 °C water bath at least 10 minutes prior to use. Immediately before use, add 100 µL DNaseI to dispase solution. - After trypsinization is complete (1 hour), add cold HBSS + 2 % FBS (equal to 2 x volume of trypsin) to quench reaction. Centrifuge at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Add 1 mL of pre-warmed dispase/DNaseI solution. Pipette the sample vigorously for 1 - 2 minutes using P 1000 pipette until solution is homogenously translucent with no visible tissue fragments. (Do not allow digestion to continue for more than 2 minutes.) (Critical: To maximize cell dissociation, this pipetting step should be done continuously.) - Add cold HBSS + 2 % FBS (equal to 5 x volume of dispase) to quench reaction. - Filter cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube. - Centrifuge filtered suspension at 350 rcf for 5 minutes and discard supernatant. - Resuspend pellet in 1 mL HBSS + 2 % FBS and transfer to 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tube. - Count viable cells using a hemacytometer and trypan blue. - Centrifuge and resuspend cells in HBSS + 2 % FBS at 100 µL/ 1 × 10 e 6 cells. (If fewer than 1 × 10 e 6 cells are obtained, resuspend in 100 µL) 2. 3. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) *Keep cell suspension and reagents on ice until sorting is finished. 1. Divide cell suspension into four 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes as follows - a. Tube 1 (unstained control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - b. Tube 2 (PerCP control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - c. Tube 3 (APC control) : 100 µL (1 × 10 e 6 cells) - d. Tube 4 (sample for collection) : remaining sample (up to 1 mL) - Add FACS antibodies as follows: - a. Tube 1 : no antibody - b. Tube 2 : 1 µL (1 : 100) anti-mouse E-cadherin PerCP-Efluor 710 antibody - c. Tube 3 : 1 µL (1 : 100) anti-mouse APC-EpCAM antibody - d. Tube 4 : both antibodies at 1 : 100 dilution (1 µL antibody per 100 µL cell suspension). - (Critical: If fewer than 4 × 10 e 6 cells are obtained after enzymatic dissociation, use 10 µL of cell suspension for control|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{internal}} thoracic artery {{is responsible}} for irrigation of the sternum. The sternum consists of three parts, the manubrium, body of sternum and xiphoid process. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze irrigation, by the branches of {{internal thoracic artery}}, towards the posterior side of the manubrium, in which we can observe the insertions of sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles as well as the branches of internal thoracic artery to the body and xiphoid process. Methods: Sixty male and female the anterior sternocostal wall of the thorax previously fixed in formaldehyde solution, with ages ranging from 20 to 80 years were used from the Service of Verification of Death (SVO) of the Federal University of São Paulo - Paulista School of Medicine. The research project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo under number: 0109 / 06 on 02 / 01 / 2006. In these the anterior sternocostal wall of the thorax. the right and left internal thoracic arteries had already been partially dissected by the graduate students, and injected with colored neoprene latex, yellow in left internal thoracic arteries and red in right side arteries. It was used a dissecting microscope with 10 X, <b>dissecting</b> <b>forceps</b> and sharp and blunt point scissors. The trunk and branches of internal thoracic arteries were dissected and after being measured they were recorded in a specific file, the material was photographed at different angles and close. In statistical analysis the paired t test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey technique were employed. Results: The sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles, with their insertions in the manubrium were irrigated by sternal branches in all 120 studied internal thoracic arteries. The body of the sternum received sternal branches originated from both internal thoracic artery and the branches arising directly from it. A difference was found regarding the amount of trunks and sternal branches in different sternal intercostal spaces of 60 the anterior sternocostal wall of the thorax. The xiphoid process was irrigated from the sternal branches of the internal thoracic artery and the superior epigastric artery, branches only of the superior epigastric and irrigation of their own superior epigastric artery. Conclusions: in the final considerations it was reported that the internal thoracic artery actively participates in the irrigation, insertions of the sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles and, therefore, manubrium. The internal thoracic artery is the third arterial pedicle for the sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles. The sternal branches are in greater quantities than those originating from branches of the sternal trunks. The preservation of these trunks is needed to keep the blood supply of the sternum, when suffering sternotomy and using both internal thoracic arteries. The xiphoid process provides irrigation from different vessels, but its maintenance through the superior epigastric artery is relevant since this vessel is richly distributed on the posterior and anterior xiphoid cartilage. Objetivos: As artérias torácicas internas, direita e esquerda, são responsáveis pela irrigação do osso esterno. O uso de ambas as artérias torácicas internas, nas cirurgias de revascularização do miocárdio, é um dos fatores que podem ocasionar a mediastinite, uma vez que dificulta o esterno de receber um bom aporte sanguíneo, facilitando a ação de agentes bacterianos. Abordagens de tratamentos demonstram que ainda não há uma conduta ideal para evitar ou tratar a ferida inflamatória do esterno. A preservação dos ramos esternais é ainda o ideal como resposta às medidas terapêuticas. A irrigação, pelos ramos da artéria torácica interna, para a face posterior do manúbrio na qual se encontram as inserções dos músculos esternotireóideo e esterno-hióideo, bem como os ramos da artéria torácica interna para o corpo e processo xifóide foi a finalidade do presente estudo. Métodos: Foi utilizado 60 faces internas de paredes torácicas anteriores (plastrões torácicos) já formalizados, femininos e masculinos, com idades entre 20 e 80 anos, provenientes do serviço de verificação de óbito (SVO) da Universidade Federal de São Paulo - Escola Paulista de Medicina. Nestes plastões as artérias torácicas internas direitas e esquerdas já se encontravam parcialmente dissecadas, por alunos de pós-graduação, e injetadas com látex neoprene colorido. Foi utilizada lupa de dissecação com aumento de 10 x, pinça de dissecação e tesouras ponta fina e romba. Os troncos e ramos das artérias torácicas internas foram dissecados, medidos e protocolados em fichário específico, o material foi fotografado em diferentes aproximações e ângulos. Na análise estatística o Teste t pareado e não pareado, Análise de Variância (ANOVA) e a técnica de Tukey foram empregados. Resultados: Os músculos esternotireóideo e esterno-hióideo, com suas inserções no manúbrio, foram irrigados por ramos esternais em todas as 120 artérias torácicas internas estudadas. O corpo do esterno recebeu ramos esternais provindos tanto de troncos da artéria torácica interna quanto de ramos originados diretamente dela. Existiu diferença na quantidade de troncos e de ramos esternais nos diferentes espaços intercostais das 60 faces internas de paredes torácicas anteriores. O processo xifóide recebeu irrigação dos ramos esternais da artéria torácica interna e da artéria epigástrica superior, ramos somente da epigástrica superior e irrigação da própria artéria epigástrica superior. Nas considerações finais, a artéria torácica interna participa ativamente da irrigação, nas inserções, dos músculos esternotireóideo e esterno-hióideo e consequentemente do manúbrio. Os ramos esternais são em maior quantidade do que aqueles ramos originados dos troncos esternais, a preservação destes troncos se faz necessária para manter o aporte sanguíneo do esterno, quando este sofrer esternotomia e forem utilizadas ambas as artérias torácicas internas. O processo xifóide apresenta irrigação provinda de diferentes vasos, mas sua manutenção pela a artéria epigástrica superior é relevante, já que este vaso se distribui ricamente pela face posterior e anterior do processo xifóide.
