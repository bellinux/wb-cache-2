40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} the first {{national}} crime victimization survey carried out on a Caribbean island. A stratified random sample of 491 persons were interviewed, with a 90 % response rate. Results were compared with those obtained in the International Crime Victims Survey for 10 countries. The prevalence and incidence of theft of vehicles, theft from vehicles, vehicle vandalism, robbery and personal theft <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> low on the island. The prevalence and incidence of bicycle theft, burglary, attempted burglary, outside theft, assault/threats and sexual incidents <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> high on the island. The probability of reporting a crime to the police <b>was</b> <b>relatively</b> low on the island, but confidence in the police <b>was</b> <b>relatively</b> high. Despite the relatively high level of crime on the island, fear of crime <b>was</b> <b>relatively</b> low...|$|R
30|$|In June, July, and September, {{salinity}} <b>was</b> <b>relatively</b> low in {{the zone}} between B and D but high in the zone between A and B (Fig.  4). The distributions of low-salinity water corresponded strongly to the zones in which the 222 Rn concentrations <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> high in all surveys. The distribution of Chl-a was constant throughout the survey, including in March. The Chl-a concentrations <b>were</b> <b>relatively</b> high in the zone between B and D but {{low in the}} zone between A and B (Fig.  5). The distribution of high-Chl-a water corresponded strongly to the zones in which the 222 Rn concentration <b>was</b> <b>relatively</b> high.|$|R
5|$|Because PGAD <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> rare and, {{as its own}} concept {{apart from}} {{clitoral}} priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the vast}} {{size of its}} coma, Halley's nucleus <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> small: barely 15kilometers long, 8kilometers wide and perhaps 8kilometers thick. Its shape vaguely resembles that of a peanut. Its mass <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> low (roughly 2.2kg) and its average density is about 0.6g/cm3, {{indicating}} that it is made {{of a large number}} of small pieces, held together very loosely, forming a structure known as a rubble pile. Ground-based observations of coma brightness suggested that Halley's rotation period was about 7.4 days. Images taken by the various spacecraft, along with observations of the jets and shell, suggested a period of 52hours. Given the irregular shape of the nucleus, Halley's rotation is likely to be complex. Although only 25% of Halley's surface was imaged in detail during the flyby missions, the images revealed an extremely varied topography, with hills, mountains, ridges, depressions, and at least one crater.|$|E

50|$|For any field F, if two polynomials p(x),q(x) ∈ Fx <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> prime {{then they}} do not have a common root, for if a ∈ F was a common root, then p(x) and q(x) would both be {{multiples}} of x &minus; a and therefore they would not <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> prime. The fields for which the reverse implication holds (that is, the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they <b>are</b> <b>relatively</b> prime) <b>are</b> precisely the algebraically closed fields.|$|R
