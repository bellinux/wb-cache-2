5|$|Canada had {{originally}} planned to send two ski jumpers, Nels Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie. Nelsen held world {{record for the}} longest ski jump. However, lack of funding meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who organized the Canadian team and who felt working for their fare was inappropriate and not <b>fitting</b> <b>for</b> the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|According to a sales ranking {{conducted}} by PCPress, Tayutama: Kiss on my Deity {{was the second}} best-selling bishōjo game in July 2008, only falling behind Key's Little Busters! Ecstasy. It was also the second most widely sold game on Getchu.com for July 2008, and was the sixth most widely sold {{game of the year}} on the website. The game was also the twenty-seventh most widely sold game on the website for the month of April 2009. The game received two awards from the 2008 Bishōjo Game Awards panel, a silver prize for graphics, coming behind Akabeisoft2's The Devil on G-String, and a gold prize for character designs. Tadamoto Ōsawa, the editor-in-chief of the Japanese bishōjo magazine BugBug, praised Moekibara for his heroines' appealing character designs, and cited Mashiro as a character <b>fitting</b> <b>for</b> the award.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely <b>fitting</b> <b>for</b> her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E

5|$|The 30-word {{design was}} the most popular {{recruitment}} poster at the time having been printed ten times the volume of Leete's image. Leete's image has been praised for being more arresting while his accompanying text is also far less verbose. The official wording, taken from a Kitchener speech, may seem more <b>fitting</b> <b>for</b> a character in a Henry James novel. The 30-word recruiting poster was developed as Britons' collective hopes of the war being over by Christmas were dashed in January 1915 and volunteer enlistments fell.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchaser}} in the 1888 {{sale was}} John Bullough, a cotton machinery manufacturer (and self-made millionaire) from Accrington in Lancashire, {{who continued to}} use the island for recreational purposes. In the following year, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; Rùm therefore {{became part of the}} new county of Argyll. When Bullough died in 1891 he was buried on Rùm, in a rock-cut mausoleum, under an octagonal stone tower. His heirs, however, felt that this was beneath his dignity, and demolished it, moving his sarcophagus into an elaborate mausoleum modelled as a Greek temple. Argyll, similarly, was not thought <b>fitting</b> <b>for</b> Rùm, and that same year was moved by boundary review to the county of Inverness, where Eigg already sat.|$|E
5|$|Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, {{the rear}} {{section of the}} centipede. As with Williams, The Human Centipede was Yennie's first major film role. Yennie {{was one of several}} actresses to {{audition}} for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams. Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, sister of Tom Six and the film's producer, and did not meet Tom Six, who had viewed tapes of her reading, until <b>fitting</b> <b>for</b> the centipede special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie was drawn to the role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic it scared her.|$|E

5|$|Because he {{acts as a}} {{link between}} the other main {{characters}} of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene. In an interview in Shōnen Jump's, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi. In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi's face but was not sure whether {{it would be in the}} manga or an upcoming movie. The Raikiri, one of Kakashi's most common techniques, had a different name, but the author forgot about its original name. Nevertheless, he found the name Raikiri <b>fitting</b> <b>for</b> this lightning-based technique. Kakashi's Sharingan was introduced to give the character mystery as only members from the Uchiha clan could possess it. By chapter 16 of the manga, Kishimoto had already decided how Kakashi obtained the Sharingan. He also added that Kakashi's face was difficult to draw since it is covered by a mask.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles also {{received}} digital enhancement. For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more <b>fitting</b> <b>for</b> Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.|$|E
