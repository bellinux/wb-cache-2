An article by GamesRadar staff of the [...] "12 PAX East games we wish we were still playing" [...] included VA-11 HALL-A; praise was directed at the game's complexity, and how [...] "you can decide to give the customer the drink they ordered, flipping through the recipe book and dragging ingredients into the mixer in a simple minigame, or you can screw it up, and give them something totally different", {{as well as the}} [...] "wildly different directions" [...] the narrative takes as a result. Similarly, Twinfinite's Matthew Byrd ranked VA-11 HALL-A first on the [...] "10 Anticipated Indie Games You Have to Check Out in 2016", writing that: [...] "While I can honestly say that I've never specifically wished for a cyberpunk bartending game before, now that I know such a thing exists, it is all that I can think of." [...] Zach Budgor of Kill Screen described VA-11 HALL-A as one of their favourite titles at Cyberpunk Game Jam 2014, describing it as [...] "self-styled 'cyberpunk bartender action' with detailed art and an LP's worth of bass-heavy future bangers." [...] PC Gamer added VA-11 HALL-As playable prologue to their list of [...] "The best free PC games". Upon release, Thomas Faust of IndieGames.com labelled VA-11 HALL-A the best game of the year, adding [...] "as far as I'm concerned, the rest of 2016 can <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now.</b> Game of the year right there, bam." [...] Faust also noted that the slice of life setting of VA-11 HALL-A, as well as its characters, are a departure from more conventional video game settings. Similarly, Gizmodo UK on June 25 listed VA-11 HALL-A as their top recommended video game for the week. Ana Valens of Den of Geek also listed VA-11 HALL-A as [...] "one of the great visual novels of 2016", again praising the game's characters and [...] "powerful" [...] writing.|$|E

6000|$|... 'And {{keep him}} {{as long as}} he lives,' she agreed. 'But I think I ought to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now.</b> You see, when I came out I didn't expect ... Did you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well! A {{breath of}} fresh air, by myself. I felt forced to feel--I feel if I <b>go</b> back <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> I shall be FORCED--forced to love--or care--or something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, them, you'd better <b>go</b> <b>home</b> just <b>now,</b> for you can't {{see your}} mother to-night. We dare {{not let her}} speak, but come back early to-morrow, and you shall hear about her--perhaps see her. Here, put that in your pocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I could <b>go</b> back <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> honorably and well, I {{would never}} do it," [...] he muttered. [...] "I couldn't bear to live knowing what I know now--unless I had laughed at this death, and risked it--and dealt it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't lend you a thing," [...] {{declared}} the sergeant. [...] "I won't aid and abet {{you in any}} such freak as this. <b>Go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> like a good girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{you stay}} here, eh?" [...] demanded the Indian, abruptly. [...] "Got plenty honey--bess <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>now.</b> Always bess go home, when hunt up. Home good place, when hunter well tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't you <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now</b> {{you have}} enough to live, with a little economy, as you were meant to do?" [...] she said. [...] "This country {{is no place for}} you." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{examination}} {{passed over}} well; M. Paul {{was as good}} as his word, and did his best to make my part easy. The next day came the distribution of prizes; that also passed; the school broke up; the pupils <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> and <b>now</b> began the long vacation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{pulled the}} worst kind of bone. I stopped on in London {{when the rest of the}} company <b>went</b> back <b>home,</b> and <b>now</b> I've got to stick." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{sat down}} on a bench, and he sat there all day, except when he went to drink from the tin cup {{dangling}} by the chain from the nearest fountain. His good breakfast kept him from being hungry for a while, but he was as aimless and as hopeless as ever, and as destitute. He would have <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> <b>now</b> if he had had the money; he was afraid they would be getting anxious about him there, though he had not made any particular promises about the time of returning. He had dropped a postal card into a box as soon as he reached Boston, to tell of his safe arrival, and they would not expect him to write again.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘It {{would be}} base to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> fair princess, {{and to have}} sailed all these seas in vain.’ Then both the princesses besought him; but Jason said, ‘It is too late.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you'd better <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> {{and perhaps}} the old lady will make you another pair," [...] {{suggested}} Dorothy. [...] "We're {{on our way to}} Fuddlecumjig, and you may hop along beside us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Take care you don't,' replied his uncle. 'You {{had better}} <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> and pack up {{what you have}} got to pack. Do you think you could find your way to Golden Square first?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I bought Nack-yal {{from this}} Indian three years ago. This mare is Nack-yal's mother. He was born {{over here to}} the south. That's why he always swung left off the trail. He wanted to <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Just <b>now</b> he {{recognized}} his mother and she whaled away {{and gave him a}} whack for his pains. She's got a colt now and probably didn't recognize Nack-yal. But he's broken-hearted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor boy! You will <b>go</b> <b>home</b> with us <b>now,</b> {{and let us}} {{take care}} of you in quiet England. You'll play no more pranks, but go soberly to work and do {{something}} that shall make me proud to be your cousin, won't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] said Father Tiebout, [...] "one {{grows out}} of it, {{and that is a}} little different. Our friend yonder once <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> too, but <b>now</b> I think he will stay here altogether, as I shall do, unless I am sent elsewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chopped him!" [...] Lord George {{was very}} patient, and {{explained}} to Lizzie, {{who was now}} indignant and disappointed, the misfortune of chopping. [...] "And are we to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now?</b> Is it all over?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean {{every word}} of it," [...] {{returned}} Josephine calmly. [...] "You'd better <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> David. I always feel as if I'd like to be alone for a spell after a disagreeable experience." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am willing}} to <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>now</b> that I know my name is cleared," [...] {{answered}} Lester Lawrence. [...] "But I can't travel just yet," [...] he added, ruefully, {{looking down at his}} bandaged foot.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{receiving}} {{news that}} King Baldwin III of Jerusalem was marching north with some Templars {{to relieve the}} siege, Nur ad-Din opened negotiations. The border between Antioch and Aleppo was re-drawn to Nur ad-Din's gain and the armies <b>went</b> <b>home.</b> Joscelin <b>now</b> found that his enemy Raymond's defeat and death placed his own possessions in extreme peril. Joscelin would soon be captured by Nur ed-Din (1150) and what remained of his County of Edessa evacuated by its Latin inhabitants.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go 'way, dere!" [...] shouted Holly. [...] "Aunt Tillum ain't <b>home.</b> <b>Go</b> 'way <b>now,</b> and tum bat {{in half an}} hour. Aunt Tillum'll be bat den. Don't yer hear now, go 'way!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he asked}} Amelia {{to take a}} walk with him as he <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> {{reflecting}} that <b>now</b> had come the time in which a little wholesome conversation might have its effect. And an idea entered his head that in his old age an acquaintance with a neighboring clergyman might be salutary to himself. So Amelia got her bonnet and walked home with him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you much,' said Ethelberta, with dignity. 'Thank you for {{bringing}} my book, but I must <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now.</b> I know that {{you will see that}} it is not necessary for us to be talking here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll talk of that tomorrow. It is very late. <b>Go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> please, before Uncle comes," [...] she said, {{trying to}} speak {{naturally}} yet betraying her distress by the tremor of her voice and the sad anxiety in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, look here, Skip Miller, I ain't got any {{too much}} love for you, but it don't seem right {{to let a}} boy go on as you've begun. <b>Go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> an' leave Billings {{to take care of}} his own business." ...|$|E
50|$|Rose Ceremony: Emily {{decided to}} cancel the {{cocktail}} party because she already had her mind made up. She gave the first two roses to Jef and Arie. With one rose left, Chris asked to speak with Emily where he pleaded his case to her. Upon their return to the ceremony, Emily gave Chris the final rose, forcing John to <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Emily will <b>now</b> travel to meet the families of Sean, Arie, Jef and Chris.|$|R
6000|$|Then a rattle, {{a daring}} hope in every eye, the {{swinging}} of a door, {{the smell of}} strong coffee, Dave Dyer's mewing voice in a triumphant, [...] "The eats!" [...] They began to chatter. They had something to do. They could escape from themselves. They fell upon the food--chicken sandwiches, maple cake, drug-store ice cream. Even when the food was gone they remained cheerful. They could <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> any time <b>now,</b> and go to bed! ...|$|R
5000|$|At first, {{the camp}} resembled {{more of a}} small town than a prison. The Germans were allowed a lot of freedom because the United States and Germany were not yet at war, but after Adolf Hitler's {{declaration}} on December 9, 1941, permission to go to Capitan, or hike in the nearby mountains, was no longer obtainable. For two years the German sailors had waited to <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> and <b>now</b> that the war had begun they were no longer being held as [...] "distressed seamen," [...] but rather enemy aliens that could only be released when the war was over. It was at this time that the guard towers and barbed wire fences were built.|$|R
6000|$|Haney {{changed the}} current {{of all their}} {{thinking}} by saying to Bertha: [...] "If you are minded to <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>now</b> is your chance, acushla. You can return with Mr. Fordyce, while Lucius and I go on to New York the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{at least}} prevent you from {{entering}} the mine, and that I shall do {{even if it is}} necessary to station guards entirely around the property. Are you willing to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>now,</b> men, with the assurance that work shall be resumed in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the meantime, I care naught about ye, Robert Moore: ye {{are nothing}} akin {{to me or}} mine, and whether ye lose or find a fortune it maks no {{difference}} to me. <b>Go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>now.</b> It has stricken ten. Miss Hortense will be wondering where ye are." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{old woman}} herself {{did nothing to}} attract public notice till they were midway between Seventh and Eighth avenues. She mumbled {{something}} {{from time to time}} which the colored girl interpreted to the rest as her continued wish to <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> She was <b>now</b> clearer about her street and number. The girl, as if after question of her own generous spirit, said she did not see how she could go with her; she was expected at home herself.|$|R
6000|$|Which {{you would}} willingly rid him of, ha! ha!--ugh, ugh," [...] {{answered}} the usurer, [...] "if you knew how--but, lack-a-day! thou art {{one of those}} that come out for wool, and art sure to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> shorn. Why <b>now,</b> but that I am sworn against laying of wagers, I would risk some consideration that this honest guest of mine sends thee home penniless, if thou darest venture with him--ugh, ugh--at any game which gentlemen play at." ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} days of the year 2003 twenty-five European {{countries}} failed to come to terms with all demands enclosed within the project of a Constitution for Europe. Everyone <b>went</b> <b>home.</b> <b>Now</b> nothing is agreed upon before all is agreed upon, and hopes are high that the Irish Presidency will manage to bring about a satisfactory covenant sometime in the Spring. In the meantime, a secession clause has crept into the agenda for Europe quietly. Article 59 of the upcoming Constitution allows any Member State, and thus all Member States, to leave the Treaty at will and in the process, entitles them to a bilateral agreement that clarifies the terms of such a procedure. The Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice had addressed the issue of suspension of a Member States voting rights but halted at the threshold of secession. Their unwillingness to go further had made it very clear to Member States that agreement and compromise was the only answer allowed when European issues were at stake. After the Constitution a Member State may distance itself not only from single issues under discussion but from European affairs altogether. It may later repent and appeal to article 57 to re-join the Union. Frontiers are thus rendered temporary. All European frontiers, old and new are rendered temporary. The external border is no longer fated to expand only, it may retreat, and the old and forgotten internal borders may be resurrected. ...|$|R
