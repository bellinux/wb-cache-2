5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz <b>has</b> <b>very</b> low thermal expansion, while soda-lime glass <b>has</b> <b>very</b> high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E

5|$|HIV {{differs from}} many viruses {{in that it}} <b>has</b> <b>very</b> high genetic variability.
