40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explain the {{principle}} <b>of</b> automatic <b>disconnection</b> <b>of</b> supply, {{which is one of}} the basic protective measures for security assurance in electric installations of low voltage according to the new issue of Czech Technical Standard (ČSN 33 2000 - 4 - 41 ed. 2). Furthermore, the relevant clauses of the Czech Technical Standard in the new and previous issues are compared, with focus on the problem <b>of</b> automatic <b>disconnection</b> <b>of</b> supply in basic types of distribution networks. In agreement with theoretical conclusions, a project of electric energy supply system is proposed in the practical part of the thesis. Special attention is paid to showing the methods of modeling and verification of conditions for automatic <b>disconnection</b> <b>of</b> supply, with using control calculations in the SICHR program. Finally, the fulfillment of the conditions for automatic <b>disconnection</b> <b>of</b> supply is verified by revising the electrical supply system...|$|R

40|$|Responses of [beta]-tubulin gene {{expression}} to low-temperature exposure (4 [deg]C) {{have been investigated}} in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. During low-temperature exposure, the patterns of both [alpha]- and [beta]-tubulin isoforms are altered; the effect is smaller for the [alpha]-tubulins than for the [beta]-tubulins, however. An examination of [beta]-tubulin {{gene expression}} revealed that during low-temperature exposure, transcript levels <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 2, TUB 3, TUB 6, and TUB 8 decrease, whereas those <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 4, TUB 5, and TUB 7 remain constant, and the TUB 9 transcript level increases. The changes in transcript levels <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 6, TUB 8, and TUB 9 were detectable after 6 h of low-temperature treatment. As shown by transcription-blocking experiments, the in vivo decay rates at 25 [deg]C are comparable to those at 4 [deg]C for TUB 5, TUB 6, and TUB 8 mRNAs, whereas TUB 9 mRNA {{appears to be more}} stable at 4 [deg]C than at 25 [deg]C. Thus, decreases in transcript levels <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 6 and TUB 8 in response to low temperature appear to be regulated at the transcriptional level, and the increase in TUB 9 transcript level that results from lowering the temperature from 25 [deg]C to 4 [deg]C may be due in part to its slower rate of decay at 4 [deg]C. When a chimeric gene containing 1061 base pairs <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 8 5 [prime] flanking DNA fused to the [beta]-glucuronidase coding region was used to produce transgenic Arabidopsis plants, the chimeric gene expression was down-regulated in response to low temperature as assayed by histochemical localization and RNA gel blots. These results confirm that the alteration of transcript levels <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 8 in response to low temperature is regulated at the transcriptional level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We have {{isolated}} a cold-sensitive allele <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 2, {{the sole}} gene encoding/ 3 -tubulin in S. cerevisiae, that confers a specific defect in spindle microtubule function. At 14 °C, tub 2 - 406 cells lack a normal bipolar spindle but do assemble functional cytoplasmic microtubules. In {{an attempt to}} identify proteins that are important for spindle assembly, we screened for suppressors of the cold-sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>tub</b> 2 - 406 and obtained four alleles of a novel gene, STU 1. Genetic interactions between stul alleles and alleles <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 1 and TUB 2 suggest that Stulp specifically interacts with microtubules. STU 1 is essential for growth and disruption of STU 1 causes defects in spindie assembly {{that are similar to}} those produced by the tub 2 - 406 mutation. The nucleotide sequence of th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. ~/-Tubulin is a conserved {{component}} of microtubule-organizing centers and {{is thought to}} be involved in microtubule nucleation. A recently discovered Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene (TUB 4) encodes a tubulin that is related to, but divergent from, ~/-tubulins. TUB 4 is essential for cell viability, and epitopetagged Tub 4 protein (Tub 4 p) is localized to the spindle pole body (Sobel, S. G., and M. Snyder. 1995. J. Cell Biol. 131 : 1775 - 1788). We have characterized the expression <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 4, the association <b>of</b> <b>Tub</b> 4 p with the spindle pole body, and its role in microtubule organization. Tub 4 p is a minor protein in the cell, and expression <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 4 is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

40|$|Tub 4 p {{is a novel}} tubulin {{found in}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It most resembles gamma-tubulin and, like it, is {{localized}} to the yeast microtubule organizing centre, the spindle pole body (SPB). In this paper we report the identification of SPC 98 as a dosage-dependent suppressor of the conditional lethal tub 4 - 1 allele. SPC 98 encodes an SPB component of 98 kDa which {{is identical to the}} previously described 90 kDa SPB protein. Strong overexpression of SPC 98 is toxic, causing cells to arrest with a large bud, defective microtubule structures, undivided nucleus and replicated DNA. The toxicity of SPC 98 overexpression was relieved by co-overexpression <b>of</b> <b>TUB</b> 4. Further evidence for an interaction between Tub 4 p and Spc 98 p came from the synthetic toxicity <b>of</b> <b>tub</b> 4 - 1 and spc 98 - 1 alleles, the dosage-dependent suppression of spc 98 - 4 by TUB 4, the binding <b>of</b> <b>Tub</b> 4 p to Spc 98 p in the two-hybrid system and the co-immunoprecipitation <b>of</b> <b>Tub</b> 4 p and Spc 98 p. In addition, Spc 98 - 1 p is defective in its interaction with Tub 4 p in the two-hybrid system.
