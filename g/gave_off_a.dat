5|$|No rivers or streams {{ran into}} the sound but note that early maps {{conflict}} and show that the River Cadoxton, originating from feeder brooks meeting at Michaelston-le-pit between Ely, Leckwith and Wenvoe to the north-east, passed through Dinas Powys and Sully Moors and bypassed the Barry shoreline to meet the sea near Cold Knap Point before decades later, Cold Knap promenade and Watchtower Bay was developed. With {{the coming of the}} docks, the River Cadoxton was re-routed from Sully moors through what was later to become the Supplies Reserve Depôt (SRD) and later still, the chemical complexes in the area, to discharge south-east of the dock's south-east breakwater at the Bendricks. For many years after the last war, with the dissolution of the SRD and coming of the chemical works, effluent discharge from some of them, was carried along the river to the sea and turned the water white in colour and it <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> pungent effervescent odour until bylaws brought this pollution to an end and gradually the hitherto white shoreline at that area, returned to its normal sandstone colour.|$|E

25|$|Scheele's {{study of}} the gas not yet named oxygen was {{prompted}} by a complaint by Torbern Olof Bergman, a professor at Upsala University who would eventually become Scheele's friend. Bergman informed Scheele that the saltpeter he had purchased from Scheele's employer, after long heating, produced red vapors (now known to be nitrogen dioxide) when it {{came into contact with}} acetic acid. Scheele's quick explanation was that the saltpeter had absorbed phlogiston with the heat (had been reduced to nitrite, in modern terms) and <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> new phlogisticated gas as an active principle when combined with an acid (even a weak acid).|$|E

25|$|On Monday, October 7, 1985, four PLF militants hijacked Achille Lauro off Egypt. The hijackers {{had been}} {{surprised}} by a crew member and acted prematurely. The Palestinians had hidden their weapons in the gas tank of a car parked in Italian in preparation for boarding the ship. Their smuggled weapons still with gasoline residue on them, <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> smell that the crew had noticed but had not acted on. A cabin steward, with the hijackers' stateroom in his responsibilities, surprised the four Palestinians (as {{they were trying to}} use a hairdryer to clean the residue off their weapons) by entering the unlocked door to their room in order to deliver complimentary fruit. The hijackers plan to launch an attack on Ashdod, Israel was put aside as the terrorists panicked and moved to hijack the ship instead.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt was}} also {{made in the}} late 18th century {{to improve the quality}} of street lighting. In 1669, under Louis XIV, the city was already lit with three {{thousand}} oil lamps, suspended in the middle of the street at a height of twenty feet, with twenty feet between each lantern, but not every street was lit, and the light was usually very dim; those going out at night or to the theater were usually obliged to hire a lantern-bearer to light their way until the end of the century. Between 1745 and 1769, the old lanterns were gradually replaced by a new model called a réverbère which, mounted on a lamp post, <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> much brighter light. By 1789 there were 5,694 new lanterns in service. A few years later the most popular revolutionary song, Ça ira! urged Parisians to hang aristocrats from the new lanterns.|$|E

500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave a more mixed review, {{suggesting}} that Spears [...] "frequently sounds disconnected, {{even a bit}} bored" [...] throughout the record, whereas Blackout was a [...] "relentless, risky album made by a woman whose obituary was apparently being prepared by Associated Press." [...] A writer for The Independent gave a negative review, opining that Spears' vocal delivery sounded emotionless in mid-tempo and ballad-paced tracks. Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson shared a similar sentiment, {{suggesting that}} the album's [...] "self-actualization" [...] <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> [...] "hollow" [...] feel through {{the majority of the}} record. Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times felt that Circus served as a [...] "bang-up job" [...] of stating that [...] "Spears is still a young woman trying to manage an impossible situation." [...] Writing for NME, Hamish MacBain was disappointed that [...] "Spears is quite simply rubbish at being sexy", adding that Circus is the [...] "umpteenth attempt to turn the perceived chaos of Britney's transition to adulthood – she's 27 next week! – into sleazy, raunchy, dirrty adult-pop product." ...|$|E
500|$|Selenium (Greek σελήνη selene meaning [...] "Moon") was {{discovered}} in 1817 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Johan Gottlieb Gahn. Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near Gripsholm, Sweden, producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process. The pyrite from the Falun mine created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the pyrite's use to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn {{wanted to use the}} pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> smell like horseradish when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from tellurium compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to Alexander Marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the Falun mine minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the Moon.|$|E
500|$|The Projector had {{a number}} of defects. It was {{difficult}} to move, the tripod had the tendency to damage itself if it was dropped, and its discharge pressure has been described as [...] "feeble." [...] The phosphorus grenades exhibited a number of faults when used in the Projector; they could often explode inside the weapon if too much black powder were added, or fall short if too little were used, or even fail to explode. They could also break inside the barrel when fired which often led to the weapon being damaged and its crew injured. Even when fired properly, the Projector <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> large cloud of smoke which could take up to a minute to clear and revealed the weapon's position. Bishop argues that its anti-tank abilities would have been 'doubtful' when it fired hand and rifle grenades, although he considers that the phosphorus grenades might have been more successful. To make handling easier, a lighter version of the weapon, the Northover Projector Mk 2 was developed in 1941, but few were produced.|$|E

500|$|One song–"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"–was improvised {{during a}} {{rehearsal}} starting {{off as a}} song with few if any lyrics. A.B. began playing a groove that enticed other band members to play their respective instruments. The band's drummer, Suzette Quintanilla, said [...] "we were goofing off" [...] and insisted that after A.B. began playing on his guitar, Selena started singing, coming up with lyrics [...] "as ideas came to her." [...] It started off being about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean and later turned into a recording played under a riff using a crybaby, which <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> wah-wah sound. The riff, improvised by Pérez, became {{the basis of the}} song before the writing process began. The track was used during the band's concerts to prevent promoters from reducing their pay for playing for a shorter time than promised. Selena performed the song at the La Feria concert in Nuevo Leon in September 1993, a day before the singer and Astudillo began [...] " [...] the lyrics and melody together". A.B. joined as co-writer, wrote the guitar solos for Pérez, as well as the arrangements for the song, and called it [...] "kinda a little scary" [...] finding the project the first of its kind.|$|E
500|$|... A.B. {{spoke out}} against the [...] "filler songs" [...] that their father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. wanted on their recordings, and began playing a groove that {{gradually}} became a song. Suzette Quintanilla, the band's drummer, said [...] "we were goofing off" [...] and insisted that after A.B. began playing on his guitar, Selena started singing, coming up with lyrics [...] "as ideas came to her". Pérez, who later eloped with Selena in 1992, wrote that the lyrics Selena came up with were unfamiliar to him despite the singer's habit of spontaneously writing ideas in a notebook and leaving it [...] "wherever around the house". The song was originally used for soundchecks during the band's rehearsals and was then transformed into a short recording by Selena about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean. Pérez said that what was then called [...] "Little Bidi Bubbles" [...] came easily [...] "for everyone in the band." [...] In a 2002 interview {{he said that he}} played a riff using a crybaby (which <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> wah-wah sound) and that A.B. gave him a [...] "look" [...] that suggested he was impressed with the sound that he had improvised. The riff became the basis of the song before the writing process began.|$|E
500|$|Leon Hurley, {{writing for}} GamesRadar, {{was of the}} opinion that, while the [...] "gore and guts" [...] were {{sparingly}} effective, {{a number of his}} most favorite moments had to do with investigating the [...] "beautifully designed" [...] Baker house. As for the VR, it was dubbed as a terrifying experience [...] "where the mildewy atmosphere gets into your soul". Giant Bombs Dan Ryckert referred to Resident Evil 7 as the reinvigoration of earlier components in the series {{while at the same time}} yielding a fresh outlook with a yet-unrivaled story. The main antagonists bore substantial weight to Ryckert's cause for worry, and gave way to thrills when prompted to flee them. He viewed the first-person perspective as [...] "bold", and attributed to the PlayStation VR, an earnest addition to the [...] "scare factor". Chloi Rad of IGN endorsed the pervading tone of eeriness in the game, owed entirely to the plantation, which she thought was [...] "one of the creepiest single settings since the Spencer Mansion". Also, she observed that the game world <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> robust sense of place with unwavering exploration. To her, the Baker family were the most compelling of the characters because of the consequent emotional strain felt in their presence. Andy Kelly at PC Gamer began his review, writing, [...] "It's a return to the atmospheric, slow-burning horror of the original". He disagreed with Ryckert's assessment that the first-person was a bold reinvention, instead praising it for being [...] "classic Resident Evil through and through". Kelly saw the regular state of vulnerability he was faced within the game as one of its greatest strengths, giving credit to the visuals and audio for adding to the [...] "rumbling sense of dread". He considered flashbacks via VHS tapes to be one of his favorite features. Polygons Philip Kollar applauded Resident Evil 7s return to form, declaring that [...] "no Resident Evil game since the first has done as good a job as RE7 at making me feel scared and helpless".|$|E

2500|$|Brand's process {{originally}} involved letting urine {{stand for}} days until it <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> terrible smell. Then he boiled {{it down to}} a paste, heated this paste to a high temperature, and led the vapours through water, where he hoped they would condense to gold. Instead, he obtained a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark. Brand had discovered phosphorus. We now know that Brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate, [...] While the quantities were essentially correct (it took about [...] of urine to make about 60g of phosphorus), it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot. Later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus.|$|E
2500|$|The robe à la française or sack-back gown was looser-fitting and {{a welcome}} change for women used to wearing bodices. With flowing pleats from the {{shoulders}} was originally an undress fashion. At its most informal, this gown was unfitted both front and back and called a sacque. With a more relaxed style came a shift away from heavy fabrics, such as satin and velvet, to Indian cotton, silks and damasks. Also, these gowns were often made in lighter pastel shades that <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> warm, graceful and childlike appearance. [...] Later, for formal wear, the front was fitted to the body {{by means of a}} tightly-laced underbodice, while the back fell in loose box pleats called [...] "Watteau pleats" [...] from their appearance in the paintings of Antoine Watteau.|$|E
2500|$|Pizarras once hunted tarsiers for a living. Since age 12, he {{gunned down}} or trapped tarsiers, exotic birds, monkeys, snakes and lizards for his father, a {{taxidermist}} who augmented the family income through {{the sale of}} the preserved kill. [...] Pizarras himself caught and sold Philippine tarsier specimens to collectors, hobbyists and tourists for a living[...] [...] He became so adept at the task that he hunted tarsiers by scent, learning that the animals <b>gave</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> musk through glands located on their breasts. Then, he shot them out of the trees with air rifles, easily catching about 100 a month. At that time, stuffed tarsiers went for 300 pesos (about five dollars). For those who preferred live pets, catching them alive was a relatively straightforward undertaking. Trees were simply shaken until the tarsiers fell.|$|E
