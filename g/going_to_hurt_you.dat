6000|$|... "Blumpo, get up!" [...] said Harry, sharply. [...] "Don't {{make a fool}} of yourself. This gentleman is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you.</b> Stand up and be a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has got to}} be {{done right}} now before the frost comes back, but we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you,</b> Harry," [...] he said. [...] "You'll walk down to the river and fill that kettle up, Charley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tut, tut!' said Heathcliff, {{stretching}} {{out a hand}} and dragging him roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin. 'None of that nonsense! We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>thee,</b> Linton--isn't that thy name? Thou art thy mother's child, entirely! Where is my share in thee, puling chicken?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, good father, pardon my fright and confusion," [...] Christina {{tried to}} murmur, {{but at that}} moment a sudden glow and glare of light broke out on the eastern rock, {{illuminating}} the fast darkening little church with a flickering glare, that made her start in terror as if the fires of heaven were threatening this stolen marriage; but the friar and Eberhard both exclaimed, [...] "The Needfire alight already!" [...] And she recollected how often she had seen these bonfires on Midsummer night shining red on every hill around Ulm. Loud shouts were greeting the uprising flame, and the people gathering thicker and thicker on the slope. The friar undid the door to hasten out into the throng, and Eberhard said he had left his spurs and belt in the hermit's cell, and must return thither, after which he would walk home with his bride, moving at the same time towards the stair, and thereby causing a sudden scuffle and fall. [...] "So, master hermit," [...] quoth Eberhard, as the old man picked himself up, looking horribly frightened; [...] "that's your hermit's abstraction, is it? No whining, old man, I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>thee,</b> so thou canst hold thy tongue. Otherwise I will smoke thee out of thy hole like a wild cat! What, thou aiding me with my belt, my lovely one? Thanks; the snap goes too hard for thy little hands. Now, then, the fire will light us gaily down the mountain side." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{has been}} parodied in several episodes of Family Guy in cutaway gags. In [...] "Brian Sings and Swings", Shalit mugs Peter in a cutaway and makes threats using several movie title puns ("Don't Panic Room... I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> William <b>Hurt</b> <b>you.</b> I only want your Tango & Cash. So just Pay it Forward and we'll all be Happy Gilmore!"), which only serves to confuse Peter. In [...] "The Book of Joe", Peter haunts Shalit and his fictional wife Joanne (who is {{identical}} to Shalit himself with a large moustache) by pretending to be the ghost of Roger Ebert. In another episode, Peter obtains the power of transformation and while {{in the form of}} Britney Spears he kisses Justin Timberlake and then turns into Shalit, exclaiming to a horrified Timberlake, [...] "I'm Gene Shalit now! BYE!" [...] In [...] "Big Man on Hippocampus", Peter reads aloud a review that was supposedly written by Shalit.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, look!" [...] said Molly. [...] "There's a {{poor little}} chicken {{out there in}} the cold. It hasn't had a morsel. Give me the spoon, Mr. Pitt. Here, chick, chick! Don't be silly, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you.</b> I've brought you your dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> bad," [...] said Hondo reassuringly. [...] "'Twon't {{hurt you}} to be tied up for a while. We will now pass you the time of day, as {{it is up to}} us to depart. Ausgespielt--nixcumrous, Dutchy. Don't get any more impatience." ...|$|E
5000|$|Later, Dolvett takes Rob {{aside for}} a special adventure: {{repelling}} off a waterfall. While Rob is initially reluctant, Dolvett encourages him to look his fear {{in the face and}} say, [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let <b>you</b> <b>hurt</b> me anymore." [...] Dolvett is afraid of heights, so this challenge will enable the two of them to face their fears together. But it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an easy journey. At the practice wall, Rob is terrified and starts crying. After that, Rob doesn't want to do it anymore. Dolvett is well aware that Rob deals with fear in unhealthy ways and is saddened to see Rob break down and storm off. He knows Rob doesn't trust himself, his body or his abilities, and Dolvett is desperate to help him see that his inadequacies are all in his mind. But failure is not an option, and with Dolvett by his side, Rob successfully makes it down the waterfall and feels on top of the world.|$|R
5000|$|To say Wilson was a {{successful}} horse jockey is an understatement. With his passion for racing {{he was able to}} achieve success from an early age, starting his thirty-five year career in 1972 when he achieved his first win as a teenager racing quarter horses in Oklahoma. Wilson had a 4,939-win career, which ranks him twentieth all time amongst jockeys. He also won 4,250 seconds and 3,461 thirds. His most winning mount was a female filly by the name of Xtra Heat. He was able to achieve thirteen wins and two second-place finishes with this particular mount. Wilson fondly refers to her as “all heart, one in a million.” Wilson has seven Triple Crown mounts from his career, which is considered a great accomplishment. The best day of Wilson’s career was a six win day at Philadelphia Park. He had seven classic mounts in his career. These include five mounts in the Preakness at Pimlico Race Course and two Kentucky Derby mounts. In 2005 he was nominated for the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award for high standards of professional conduct in racing and life. However it was awarded to Ray Sibille. [...] Wilson is quoted in The Baltimore Sun “’It's a rush being a rider,’ he said. ‘If you ride enough, you know you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get <b>hurt.</b> But <b>you</b> can get killed crossing a road, too.’” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What is the matter?' cried Tom. 'Have I said {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you?</b> Has any one {{said anything}} <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you?</b> Don't cry. Pray {{tell me what it}} is. I cannot bear to see you so distressed. Mercy on us, I never was so surprised and grieved in all my life!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bend {{a little}} more forward," [...] {{he said to the}} victim, [...] "and much tighter. Don't trouble to look pleasant, because I can't see your face anyway. It may sound unorthodox to say so, but this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> much more than it will hurt me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jefferson {{stretched}} out a lean hand suddenly, {{and laid it}} on his comrade's arm. [...] "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you,</b> but you can't get anything worth while without that. You can send them back their money when we get her off; but if you let anything stop you now you'll feel mean and sorry all your life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Gordon, [...] "I don't {{know that}} it's any consolation, {{but if you}} expose it at this temperature, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> {{considerably}} more. You can't do anything worth while with one hand, and that the one you don't generally use, either. There's a rip upon your face that may give you trouble, too. I'm going to pack you out to-morrow." ...|$|E

6000|$|Bradley laughed aloud. [...] "I {{thought we}} English were {{supposed}} to have the least sense of humor of any people in the world," [...] he cried; [...] "but now I've found one human being who hasn't any. Of course you don't know half I'm saying; but don't worry, little girl; I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you,</b> and if I can get you out of here, I'll do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, there! little citizeness," [...] {{the awful}} man said, {{in a voice}} that sounded low and almost caressing, [...] "there is nothing to be frightened of. No one is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> or your little family. We only want you to be reasonable. You have promised to your former {{employer}} that you would never tell anyone of his whereabouts. Well! we don't ask you to tell us anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Alton grimly. [...] "My {{father used}} to be, {{but he was too}} much of my way of {{thinking}} and they fired him out of the country. It's a thing I don't like to talk of, Charley, and just now I'm a low-down packer hauling in a pile of truck I'll never get paid for. Steady, come up. There's nothing <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you,</b> Julius Caesar." ...|$|E

But his smile and the look in his eyes only frightened her. [...] "Look here, Fan, I will teach you {{something}} else. Don't you know that it is the custom among ladies and gentlemen for a young girl to kiss a gentleman when he speaks kindly to her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lee Congdon was an unconquerable realist and truth-teller, and {{she could}} not at the moment utter any other than a {{divergent}} word. [...] "We got you here to-night to talk over that Haney business. We don't entirely like it; at least, I don't. Frank has no responsibility, never had. Haney is not a bad man, and she isn't a bit low or common; but folks think she is. And it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> both, I'm afraid, {{to have anything to do}} socially with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in {{and take}} off your things," [...] called Janet, {{undisturbed}} by the outcry. [...] "This building hasn't a soul in it but ourselves, and you may yell for help until you are hoarse without being heard. But don't be frightened. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you.</b> In fact, I'd like to make your confinement as cheerful as possible. Can't you understand the truth-- that I am simply holding your person in order to force Jason Jones to pay the money he owes me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Huh! As if you didn’t know why!” replied Roger, with {{something}} like a chuckle. “Don’t they both know that Jessie is the very apple of your eye, and that anything that brings trouble to her will cut you to the heart? Of course they know that, Dave, and you can rest assured that they will try <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> quite as much through Jessie as they’ll try <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>you</b> direct.” ...|$|R

6000|$|As {{they emerged}} from the enclosure, {{the girl with the}} fruit basket stood near the gate, looking outward from the wall, her face turned away from the awful home of Tu-Kila-Kila. At the moment when Muriel passed, to her immense astonishment the girl spoke to her. [...] "Don't be afraid, missy," [...] she said in English, in a rather low voice, without obtrusively {{approaching}} them.

6000|$|A {{trace of}} gravity crept into Flora Schuyler's blue eyes, which were unusually {{attractive}} ones. [...] "When they come too often I send them back," [...] she said.
