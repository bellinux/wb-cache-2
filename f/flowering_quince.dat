The fruit is edible, but hard and astringent-tasting, unless bletted. The fruit is occasionally used in jam, jelly and pie making as a substitute for its cousin, the true quince, Cydonia oblonga. C. japonica is also popularly grown in bonsai.|$|E
50|$|Eastern towhees may {{associate}} with and avoid certain plants. In Nevada, Towhees seem to prefer a habitat {{in which they}} are camouflaged such as <b>flowering</b> <b>quince</b> which matches their rufous coloration. In riparian vegetation in Iowa, eastern towhee density was significantly (p≤0.01) positively associated with total plant and vine species richness and negatively correlated with forb and deciduous tree species richness. In West Virginia, eastern towhees were associated with plant species that occurred on drier ridgetops, such as blackberry (p<0.02), black cherry (p<0.002), and black locust (p<0.04). These sites tended to have open canopies and low tree density. Eastern towhee density was negatively associated with plants of the moister parts of this study area, such as black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica, p<0.006), red maple (p<0.001), and witch hazel (p<0.03). In central New Jersey eastern towhees were significantly (p=0.03) more abundant in gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa) shrubland than either eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) or multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) shrublands.|$|E

5000|$|A {{horizontal}} inscribed board reading [...] "Yuewei Cottage" [...] {{was hung}} over {{the door of the}} north room in the original east courtyard of Yuewei Cottage, but later it was taken away by people working in Zhili Guild Hall. In the courtyard, Chaenomeles speciosa (the <b>flowering</b> <b>quince)</b> and wisteria planted by Ji Xiaolan himself still flourish today, producing a remarkable floral aroma in spring. Ji Xiaolan once wrote in Fantastic Tales By Ji Xiaolan that [...] "The wisteria is still there. It can be supported only by the wood which is used as pillars. Its shade covers the central room yard. Its vines have spread to other places and cover the west study room yard. When it blooms, the flowers hang down to the ground like purple clouds, overwhelming people with their the fragrance." [...] After Ji Xiaolan's death, the residence has changed hands many times. Notable figures such as Zhili Huiguan, Mei Lanfang, Zhang Boju, Xiao Changhua, Liu Shaobai and many others have all been owners of the estate at various time. Mei Lanfang also once established the National Opera Association and the Spreading and Learning Site of National Opera here. In the 1950s, it became a Communist Party school in Xuanwu District, Beijing. In October, 1959, a Shanxi cuisine restaurant, namely Jinyang Restaurant, opened for business here with the help of Peng Zhen, then the mayor of Beijing. Because it was the residence of Ji Xiaolan, many men of letters gathered there to admire the vines, including Lao She, Zang Kejia and Cao Yu. Moreover, the residence has proven popular with a lot of international visitors, who come to experience its artistic atmosphere. George Herbert Walker Bush, {{the former president of the}} U.S.A, George P. Shultz and Colin Powell, two American Secretaries of State as well as other notable figures have dined there, tasting the characteristic crispy fried duck. In 1986, the restaurant was enrolled as a Major Site Protected for Its Historical and Cultural Value at the National Level in Xuanwu District (now merged into Xicheng District). In 2000, during the reconstruction of Liangguang Road in Beijing, the Former Residence of Ji Xiaolan was slated for demolition. However, after the protest from experts and appeals to the public, the construction plans were revised to avoid it. At the beginning of 2002, Jinyang Restaurant moved to a hall at the east side from the residence's yard. The government invested in the reconstruction of the residence and officially opened to the public. In the year 2003, the Former Residence of Ji Xiaolan was added to the list of Major Site Protected for Its Historical and Cultural Value at the National Level of Beijing.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a trend toward}} "edible {{landscaping}} " has begun to emerge as {{a natural extension of}} standard gardening. Two books on the subject have been published (Britz; Creasy), and in Massachu-setts a bill creating the innovative Massachusetts Fruition Program was passed by the legislature in 1980. With a budget of $ 64, 000 this program promotes the planting of food-producing trees, shrubs, and vines. Perhaps the most desirable characteristic in landscape plants is an ability to thrive in low-maintenance situations. This eliminates many commercial fruit species, however, as these usually have been highly selected for fruit production under the assumption that adequate care will be provided. Fortunately, there are many food-producing plants that, for various reasons, have never been developed. On the Arnold Arboretum grounds alone I found about 150 species, from Actinidia arguta to Zizyphus jujuba. The usual reason that such plants are not developed is that they have a deficiency in some characteristic, such as yield, keeping quality, or ease of propagation, that would limit their success as a commercial crop. On the other hand, their broader-based genetic makeup often allows them greater environmental adaptabil-ity, and they are therefore less needful of maintenance. I chose the two plants described here for the quality of their fruits and their adaptability in low-maintenance situations. Many other plants deserve equal attention, including the juneberry, <b>flowering</b> <b>quince,</b> hazelnut, walnut, mulberry, elderberry, hickory, pine nut, grape, and various Prunus species. Three major climatic factors must be considered in growing woody food plants in the Northeast: minimum winter temperatures, occur-rence of late spring and early fall freezes, and the relatively short, cool growing season. Carefully choosing a favorable planting site (e. g., with good air and soil drainage) will enhance a plant’s performance in any given climate. Actinidia will grow reliably in northern New En-gland and New York (USDA plant hardiness zone 4; see map on page 119). The persimmon is recommended only for zones 5 and 6 in th...|$|E

I could not paint all night-- [...] Ouf! I leaned out of window for fresh air. [...] 50 [...] There came a hurry of feet and little feet, [...] A sweep of lute-strings, laughs, and whifts of song-- [...] Flower o' the broom, [...] Take away love, and our earth is a tomb! [...] <b>Flower</b> o' the <b>quince,</b> [...] 55 [...] I let Lisa go, and what good in life since? [...] Flower o' the thyme--and so on. Round they went. [...] Scarce had they turned the corner when a titter [...] Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight--three slim shapes, [...] And a face that looked up ... zooks, sir, flesh and blood, [...] 60 [...] That's all I'm made of! Into shreds it went, [...] Curtain and counterpane and coverlet, [...] All the bed-furniture--a dozen knots, [...] There was a ladder! Down I let myself, [...] Hands and feet, scrambling somehow, and so dropped, [...] 65 [...] And after them. I came up with the fun [...] Hard by Saint Laurence, hail fellow, well met-- [...] Flower o' the rose, [...] If I've been merry, what matter who knows? [...] And so I was stealing back again [...] 70 [...] To get to bed and have a bit of sleep [...] Ere I rise up tomorrow and go work [...] On Jerome knocking at his poor old breast [...] With his great round stone to subdue the flesh, [...] You snap me of the sudden. Ah, I see! [...] 75 [...] Though your eye twinkles still, you shake your head-- [...] Mine's shaved--a monk, you say--the sting's in that! [...] If Master Cosimo announced himself, [...] Mum's the word naturally; but a monk! [...] Come, what am I a beast for? tell us, now! [...] 80 [...] I was a baby when my mother died [...] And father died and left me in the street. [...] I starved there, God knows how, a year or two [...] On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and shucks, [...] Refuse and rubbish. One fine frosty day, [...] 85 [...] My stomach being empty as your hat, [...] The wind doubled me up and down I went. [...] Old Aunt Lapaccia trussed me with one hand [...] (Its fellow was a stinger as I knew), [...] And so along the wall, over the bridge, [...] 90 [...] By the straight cut to the convent. Six words there, [...] While I stood munching my first bread that month: [...] "So, boy, you've minded," [...] quoth the good fat father, [...] Wiping his own mouth--'twas refection-time-- [...] "To quit this very miserable world? [...] 95 [...] Will you renounce" ... "the mouthful of bread?" [...] thought I; [...] By no means! Brief, they made a monk of me; [...] I did renounce the world, its pride and greed, [...] Palace, farm, villa, shop, and banking-house, [...] Trash, such as these poor devils of Medici [...] 100 [...] Have given their hearts to--all at eight years old. [...] Well, sir, I found in time, you may be sure, [...] 'Twas not for nothing--the good bellyful, [...] The warm serge and the rope that goes all round, [...] And day-long blessed idleness beside! [...] 105 [...] "Let's see what the urchin's fit for"--that came next. [...] Not overmuch their way, I must confess. [...] Such a to-do! They tried me with their books; [...] Lord, they'd have taught me Latin in pure waste! [...] Flower o' the clove, [...] 110 [...] All the Latin I construe is [...] "amo," [...] I love! [...] But, mind you, when a boy starves in the streets [...] Eight years together, as my fortune was, [...] Watching folk's faces to know who will fling [...] The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires, [...] 115 [...] And who will curse or kick him for his pains-- [...] Which gentleman processional and fine, [...] Holding a candle to the Sacrament, [...] Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch [...] The droppings of the wax to sell again, [...] 120 [...] Or holla for the Eight and have him whipped-- [...] How say I?--nay, which dog bites, which lets drop [...] His bone from the heap of offal in the street-- [...] Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp alike, [...] He learns the look of things, and none the less [...] 125 [...] For admonition from the hunger-pinch. [...] I had a store of such remarks, be sure, [...] Which, after I found leisure, turned to use. [...] I drew men's faces on my copy books, [...] Scrawled them within the antiphonary's marge, [...] 130 [...] Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes, [...] Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and B's, [...] And made a string of pictures of the world [...] Betwixt {{the ins and outs of}} verb and noun, [...] On the wall, the bench, the door. The monks looked black. [...] 135 [...] "Nay," [...] quoth the Prior, [...] "turn him out, d'ye say? [...] In no wise. Lose a crow and catch a lark. [...] What if at last we get our man of parts, [...] We Carmelites, like those Camaldolese [...] And Preaching Friars, to do our church up fine [...] 140 [...] And put the front on it that ought to be!" [...] And hereupon he bade me daub away. [...] Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank, [...] Never was such prompt disemburdening. [...] First, every sort of monk, the black and white, [...] 145 [...] I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at church, [...] From good old gossips waiting to confess [...] Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends-- [...] To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot, [...] Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there [...] 150 [...] With the little children round him in a row [...] Of admiration, half for his beard and half [...] For that white anger of his victim's son [...] Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm, [...] Signing himself with the other because of Christ [...] 155 [...] (Whose sad face on the cross sees only this [...] After the passion of a thousand years) [...] Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head, [...] (Which the intense eyes looked through) came at eve [...] On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf, [...] 160 [...] Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers [...] (The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone. [...] I painted all, then cried, [...] "'Tis ask and have; [...] Choose, for more's ready!"--laid the ladder flat, [...] And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall. [...] 165 [...] The monks closed in a circle and praised loud [...] Till checked, taught what to see and not to see, [...] Being simple bodies--"That's the very man! [...] Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog! [...] That woman's like the Prior's niece who comes [...] 170 [...] To care about his asthma: it's the life!" [...] But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funked; [...] Their betters took their turn to see and say: [...] The Prior and the learned pulled a face [...] And stopped all that in no time. [...] "How? what's here? [...] 175 [...] Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all! [...] Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true [...] As much as pea and pea! It's devil's-game! [...] Your business is not to catch men with show, [...] With homage to the perishable clay, [...] 180 [...] But lift them over it, ignore it all, [...] Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh. [...] Your business is to paint the souls of men--- [...] Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke ... no, it's not ... It's vapor done up like a new-born babe-- [...] 185 [...] (In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth) [...] It's ... well, what matters talking, it's the soul! [...] Give us no more of body than shows soul! [...] Here's Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God, [...] That sets us praising--why not stop with him? [...] 190 [...] Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head [...] With wonder at lines, colors, and what not? [...] Paint the soul; never mind the legs and arms! [...] Rub all out; try at it a second time. [...] Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts, [...] 195 [...] She's just my niece ... Herodias, I would say-- [...] Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off! [...] Have it all out!" [...] Now, is this sense, I ask? [...] A fine way to paint soul, by painting body [...] So ill the eye can't stop there, must go further, [...] 200 [...] And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for white [...] When what you put for yellow's simply black, [...] And any sort of meaning looks intense [...] When all beside itself means and looks naught. [...] Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn, [...] 205 [...] Left foot and right foot, go a double step, [...] Make his flesh liker and his soul more like, [...] Both in their order? Take the prettiest face, [...] The Prior's niece ... patron-saint--is it so pretty [...] You can't discover if it means hope, fear, [...] 210 [...] Sorrow, or joy? Won't beauty go with these? [...] Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue, [...] Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash, [...] And then add soul and heighten them three-fold? [...] Or say there's beauty with no soul at all-- [...] 215 [...] (I never saw it--put the case the same--) [...] If you get simple beauty and naught else, [...] You get about the best thing God invents: [...] That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed, [...] Within yourself, when you return Him thanks. [...] 220 [...] "Rub all out!" [...] Well, well, there's my life, in short, [...] And so the thing has gone on ever since. [...] I'm grown a man no doubt; I've broken bounds: [...] You should not take a fellow eight years old [...] And make him swear to never kiss the girls. [...] 225 [...] I'm my own master, paint now as I please-- [...] Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house! [...] Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front-- [...] Those great rings serve more purposes than just [...] To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse! [...] 230 [...] And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes [...] Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work, [...] The heads shake still--"It's art's decline, my son! [...] You're not of the true painters, great and old; [...] Brother Angelico's the man, you'll find; [...] 235 [...] Brother Lorenzo stands his single peer: [...] Fag on at flesh, you'll never make the third!" [...] Flower o' the pine, [...] You keep your mist ... manners, and I'll stick to mine! [...] I'm not the third, then: bless us, they must know! [...] 240 [...] Don't you think they're the likeliest to know, [...] They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage, [...] Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint [...] To please them--sometimes do and sometimes don't; [...] For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come [...] 245 [...] A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints-- [...] A laugh, a cry, the business of the world-- [...] (Flower o' the peach, [...] Death for us all, and his own life for each!) [...] And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over, [...] 250 [...] The world and life's too big to pass for a dream, [...] And I do these wild things in sheer despite, [...] And play the fooleries you catch me at, [...] In pure rage! The old mill-horse, out at grass [...] After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so, [...] 255 [...] Although the miller does not preach to him [...] The only good of grass is to make chaff. [...] What would men have? Do they like grass or no-- [...] May they or mayn't they? All I want's the thing [...] Settled forever one way. As it is, [...] 260 [...] You tell too many lies and hurt yourself: [...] You don't like what you only like too much, [...] You do like what, if given you at your word, [...] You find abundantly detestable. [...] For me, I think I speak as I was taught; [...] 265 [...] I always see the garden and God there [...] A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned, [...] The value and significance of flesh, [...] I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{research}} on dietary fibre and cell-wall polysaccharides in chaenomeles fruits is reported and summarised. The dietary fibre in fruits of 12 genotypes of Japanese quince (Chaenomeles japonica) and 1 genotype of <b>flowering</b> <b>quince</b> (C. speciosa) was prepared using two different methods: the Alcohol Insoluble Solid (AIS) method; and the AOAC method for total {{as well as}} for soluble and insoluble fibre. The two methods resulted in significantly different estimates, however, no interaction was found between the methods and the genotypes studied. For content of total dietary fibre, three main groups were distinguished, one containing a low amount of fibre (3 genotypes, 28 – 30 g/ 100 g dry matter); one containing a moderate amount of fibre (9 genotypes, 30 – 36 g/ 100 g dry matter) and an isolated genotype (C. speciosa) that contained a high amount of fibre (38 g/ 100 g dry matter). The amount and the nature of monomeric sugars in the constituent polysaccharides of the fibre were determined after total hydrolysis of the AIS and the TDF (Total Dietary Fibre). The fibre contained mostly pectic and cellulosic polysaccharides. A sequential extraction scheme allowed the separation of the cell-wall material into its major components (cellulose, pectins and hemicelluloses). The AIS was composed of 30 g pectins, 8 g hemicelluloses and 60 g cellulosic residue/ 100 g AIS. In 100 g entire dry fruit (800 g entire fresh fruit) there were 11 g pectins, 3 g hemicelluloses and 18 g cellulosic residue. Pectins were mostly located in the flesh of the fruit. Pectins were more efficiently extracted with hot dilute acid than with other extraction media. Pectins had a high degree of methylation (DM) and a low degree of acetylation (DAc). No difference was found in the quantity of polysaccharides extracted from two Japanese quince genotypes, or in the composition of these constituent polysaccharides. The physico-chemical properties of pectins extracted from two genotypes of Japanese quince were studied. On average, the fruits contained 11 g pectins/ 100 g dry fruit corresponding to 1. 4 g pectins/ 100 g fresh fruit. Pectins were sequentially extracted, and the cells from the flesh of the fruits were observed with a confocal laser scan microscope. Although the dilute acid conditions were the most efficient for extraction of pectins, pectins extracted by water or potassium oxalate had higher (> 600 ml/g) intrinsic viscosities than pectins extracted by dilute acid (< 400 ml/g). Anionic exchange chromatography was performed on the acid-extracted pectins. The pectins were composed of four populations, the first being mainly composed of arabinans, the second of homogalacturonans and the third of rhamnogalacturonans. The composition of the fourth population differed depending on the genotype studied...|$|E
