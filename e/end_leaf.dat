40|$|The multi-leaf {{collimator}} (MLC) {{of a particular}} linear accelerator vendor (Millennium MLC, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) has a maximum leaf extension of 14. 5 cm. To achieve intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for fields wider than 14. 5 cm all closed leaf pairs are restricted to placement inside the field. Due to the rounded leaf end design of the MLC <b>end</b> <b>leaf</b> leakage will occur in the treatment field. The implementation of direct aperture optimization in the IMRT module of a radiotherapy treatment planning system (Pinnacle, Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA) has facilitated the delivery of IMRT fields wider than 14. 5 cm. The <b>end</b> <b>leaf</b> leakage of the Millennium MLC has been characterized for 6 MV photons using gafchromic and radiographic film, and {{the accuracy of the}} planning system verified. The maximum leakage measured for a single field was 0. 39 cGy MU- 1 for a 0 mm leaf gap and 0. 51 cGy MU- 1 for a 0. 6 mm leaf gap. For a clinical IMRT field leaf end leakage contributed an additional 23 Gy over the course of treatment. The planning system underestimated the magnitude of <b>end</b> <b>leaf</b> leakage by 2040 %. The ability to deliver IMRT fields wider than 14. 5 cm with the Millennium MLC has improved the efficiency and flexibility of IMRT treatments; however, significant extra dose can be introduced due to <b>end</b> <b>leaf</b> leakage. Caution should be exercised when delivering wide field IMRT as it is not a complete panacea. Any significant occurrences of <b>end</b> <b>leaf</b> leakage predicted by the planning system should be independently verified prior to delivery...|$|E

40|$|Lateral {{penumbra}} of multileaf collimator {{plays an}} important role in radiotherapy treatment planning. Growing evidence has revealed that, for a single-focused multileaf collimator, lateral penumbra width is leaf position dependent and largely attributed to the <b>leaf</b> <b>end</b> shape. In our study, an analytical method for <b>leaf</b> <b>end</b> induced lateral penumbra modelling is formulated using Tangent Secant Theory. Compared with Monte Carlo simulation and ray tracing algorithm, our model serves well the purpose of cost-efficient penumbra evaluation. <b>Leaf</b> <b>ends</b> represented in parametric forms of circular arc, elliptical arc, Bézier curve, and B-spline are implemented. With biobjective function of penumbra mean and variance introduced, genetic algorithm is carried out for approximating the Pareto frontier. Results show that for circular arc <b>leaf</b> <b>end</b> objective function is convex and convergence to optimal solution is guaranteed using gradient based iterative method. It is found that optimal <b>leaf</b> <b>end</b> in the shape of Bézier curve achieves minimal standard deviation, while using B-spline minimum of penumbra mean is obtained. For treatment modalities in clinical application, optimized <b>leaf</b> <b>ends</b> are in close agreement with actual shapes.

40|$|Modern {{radiation}} oncology {{is constantly}} improving and becoming more complex. Novel dosimetric planning, delivery and dosimetry techniques have allowed for im- proved plan quality {{and confidence in}} delivery. This thesis is {{an investigation into the}} impacts of novel radiotherapy planning and delivery techniques and the efficacy of novel dosimetry methods for modern, complex radiotherapy. The first part of the thesis involved investigation into novel treatment planning optimisation techniques for prostate cancer radiotherapy. Advantages and disadvantages of IMRT for simple prostate radiotherapy in the Australian clinical setting is investigated, showing small gains compared with high quality conformal radiotherapy. The use of a radiobiological parameter, specifcally the generalised Equivalent Uniform Dose (gEUD) was investigated for prostate IMRT optimisation to reduce rectal dose. The gEUD metric was found to be a useful optimisation objective that provided rectal dose reductions over the full dose range. The result of the optimisation was heavily dependent on the value of a (describing organ architecture), with a lower value of a resulting in the largest reductions in rectal dose. A commercial Volumetric Modulated Arc Radiotherapy (VMAT) tool was investigated for prostate radiotherapy. Single arc VMAT plans were compared to static gantry angle IMRT plans for prostate cancer cases. It was found that VMAT resulted in equivalent target coverage with reductions in rectal V 25 Gy. The VMAT plans required on average 18. 6 % fewer monitor units and were theoretically up to 3. 75 times faster to delivery compared with static gantry angle IMRT. The second part of the thesis looked at using modern radiation detectors for verification of treatment dose in regions of electronic disequilibrium. Rectal balloons filled with air are used for prostate immobilisation and rectal dose reduction in prostate photon radiotherapy. This introduces an air cavity into the patient, immediately adjacent to the target. Radiochromic film was used to show that two commercial convolution/superposition dose calculation algorithms slightly over-predict the anterior rectal wall dose and under-predict the posterior rectal wall dose. The feasibility of a novel MOSFET detector, the MOSkin, coupled to a commercial rectal balloon was investigated for real time in vivo rectal wall dose verification. In this phantom study, the MOSkin was shown to be an excellent real time dosimeter, with minimal angular response and reproducible sensitivity. The MOSkin was then used with radiochromic film to verify the dose delivered to the skin during total scalp irradiation with helical tomotherapy. It was shown that the helical tomotherapy RTPS accurately calculated the dose to surface voxels and that the dose delivered to the skin is less than the prescription dose, which suggests a bolus may be required to achieve prescription dose to the skin. Finally, the dosimetric effect of <b>end</b> <b>leaf</b> leakage was investigated for a commercial multileaf collimator for wide-field IMRT. It was shown that <b>end</b> <b>leaf</b> leak- age can contribute significant doses to treatment fields, but provided the effects are quantified it is reasonable to accept these as the allowance of wide fields avoids complicated dual overlapping field feathering. The commercial RTPS investigated slightly under-predicts the magnitude of these <b>end</b> <b>leaf</b> leakage dose contributions...|$|E

40|$|Social {{relationships}} and intra-organizational networking have repeatedly {{been shown to}} predict career success. [1] However, building social networks may become difficult when STEM women enter into an area where they are judged, implicitly or explicitly, to be less competent outsiders. Social networks can also become more difficult to manage when work-life demands become unmanageable. Thus, a key component to analyzing {{the success of the}} ADVANCE program at the University of Cincinnati (UC LEAF) entails assessing the social climate through real connections between people within UC. To this <b>end,</b> <b>LEAF</b> has begun collecting closed network data from faculty in each of UC’s STEM departments to assess department-level network characteristics. We will use these data specifically to examine whether the networks of men and women faculty within each department differ according to (1) overall number of ties, (2) the types of ties they have (e. g., research vs. teaching, professional vs. personal support), and (3) the “quality” of ties as measured by the rank of those individuals in their departmental networks. We will also match these data with findings from our climate survey to identify whether network characteristics are associated with more or less positive workplace perceptions. In this presentation, we will compare findings from three STEM departments and discuss how these data will be used to assess ADVANCE-related progress and to inform future programming.

This paper presents procedures for the rapid, high frequency regeneration of a camptothecin producing plant, Ophiorrhiza prostrata D. Don from leaf and internode explants via shoot organogenesis. The concentrations of plant growth regulators and explant types exhibited discrete roles in the efficacy of shoot induction. N 6 -benzyladenine (BA) was the most effective cytokinin for the induction of shoots. Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 8. 87 µM BA and 2. 46 µM indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) yielded {{the highest number of}} shoots from leaf and internode explants (76. 0 and 90. 8 shoots respectively). In the case of leaf explants, explants from the proximal end produced a higher number of shoots than those from the mid and distal <b>end.</b> <b>Leaf</b> and internode explants cultured on MS medium supplemented with &# 945;-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and BA developed shoots, calli and roots. Calli subcultured onto medium supplemented with 8. 87 µM BA and 2. 46 µM IBA developed a mean of 20. 1 shoots within 40 days. Excision and culture of internode and proximal leaf explants from the established cultures on MS basal medium significantly enhanced the number of shoots and yielded a mean of 18. 3 and 13. 7 shoots respectively within 40 days. Histological examination of leaf explants showed that the shoots were of sub-epidermal origin, confined to the sub-epidermal cells above the vascular traces. Shoots cultured on half-strength MS basal medium with 10. 74 µM NAA and 2. 32 µM Kn produced a mean of 48. 2 roots per shoot. Direct transfer of rootless healthy shoots showed a 50 % survival rate, whilst it was 100 percent in the case of in vitro rooted shoots...|$|E
