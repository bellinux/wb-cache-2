This thesis addresses the problem of describing the time evolution of a genetic chemical system using a stochastic approach: the Master equation approach, which is the consequence of the fundamental hypothesis of the stochastic formulation of <b>chemical</b> <b>kinetics.</b> The Master <b>equation</b> can be used to compute the time dependent probability distribution of the state of a chemical system. The Master equation is built on a Markov model foundation. We derive the Master equation under the assumption that there exits a Markov process satisfying three particular postulates...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of reactive flows has progressed mainly with advances in aerospace, which {{gave birth to}} a new science called aerothermochemistry, as well as through developments in chemical and process engineering. The methods employed, the phenomena investigated, and the aims of modeling differ for each field; however, in all cases, the results obtained have considerably enriched the working knowledge of reactive flows. This work examines basic concepts and methods necessary to study reactive flows and transfer phenomena in areas such as fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and chemistry. Specific topics covered include: * Equations of state * Transfer phenomena and <b>chemical</b> <b>kinetics</b> * Balance <b>equations</b> of reactive flows * Dimensionless numbers and similarity * Chemical reactors * Coupled phenomena * Turbulent flow concepts * Boundary layers and fluid layers * Reactive and nonreactive waves * Interface phenomena * Multiphase flow concepts The book presents tools of interest to graduate students, researchers in mathematical physics, and engineers who wish to investigate problems of reactive flows. Portions of the text may be used in courses on the physics of liquids or in seminars on mechanics...|$|R
