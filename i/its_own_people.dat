5|$|Several {{sources have}} {{reported}} 610 officers as {{being involved in}} or ordering the torture of Falun Gong adherents in custody. In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005, prominent human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting Falun Gong practitioners: “of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I have heard, of all {{the records of the}} government’s inhuman torture of <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>people,</b> what has shaken me most is the routine practice {{on the part of the}} 6–10 Office and the police of assaulting women’s genitals,” wrote Gao. Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female Falun Gong practitioner with an iron bar. The event helped catalyze Hao's decision to defect to Australia. The 2009 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.|$|E

25|$|The Restoration was {{an age of}} poetry.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there were also}} {{interventions}} from other delegates whom re-affirmed their adherence {{to the line of}} the Soviet party. The Bulgarian communist leader Todor Zhivkov, in his intervention, took a firmer stand than the Soviets in upholding the notion of general laws of socialist development (as opposed to the idea that each party should develop its own way of building socialism), denouncing revisionism and underlining the dual responsibility of the individual communist party (both to <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> and the world communist movement). Gustáv Husák of Czechoslovakia and the East German host, Erich Honecker, were also amongst the prominent spokespersons of the orthodox camp. Other parties that voiced their support for the Soviets, in varying degrees, were the Greek, Portuguese, West German, Luxembourgish, Danish, West Berlin, Turkish, Norwegian and Austrian parties.|$|E
25|$|The first {{occurred}} on 5 February 1994; 68 {{people were killed}} and 144 more were wounded. The second {{occurred on}} 28 August 1995 when five mortar shells killed 43 people and wounded 75 others. This latter attack was the stated reason for NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces that would eventually lead to the Dayton Peace Accords {{and the end of the}} war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The responsibility of the Army of the Republika Srpska for the first shelling is contested, since investigations to establish the location from where the shells had been fired did not lead to unambiguous results. It was claimed that actually the Bosnian army had shelled <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> in order to provoke intervention of Western countries on their side. Even though ICTY in its appeal judgement of Stanislav Galić in 2006 summarized the evidence and ruled that the conclusion that the shells had been fired from a location occupied by Serbian forces was a reasonable one, still Radovan Karadžić during his trial before ICTY tried to use this rumour to his defense, but to no avail.|$|E
25|$|The first {{massacre}} {{occurred between}} 12:10 and 12:15 PM, on 5 February 1994, when a 120 millimeter mortar shell {{landed in the}} center of the crowded marketplace. Republika Srpska authorities denied all responsibility and accused the Bosnian government of bombarding <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>people</b> to incite international outrage and NATO intervention. Rescue workers and United Nations (UN) personnel rushed to help the numerous civilian casualties, while footage of the event soon made news reports across the world. Controversy over the event started when an initial UNPROFOR report claimed that the shell was fired from Bosnian government positions. General Michael Rose, the British head of UNPROFOR, revealed in his memoirs that three days after the blast he told General Jovan Divjak, the deputy commander of ARBiH forces, that the shell had been fired from Bosnian positions. A later and more in-depth UNPROFOR report noted a calculation error in the original findings. With the error corrected, the United Nations concluded that it was impossible to determine which side had fired the shell. In December 2003, the ICTY Trial Chamber in the trial against Stanislav Galić, a Serb general in the siege of Sarajevo (for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity), concluded that the massacre was committed by Serb forces around Sarajevo.|$|E

He said [...] "those Hezbollah fighters who are killing children and terrorizing people and destroying houses in Syria will go to hell". The Consultative Gathering, a group of Shia and Sunni leaders in Baalbek-Hermel, also called on Hezbollah not to [...] "interfere" [...] in Syria. They said, [...] "Opening a front against the Syrian people and dragging Lebanon to war with the Syrian people is very dangerous and will {{have a negative impact on}} the relations between the two". Walid Jumblatt, leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, also called on Hezbollah to end its involvement and claimed that [...] "Hezbollah is fighting inside Syria with orders from Iran". Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi condemned Hezbollah by saying, [...] "We stand against Hezbollah in its aggression against the Syrian people. There is no space or place for Hezbollah in Syria".|$|E

500|$|Following the {{downfall}} of the Ngô family, the White House came under pressure from the South Vietnamese public to take a hard line against Cẩn. Mass graves containing 200 bodies were found on his land. The US consul in Huế, John Helble, confirmed the existence of rows of 18th-century style dungeons with filthy, dark cells in an old French arsenal. Although junta member General Trần Văn Đôn asserted that the compound predated the Diệm era, the town's citizens saw Cẩn as a mass murderer. On 4 November, two days after the coup ended, thousands of irate townspeople walked three kilometres to Cẩn's house on the city's southern outskirts — where he lived with his aged mother — demanding vengeance. The junta had ringed the home with barbed wire and armoured cars, sensing that the populace would riot and attack Cẩn. By this time, Cẩn had escaped to a Catholic seminary, but was considering applying to the Americans for political asylum. The U.S. State Department was faced with a dilemma: sheltering Cẩn would associate them with the protection of a corrupt and authoritarian regime that had killed and tortured hundreds of thousands of <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>people.</b> Allowing Cẩn to be attacked by angry mobs would damage the reputation of the new American-backed junta.
