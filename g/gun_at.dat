5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} with over 2,200 British and American bombers attacking targets {{along the coast}} and further inland. At Gold, naval {{bombardment}} by Bombarding Force K got underway at 05:30, at which time the first waves of infantry were loading into their Landing Craft Assault (LCAs) for the run in to the beach. German defensive positions were attacked by medium and heavy bombers and by self-propelled guns on board the landing craft. Results were good at Mont Fleury Battery and at Longues, where at 07:00 Ajax and Argonaut took out of commission {{three of the four}} guns. The fourth gun resumed firing sporadically in the afternoon, and the garrison surrendered the following day. Two heavily casemated gun emplacements (an 88mm <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> La Rivière overlooking King and a 75mm <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> Le Hamel overlooking Jig) were only lightly damaged, as they were heavily reinforced with concrete, especially on the seaward side. These positions had embrasures that permitted a wide range of enfilade fire on the beach. Four other German strong points in the immediate area were also only lightly damaged, and had to be individually assaulted as the day progressed.|$|E
50|$|Heavy {{weapons for}} the East Passage {{included}} four 12-inch (305 mm) <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Fort Wetherill (two on barbette carriages, two on disappearing carriages), with three 10-inch (254 mm) disappearing guns there, along with sixteen 12-inch (305 mm) mortars and two 10-inch (254 mm) disappearing <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Fort Adams. The West Passage had three 10-inch disappearing guns and eight 12-inch mortars at Fort Greble, with three 12-inch disappearing <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Fort Getty. Medium caliber {{weapons in the}} initial design were five 6-inch (152 mm) <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Fort Wetherill (two disappearing, two on pedestal mounts), three 6-inch disappearing <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Fort Greble, and two 6-inch pedestal <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Fort Getty, along with six 6-inch disappearing <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Fort Kearny.

5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns. The film performed {{better in the}} French and West German markets, {{largely due to the}} presence of Trintignant and Kinski.

5|$|Most capable Soviet tank at Kursk was the T-34, the {{original}} version was armed with a 76.2mm gun, the gun struggled against uparmoured Panzer IVs, and the frontal armour of Tigers and Panthers was essentially impenetrable.

25|$|Two other historians {{assigned}} weaker {{forces to}} Albert Gyulai's division. According to Historian Robert M. Epstein, he deployed about 6,000 {{troops in the}} vicinity of Tarvis, with 650 Grenz and 10 guns holding the Malborghetto blockhouse, and 250 Grenz and eight guns defending the Predil Blockhouse. Author Digby Smith listed 3,500 Austrians and 6 <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Tarvis, 450 men and 11 <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Malborghetto, and 250 men and eight <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Predil.|$|R

Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows, though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.|$|E
5|$|The first Australian {{shot of the}} war {{took place}} several hours after the {{declaration}} of war when a <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> Fort Queenscliff fired across the bows of an Australian ship as it attempted to leave Melbourne without required clearances.

5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
5|$|Analyzing {{the bullet}} from his shoulder, Wesley realises that Cross used a {{traceable}} bullet(as his previous kills were all untraceable).Wesley traces it {{to a man}} named Pekwarsky. Wesley and Fox capture Pekwarsky, who arranges a meeting with Cross. When Wesley faces Cross alone on a moving train, Fox crashes a car into the train, causing a derailment. After Cross saves Wesley from falling, Wesley fatally shoots him. Before dying, Cross reveals that he is Wesley's real father. Fox confirms this, and explains that Wesley was recruited {{because he was the}} only person Cross would not kill. Fox points her <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> Wesley, but he shoots the window below,falling into the river.|$|E
5|$|At Jig, {{the first}} wave of {{infantry}} (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75mm <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points. The DD tank and Royal Marine Centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got bogged down on the beach or were taken out by enemy fire. The tide came in quicker than expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared, and some of the landing craft were damaged as a result.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted on the port side of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E
5|$|Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} them {{one after the}} other, while keeping outside their guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> Rinella still exists.|$|E
