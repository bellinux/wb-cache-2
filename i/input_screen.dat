So if the system was trying to determine if Mortal(Socrates) is true it would find R1 and query the knowledge base to see if Man(Socrates) is true. One of the early innovations of expert systems shells was to integrate inference engines with a user interface. This could be especially powerful with backward chaining. If the system needs to know a particular fact but doesn't it can simply generate an <b>input</b> <b>screen</b> and ask the user if the information is known. So in this example, it could use R1 to ask the user if Socrates was a Man and then use that new information accordingly.|$|E

The CCD camera is modelled according to a general 2 D projective transformation of the output screen of the image intensifier.

40|$|In this study, 144 {{professional}} {{accounting data}} entry clerks {{took part in}} a fully randomized field experiment using a 4 (mode of participation) × 2 (task meaningfulness) design. Participants were full-time, mandatory users of payroll applications. The nature of the experiment engaged these users in hands-on activity (Hartwick and Barki [Hartwick, J., H. Barki. 1994. Explaining the role of user participation in information system use. Management Sci. 40 440 [...] 465. ]) regarding the development of a payroll <b>input</b> <b>screen.</b> User mode of participation was manipulated by varying the extent of decision input used to execute hands-on activity in accordance with procedural justice theory. Perceptions of decision control, procedural justice, and outcome satisfaction, as well as objective levels of task performance escalated with corresponding increases in decision input. Task meaningfulness was manipulated by creating either high or low expectations of using the payroll <b>input</b> <b>screen</b> in the near future. As the development task became more meaningful, procedural justice, decision control, task commitment, and task performance responses also increased. An underlying theoretical model of treatment effects was tested using path analysis which supported the control-oriented theory of procedural justice. The strong attitudinal and behavioral results observed in this experiment enhance understanding of the user participation and involvement model proposed by Hartwick and Barki (Hartwick, J., H.

Five video recordings were made at each absorber thickness. The video image was digitized directly from the disk recording and quantized into 128 gray levels. The five recordings were averaged on a point-to-point basis, and the central 900 averaged points were again averaged to yield a value for the gray level assigned to each particular image.

These are used for learning the facial model and for matching the face from new screen images based on the learned models. Secondly, the face and background are separated in the screen image. Four points with the biggest possibilities for wrinkling are selected from the face and high wrinkle weighted values are assigned to them. Finally, the wrinkles are detected by applying Canny edge algorithm for the interested points of weighted value. The suggested algorithm adopts various screen images for experiment. The experiments display the excellent results of face and wrinkle detection in the most of the screen images...|$|E
