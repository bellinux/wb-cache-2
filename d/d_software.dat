40|$|Timely {{operation}} {{is a key}} factor in CPS that is challenged by their inherent distributed nature. The variability intro- duced by the network and its unpredictable effects have to be handled. Thus, a vertical understanding of the involved software layers is needed at the levels of the operating sys- tem, the networking software and the middleware. Typi- cally, middleware has been described in a quite independent way from the underlying operating system kernel and the network software. That is not appropriate in a CPS as some degree of control over the resource assignment is expected as a means to ensure timeliness. In this paper, we look into the details of middleware in relation to its sorround- <b>ing</b> <b>software</b> layers to provide a middleware design, namely OMA-Cy, suiting the needs of CPS.

40|$|Modern {{software}} {{systems are}} large and complex products, consisting in thousands lines of code, developed, often in a distributed environment, by dozens of developers and produced through an industrial process, usu- ally with short time to market. To manage such kind of complexity {{and to keep the}} development process under control measurements and metrics are required. The present thesis collects the outcomes of the research the author carried on in the field of software metrics during the three years of the Ph. D. studies. Software metrics are used to measure various aspects of software development, including software features, processes execution, developers' efforts, software quality, just to name a few. The first part of the present thesis reports the results of the studies performed on product metrics, with the final goal of helping software engineers better manage the programmers efforts and particularly to assess <b>software</b> quality dur- <b>ing</b> <b>software</b> development. The second part of this dissertation presents the outcomes of the research aimed at shedding some light on the effec- tiveness and impact of some development practices on software systems. To perform these studies I used a novel approach, based on the concept of complex network. Complex networks are in fact one of the best can- didates to represent software systems, enabling researchers to obtain a deeper knowledge of the structure and evolution of a software system. We found some meaningful statistical correlations between network metrics and software properties. Both the theoretical framework and the reported findings might, in principle, have a practical application to assist software engineers dealing with specific development tasks, like bug discovery or refactoring. ...|$|R
