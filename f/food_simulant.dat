This work describes a method for quantitative determination of VOCs, namely styrene, toluene, ethylbenzene, iso-propylbenzene and n-propylbenzene that have migrated from polystyrene food packaging into <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique was applied for migration test using water as <b>food</b> <b>simulant.</b> The effects of extraction variables including sample volume, elutropic strength, extraction temperature, extraction time, desorption time, sample agitation, and salt addition on the amounts of the extracted analytes were studied to obtain the optimal HS-SPME conditions. The optimized method was applied to test the VOCs migrated from polystyrene bowls and cups at storage temperatures ranging from 24 °C to 80 °C for 30 min. Styrene and ethylbenzene were found to migrate from the samples into the <b>food</b> <b>simulant.</b> The migration of analyte was found to be strongly dependent upon the storage temperature.

Fast and reliable analytical procedures were developed and validated {{for the analysis of}} the studied AOs in <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> For aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants,</b> solid phase extraction followed by GC–MS analysis was performed. Fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> were directly analysed by GC–MS and HPLC-UV for isooctane and ethanol 950 mL/L, respectively. The release of AOs from the films was dependent on the type of food stimulant and AO incorporated. In particular, high levels of migration were obtained for both AOs into isooctane, showing thymol higher migration. The release kinetics of AOs from PP films showed a Fichian behaviour with diffusion coefficients ranging from 1 to 2 × 10 − 14 m 2 /s; except for the diffusion into isooctane where 4 - 6 higher values were obtained. The antioxidant activity of migration extracts was confirmed by the DPPH method, showing thymol a higher antioxidant capacity especially into isooctane with a 42. 2 % of inhibition. The obtained results suggest that carvacrol and thymol show a potential use as AOs for active packaging for extending the shelf-life of food products.

The PLA antioxidant-active packaging approach also permits to reduce the amounts of directly added antioxidants in foods to provide safer foods...|$|R
40|$|The {{amounts of}} {{substances}} migrating from plastics into foodstuffs with high fat contents are usually higher than into aqueous foodstuffs. In most cases {{this is due}} to the higher solubility of the migrating organic compunds in fat compared to water and not due to an increase in the diffusion coefficient due to interactions between the fat and plastic as is often assumed. Ethanol and aqueous ethanol mixtures can be good fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> because they interact very little with many plastics, migrants are readily soluble in them and because they are easy to work with analytically. The utilizeable limits of aqueous ethanol and other low molecular weight solvents as <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> are developed from the physical chemical background of partition coefficients and diffusion. The use of ethanol simulants is supported by experimental results for polyolefins and rigid polyvinyl chloride. Other low molecular weight solvents for other classes of polymers are suggested. The UNIFAC activity coeffic ient estimation method is applied to alternative fatty food simulants/polymer systems and estimations for sorption and partition coefficients are compared with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{variety of}} melaware {{articles}} {{have been tested}} for migration of melamine into the <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> 3 % w/v acetic acid, as a benchmark, and into other food simulants, beverages and foods for comparison. The {{results indicate that the}} acidity of the <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> plays a role in promoting migration but not by as much as might have been anticipated, since 3 % acetic acid gave migration values about double those obtained using water under the same time and temperature test conditions. In contrast, migration into the fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> olive oil was not detectable and at least 20 -fold lower than with the aqueous food simulants. This was expected given the solubility properties of melamine and the characteristics of the melaware plastic. Migration levels into hot acidic beverages (apple juice, tomato juice, red-fruit tea and black coffee) were rather similar to the acetic acid simulant when the same time and temperature test conditions are used, e. g. 2 hours at 70 °C. However, migration levels into foods that were placed hot into melaware articles and then allowed to cool on standing were much lower (6 to 14 -times lower) than if pre-heated food was placed into the articles and then maintained (artificially) at that high temperature {{in the same way that}} a controlled time-temperature test using simulants would be conducted. This very strong influence of time and especially temperature was manifest in the effects seen of microwave heating of food or beverage in the melaware articles. Here, despite the short duration of hot contact, migration levels were similar to simulants used for longer periods, e. g. 70 °C for 2 hours. This is rationalised in terms of the peak temperature achieved on microwave heating, which may exceed 70 °C, counterbalancing the shorter time period held hot. There was also evidence that when using melaware utensils in boiling liquids, as for stove-top use of spatulas, the boiling action of circulating food/simulant can have an additional effect in promoting surface erosion, increasing the plastic decomposition and so elevating the melamine release...|$|E

40|$|Fully {{bio-based}} and biodegradable active films {{based on}} poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blended with poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and incorporating lactic acid oligomers (OLA) as plasticizers and carvacrol as active agent were extruded and fully characterized in their functional properties for antimicrobial active packaging. PLA_PHB films showed good barrier to water vapor, while {{the resistance to}} oxygen diffusion decreased {{with the addition of}} OLA and carvacrol. Their overall migration in aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> was determined and no significant changes were observed by the addition of carvacrol and OLA to the PLA_PHB formulations. However, the effect of both additives in fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> can be considered a positive feature for the potential protection of foodstuff with high fat content. Moreover, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the proposed formulations increased by the presence of carvacrol, with enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus if compared to Escherichia coli at short and long incubation times. These results underlined the specific antimicrobial properties of these bio-films suggesting their applicability in active food packaging.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} migration into <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> of TiN nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated at three different levels in low density polyethylene (LDPE) films was carried out under severe test conditions. It was shown that within the analytical sensitivity of the applied ICP-MS method no measurable migration of titanium was found at detection limits to 0. 09 – 0. 11 μg kg− 1 for the <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> 95 % ethanol and iso-octane and 0. 24 μg kg− 1 for 3 % acetic acid. In addition a migration model generally applicable for nanoparticles was established based on an existing migration model for conventional polymer additives to explore into the migration range below the experimentally accessible detection limits. The modeling results indicate that measurable migration may only occur for NPs up to approximately 3. 5 nm in diameter but not for larger ones. Overall, the conclusion was drawn that due to the usual size, shape and aggregation of NPs in plastics nanocomposites nanomaterials are immobilized in food contact plastics. Exposure of the consumer to nanomaterials via migration from food contact plastics cannot be expected...|$|R
40|$|Food {{contaminations}} by {{migration of}} {{low molecular weight}} additives into foodstuffs can result from direct contact between packaging materials and food. The amount of migration {{is related to the}} structural properties of the additive {{as well as to the}} nature of packaging material. The goal of this study is to develop a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model by the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for prediction of the partition coefficient K in food/packaging system. The partition coefficients of a set of 44 systems consisted of 4 <b>food</b> <b>simulants,</b> 6 migrants and 2 packaging materials were investigated. A set of 6 molecular descriptors representing various structural characteristics of <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> (2 descriptors), migrants (3 descriptors) and polymers (1 descriptor) was used as data set. This data set was divided into three subsets: training, test and prediction. ANFIS as a new modeling technique was applied for the first time in this field. The final model has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0. 0006 and correlation coefficient (R²) for the prediction set of 0. 9920...|$|R
40|$|Toxicological {{evidence}} shows that some monomers present in packaging materials may be carcinogenic. These monomers, notably vinylchloride, vinylidenechloride, acrylonitrile and epichlorohydrin, may migrate from the packaging material into the food. Therefore, severe limits are set to the contents of these compounds. Very sensitive and specific methods are required for determining such contents. Moreover, a Food Inspection Service {{must be able to}} inspect large numbers of samples. Gas chromatography, combined with headspace techniques and mass fragmentic detection, has proved to meet such requirements. Thus, vinylchloride and acrylonitrile could be measured down to 1 ppb in <b>food</b> and <b>food</b> <b>simulants,</b> vinylidenechloride down to 5 ppb in polymers, and epichlorohydrin as low as 6 ppb in <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> The potential carcinogenic compound diethylpyrocarbonate could be determined at the ppb level as diethylcarbonate. Methods of analysis using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector and a Hall detector developed at the beginning of our investigations, are now only used for screening purposes. The method for determination of vinylchloride {{has been the subject of}} a collaborative study with sixteen participating laboratories. Results of recent determinations are reported...|$|R
