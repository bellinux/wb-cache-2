40|$|Examines {{the effects}} of {{economic}} change on individual well-being for a panel of married Czech women compared with a US sample from IA (N = 192 & 386, respectively, in 1990 / 91). Questionnaire data show that respondents who were forced to make <b>economic</b> <b>adjustments</b> reducing {{their standard of living}} also reported increased health problems & depressive symptoms. Contrary to some US findings the relationship between <b>economic</b> <b>adjustments</b> & change in depressive symptoms was strongest among those who reported having the strongest sense of personal control (mastery) & the highest perceived social support. Compared with the US sample, married Czech women reported more depressive symptoms, had more health problems, & were lower in feelings of mastery. In addition, Czech women recorded significantly stronger paths linking education to changes in health conditions & depressive symptoms, whereas US women had significantly stronger paths linking actual economic conditions to subsequent <b>economic</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Data suggest that the US stress-distress model applies in the Czech Republic as well, but further understanding of the differentiated role of social support & mastery for Czech & US women is necessray to more completely interpret the observed interactions...|$|R
40|$|The Latvian {{economy has}} been the most crisis {{affected}} economy so far in the whole territory of the EU. The expected GDP fall during the year 2009 is close to 20 %, the unemployment rate is approaching 20 %, and prices have already started to fall. There are major fiscal problems in the economy. For the second year Latvian society has lived under the threat of devaluation of the national currency. The country has applied for serious external financial assistance from the IMF and the European Commission. The sharp decrease in the economic activity is strongly related to the high current account deficit in the balance of payments which developed during the previous years of a high growth thus making the Latvian economy extremely vulnerable. As a financial inflow has strongly decreased, there is a rapid decline in both private and government consumption and investment. This paper is aimed at analysing and explaining the roots of the drastic changes in almost all macroeconomic indicators that have led to serious <b>economic</b> <b>adjustments</b> and strict changes in the economic policy. The paper will assess the outcomes of the <b>economic</b> <b>adjustments</b> as well as extract the most important lessons that have to be taken from {{what has happened in the}} crisis most affected economy of the EU.

25|$|In 1979 {{a second}} oil shock nearly doubled {{the price of}} {{imported}} oil to Brazil and lowered the terms of trade further. The rise in world interest rates sharply increased Brazil's balance of payments problem {{and the size of}} the foreign debt. Nevertheless, the government continued borrowing, mainly to face an increasing debt burden, while it tried vainly to maintain the high-growth strategy. At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the foreign-debt problem became acute, leading to the introduction of a program to generate growing trade surpluses in order to service the foreign debt. The program was achieved by reducing growth and, with it, imports, and by expanding exports. As a result, in 1981 real GDP declined by 4.4 percent. The 1982 Mexican debt crisis ended Brazil's access to international financial markets, increasing the pressure for <b>economic</b> <b>adjustment.</b>|$|E

Towards the end of the debate, Zoi Konstantopoulou, the Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament, raised so many procedural questions and objections that Tsakalotos missed the 9:30am vote to catch a flight to Brussels. More than 40 Syriza MPs voted against the plans, and it was suggested that Tsipras may resign, bringing the prospect of another snap election in September.
