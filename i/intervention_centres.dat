40|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{has been an}} urgent problem also in the Czech Republic. The necessity to solve its complexity upon level of the state, not only through non governmental, non-profit-making institutions, is especially expressed by adopting Act No. 135 / 2006 Collection of Laws, by which some acts in scope of domestic violence protection are amended. This Act allows the Police of the Czech Republic to banish an offender committing domestic violence from mutual residence {{for a period of}} 10 days and the Act has established a new social service the so called "Intervention Centreq, i. e. a specialized facility that provides help with people who are endangered by domestic violence. The objective was to find out the level of public awareness, knowledge of the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres</b> in the Moravia-Silesian and Pilsen Regions. Within the first year of that Act operating, there were the least banished offenders v. s. number of inhabitants, just in the Pilsen Region and there were the most ones in the Moravia-Silesian Region. The theoretical work part describes forms of violence in the family, historical relationship of violent actions with women, possibilities how to prevent them or advised help measures to victims of domestic violence. Further, it is focussed on a legislative solution of that problem area in the Czech Republic and some of European countries or the USA as well. The practical work part involves results of a quantity research that was aimed to discovery of public awareness of the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centres.</b> The research was performed by method of questioning in a way of a questionnaire.

40|$|Background: Non-communicable {{diseases}} are a {{leading cause of}} death and can largely be prevented by healthy lifestyles. Health care organizations are encouraged to integrate healthy lifestyle promotion in routine care. This study evaluates the impact of a team initiative on healthy lifestyle promotion in primary care. Methods: A quasi-experimental, cross-sectional design compared three <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> that had implemented lifestyle teams with three control centres that used a traditional model of care. Outcomes were defined using the RE-AIM framework: reach, the proportion of patients receiving lifestyle promotion; effectiveness, self-reported attitudes and competency among staff; adoption, proportion of staff reporting regular practice of lifestyle promotion; implementation, fidelity to the original lifestyle team protocol. Data collection methods included a patient questionnaire (n = 888), a staff questionnaire (n = 120) and structured interviews with all practice managers and, where applicable, team managers (n = 8). The chi square test and problem-driven content analysis was used to analyse the questionnaire and interview data, respectively. Results:Reach: patients at control centres (48 %, n = 211) received lifestyle promotion significantly more often compared with patients at <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> (41 %, n = 169). Effectiveness: intervention staff was significantly more positive towards the effectiveness of lifestyle promotion, shared competency and how lifestyle promotion was prioritized at their centre. Adoption: 47 % of staff at <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> and 58 % at control centres reported that they asked patients about their lifestyle on a daily basis. Implementation: all <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> had implemented multi-professional teams and team managers and held regular meetings but struggled to implement in-house referral structures for lifestyle promotion, which was used consistently among staff. Conclusions:Intervention centres did not show higher rates than control centres on reach of patients or adoption among staff at this stage. All <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> struggled to implement working referral structures for lifestyle promotion. <b>Intervention</b> <b>centres</b> were more positive on effectiveness outcomes, attitudes and competency among staff, however. Thus, lifestyle teams may facilitate lifestyle promotion practice in terms of increased responsiveness among staff, illustrated by positive attitudes and perceptions of shared competency. More research is needed on lifestyle promotion referral structures in primary care regarding their configuration and implementation.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was to map possibilities of a co-operation among the <b>intervention</b> <b>centre</b> and other entities interested in helping to people threatened by the domestic violence. The current status {{was taken from the}} professional literature. There is described an issue of the domestic violence, types and forms of the domestic violence, its characteristics and dynamics, causes, consequences, legal framework of the domestic violence, its actors, entities helping to people threatened by the domestic violence and an interdisciplinary co-operation. The qualitative research was used in the thesis. A tool for the data collection was a semi-standardized interview. Questions were based on theme ranges concerning the examined issue. The research sample consisted of 13 workers of the entities helping to people at risk of the domestic violence in the Highland (Vysočina) region. The research showed that the domestic violence is a very wide-spread and still underestimated issue. At the same time it is seen a considerable progress {{in the area of the}} help to people at risk by the domestic violence. Further the research showed that workers do not exactly know services provided by the <b>Intervention</b> <b>Centre</b> of the Highland (Vysočina) region. Thanks to this fact there can occur a disinformation of people threatened by the domestic violence. The staff can determine the most often demanded help from the side of the potential service users. They can also recognize that not always it is about the help the <b>intervention</b> <b>centre</b> is able to provide. The research does not confirm that the personnel generally would be influenced by prejudices at their work with people at risk by the domestic violence. But they were certainly also in their professional life influenced by a personal experience with the domestic violence that acquired in their neighbourhood. The research raised a possibility of a co-operation among the <b>intervention</b> <b>centre</b> and other entities, namely organizing case conferences.

40|$|Background: Integration of {{lifestyle}} promotion in routine primary care has been suboptimal. Coordinated care models (e. g. screening, brief advice and referral to in-house specialized staff) could facilitate lifestyle promotion practice; {{they have been}} shown to increase the quality of services and reduce costs in other areas of care. This study evaluates the long-term impact of a coordinated lifestyle promotion intervention with a multidisciplinary team approach in a primary care setting. Methods: A quasi-experimental, cross-sectional design was used to compare three <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> using a coordinated care model and three control centres using a traditional model {{of lifestyle}} promotion care. Outcomes were inspired by using the RE-AIM framework: reach, the proportion of patients receiving lifestyle promotion; effectiveness, self-reported attitudes and competency among staff; adoption, proportion of staff reporting daily practice of lifestyle promotion and referral; and implementation, of the coordinated care model. The impact was investigated after 3 and 5 years. Data collection involved a patient questionnaire (intervention, n = 433 - 497; control, n = 455 - 497), a staff questionnaire (intervention, n = 77 - 76; control, n = 43 - 56) and structured interviews with managers (n = 8). The X- 2 test or Fisher exact test with adjustment for clustering by centre was used for the analysis. Problem-driven content analysis was used to analyse the interview data. Results: The findings were consistent over time. <b>Intervention</b> <b>centres</b> did not show higher rates for reach of patients or adoption among staff at the 3 - or 5 -year follow-up. Some conceptual differences between intervention and control staff remained over time in that the intervention staff were more positive on two of eight effectiveness outcomes (one attitude and one competency item) compared with control staff. The Lifestyle team protocol, which included structural opportunities for coordinated care, was implemented at all <b>intervention</b> <b>centres.</b> Lifestyle teams were perceived to have an important role at the centres in driving the lifestyle promotion work forward and being a forum for knowledge exchange. However, resources to refer patients to specialized staff were used inconsistently. Conclusions: The Lifestyle teams may have offered opportunities for lifestyle promotion practice and contributed to enabling conditions at centre level but had limited impact on lifestyle promotion practices.

40|$|Background: Implementation {{of healthy}} {{lifestyle}} promotion in routine primary has been suboptimal. There is emerging evidence that coordinating care {{can improve the}} efficiency and quality of care. However, {{more research is needed}} on the implementation of coordinated care in healthy lifestyle promotion, the role of patients in implementation and the long-term outcomes of implementation efforts. Overall aim: To investigate the implementation of coordinated healthy lifestyle promotion in primary care in terms of process and outcomes, from the perspectives of both staff and patients. Methods: In 2008, Östergötland county council commissioned primary care centres to implement a coordinated care initiative, lifestyle teams, to improve healthy lifestyle promotion routines. A lifestyle team protocol stipulated centres to: (1) create multi-professional teams, (2) appoint team managers, (3) hold team meetings, and (4) create in-house referral routines for at-risk patients. Paper I investigated the implementation process of three lifestyle teams during a two year period using a mixed method, convergent parallel design. A proposed theory of implementation process was used to analyse data from manager interviews, documents and questionnaires. Paper II explored patients’ role in implementation using grounded theory. Interview data from patients with varied experience of promotion was used. Paper III investigated implementation outcomes using a quasi-experimental, cross-sectional design that compared three <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> (lifestyle teams) with three control centres (no teams). Data were collected by staff and patient questionnaires and manager interviews at 3 and 5 years after commissioning. The RE-AIM framework was modified and used to define outcome variables: Reach of patients, Effectiveness (attitudes and competency among staff), Adoption among staff, Implementation fidelity to the lifestyle team protocol, and Maintenance of the results at 5 -year follow-up. Results: Paper I: The implementation process was complex including multiple innovation components and groups of adopters. The conditions for implementation, e. g. resources varied between staff and team members which challenged the embedding of the teams and new routines. The lifestyle teams were continuously redefined by team members to accommodate contextual factors, features of the protocol and patients. The lifestyle team protocol presented an infrastructure for practice at the centres. Paper II: A grounded theory about being healthy with three interconnected subcategories emerged from data: (1) conditions, (2) managing, and (3) interactions regarding being healthy. Being healthy represented a process of approaching a health ideal which occurred simultaneously with, and could contradict, a process of maximizing well-being. A typology of four patient types (resigned, receivers, co-workers, and leaders) illustrated how processes before, during and after healthy lifestyle promotion were interconnected. Paper III: Reach: significantly more patients at control centres received promotion compared to <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> at 3 -year (48 % and 41 % respectively) and 5 -year followups (44 % and 36 % respectively). Effectiveness: At 3 -year follow-up, after controlling for clustering by centres, intervention staff were significantly more positive concerning perceived need for lifestyle teams; that healthy lifestyle promotion was prioritized at their centre and that there was adequate competency at individual and centre level regarding lifestyle promotion. At 5 -year follow-up, significant differences remained regarding prioritization of lifestyle promotion at centre level. The majority of both intervention and control staff were positive towards lifestyle promotion. Adoption: No {{significant differences were found between}} control and <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> at 3 years (59 % and 47 % respectively) or at 5 years (45 % and 36 % respectively). Implementation fidelity: all components of the lifestyle team protocol had been implemented at all the <b>intervention</b> <b>centres</b> and at none of the control centres. Conclusions: The implementation process was challenged by a complex interaction between groups of staff, innovation components and contextual factors. Although coordinated care are used for other conditions in primary care, the findings suggest that it is difficult to adopt similar routines for healthy lifestyle promotion. Findings suggest that the lifestyle team protocol did not fully consider social components of coordinated care or the varied conditions for change exhibited by adopters. Patients can be seen as coproducing implementation of healthy lifestyle promotion...|$|E
