6000|$|We arrived after a {{while at}} Valencia, a {{scattered}} hamlet in the woods, with a good shop or 'store' upon a village green, under the verandah whereof lay, {{side by side with}} bottled ale and biscuit tins, bags of Carapo {265} nuts; trapezoidal brown nuts--enclosed originally in a round fruit--which ought some day to form a valuable article of export. Their bitter anthelminthic oil is said to have medicinal uses; but it will be still more useful for machinery, as it has--like that curious flat gourd the Sequa {266a}--the property of keeping iron from rust. The tree itself, common here and in Guiana, is one of the true Forest Giants; we saw many a noble specimen of it in our rides. Its timber is tough, not over heavy, and extensively used already in the island; while its bark is a febrifuge and tonic. In fact it possesses all those qualities which make its brethren, the Meliaceae, valuable throughout the Tropics. [...] But {{it is not the only}} tree of South America whose bark may be used as a substitute for quinine. They may be counted possibly by dozens. A glance at the excellent enumerations of the uses of vegetable products to be found in Lindley's Vegetable Kingdom (a monument of learning) will show how God provides, how man neglects and wastes. As a single instance, the Laurels alone are known already to contain several valuable febrifuges, among which the <b>Demerara</b> <b>Greenheart,</b> or Bibiri, {266b} claims perhaps the highest rank. 'Dr. Maclagan has shown,' says Dr. Lindley, 'that sulphate of Bibiri acts with rapid and complete success in arresting ague.' [...] This tree spreads from Jamaica to the Spanish Main. It is plentiful in Trinidad; still more plentiful in Guiana; and yet all of it which reaches Europe is a little of its hard beautiful wood for the use of cabinetmakers; while in Demerara, I am assured by an eye-witness, many tons of this precious Greenheart bark are thrown away year by year. So goes the world; and man meanwhile at once boasts of his civilisation, and complains of the niggardliness of Nature.|$|E
50|$|Chlorocardium rodiei (greenheart) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Lauraceae. It {{is one of two}} species in the genus Chlorocardium. It is native Guyana and Suriname in South America. Other common names include cogwood, <b>demerara</b> <b>greenheart,</b> ispingo moena, sipiri, bebeeru and bibiru.|$|E
40|$|Some {{rain and}} savanna forests of western Suriname (Corantijn R., Winana Creek; Upper Marataka R.; Upper Nickerie R;) were studied and their {{composition}} was {{compared with that}} of forests of other parts of Suriname and Guyana. The savanna forests of western Suriname proved to be much related to Guyanan (Walabaand Dakama-) savanna forests as described by Davis & Richards (1934) and Fanshawe (1952). On the other hand, there was less relationship as regards rain forests of western Suriname when compared with ones of Guyana and other parts of Suriname, except for the <b>Demerara</b> <b>greenheart</b> forest of the Upper Marataka R., which was closely related to the <b>Demerara</b> <b>greenheart</b> forests of Guyana as described by Davis & Richards (1934). In addition an upland rain forest was studied near Blanche Marie falls, Upper Nickerie R., which proved to be very much like that of the Stofbroekoe Mts., eastern Suriname, as described by Schils (1960). Species/area curves for some rain and savanna forests are given. The geographical distribution of some common western Surinam tree species was studied; of the seventeen species studied one was endemic for Suriname. An annotated list of all species of trees and palms occurring in the explored areas is provided...|$|E
