40|$|PURPOSE:: Thorough this {{experimental}} study, the physic {{features of}} a modified 23 -gauge vitrectomy probe were evaluated in vitro. METHODS:: A modified vitrectomy probe to increase vitreous outflow rate with a small-diameter probe, that also minimized tractional forces on the retina, was created and tested. The “new” probe was created by drilling an opening into the <b>inner</b> <b>duct</b> of a traditional 23 -gauge probe with electrochemical or electrodischarge micromachining. Both vitreous outflow and tractional forces on the retina were examined using experimental models of vitreous surgery. RESULTS:: The additional opening allowed the modified probe to have a cutting rate of 5, 000 cuts per minute, while sustaining an outflow approximately 45 % higher than in conventional 23 -gauge probes. The modified probe performed two cutting actions per cycle, not one, as in standard probes. Because tractional force is influenced by cutting rate, retinal forces were 2. 2 times lower than those observed with traditional cutters. CONCLUSION:: The modified probe could be useful in vitreoretinal surgery. It allows for faster vitreous removal while minimizing tractional forces on the retina. Moreover, any available probe can be modified by creating {{a hole in the}} <b>inner</b> <b>duct...</b>|$|E

The profiles of the mean axial velocity, of the axial and radial turbulence intensities, and of the shear stress are described for the initial and intermediate zones of the near field. The lenghts of the potential cores are in good agreement with available data obtained with lower exit turbulence levels and laminar boundary layers. It is shown that the prevailing frequencies of the flow fluctuations may be better recognized if the hot-wire spectra of both the axial and the radial velocities are analyzed.

Even {{in one of the}} most well-resolved systems for studying post-copulatory sexual selection, the yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria), the process of sperm transfer is not well understood. Our aim is to model the fluid dynamics of sperm flow in the reproductive tracts of female yellow dung flies to determine what aspects of female morphology may influence sperm movement. We model fluid flow using computational mathematics, and investigate geometric parameters suspected of influencing rates of ejaculate movement: the curvature of sperm storage ducts, the smoothness of the <b>inner</b> <b>duct</b> wall (surface area), spermathecal duct length and duct diameter. Duct length does not influence the flow rate, where duct diameter has a strong influence of up to 71 % at the extremes of the natural range observed in female dung flies. Whereas duct curvature influences the flow rate only slightly (with an effect size of 1. 6 % over the natural range), the duct wall smoothness has a pronounced effect (50 %). The increase in duct surface area also slightly increases the effect of curvature, implying that these structures might act synergistically, although the small size of this effect argues against such a synergy having evolved as an adaptation for controlling sperm flow.

40|$|Most {{air duct}} system {{components}} are {{assembled in the}} field and are mechanically fastened by sheet metal screws (for sheet metal-to-sheet metal) or by drawbands (for flex duct-to-sheet metal). Air sealing is separate from this mechanical fastening and is usually achieved using tape or mastic products after mechanical fastening. Field observations have shown that mechanical fastening rarely meets code or manufacturers requirements and that sealing procedures are similarly inconsistent. To address these problems, Proctor Engineering Group (PEG) is developing a system of joining ducts (called PEGIT) that combines the mechanical fastening and sealing into a single self-contained procedure. The PEGIT system uses a shaped flexible seal between specially designed sheet metal duct fittings to both seal and fasten duct sections together. Figure 1 shows the <b>inner</b> <b>duct</b> fitting complete with rubber seal. This seal provides the air seal for the completed fitting and is shaped to allow the inner and outer fittings to slide together, and then to lock the fittings in place. The illustration in Figure 2 shows the approximate cross section of the rubber seal that shows how the seal has a lip that is angled backwards. This angled lip allows the joint to be pushed together by folding flat but then its long axis makes it stiff in the pulling apart direction. This study was undertaken to assist PEG in some of the design aspects of this system and to test the performance of the PEGIT system. This study was carried out in three phases. The initial phase evaluated the performance of a preliminary seal design for the PEGIT system. After the first phase, the seal was redesigned and this new seal was evaluated in the second phase of testing. The third phase performed more detailed testing of the second seal design to optimize the production tolerances of the sheet metal fittings. This report summarizes our findings from the first two phases and provides details about the third phase of testing...|$|E

Calmodulin inhibitors also blocked both cholera toxin- and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In isolated perfused tubules, W- 7 reversibly blocked vasopressin-stimulated urea permeability, a process that requires a rise in intracellular cAMP, but does not appear to involve protein trafficking to the apical plasma membrane.
