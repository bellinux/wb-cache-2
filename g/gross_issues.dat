40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether a}} successful employment discrimination plaintiff may be entitled, under current law, {{to receive an}} augmented award (a gross up) to neutralize certain adverse federal income tax consequences. The question of whether such a gross up is allowed, the resolution of which can have drastic effects on litigants, has received almost no attention from practitioners, judges, and academics. Because of the potentially enormous impact of {{the alternative minimum tax}} (AMT) on discrimination lawsuit recoveries, however, the <b>gross</b> up <b>issue</b> is now beginning to appear in reported cases. The three principal federal anti-discrimination statutes - Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) - generally confer broad equitable powers on the courts to devise remedies that will make the victims of discrimination whole in economic terms. The Internal Revenue Code (Code), however, sometimes operates to frustrate this make-whole objective by taxing a discrimination award more heavily than the components of the award would have been taxed had the components been earned in due course by the plaintiff. This excess taxation gives rise to what this article calls adverse tax consequences. A discrimination plaintiff may suffer adverse tax consequences in two distinct ways. First, amounts recovered to compensate for back pay and front pay losses may be subjected to higher income tax rates than if such amounts had been earned as wages in due course. This increase in tax rates is typically {{due to the fact that}} the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s recovery is in a lump sum; as a result, a portion of the recovery may be subject to marginal rates higher than the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s typical marginal rate. Second, an employment discrimination recovery could implicate the AMT. If so, the AMT may cause the recovery to be effectively taxed at rates significantly higher than the top marginal rate of 35 percent. In fact, in certain cases, the AMT may cause the tax on the recovery to exceed 100 percent - meaning that a victorious plaintiff would owe more in taxes than her recovery. This AMT trap is notoriously absurd as a matter of tax policy and undermines the national policy of encouraging the pursuit of meritorious civil rights claims. Yet, the trap persists, at least in most areas of the country. The resolution of the <b>gross</b> up <b>issue</b> depends ultimately on whether the federal anti-discrimination remedial provisions permit judges to shift the liability for these adverse tax consequences from the plaintiff - on whom the Internal Revenue Code specifically imposes the liability - to the defendant - whose unlawful conduct necessitated the lawsuit that caused the adverse taxconsequences. The potential vehicle for this shift is the broad equitable powers conferred upon courts to fashion relief in order to make victims of discrimination whole. The issue of whether these broad equitable powers allow judges to shift a portion of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s federal income tax liability to defendants is particularly interesting since both the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s tax liability and the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s discrimination liability arise from federal statutes passed by Congress. Thus, the resolution of the issue depends on which body of statutes, the Internal Revenue Code or the pertinent federal anti-discrimination statute, prevails over the other. More generally, though, the issue concerns the courts 2 ̆ 7 willingness to delve into federal income tax matters and focus on after-tax dollars, which are meaningful, rather than pre-tax dollars, which are meaningless. Courts typically have been reluctant to get their hands dirty with tax law if they can avoid it. Determining after-tax income can be a painstaking process and predicting future after-tax income even more so. Nevertheless, we conclude that courts have the authority to provide gross ups to discrimination plaintiffs and should exercise this authority whenever adverse tax consequences are substantial...|$|R

While much time has been spent delving into relationship between campaign spending and election outcomes, little has been spent on the question of campaign finance laws on elections. Until Eom and <b>Gross</b> addressed the <b>issue</b> in, "Contribution Limits and Disparity in Contributions between Gubernatorial Candidates," the effects of laws on campaign spending were always assumed to be uniform between all candidates. Running a standard OLS regression with the disparity between campaign spending of incumbent and challengers in gubernatorial elections as the dependent and contribution limits and other control variables as independents, they conclude that these laws do not impact the disparity between candidates in spending. I recognized flaws in their analysis in three areas: 1) small data set of 57 observations, 2) lack of adequate control variables, and 3) an ill defined law independent variable. Before proposing other models or doing further work, I determined it best to instead retest their model after fixing these three flaws. Using a data set of 368 observations, including state control variables and disaggregating the law variable into separate corporate and individual limitations yielded the opposite conclusion of their paper. Using the model they have proposed corporate contribution limits have a significant negative impact on spending disparity while individual contribution limits have a significant positive impact on spending disparity. Borrowing their terminology, this would imply corporate limits increase election competition while individual limits decrease election competition...|$|R
40|$|The unique {{climate of}} the alpine wetland meadow is {{characterized}} by long cold winters and short cool summers with relatively high precipitation.

The measurements covered three years and were made using the eddy covariance method. Seasonal trends of both GPP and Reco, followed closely changes in Leaf Area Index (LAI). Reco, exhibited the same exponential variation as soil temperature with seasonally-dependent R 10 (the ecosystem respiration rate (μmol CO 2 m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 ) at the soil temperature reach 283. 16 K (10 &deg;C)). Yearly average GPP, Reco, and NEE (which were 575. 7, 676. 8 and 101. 1 gCm&minus; 2 , respectively, for 2004 year, and 682. 9, 726. 4 and 44. 0 gCm&minus; 2 for 2005 year, and 630. 97, 808. 2 and 173. 2 gCm&minus; 2 for 2006 year) values indicated that the alpine wetland meadow was a moderately important source of CO 2 . The observed carbon dioxide fluxes in this alpine wetland meadow plateau are high in comparison with other alpine meadow environments such as Kobresia humilis meadow and shrubland meadow located in similar areas. And the cumulative NEE data indicated that the alpine wetland meadow is a source of atmospheric CO 2 during the study years.

To contribute to knowledge by engaging {{in a study of}} the relationship between Australia, New Zealand and international capital markets 1850 - 1950 which would focus on three key themes: i. 	The history of Australia and New Zealand as borrowers and debtors. ii. 	The rise and consolidation of the British 'colonial' market in the London capital market from the mid-nineteenth century to the late 1920 s. iii. 	The interaction between the market disciplines to which all borrowers were subject, and the opportunities and constraints created by membership of the British Empire. The study would also evaluate recent arguments (Cain and Hopkins, 1993) {{about the role of the}} City of London in the dynamics of British imperial expansion and control with respect to two British settler societies, Australia and New Zealand. 2. 	To extend and revise the statistics of Australasian public debt in the period 1850 - 1950. 3. 	To create a database of Australasian overseas public loans during that period. The projects specific objectives were to complete three stages of research: 1. 	The consultation of archival and printed official sources in the United Kingdom and Australia relating to Australasian borrowing activity and relations with overseas creditors during nineteenth century. These either had not been available to, or were not consulted by, earlier historians. 2. 	The collection of quantitative data for revised statistics of Australian and New Zealand public debt between 1850 and 1950. 3. 	The collection of data for a database of Australasian overseas public loans during that period. Main Topics : This dataset publishes new statistics of Australian colonial and state debt, and of capital raised by all Australian public borrowers (including corporation) in London, until 1914. Current historical statistics do not distinguish between stocks of debt held locally or abroad. Moreover, the time series of new capital subscribed or received in London prepared by Butlin, Simon, Hall, and others often aggregate all colonial public borrowing, have different terminal dates, and are inconsistent with each other. The new statistics remedy these deficiencies. Three types of table are presented. The first disaggregates, and where necessary corrects, the official annual statistics of stocks of outstanding debt of each Australian colony, distinguishing between the place of original sale, long and short-term securities, and <b>gross</b> new <b>issues</b> (i. e. the nominal value of all securities sold) and repayments. The second shows the stocks of long and short term debt held in Australia and the United Kingdom. These are taken principally from Statistical Registers, and include debt (e. g. stock issued by Savings Banks) omitted from the official statistics in the early years. The final type of table summarises the principal annual flows in London of capital created (including as a result of conversions and exchanges), subscribed, received, and amortized for each colonial government and for public corporations as a single group. It excludes flows arising from remittance of securities originally sold in the colonies, but includes transfers from London to colonial registers and purchases from sinking funds where they are known. The data is presented in 18 spreadsheets and are of seven separate borrowers: New South Wales (3 spreadsheets), Victoria (3), Queensland (3), South Australia (3), Tasmania (2), Western Australia (2), and public corporations (1). Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|R
