40|$|Objective:To {{evaluate}} phenylalanine {{plasma profile}} in preterm newborns fed different <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> diets. Methods:Twenty-four very-low weight preterm newborns were distributed randomly in three groups with different feeding types: Group I: banked <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> plus 5 % commercial fortifier with bovine protein, Group II: banked <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> plus evaporated <b>fortifier</b> derived from modified <b>human</b> <b>milk,</b> Group III: banked <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> plus lyophilized <b>fortifier</b> derived from modified <b>human</b> <b>milk.</b> The newborns received the group diet when full diet was attained at 15 ± 2 days.

40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} fortification on the osmolality of <b>human</b> <b>milk.</b>  METHODS—The osmolality of 47 samples of <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> was determined at baseline, just after, and 24 hours after supplementation with five different <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifiers</b> (HMF) at 4 °C.  RESULTS—Ten minutes after HMF supplementation the osmolality of <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> {{was significantly higher than}} the sum of the respective values of HMF dissolved in water and <b>human</b> <b>milk,</b> measured separately at baseline (p< 0. 0001), {{with the exception of the}} HMF containing only proteins. After 24 hours a further increase in osmolality was observed. Linear regression analysis showed that total dextrin content (r= 0. 84) was the main determinant of the increase.  CONCLUSIONS—Human milk and HMF interact to induce a rapid increase in osmolality higher than would be expected from composition alone. This rise could be explained by the amylase activity of <b>human</b> <b>milk,</b> inducing hydrolysis of the dextrin content of HMF, leading to small osmotically active molecules of oligosaccharides. The high osmolality of fortified <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> should be considered in the nutritional management of preterm infants. ...|$|R
30|$|Classic late {{metabolic}} acidosis of prematurity and inability to adequately excrete acidic equivalents is uncommon with contemporary neonatal care; however, mild {{metabolic acidosis}}, i.e., base excess {{less than minus}} 4 or bicarbonate less than 18  mmol/l, remains a concern in up to 30 % of neonates with tubulopathy of prematurity and with use of <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifiers</b> (HMF) [59]. This is often not easily appreciated in some infants due to relative renal compensation for respiratory acidosis associated with BPD {{as a consequence of}} very preterm birth.

40|$|Free radical {{injury is}} thought to play a {{significant}} role in the pathogenesis of several disease processes in low birth weight premature infants including retinopathy of prematurity and ne-crotizing enterocolitis. Because iron is a known catalyst in free radical–mediated oxidation reactions, the objectives of the present in vitro studies were to determine whether after exposure to air 1) iron present in infant formula, or that added to human milk or formula as medicinal iron or as iron contained in <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier,</b> increases free radical and lipid peroxidation prod-ucts; and 2) recombinant human lactoferrin added to formula or human milk attenuates iron-mediated free radical formation and lipid peroxidation. Before adding medicinal iron to formula and human milk, significantly more ascorbate and -hydroxyethyl radical production and more lipid peroxidation products (i. e. thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, malondialdehyde, and ethane) were observed in formula. After the addition of medic-inal iron to either formula or human milk, further increases were observed in free radical and lipid peroxidation products. When iron-containing <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> was added to human milk, free radicals also increased. In contrast, the addition of apo-recombinant human lactoferrin to formula or human milk de-creased the levels of oxidative products when medicinal iron or <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> was present. We speculate that the presence of greater concentration of iron and the absence of lactoferrin in formula compared with human milk results in greater in vitro generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation products. Whether iron-containing formula with lactoferrin administered enterally to preterm infants will result in less free radical gener-ation in vivo has yet to be established.

40|$|Preterm infants are {{difficult}} to adequately nourish due to their immature organ systems and prematurity related illnesses. Human milk is accepted as the preferred feed for the preterm infant but needs to be supplemented with protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals to meet the metabolic needs of the infant. Currently available commercial fortifiers {{do not meet the}} recommended protein intakes suggested in the literature. This thesis tested the hypothesis that preterm infants fed a <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> with a protein content of 1. 8 grams protein per 100 ml expressed breast milk would experience greater weight gain than infants fed the current nursery practice amount – 1. 0 grams protein per 100 ml expressed breast milk. Criteria for eligibility of infants in this study were birth at 28 – 32 weeks gestation and a planned breast milk diet. Power analysis indicated that to detect a clinically significant weight gain increase of 3. 31 grams per day, 60 infants in total would be required. After parental consent was obtained, 60 infants were randomised into the study between February 2012 and February 2013, with 31 in the High protein group and 29 in the Standard group. Multiple births were randomised as individual infants. Infants in the High protein group received a <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> (FM- 85, Nestle) enriched with Protifar (Nutricia) which provided 1. 8 grams protein per 100 ml expressed breast milk. Infants in the Standard group received a <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> (FM- 85) that was equivalent to standard care and provided 1 gram protein per 100 ml expressed breast milk. The Standard diet was made isocaloric to the High Protein by the addition of carbohydrate (PolyJoule, Nutricia). The study period for infants began at randomisation and ceased when the naso-gastric tube was removed. Infants were weighed daily by care staff and weekly by trained research personnel. Length and head circumference – important measures of growth – were assessed weekly. Lean mass gain, which is better associated with adult metabolic health outcomes than adipose tissue gain in the in-hospital period, was also assessed weekly. Blood and urine chemistry markers were assessed weekly and every two weeks, respectively, as an assessment of protein nutritional status. A weekly sample of breast milk was collected if supply was abundant. Lean mass was assessed using Bioelectrical Impedance Spectroscopy, which was validated for use in preterm infants as part of this thesis. Breast milk was assessed for protein content to ensure that intake calculations were based on true, not assumed values. There were no differences in the primary outcome of weight gain or the secondary outcomes of length gain, head circumference gain or small for gestational age at discharge status. There was a significant trend for increased lean mass as a percentage of body weight in the high protein infants (p= 0. 03). Blood urea nitrogen and urine urea measurements were significantly higher in the High protein infants. Base excess measurements were significantly decreased in High protein infants however no infants experienced metabolic acidosis. Increasing the protein content of <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> to 1. 8 grams protein did not increase weigh gain, length gain or head circumference gain in preterm infants born at 28 – 32 weeks gestation. While the intervention was well tolerated it is the conclusion of this thesis that the protein content of <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> {{does not need to be}} increased to 1. 8 grams protein per 100 ml expressed breast milk.

40|$|Optimal {{nutritional}} {{support for}} the newborn {{is one of the}} most relevant task of the neonatologist, because of the short and long term effects on health and well being. While in the past scientific interest was mainly focused on nutritional needs, recently, nutrition has revealed its main role in primary prevention of adult diseases and in the improvement of physical and cognitive potentials. This concept is also expressed by the “programming” theory, which identifies a critical period in life, in which a stimulus or an insult may exert long-term consequences on the structure and functions of the organism. Breastfeeding is still considered the best option for the healthy term infant, and has shown several advantages also for the preterm infant. In several observational studies breastfed infants have, in fact, shown to be at lower risk for cardiovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, high blood pressure, obesity and type- 2 diabetes. The anti-infective properties, the immunomodulatory effect and the favourable influences on intestinal microbiota make mother’s milk the enteral feeding of choice also for the preterm infant. Anyway, the nutritional needs of very low and extremely low birth weight infants (VELBW, ELBW) greatly exceed the content of <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> for protein, minerals and vitamins. The currently available <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifiers</b> are still inadequate for the smallest infants but, perhaps also for commercial reasons, no upgrading of their composition has been made in the last few years. In this perspective, some authors have studied the growth improvement of weight and head circumference of VLBW infants with an adjustable fortification regimen of <b>human</b> <b>milk.</b> The same concept should be valid also for formula feeding regimens, because it is necessary to choose the right product for the specific preterm infant.

40|$|For preterm infants, it {{is common}} {{practice}} to add <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifiers</b> to native breast milk to enhance protein and calorie supply because the growth rates and nutritional requirements of preterm infants are considerably {{higher than those of}} term infants. However, macronutrient intake may still be inadequate because the composition of native breast milk has individual inter- and intra-sample variation. Target fortification (TFO) of breast milk is a new nutritional regime aiming to reduce such variations by individually measuring and adding deficient macronutrients. Added TFO components contribute to the final osmolality of milk feeds. It is important to predict the final osmolality of TFO breast milk to ensure current osmolality recommendations are followed to minimize feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis. This study aims to develop and validate equations to predict the osmolality of TFO milk batches. To establish prediction models, the osmolalities of either native or supplemented breast milk with known amounts of fat, protein, and carbohydrates were analyzed. To validate prediction models, the osmolalities of each macronutrient and combinations of macronutrients were measured in an independent sample set. Additionally, osmolality was measured in TFO milk samples obtained from a previous clinical study and compared with predicted osmolality using the prediction equations. Following the addition of 1 g of carbohydrates (glucose polymer), 1 g of hydrolyzed protein, or 1 g of whey protein per 100 mL breast milk, the average increase in osmolality was 20, 38, and 4 mOsm/kg respectively. Adding fat decreased osmolality only marginally due to dilution effect. Measured and predicted osmolality of combinations of macronutrients as well as single macronutrient (R 2 = 0. 93) were highly correlated.

40|$|Preterm birth {{survivors}} {{are at a}} higher risk of growth and developmental disabilities compared to their term counterparts. Development of strategies to lower the complications of preterm birth forms the rising need of the hour. Appropriate nutrition is essential for the growth and development of preterm infants. Early administration of optimal nutrition to preterm birth survivors lowers the risk of adverse health outcomes and improves cognition in adulthood. A group of neonatologists, pediatricians, and nutrition experts convened to discuss and frame evidence-based recommendations for optimizing nutrition in preterm low birth weight (LBW) infants. The following were the primary recommendations of the panel: (1) enteral feeding is safe and may be preferred to parenteral nutrition due to the complications associated with the latter; however, parenteral nutrition may be a useful adjunct to enteral feeding in some critical cases; (2) early, fast, or continuous enteral feeding yields better outcomes compared to late, slow, or intermittent feeding, respectively; (3) routine use of nasogastric tubes is not advisable; (4) preterm infants can be fed while on ventilator or continuous positive airway pressure; (5) routine evaluation of gastric residuals and abdominal girth should be avoided; (6) expressed breast milk (EBM) is the first choice for feeding preterm infants due to its beneficial effects on cardiovascular, neurological, bone health, and growth outcomes; the second choice is donor pasteurized human milk; (7) EBM or donor milk may be fortified with <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifiers,</b> without increasing the osmolality of the milk, to meet the high protein requirements of preterm infants; (8) standard fortification is effective and safe but does not fulfill the high protein needs; (9) use of targeted and adjustable fortification, where possible, helps provide optimal nutrition; (10) optimizing weight gain in preterm infants prevents long-term cardiovascular complications; (11) checking for optimal weight and sucking/swallowing ability is essential prior to discharge of preterm infants; and (12) appropriate counseling and regular follow-up and monitoring after discharge will help achieve better long-term health outcomes.

Methods: This was a decision modelling study using patient data obtained from a randomized controlled trial comparing a LHMF with a PHMF in preterm infants, supplemented with additional data obtained by performing a chart review among 79 % of the trial patients. The model estimated the cost-effectiveness of LHMF versus PHMF in US$ at 2014 / 2015 prices. Results: More infants in the LHMF group were discharged home (92 % versus 89 %) and more infants in the PHMF group were transferred to another unit (9 % versus 5 %). Gestational age was an independent predictor for being discharged home (odds ratio of 2. 18; p= 0. 006 for each week of gestational age). Mean length of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay was 1 day less in the LHMF than the PHMF group (62. 3 versus 63. 4 days), but mean length of NICU stay among infants who developed NEC or sepsis was 79. 3 days and 61. 2 days in the PHMF and LHMF groups, respectively. Total management cost up to discharge was $ 10, 497 per infant less in the LHMF group than the PHMF group ($ 240, 928 versus $ 251, 425).

40|$|The use of <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifiers</b> (HMF) {{helps to}} meet the high {{nutritional}} requirements of the human milk-fed premature infant. Previously available powdered products have not met the protein requirements of the preterm infant population and many neonatologists add powder protein modulars to help meet protein needs. The use of powdered products is discouraged in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) due to concern for invasive infection. The use of a commercially available acidified liquid product with higher protein content was implemented to address these two concerns. During {{the course of this}} implementation, poor growth and clinically significant acidosis of infants on Acidified Liquid HMF (ALHMF) was observed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify those observations by comparing infant outcomes between groups receiving the ALHMF vs. infants receiving powdered HMF (PHMF). A retrospective chart review compared outcomes of human milk-fed premature infants < 2000 g receiving the ALHMF (n = 23) and the PHMF (n = 46). Infant growth, enteral feeding tolerance and provision, and incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), metabolic acidosis, and diaper dermatitis were compared between the two groups. No infants were excluded from this study based on acuity. Use of ALHMF resulted in a higher incidence of metabolic acidosis (p = 0. 002). Growth while on HMF as measured in both g/kg/day (10. 59 vs. 15. 37, p < 0. 0001) and in g/day (23. 66 vs. 31. 27, p = 0. 0001) was slower in the ALHMF group, on increased mean cal/kg/day (128. 7 vs. 117. 3, p = 0. 13) with nearly twice as many infants on the ALHMF requiring increased fortification of enteral feedings beyond 24 cal/ounce to promote adequate growth (48 % vs. 26 %, p = 0. 10).

RHC-DHA related positively with gain in weight and length and negatively with gain in head circumference. RBC-AA related positively with gain in head circumference and negatively with gain in weight and length. In conclusion, PDF with higher DHA and AA than TF may promote postnatal growth of preterms.

Latest ESPGHAN 2 guidelines suggest protein intakes between 3. 5 and 4. 5 g/kg/d and energy intakes between 110 and 135 kcal/kg/d are necessary for preterm infants to achieve reference growth (weight gain of ~ 15 g/kg/d). These intakes are difficult to achieve with milk feeds, especially when fluids are restricted, and therefore expressed breast milk (EBM) is routinely fortified with a multi-component, breast <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> and a protein supplement to assist preterm infants in meeting their nutritional and growth requirements.

This study has investigated the efficacy of a <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> made up of glucose polymers, a mixture of bovine milk protein fractions and free amino acids, minerals and vitamins designed to improve these nutritional deficiencies. Growth and bone mineral deficiencies were compared in 38 preterm infants fed fortified mother's milk and 21 preterm infants fed a preterm formula until they reached 1800 g; all had a birthweight below 1600 g. Weight gain was similar in each group with a mean (SD) increase of 19. 6 (3. 5) g/kg/day in the fortified group and 19. 9 (4. 1) g/kg/day in the preterm formula group. There were also no significant differences in linear growth, head circumference, skin fold thickness or mid-arm circumference. Serum phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and plasma urea concentrations were similar and there was no clinical evidence of osteopenia.

40|$|Although {{there are}} no {{official}} recommendations for specific nutrient intakes in premature infants after hospital discharge, it is agreed that the {{goal should be to}} achieve the body composition and rate of growth of that of a normal fetus of the same postmenstrual age during the entire first year of life. Close monitoring of growth during hospital stay and after discharge is recommended to enable the provision of adequate nutrition support. Measurements of length and head circumference, in addition to weight, must be used to identify those preterm infants with poor growth that may need additional nutrition support. Infants with an appropriate weight for postconceptional age at discharge should be breast-fed when possible. Infants discharged with a subnormal weight for postconceptional age are at increased risk of long-term growth failure, and the human milk they consume should be supplemented, for example, with a <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> to provide an adequate nutrient supply.

40|$|D. Cur. The {{feeding of}} {{low birth weight}} babies remains a challenge. Mother's milk is {{deficient}} in protein, calcium, magnesium and phosphate.

The objective {{of the study was to}} compare the growth of the low birth weight baby, who was only fed mothers milk, to the low birth weight babay who was fed mother's milk with a commercial fortifier, using mass, lenght and head circumference as a guide. The literature study has shown that there are different methods which can be used to compliment the deficiencies in mothers's milk, for example: premature milk formula, alternating mother's milk with premature milk formula, additional additives to mother's <b>milk</b> and commercial <b>fortifiers.</b> Previous research of mother's <b>milk</b> <b>fortifiers</b> has shown that the biochemistry has positvely influenced their growth.

An Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved retrospective chart review compared infant outcomes (born < 2000 g) who received one of three HMF. Growth, enteral nutrition, laboratory and demographic data were compared. 120 infants were included (P-HMF = 46, AL-HMF = 23, NAL-HMF = 51). AL-HMF infants grew slower in g/day (median 23. 66 vs. P-HMF 31. 27, NAL-HMF 31. 74 (p < 0. 05)) and in g/kg/day, median 10. 59 vs. 15. 37, 14. 03 (p < 0. 0001). AL-HMF vs. NAL-HMF infants were smaller at 36 weeks gestational age (median 2046 vs. 2404 g, p < 0. 05). However AL-HMF infants received more daily calories (p = 0. 21) and protein (p < 0. 0001), mean 129 cal/kg, 4. 2 g protein/kg vs. P-HMF 117 cal/kg, 3. 7 g protein/kg, NAL-HMF 120 cal/kg, 4. 0 g protein/kg.

40|$|Feeding {{very low}} birth weight (VLBW) infants their mothers ’ {{expressed}} breast milk (EBM) is strongly advo-cated because of the numerous nutritional and immuno-logical benefits for infants and psychological benefits for the mother. 1, 2 Because the nutrient content of unsupple-mented human milk {{is considered to be}} insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} VLBW infants, a powdered com-mercial <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> (HMF) containing pro-tein, minerals, and vitamins is routinely added to EBM and fed to VLBW infants. 3, 4 Despite this fortifi-cation, VLBW infants, especially those who are very preterm (< 28 weeks ’ gestation), commonly experience postnatal growth failure. 5, 6 As well, poor growth in this population is associated with long-term growth and neu-rodevelopmental delays until at least school age. 7 - 9 This has led clinicians to further enhance the nutritional intake of VLBW infants by supplementing fortified preterm milk with additional fat, carbohydrate, and/or protein modules. It has been suggested that the natural increase in fat and energy concentrations of breast milk toward the lat-ter part of the pumping session (hindmilk) could be used to increase the energy density of fortified EBM fed to VLBW infants. 10 Over the past several years there has been an increase in the use of hindmilk in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across North America. 11, 12 Widespread adoption of this practice is concerning as there is limited information on the nutrient composi-tion of hindmilk produced by mothers of preter...|$|E
40|$|Background: Human milk is nutritionally {{better than}} formula milk for preterm infants. However, unfortified human milk {{may fail to}} meet the {{theoretical}} requirements of very low birth weight (VLBW). <b>Human</b> <b>milk</b> <b>fortifier</b> (HMF) increases the nutritional content of human milk. However, the important factor of concern in feeding VLBW is the osmolality, the higher the osmolality, the greater the risk of necrotizing entero colitis (NEC). Therefore, high osmolality in fortified human milk should be considered for this condition. Objective: To evaluate the effect of fortification on the osmolality of human milk Material and Method: Twenty samples of human milk were collected from mothers of gestational age less than 32 weeks, at about 1 week postpartum in Songklanagarind Hospital. The osmolality of each sample was determined at baseline and after supplementation with HMF at 10 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours at room temperature and 24 hours at 4 oC in a refrigerator. Results: The mean osmolalities (SD) of human milk and HMF dissolved in sterile water were 285. 3 (3. 3) mOsm/kg H 2 O and 64. 6 (0. 7) mOsm/kg H 2 O, respectively. Thus, the expected osmolality of human milk after supplementation with HMF was 349 mOsm/kg H 2 O.
