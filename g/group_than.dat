After Havelock joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, along with several other members of the League, he was pressured by his superiors at the University to curtail his political activity. He did not, continuing to act as an ally and occasional spokesman for Underhill and other leftist professors. He found himself in trouble again in 1937 after criticising both the government's and industry's handling of an automotive workers' strike. Despite calls from Ontario officials for his ouster, he was able to remain at Victoria College, but his public reputation was badly damaged.|$|E

Some observers felt that the personable Booth would have been more popular among the playing <b>group</b> <b>than</b> Simpson, while others thought that he would not have been hard-nosed enough in pursuing his team's competitive interest. While Simpson was known for being relentlessly hard-nosed, he was also abrasive and sometimes irritated others by making derogatory comments towards teammates. Booth again ran daily fitness classes during the voyage, and on this occasion, Simpson made them compulsory for the players. Booth started the tour well, scoring 109 not out in his third match for the summer, against Surrey. He passed 50 three more times before the start of the Tests, when his form waned.|$|E
5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age <b>group</b> <b>than</b> the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} hemofiltration on lactate level in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Hemofiltration increases the lactate level. The study included 283 patients classified into two groups: Hemofiltration group (n =  138), hemofiltration was done during CPB. Control group (n =  145), patients without hemofiltration. The lactate elevated in <b>group</b> H <b>than</b> <b>group</b> C (P <  0. 05), and the PH showed metabolic acidosis in group H (P <  0. 05). The mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased in <b>group</b> H <b>than</b> <b>group</b> C (P <  0. 05). The number of transfused {{packed red blood cells}} was lower in <b>group</b> H <b>than</b> <b>group</b> C (P <  0. 05). The hematocrit was higher in <b>group</b> H <b>than</b> <b>group</b> C (P <  0. 05). The urine output was lower in <b>group</b> H <b>than</b> <b>group</b> C (P <  0. 05). Hemofiltration leads to hemoconcentration, elevated lactate level and increased inotropic support. There are some recommendations for hemofiltration: First; Hemofiltration should be limited for patients with impaired renal function, positive fluid balance, reduced response to diuretics or prolonged bypass time more than 2 hours. Second; Minimal amount of fluids should be administered to maintain adequate cardiac output and reduction of priming volumes is preferable to maintain controlled hemodilution. Third; it should be done before weaning of or after cardiopulmonary bypass and not during the whole time of cardiopulmonary bypass...|$|R

METHODS: A total of 192 patients with circumferential mixed hemorrhoids were randomized into the treatment group, where they underwent Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy with anal cushion suspension and partial internal sphincter resection, or the control group, where traditional external dissection and internal ligation were performed. Postoperative recovery and complications were monitored. RESULTS: The time to wound healing was 12. 96 1; 2. 25 d in the treatment <b>group</b> shorter <b>than</b> 19. 58 1; 2. 71 d {{in the control group}}. Slight pain rate was 58. 3 % in the treatment <b>group</b> higher <b>than</b> 22. 9 % in the control group; moderate pain rate was 33. 3 % in the treatment <b>group</b> lower <b>than</b> 56. 3 % in the control group severe pain rate was 8. 4 % in the treatment <b>group</b> lower <b>than</b> 20. 8 % in the control group.
