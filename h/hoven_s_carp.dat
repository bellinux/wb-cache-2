40|$|AbstractUncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) is of {{demonstrated}} {{importance in}} mammalian thermogenesis, and early hypotheses regarding {{the functions of}} the newly discovered UCP homologues, UCP 2, UCP 3 and others, have focused largely on their potential roles in thermogenesis. Here we report the amino acid sequences of two new UCPs from ectothermic vertebrates. UCPs from two fish species, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and carp (Cyprinus carpio), were identified in expressed sequence tag databases at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. cDNAs from a C. carpio ‘peritoneal exudate cell’ cDNA library and from a D. rerio ‘day 0 fin regeneration’ cDNA library were obtained and fully sequenced. Each cDNA encodes a 310 amino acid protein with an average 82 % sequence identity to mammalian UCP 2 s. The fish UCP 2 s are about 70 % identical to mammalian UCP 3 s, and 60 % identical to mammalian UCP 1 <b>s.</b> <b>Carp</b> and zebrafish are ectotherms – they do not raise their body temperatures above ambient by producing excess heat. The presence of UCP 2 in these fish thus suggests the protein may have function(s) not related to thermogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Carp (Cyprinus carpio), {{which is}} thought to have {{originated}} from central Asia, is the world’s oldest aquacultured fish. In Japan, farmers have cultured carp in paddy fields for nearly two thousand years, particularly in inland areas, such as in Nagano, Gunma and Akita Prefectures, which have been traditionally characterized by a lack of animal protein resources. Since the 1960 <b>s,</b> <b>carp</b> production, particularly in Lake Kasumigaura in Ibaraki Prefecture, has been accelerated by new developments in artificial feed and net-pen aquaculture technology. Culture levels peaked in 1977, when total annual production was about 30, 000 tons. Subsequently, with the diversification of people’s food preferences and product availability, total production decreased gradually in accordance with lower demand and depressed prices. As a consequence, total annual production of cultured carp reached a low of 9, 949 tons in 2001. While, nishikigoi (koi) have been bred as ornamental fish since the Edo Era in the 18 th century. Nowadays, koi shows and contests are important activities inside of Japan, and koi traded is conducted throughout the country. International trading is also being actively promoted, and these fish are well-known and admired in many foreign countries. Nishikigoi farms are located in many areas of Japan; 48 % of the farms are found in Niigata Prefecture, followed by Gifu (8 %) and Hiroshima (6. 5 %...|$|R
40|$|Carp {{is widely}} sold {{and used in}} its fresh in Iran, however, {{recently}} a range of value additions may also be observed. It {{is essential to the}} sustainable development of a carp farm to know the production costs and their contribution. Warm-water fish farming is mainly based on common, silver, grass and bighead carp and the common carp and the three Chinese species are often reared in poly culture in Iran. Since, the 1970 <b>S</b> <b>carp</b> farming has spread around the Caspian coast and farmed production reached a peak in 2006 with production of more than 73, 400 tons. A study of production, costs and profitability of carp farming sector was carried out to help clarify carp production costs and their difference with location in 2001. A total of 101 farms from the three main carp farming provinces, Guilan, Mazandaran and Khuzestan were randomly selected, classified and studied. The results of the survey showed that the various producer provinces have different cost structures. Overall, feed and fertilizer with the highest level of variation accounted for 23 % of total costs, followed by seed and labor and salary with 23 and 17 %, respectively. On average, benefit-cost ratio and the rate of farm income were closely related to location. This result suggests that farmers practice more efficiently and have better conditions in Mazandaran, followed by Guilan province...|$|R

Ultrastructural observations revealed cell disruption and highly vacuolated cytoplasm in the thymus. Of the cells that remained intact {{there was a significant}} increase in thrombocytes after 48 h exposure to the pollutant. In addition, there was a decrease in lymphocytes following exposure to ammonia at both time-periods studied. In contrast the pronephros of fish exposed to the pollutant underwent relatively mild changes in cellular architecture although ammonia and time of exposure had significant effects on the proportions of several leucocyte types. A significant decrease in neutrophils, thrombocytes and lymphocytes occurred in fish exposed to the pollutant for 168 h. Pronephric lymphocyte stimulation (cpm) by Con A and PWM increased in vitro, whereas the stimulation index was reduced in infected fish exposed to ammonia.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{summarizes}} recent {{observations of}} silver carp, Hypopthalmichthys molitrix, in small wetlands of the Lower Mississippi River and suggests management actions for their control based on wetland hydrology and pattern of fish movements. BACKGROUND: The history and biology of silver carp in North America have been summarized previously by Robison and Buchanan (1988), Pflieger (1997), and Ross (2001). In 1973, the species {{was brought to}} the United States from Asia by a private fish farmer to control algae blooms in Arkansas aquaculture ponds. By the late 1970 <b>s,</b> silver <b>carp</b> were cultured or stocked at 10 facilities in the state, and by 1980 were reported in natural waters presumably from flooding. The fish now inhabit the Mississippi River and its tributaries from Illinois to Louisiana. In their natural range, silver carp spawn at temperatures of 18 °C, during rising water, in large rivers, with high velocities (> 70 cm/s), and extensive free-flowing reaches (100 km). In the United States, spawning occurs in large rivers and flooding allows silver carp to move freely from one location to another. Under some circumstances, silver carp can become isolated in smaller water bodies when low-water stages strand them in off-channel habitats. Silver carp inhabit river channels, backwaters, lakes, reservoirs, and open waters. Self-sustaining populations were discovered in 1995 with the capture of young-of-the...|$|R
40|$|Since their {{introduction}} in the 1970 <b>s,</b> Silver <b>Carp</b> Hypophthalmichthys molitrix {{have spread}} throughout the Mississippi River basin. Management of any species relies on an accurate understanding of population characteristics and dynamics. However, Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation is unknown. Sampling during periods of peak catch rates would facilitate Silver Carp assessment and management, improving monitoring and removal techniques. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate adult Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation with boat electroshocking and trammel nets. Silver Carp were collected monthly (April–October) during 2014 and 2015 from four locations in the Des Moines River, Iowa. Trammel nets rarely captured Silver Carp (mean ± SE = 4. 9 ± 1. 6 fish/net; 60 % of fish were captured in 6. 3 % of net sets) and therefore were not included in analyses. Electroshocking catch rates (CPUEs) exhibited a bimodal distribution, with peak CPUEs generally occurring in May, June, and September and lower catch rates observed during July and August. Catch rates were positively related to river discharge at upstream sites but not at downstream sites. Silver Carp size structure was similar among months and sites except at Cliffland, where fish were smaller during August and October compared to earlier in the year. Finally, Silver Carp condition peaked during April and May and decreased throughout the year except at Keokuk, where peaks were observed during both May and August. Although spatiotemporal variability was substantial, these results suggest that sampling of Silver Carp via electroshocking in May–June and September–October generally produces higher catch rates compared to July–August sampling and generates a more representative size structure. Using site-specific knowledge, monitoring and surveillance programs could more effectively sample during these periods of high vulnerability and densities in order to manage the spread and impacts of Silver Carp at statewide and regionwide scales...|$|R
40|$|Allozyme {{analyses}} of carp gudgeons (Hypseleotris) from five {{sites in the}} lower River Murray revealed three distinctive taxa designated HA, HB and HC, diagnosable from one another by fixed differences at 3 – 5 loci, and three apparent F 1 hybrid forms, HA¥HB, HA¥HX and HB¥HX, where HX denotes a taxon not sampled in its ‘pure’ form. Of all fish sampled, 25 % were hybrids, although only one hybrid form was found at any one site, and never in company with both parental taxa. No hybrids involving HC were found, although {{this was the most}} common taxon, and no HA¥HB hybrids were present at the one site of demonstrated sympatry between the parental taxa. Morphological analysis and the lack of introgression confirm that HA, HB, and HC are distinct biological species. Partial meristic data suggest that HC corresponds to H. klunzingeri <b>s.</b> l., ‘Midgley’s <b>carp</b> gudgeon’ is a composite of HA, HB and HA¥HB hybrids, and ‘Lake’s carp gudgeon’ may be a composite of HX and one of its hybrids (HB¥HX).

40|$|Israeli {{aquaculture}} {{began in}} the 1920 <b>s,</b> with common <b>carp</b> monoculture. This was followed by polyculture of carp with tilapias, grey mullet, and planktivorous carp. Scientific research on polyculture started in the 1950 s and has since contributed to the global science and practice of green water aquaculture, especially with novel polyculture approaches and concepts. Today, the industry is characterized by intensive freshwater polyculture, implemented in earthen fish ponds and reservoirs. In the Mediterranean coastal plain, fresh, brackish, and marine water polyculture is carried out in semi-intensive fishponds. Polyculture in Israel is an entrepreneurial activity that combines ecological principles of Chinese polyculture with local technologies and objectives. The Biofloc approach (active suspension ponds, ASP), periphyton, and aquaponics, were developed in the 1980 s in response to rising public and policymakers’ concerns and regulations on land use, pollution, use of chemicals, and organic manures. R&D on marine integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems {{began in the}} early 1970 s at the National Center for Mariculture (NCM) in Eilat. It started with sea bream and mullet in earthen seawater ponds, whose plankton-rich water recirculated through bivalve and macroalgae biofiltration modules. An advanced form of the concept was deployed in the early 1980 s and was studied in detail using nutrient budgets. Several system models with fish, bivalves, and algae, on small and pilot scales, were studied and quantified. Abalone, sea urchins, shrimp, brine shrimp, Salicornia, and periphyton, were added to the Eilat marine IMTA models, beginning in the 1990 s. Upon entering the third millennium, Israeli research further examined the relationship between the sustainability and economics of IMTA in world aquaculture...|$|R
40|$|A {{partial survey}} {{was made of}} the bird life in the {{vicinity}} of Pony Lake, located about 15 miles south of Newport, in portions of sections 17 - 20, T 28 N, RI 7 W, Rock County. Pony Lake was reportedly named according to a legend from 2 ̆ 2 early days 2 ̆ 2 when a native American was thrown and killed on its banks by a wild pony (Perkey, 1982). Originally Pony Lake was reported to be 20 feet deep (lake history based on conversations and observations of Jerry Schoenenberger). In the late 1800 s, possibly 1900 - 1910, a town site was platted on the southwest corner of the lake. Construction included a lumberyard and dance pavilion. There was also a dock for a sail boat on which rides were given. About 1910, Orley Peterson purchased the lots and surrounding land from the various owners and developed a ranch headquarters at the site of Lake City. The post office was established 8 June 1910. In the early teens, Oscar Peterson and his sons would annually plow a fire break from Pony Lake northeast toward Otter Lake. Then one spring day they shoveled out a short way between the lake {{and the end of the}} fire break, draining Pony Lake to its present level. It was said that the water ran out for two years. The post office was discontinued 15 August 1929. In 1934 Pony Lake went totally dry from the drought. Corn was planted in the lake bottom in 1936. When Chester Schoenenberger moved to Pony Lake from Newport in 1947, he wore four-buckle overshoes while hunting pheasants all over the lake. Pony Lake refilled in the late 1940 s and early 1950 s, then in 1956 was nearly dry. Ducks were more plentiful then than I have ever seen since. Fish have been in the lake in varying amounts and species through the years. Since the lake is ditched to the northeast, it eventually connects with the Elkhorn River. Fish make their way up the ditch during high water periods. Pony Lake was almost all covered with vegetation after it refilled in the late 1950 <b>s.</b> Then <b>carp</b> came up from the Elkhorn, and today there is such a large population of carp, that the only vegetation is cattails and bulrushes around the perimeter. The water is very muddy and there is almost no food, i. e. duckweed, for waterfowl. The maximum water depth currently is about five feet. The lake bottom which was originally white sand has become silted in to a depth of 18 to 24 inches in some places. Pony Lake is about 330 acres in size with a mean recorded depth of about 24 inches and a maximum depth of about 36 inches (McCarraher, 1977) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduced in the 1960 s and 1970 <b>s,</b> Grass <b>Carp</b> (Ctenopharyngodon idella), Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and Bighead Carp (H. nobilis), collectively called Asian Carp in the US, have {{invaded the}} Mississippi River Basin and are {{expanding}} their range, threatening ecosystem integrity. Impounded sections on the Upper Mississippi River associated with lock and dams may be poor habitats for reproduction and recruitment {{due to their}} lentic flow characteristics and perceived lack of adequate spawning habitat. However, tributaries connected to the impounded sections possess several requirements needed for successful spawning and observations of adults are becoming more prevalent. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the reproductive status of Asian Carp populations in these tributary systems. Models have been created to determine the thermal and hydrologic suitability of rivers for reproduction. However, these models focus on the general feasibility of reproduction in a river and do not attempt to pinpoint river locations best suited for adult spawning. Furthermore, efforts to confirm areas of current establishment have largely relied upon the detection of early life stages. However, discrepancies and lack of information on morphological egg characteristics of Asian Carp and native species has made traditional visual identification of fish eggs difficult and unreliable. Therefore, the overarching goal of this thesis {{was to provide a}} set of tools to predict, identify, and analyze Asian Carp reproduction. The three main objectives to achieve this goal were to develop an egg identification tool that could identify Asian Carp eggs preserved in ethanol, to determine reproductive dynamics in three tributary rivers connected to the mainstem Upper Mississippi River, and to develop a GIS model to predict the most likely locations for Asian Carp reproduction in the Des Moines River. Results demonstrate that a combination of morphometric measurements from genetically identified ethanol preserved eggs in a random forests classification model was a good alternative for Asian Carp (Bighead, Grass and Silver carps combined) egg identification. Back calculated spawn dates of Asian Carp eggs and larvae collected in the Des Moines, Iowa and Skunk rivers suggest that peak spawning occurs during late May and June, coinciding with a substantial decrease in adult GSI and increase in post spawn females; however, spawning occurred as late as August. Egg and larval spawn dates were within the spawning optimum when water temperatures were 18 to 30 ÃÂ°C and channel velocities were 0. 7 m/s or higher. Spawning occurred on rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph at 24 and 48 h intervals, indicating a rising hydrograph was not necessary for spawning. Densities of eggs and larvae were higher in the downriver section compared to the upriver section within each tributary during both years. Densities among tributaries were similar in 2014 and but were significantly higher in the Des Moines River than the Iowa and Skunk rivers during 2015. Densities among the three confluence sites were similar for the Iowa and Skunk during each year. However, densities among sites associated with the Des Moines River confluence were higher in the mainstem Upper Mississippi River in 2014 and higher in the tributary site near the mouth in 2015. Back-calculated drift distances of eggs indicated reproductive GIS models were able to predict reproduction areas in the upper portions of the lower Des Moines River but were less successful at identifying areas where reproduction was documented in the lower portions. Collectively, this thesis documents the first observations of Asian Carp spawning in Upper Mississippi River tributaries in Iowa. Back calculated drift distances of eggs, spatiotemporal variation in egg and larval densities, and adult reproductive assessments suggest that Asian Carp reproduction may be ubiquitous throughout some tributaries, such as the Des Moines River; however, reproductive concentration varies annually. Asian Carp reproduction and subsequent establishment in the Upper Mississippi River tributaries could provide sources of recruitment for the impounded sections of the Upper Mississippi River and other areas of poor reproduction, further expanding Asian Carp distribution in the US...|$|R
