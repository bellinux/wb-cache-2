50|$|Conductance is also {{a useful}} concept {{in the design and}} study of vacuum systems. Such systems consist of vacuum {{chambers}} and the various flow passages and pumps that connect and maintain them. These systems are common in physical science laboratories and many laboratory appratus as well, such as mass spectrometers. Typically, the pressures inside these devices are low enough that the gas inside them is rarefied, meaning here that the mean free path of constituent atoms and molecules is a non-negligible fraction of the dimensions of orifices and passageways. Under those conditions, the total mass flow through an orifice or conduit is typically linearly proportional to the pressure drop, so that it is convenient to quantify mass flow in terms of the <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> of the constituent components.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that formation of inhibition zones by bonded restorations in artificially-induced carious dentin lesions {{is related to the}} permeability of the self-etch adhesives. METHODS: <b>Fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> of four single-step self-etch adhesives (Prompt L-Pop, Etch&Prime 3. 0, One-Up Bond F and Reactmer Bond), and a control two-step self-etch adhesive (UniFil Bond) were measured after sound dentin surfaces were:(1) acid-etched; (2) polished to produce smear layers; (3) bonded with the adhesive; each at 20 cm hydrostatic pressure (hp). Osmotic <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> was also determined for the bonded dentin after immersion in 4. 8 M CaCl 2 at 0 cm hp. For artificial caries inhibition, a non-fluoride releasing (NFR) two-step self-etch adhesive (UniFil Bond) and a fluoride-releasing (FR) single-step adhesive (Reactmer Bond) were used in combination with a NFR composite (Metafil CX) or a FR restorative material (Reactmer Paste). Artificial caries were induced in these restorations, from which 120 +/- 10 microm thick sections and the effect of caries inhibition were quantitatively assessed with polarizing light microscopy and image analysis. RESULTS: <b>Fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> after bonding with the single-step adhesives Prompt L-Pop and Etch&Prime 3. 0 were not significantly different from those recorded from smear layer-covered dentin. Although better seals were achieved with One-Up Bond F and Reactmer Bond, <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> at 20 cm hp was significantly higher than the two-step self-etch adhesive UniFil Bond. Osmotic conductance at 0 cm hp were not significantly different from normal <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> at 20 cm hp. The sizes of artificial carious lesions in UniFil Bond were significantly higher irrespective of whether a FR or NFR composite was used. Significant reduction in lesion size occurred in Reactmer Bond {{with the use of a}} NFR composite, and even more so with the use of a FR composite. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Severe malaria {{can trigger}} acute lung injury {{characterized}} by pulmonary edema resulting from increased endothelial permeability. However, the mechanism through which lung <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> is altered during malaria remains unclear. To define {{the role that}} the scavenger receptor CD 36 may play in mediating this response, C 57 BL/ 6 J (WT) and CD 36 -/- mice were infected with P. berghei ANKA and monitored for changes in pulmonary endothelial barrier function employing an isolated perfused lung system. WT lungs demonstrated a > 10 -fold increase in two measures of paracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> and a decrease in the albumin reflection coefficient (σalb) compared to control lungs indicating a loss of barrier function. In contrast, malaria-infected CD 36 -/- mice had near normal <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> but a similar reduction in σalb. In WT mice, lung sequestered iRBCs demonstrated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To determine whether knockout of CD 36 could protect against ROS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, mouse lung microvascular endothelial monolayers (MLMVEC) from WT and CD 36 -/- mice were exposed to H 2 O 2. Unlike WT monolayers, which showed dose-dependent decreases in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) from H 2 O 2 indicating loss of barrier function, CD 36 -/- MLMVEC demonstrated dose-dependent increases in TER. The differences between responses in WT and CD 36 -/- endothelial cells correlated with important differences in the intracellular compartmentalization of the CD 36 -associated Fyn kinase. Malaria infection increased total lung Fyn levels in CD 36 -/- lungs compared to WT, but this increase was due to elevated production of the inactive form of Fyn further suggesting a dysregulation of Fyn-mediated signaling. The importance of Fyn in CD 36 -dependent endothelial signaling was confirmed using in vitro Fyn knockdown as well as Fyn-/- mice, which were also protected from H 2 O 2 - and malaria-induced lung endothelial leak, respectively. Our results demonstrate that CD 36 and Fyn kinase are critical mediators of the increased lung endothelial <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> caused by malaria infection...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} on {{thermal contact}} conductances of metallic contacts {{have been reported}} here. The studies are restricted to relatively low contact pressure: hardness ratios (< 0. 7 × 10 ^- 3) where very little data exist. These results have applications in situations like some types of electrical contacts, cooling of electronic components, contacts in instruments and highpower semiconductors. Results show that the behaviour is considerably different from what happens in high-pressure contacts, due to the increased importance of gap <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> at low pressures. This {{is not the case}} at higher interface pressures where the dominant mechanism is the solid spot conductance. The study shows that the correlations developed for highpressure cases cannot be used for low-load conditions.

We hypothesize that non-rinsing, simplified, one-step self-etch adhesives are effective for minimizing dentin permeability after tooth preparation procedures. Crown preparations in vital human teeth were sealed with Adper Prompt, Xeno III, iBond, or One-Up Bond F. Epoxy resin replicas were produced from polyvinyl siloxane impressions for SEM examination. Dentin surfaces from extracted human teeth were bonded with these adhesives {{and connected to}} a fluid-transport model for permeability measurements and TEM examination. Dentinal fluid droplets were observed from adhesive surfaces in resin replicas of in vivo specimens. In vitro <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> of dentin bonded with one-step self-etch adhesives was either similar {{to or greater than}} that of smear-layer-covered dentin.

30|$|Forced {{convective}} heat transfer from a vertical circular tube conveying deionized (DI) water or very dilute Ag-DI water nanofluids (less than 0.02 % volume fraction) in a cross flow of air {{has been investigated}} experimentally. Some experiments have been performed in a wind tunnel and heat transfer characteristics such as thermal conductance, effectiveness, and external Nusselt number has been measured at different air speeds, liquid flow rates, and nanoparticle concentrations. The cross flow of air over the tube and the liquid flow in the tube were turbulent in all cases.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} intracoronal bleaching agents on the sealing properties of different intraorifice barriers and root filling materials. Study Design: The root canals of extracted human premolars (n= 180) were prepared by using System GT rotary files and filled with either gutta-percha+AH Plus or Resilon+Epiphany sealer. In both groups, the coronal 3 mm of root filling was removed and replaced {{with one of the}} following materials applied as intraorifice barriers (n= 30 /group) : 1. ProProot-MTA; 2. Conventional Glass ionomer cement; and 3. Hybrid resin composite. In each subgroup, intracoronal bleaching was performed using either sodium perborate with distilled water or 35 % hydrogen peroxide gel for 3 weeks. The leakage of specimens was measured using fluid-filtration and dye penetration tests. The data were analyzed statistically with One-way ANOVA, Repeated Measures t-test and Independent Samples t-test (p= 0. 05). Results: The <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> values of the test groups were not influenced by the type of the bleaching agent, the intraorifice barrier, or the root filling material (all p> 0. 05). However, the extent of dye leakage was significantly affected by the type of intraorifice barrier material (p resin composite > ProRoot-MTA (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: The effect of 35 % hydrogen peroxide gel or sodium perborate/distilled water on the sealing properties of tested intraorifice barriers and root filling materials varied conforming leakage assessment.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare nanoleakage {{patterns}} of an unfilled (OS; One-Step), a 6 wt% spherical silica-filled (OSs; One-Step Plus) and a 15 wt% glass-filled (OSg) {{version of a}} two-step, acetone-based self-priming adhesive. Permeability of bonded dentin treated with OS and OSs was also examined. METHODS: Deep, coronal dentin from extracted third molars were etched and bonded using these adhesives. One-mm thick sections were immersed in 50 wt% ammoniacal silver nitrate (pH 9. 5) for 24 hours. Unstained, undemineralized sections were examined by TEM. The permeability of dentin bonded with OS and OSs were investigated at 20 cm of H 2 O hydrostatic pressure and compared with the osmotic conductance determined with 4. 8 M CaCl 2 at zero hydrostatic pressure. Composite-dentin beams bonded with OS, OSs and OSg that were fractured after microtensile bond testing were examined by SEM. RESULTS: Two types of nanoleakage patterns were recognized along the resin-dentin interfaces. The reticular type consisted of discontinuous islands of silver deposits and was exclusively seen in hybrid layers. The spotted type consisted of isolated silver grains and was evident throughout the hybrid and adhesive layers in OS. These two patterns were seen to variable extents in the two filled adhesive versions OSs and OSg and their distribution was independent of one another. OS and OSs bonded dentin were permeable to fluid filtration. However, part of this fluid movement {{was due to the}} permeability of the adhesive layer, as demonstrated by osmotic <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> in the absence of hydrostatic pressure.

40|$|Using simple, finite-time, {{thermodynamic}} {{models of}} {{solar thermal power}} plants, {{the existence of an}} optimal solar receiver temperature has previously been demonstrated in literature. Scant attention has been paid, however, to the presence of an optimal level of solar concentration at which the conversion of incident sunlight to electricity (solar-to-electric efficiency) is maximized. This paper addresses that gap. The paper evaluates the impact, on the design of Rankine-cycle solar-trough and solar-tower power plants, of the existence of an optimal receiver temperature and an optimal level of solar concentration. Mathematical descriptions are derived describing the solar-to-electric efficiency of an idealized solar thermal plant in terms of its receiver temperature, ambient temperature, the receiver irradiance (radiation striking unit receiver area), solar receiver surface to working <b>fluid</b> <b>conductance,</b> condenser conductance, solar collector efficiency, convective loss coefficients and radiative loss coefficients. Using values from the literature appropriate to direct-steam and molten-salt plants, curves of optimal solar receiver temperature, and optimal solar-to-electric conversion efficiency, are generated as a function of receiver irradiance. The analysis shows that, as the thermal resistance of the solar receiver and condenser increases, the optimal receiver temperature increases whilst the optimal receiver irradiance decreases. The optimal level of receiver irradiance, for solar thermal plants employing a service fluid of molten salts, is found to occur within a range of values achievable using current solar tower technologies. The tradeoffs (in terms of solar-to-electric efficiency) involved in using molten salts rather than direct steam in the case of solar towers and solar troughs are investigated. The optimal receiver temperatures calculated with the model suggest the use of sub-critical Rankine cycles for solar trough plants, but super-critical Rankine cycles for solar tower plants, if the objective is to maximize solar-to-electric efficienc...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} the three commercially available colloid solutions, 6 % dextran 70, 6 % hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 200 / 0. 5, and 3. 5 % urea-linked gelatin on permeability for human albumin in a skeletal muscle in vivo model by evaluating their effects on the reflection coefficient for albumin. DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Eighteen adult cats. INTERVENTIONS: The autoperfused and denervated calf muscles of the cat hindlimb were placed in a plethysmograph. The transvascular fluid absorption induced by an increase in the colloid osmotic pressure following a fixed intravenous bolus of human albumin was analyzed, first before start of, and then during an intra-arterial infusion to, the muscle preparation of the synthetic colloid to be analyzed. Capillary filtration coefficient as a measure of microvascular <b>fluid</b> permeability (<b>conductance)</b> was analyzed before and after start of the synthetic colloid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Arterial blood flow, arterial and venous blood pressures, total vascular resistance, tissue volume changes, capillary filtration coefficient, and plasma volume were measured before and during the colloid infusion. According to the Starling fluid equilibrium, the ratio between the reflection coefficients for albumin on two occasions (before and after infusion of the synthetic colloid) can be calculated from the maximum osmotic absorption rates induced by a fixed intravenous bolus infusion of albumin and from the capillary filtration coefficients. Obtained data were adjusted for different plasma volume at the two occasions. We found that none of the three synthetic colloids analyzed had any significant effect on the reflection coefficient for albumin. CONCLUSION: An effect on albumin microvascular permeability of the synthetic colloids dextran 70, HES 200 / 0. 5, and urea-linked gelatin could not be shown by a method analyzing their effect on the reflection coefficient for albumin...|$|R

This suggests that dedicated pump sampling of ground water in the aquifer may not be representative of the chemistry of the waste plumes migrating southwest of the nuclear facilities. Natural background Cs in basalt-aquifer ground water of this part of the Snake River Plain aquifer is less than 325 µS/cm (microSiemans/cm), and total dissolved solids in mg/L units, (TDS) ≈ 0. 6 Cs).

At the time of logging (9 / 14 / 93) the 1115 µS/cm water was flowing down the well, mixing with less concentrated waters and exiting at 600 or 624 -ft depth. Waste water disposed of down the injection well at ICPP until 1984 was estimated to have a Cs) of 1140 µS/cm, identical to the water detected in logging.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) for light water nuclear power reactors {{was the subject}} of lengthy, controversial and technically complex hearings conducted by the AEC over the two years from 1971 through 1973. An independent, objective review and assessment of the technical issues associated with ECCS effectiveness was conducted in a study performed at the Environmental Quality Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. The review was based upon the testimonies and supporting technical documentation of the principal participants in the hearings: the AEC, utilities, reactor manufacturers, and intervenors. From the review, the critical technical parameters influencing ECCS performance, which were at issue, are identified. Of fifteen parameters cited by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safety in the hearings as being of unproved conservatism, essentially all are reviewed in detail, including, for example, the initial stored fuel energy, fuel rod gas gap <b>conductance,</b> <b>fluid</b> flow rates through broken pipes, metal-water reaction energy release and fuel rod embrittlement, reflood/core-spray heat transfer, and reflooding rates, as well as the adequacy of ECCS analytical models and numerical methods.,The relative influence of uncertainties in the performance criteria associated with these parameters is assessed. Based upon the relative importance of these parameters, alternative responses to resolution of the ECCS problem are analyzed. The importance of the core reflooding rate in resolving the technical issues of the problem is emphasized. The conservatism of the proposed criteria (current and past) is reviewed. Recommendations are made for improvements in criteria conservatism, especially in the establishment of minimum reflood heat transfer rates (or alternatively, reflooding rates). Several new and/or accelerated research programs and additional large scale testing programs are also recommended.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Sweet corn (Zea mays L.) yields in the Willamette Valley of Oregon {{have been}} declining {{since the early}} 1990 ’s. Studies were done to {{determine}} if there is a relationship between ear weight and several disease parameters including necrotic crowns or stalk nodes, nodal root rot, radicle root rot, and sub-crown internode rot. Regression analysis indicated that plants with more necrotic crown tissues have lower ear weights and crown necrosis was the best predictor of ear weight at harvest. Fungal isolations from crown tissues indicated that presence of Fusarium oxysporum was associated with more necrotic crowns and lower ear weights. Fusarium verticillioides was also associated with darker crowns and nodes. <b>Fluid</b> <b>conductance</b> tests indicated that plants with darker stalk nodes had a reduction in fluid passage through a 30 -cm stalk section. Isolates of several species of Fusarium were examined for their ability to cause crown and stalk node rot in two field and two greenhouse trials. Seed kernel inoculation with F. oxysporum and F. verticillioides resulted in plants with darker crowns and lower ear weights, although differences were not always significant. Both of these fungi were recovered from crown tissues of the majority of mature corn plants sampled in pathogenicity trials. It was also observed that seed kernel inoculation with these Fusarium species resulted in plants having greater root damage attributed to the western spotted cucumber beetle (WSCB), Diabrotica undecimpunctata undecimpunctata. Studies were conducted to determine if the beetles show feeding or oviposition preferences when sweet corn plants were grown from kernels inoculated with Fusarium species. Generally, plants grown from Fusarium-treated kernels had significantly more leaf-feeding injury of corn seedling from adult WSCB compared to the disinfested control. Plants grown from Fusarium-treated kernels were also found to have increased larval root feeding in field pathogenicity trials. It appears that sweet corn ear yield reductions in the Willamette Valley is at least partly attributed to crown and stalk node rot incited by Fusarium species, and WSCB injury could be compounded with Fusarium injury, causing further stress of diseased sweet corn plants when these beetles are present...|$|E
