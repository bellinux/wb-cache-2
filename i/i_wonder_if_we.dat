500|$|The {{polar group}} {{continued}} towards the Pole, passing Shackleton's Furthest South (88Â°23'S) on [...] Seven days later, about [...] from their goal, Amundsen's black flag was spotted {{and the party}} knew {{that they had been}} forestalled. They reached the Pole the next day, [...] 1912: [...] "The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected... Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here" [...] Scott still hoped to race Amundsen to the telegraph cablehead in Australia: [...] "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can do it." [...] However, on 18 January 1912 they discovered Amundsen's tent, some supplies, a letter to King HaakonVII of Norway (which Amundsen politely asked Scott to deliver) and a note stating that Amundsen had arrived there with four companions on [...] 1911.|$|E
2500|$|The rations were {{deficient}} in B and C vitamins. The party became weaker {{a few weeks}} after reaching the pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing [...] "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [...] <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Thompson's {{opinion of}} the {{legislation}} changed and he conceded it had not worked as planned, saying [...] "I'm not prepared to go there yet, but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't just take off the limits and have full disclosure with harsh penalties for not reporting everything on the Internet immediately." [...] Thompson {{thought that it was}} right to do away with soft money, that it was right to raise the limits on hard money, but that the limitation on political speech within 30 or 60 days of an election was wrong and the spending limits by outside groups are not working and they both should be repealed.|$|E
5000|$|This {{song was}} {{straight}} up. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should even {{put it on}} the record because it's just so honest and brutal - brutal in the fragile sense. Katy Steele ...|$|R
60|$|The morning came, {{and like}} one under the {{influence}} of some hideous nightmare I became aware that the savages were loosening the rawhide thongs. Faintly, with but little curiosity regarding the matter, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to be killed at once, regardless of the usual customs of such wretches.|$|R
40|$|This {{recreation}} {{was inspired}} by the famous mathematical discovery of S. Ulam: if the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 [...] . are arranged in a spiral on a square grid, unexpected diagonal patterns appear when one looks at the prime numbers. What happens, <b>I</b> <b>wondered,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> do a similar thing with the alphabet, or other sequences of letters, and look for words instead of numbers...|$|R
2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! But <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I have an idea. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> dare----I have a friend, sort of {{a distant}} cousin, who married her a husband at Winklehurst, on the Palisades, not very far from the ferry. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> couldn't make her invite us both for dinner? Of course, she'll want to know all about you; but we'll be mysterious, and {{that will make it}} all the more fun, don't you think? I do want to prolong our jaunt, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Light a fire?--ah, yes.... <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could manage. This {{is an odd}} coincidence--and awkward!' he murmured. 'Very well, light a fire.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You old honeymooner! Say, I've got an idea. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> couldn't {{sneak in}} {{a look inside}} {{of one of these}} bungalows. Let's try this door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a {{dangerous}} man," [...] Payne said thoughtfully. [...] "Pat, you came near being a----ass that day. Anyway, it's {{time we went}} in, and as Larry's here <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> saw Courthorne again before the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear {{there are}} no oysters hereabouts," [...] said Hayward, [...] "but <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to find mussels {{and things of that}} sort. Come, lads, we'll go and have a search for them, while the ladies fill and boil our kettle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that's certain. But these fellows {{have done}} it to me again and again. <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> got one to-night in the very same way. I'm sure, {{by the look of}} these rascals, that they would do {{anything}} of a reckless, stupid nature just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{cases are}} awfully heavy. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can't hide them somewhere {{and come back}} for them later? The snow is not melting, so that won't hurt them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I declare, I don't {{know what}} to do, Crippy," [...] he said, as he seated himself on a {{doorstep}} with the goose by his side, and looked mournfully {{up and down the}} street. ,. <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> hadn't been more'n half-way 'round the city in all this time, an' yet we hain't seen any of uncle Robert's folks.

6000|$|... "What he needs," [...] commented Beth, [...] "is to {{get away}} from himself, and mingle with people more. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could coax him to join us in our ride to Point Loma." ...|$|E

40|$|Are you chromatically in tune? <b>I</b> often <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{realize just}} {{what it means to}} be out of tune with color.

60|$|A {{cold wave}} went over me, like that {{unreasonable}} change and chill with {{which a man}} far from home fancies his house has been burned down, or that those dear to him are dead. For one horrible moment at least <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{had come to the}} end of compromise and comfortable nonsense, and if at last the successful stupidity of England would topple over like the successful wickedness of Prussia; because God is not mocked by the denial of reason any more than the denial of justice. And I fancied the very crowds of Jerusalem retorted on me words spoken to them long ago; that a great voice crying of old along the Via Dolorosa was rolled back on me like thunder from the mountains; and that all those alien faces are turned against us to-day, bidding us weep not for them, who have faith and clarity and a purpose, but weep for ourselves and for our children.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} that upon this particular morning I was troubling indirectly about Mariposilla, thinking that perhaps her daily association with Sidney {{might not be}} for the best. I had not then dreamed of inhuman exertions {{on the part of}} the Sandersons to entrap the child. <b>I</b> simply <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were wise to expose the beautiful, immature girl to the constant, flattering attentions of an impossible young man.|$|R
