Through {{the course of time}} the developing and changing theatre found its place at schools as a part of art. It is important for teaching students in terms of learning styles. Visual and auditory styles are mostly used in our educational system. Unluckily a lot of students are of <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>type</b> who learn more by experience. Drama techniques make learning to these students much easier as they use movement and learning through experience. Despite all the good qualities theatre has, there are still minor difficulties in the Slovenian educational system because the theatre has not acquired a special place in it as some other arts have. So teachers use this teaching technique merely if they want. Good practices of teachers who use drama techniques at schools are also presented in my work. Theatre in Slovenia is present at almost all schools all over the country in the form of drama club. Attending these activities is optional for students. In this theoretical part I also investigate the similarities of teachers’ and actors’ profession who have quite a lot in common. The second part of my master thesis is empirical and again divided into two parts. In the first part the study is focused on students who attend the drama club. Various authors have noted different influences of theatre. In this way I have checked the impact the theatre has on cooperation and communication of all participants. My study includes 11 students. A mentor of a drama club was also a great help. The results of my study have shown that theatre connects the students and encourages them to cooperate. It turned out that role playing students use standard language and non verbal elements, which become better from performance to performance through lesser usage of slang. Besides the students I also asked for their opinion the Slovenian teachers by questionnaires in my second investigation. They expressed their views on using drama techniques in classes and on drama club, too. On one hand my supposition that teachers use drama techniques in classes very rarely turned out to be wrong. But on the other hand the supposition that teachers organize performances in classes very rarely turned out to be true. The majority of the teachers who answered the questionnaire say that drama club is an excellent activity. ...|$|E
