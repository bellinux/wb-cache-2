5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} <b>judges</b> have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that <b>judges,</b> who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi <b>judges</b> come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi <b>judges</b> and almost all senior <b>judges</b> come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior <b>judges</b> will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove <b>judges</b> that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E

5|$|After a {{successful}} appeal by the British, <b>judges</b> reversed {{the result of}} the match, granting Sarah Stevenson two points for a final round kick to her opponent's head which the <b>judges</b> had previously missed.

5|$|Cleveland {{nominated}} 41 lower {{federal court}} <b>judges</b> {{in addition to}} his four Supreme Court justices. These included two <b>judges</b> to the United States circuit courts, nine <b>judges</b> to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 <b>judges</b> to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed <b>judges</b> to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.|$|E

5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the <b>Judges</b> had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark <b>Judges</b> during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file <b>judges,</b> or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular <b>Judges</b> would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other <b>judges</b> even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
