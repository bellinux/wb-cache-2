Santer stated: [...] "I just think everyone did brilliantly tonight—the cast, the crew, everyone. It's everything I wished for and more. I'm thrilled with how it went. It was quite remarkable. Everything went to plan. <b>I</b> <b>spotted</b> a couple of little wobbles but what I was proudest of was the recovery. The technical crew, the cast—every time we maybe veered slightly off course, they pulled it back round." [...] Santer explained that he had always intended for Stacey to be revealed as Archie's killer, and was never tempted to air a different conclusion, despite at least ten characters having strong motives. Turner {{was surprised to learn}} that Stacey was the killer, and hoped that viewers would sympathise with her character, observing: [...] "She not only has to deal with the guilt of what she did but she also knows that she's inadvertently responsible for Bradley's death. I think that's going to hurt her more than anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, <b>I</b> <b>spotted</b> her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E

30|$|If {{electricity}} is supplied to spot j via <b>spot</b> <b>i,</b> {{then it is}} necessary to restore <b>spot</b> <b>i</b> before restoring <b>spot</b> j. Namely, a restoration team cannot start operating spot j, but they may wait at spot j until the restoration of <b>spot</b> <b>i</b> is completed. We denote this by i≺j. Notice that (V,≺) is a strictly partially ordered set (or strict poset), where V is the set of damaged spots. In our application, we can assume that the Hasse diagram of the poset is a directed forest (see Fig. 8 in Section 4). Moreover, the whole damaged area is divided into multiple areas in advance, and each restoration team has their area of responsibility. For any pair (i,j), i≺j implies that <b>spots</b> <b>i</b> and j are located in the same area.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the first}} time in the series Richie Benaud won the toss and took the unusual step of putting England into bat, but he had four fast bowlers in his team and wanted to use them in the humid, {{swinging}} conditions. In the second over Ray Lindwall's first ball swung away and Trevor Bailey was caught first ball by Alan Davidson in third slip to give him his 216th Test wicket and equal Clarrie Grimmett's Australian record. Just before the Test Bailey had given a talk to the inmates of HMP Pentridge and had been asked if he had ever been out first ball in a Test match. He said he had not, but retained his sense of humour as he ordered roast duck for dinner after his dismissal. Peter May fell to Meckiff and England were 13/2, but Peter Richardson made a dogged 68 by forgoing his favourate deflections through the slips which had cost his wicket so many times. He added 48 with Colin Cowdrey (22) and 48 again with Tom Graveney (19), taking the score to 109/3. Tom Graveney was dismissed by Benaud; [...] "I remember him getting me out in the 1958–59 Melbourne Test by attacking my leg stump. He bowled me two half-volleys, the first of which I drove hard to Colin McDonald at mid-on. The second was just a fraction slower, and I was committed to the stroke before <b>I</b> <b>spotted</b> it. McDonald held the catch and the critics put it down to another casual shot from Graveney. They did not seem to notice the crafty part that Benaud had played in my dismissal". Ted Dexter was out first ball to Meckiff (2/57), Roy Swetman for 1 off Davidson and Richardson was caught and bowled by Benaud to leave England 128/7. Debutant John Mortimore showed his all round skills with an unbeaten 44, adding 63 with Fred Trueman (21) before Benaud (4/43) and Davidson (3/38) finished off the innings for 205 early on the second day.|$|E

40|$|The major {{hot spot}} of {{transposon}} Tn 5 insertion in plasmid pBR 322 (hot <b>spot</b> <b>I)</b> {{is in the}} promoter for the tetracycline resistance gene (tet). We {{made a series of}} pBR 322 derivatives with mutations in and around this promoter and assayed their effects on insertion of Tn 5 into hot <b>spot</b> <b>I.</b> Those mutations which reduced transcription from the tet promoter also reduced the frequency of insertion into hot <b>spot</b> <b>I.</b> Transcription and translation of tet are thought to cause the formation of paired domains of negative and positive supercoiling in pBR 322. An amber codon in tet, 345 base pairs from hot <b>spot</b> <b>I,</b> decreases the negative supercoiling of the DNA segment containing hot <b>spot</b> <b>I</b> because it terminates translation of tet prematurely. We report here that this amber mutation also reduces insertion into hot <b>spot</b> <b>I.</b> These results suggest that the ability of Tn 5 to insert into its major hot spot in pBR 322 depends directly on negative supercoiling of the target DNA...|$|R

40|$|A {{posterior}} modeling {{approach for}} on-orbit breakup, named ASSEMBLE (ASemi-Stochastic Environment Modeling of Breakup in LEO), is proposed. The main objectives {{of this paper}} are the statistical characterization of the orbital and physical parameters of the fragments generated by a non-orbit breakup. The analysis of two line element (TLE) data of the fragments of some fragmentation events, such as the Indian PSLV-TES rocket body breakup, showed their orbital parameters obey statistical distributions. The apogee or perigee height, limited by breakup altitude, and the inclination follow Laplace distributions, while the eccentricity a Lognormal distribution. Subsequently, suitable empirical relations in the literature help to expand the fragmentation scenario to mass, effective area, and ballistic coefficient. Lastly, the simulation of well-known historical breakups of (<b>i)</b> <b>SPOT</b> <b>I</b> rocket body,(ii) COSMOS 1813, (iii) STEP II rocket body, and (iv) CBERS I/ SAC Iprovide further confidence in the present model for orbital debrisstudies...|$|R
