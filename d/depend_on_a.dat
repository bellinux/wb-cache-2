5|$|Like the Tom Swift, Jr. series, {{the series}} portrays Tom as a {{scientist}} {{as well as an}} inventor whose inventions <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> knowledge of theory. The series differs from previous versions of the character, however, in that Tom's inventive genius is portrayed as problematic and sometimes dangerous. As Robert Von der Osten argues, Tom's inventions for this series often have unexpected and negative repercussions.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the fate}} of Laos did not <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} solution in the air or {{on the ground in}} Laos and could only be decided by the outcome in Vietnam, winning the war against the DRV in northern Laos was not the objective. Instead, maintaining access to the country was paramount and keeping the Royal Lao government in power became the primary objective.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E

5|$|Leg before wicket (lbw) {{is one of}} {{the ways}} in which a batsman can be {{dismissed}} in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman's body (except the hand holding the bat). The umpire's decision will <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E
5|$|Using the Big Bang model it is {{possible}} to calculate the concentration of helium-4, helium-3, deuterium, and lithium-7 in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen. The relative abundances <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single parameter, the ratio of photons to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of CMB fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for /, about 10−3 for /, about 10−4 for / and about 10−9 for /.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. This {{is the result of}} a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E
5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and marbled newts <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{landscape that}} offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts {{are much more}} difficult to detect and observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern marbled newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, the quality of the surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.|$|E
5|$|When {{targeting}} livestock, {{the spotted}} hyena primarily preys upon cattle, sheep and goats, though hyenas {{in the southern}} parts of Ethiopia's Tigray region preferentially target donkeys. Reports of livestock damage are often not substantiated, and hyenas observed scavenging on a carcass may be mistaken for having killed the animal. The {{rate at which the}} species targets livestock may <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> number of factors, including stock keeping practices, the availability of wild prey and human-associated sources of organic material, such as rubbish. Surplus killing has been recorded in South Africa's eastern Cape Province. Attacks on stock tend to be fewer in areas where livestock is coralled by thorn fences and where domestic dogs are present. One study in northern Kenya revealed that 90% of all cases of livestock predation by hyenas occurred in areas outside the protection of thorn fences.|$|E

5|$|Further {{regulation}} of the Columbia's flows was necessary to make the new power plant feasible. Water storage and regulation projects in Canada would be needed, {{as well as a}} treaty resolving the many economic and political issues involved. The Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers explored alternatives that would not <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> treaty with Canada, such as raising the level of Flathead Lake or Pend Oreille Lake, but both proposals faced strong local opposition. The Columbia River Treaty, which had been discussed between the U.S. and Canada since 1944, was seen as the answer. Efforts to build the Third Powerplant were also influenced by competition with the Soviet Union, which had constructed power plants on the Volga River that were larger than Grand Coulee. On , 1964, the Columbia River Treaty was ratified and included an agreement by Canada to construct the Duncan, Keenleyside, Mica Dams upstream and the U.S. would build the Libby Dam in Montana. Shortly afterward, Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson, who was influential in constructing the new power plant, announced that Reclamation would present the project to Congress for appropriation and funding. To keep up with Soviet competition and increase the generating capacity it was determined that the generators could be upgraded to much larger designs. With the possibility of international companies bidding on the project, the Soviets who had just installed a 500MW hydroelectric generator on the Yenisei River indicated their interest. To avoid the potential embarrassment of an international rival building a domestic power plant, the Department of the Interior declined international bidding. The Third Powerplant was approved and its appropriation bill was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on , 1966.|$|E
