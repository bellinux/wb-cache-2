40|$|This Article gives a fresh {{perspective}} on the perennial issue of the dearth of effective <b>global</b> <b>securities</b> rules. It argues that the disparate <b>global</b> <b>securities</b> definitions are a critical, but often overlooked, issue in <b>global</b> <b>securities</b> regulations. After all, the <b>global</b> trade in <b>securities</b> developed and grew exponentially {{in the last three}} decades without a securities treaty or effective <b>global</b> <b>securities</b> rules largely because there is no global consensus on what securities are or how best to regulate them. The stark differences between the U. S. Definition of a “security” and its foreign counterparts inspired this Article. Accordingly, it singles out and holistically compares the notoriously broad U. S. federal securities laws definition of a “security” with its foreign counterparts in four major global financial jurisdictions. In doing so, this Article illustrates {{the nature and extent of}} the disparate <b>global</b> <b>securities</b> definitions. Furthermore, this Article highlights areas of harmonizing <b>global</b> <b>securities</b> definitions. It concludes that the U. S. Definition is too broad, rigid, and obsolete relative to its foreign counterparts, recent global financial market developments, and trends in <b>global</b> <b>securities</b> definitions. Finally, it offers a harmonized U. S. Definition of a “security. ...|$|R

5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Australian {{government}} had increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While {{most of these}} deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards. The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the ADF's force structure and role, with the new government's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia's <b>global</b> <b>security</b> interests. In line with this new focus, the ADF's force structure changed {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E

25|$|Global {{justice is}} the {{paramount}} to <b>global</b> <b>security,</b> because injustice {{can lead to}} feelings of anger, humiliation, and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional self-interest and that protecting humans’ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people {{feel that they have}} been the victim of unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, justice and not just military power, is essential to maintaining <b>global</b> <b>security.</b> Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often feel that they are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current status quo are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.|$|E
