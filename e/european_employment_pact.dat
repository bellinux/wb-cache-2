The Report lacks a systematic overview of the consequences of the proposed tax reform for allocation and distribution. Therefore, the Council missed a chance to influence the coming tax legislation. The report does not mention or underestimates the implications of important developments in the EC, e. g. the EC-Employment Pact, the government conference on reforming the EC-institutions and certain important aspects of EC Competition Policy for the German banking system.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} EU {{governance in}} the social policy field, in particular the following sub-issue areas: health and safety policy, the social dialogue process, and the <b>European</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Pact.</b> The quality of governance in these sub-issue areas is assessed using the indicators suggested by Wolfgang Wessels' fusion thesis: binding outputs, institutional growth, procedural differentiation, the presence of intermediary groups, and the transfer of competencies. This paper suggests that the fusion thesis needs to be complemented by further indicators {{in order to assess}} the quality of governance [...] . different levels of both fusion and diffusion exist in the sub-issue areas of social policy. Health and safety policy has a high degree of fusion, but recent framework directives illustrate that diffusion may be much lower than might be expected. The social dialogue exhibits high levels of both fusion and diffusion, but only along narrow, issue-specific bands. The EEP possesses low levels of fusion but high levels of diffusion. EU governance {{in the social}} policy field indicates that integration cannot be captured by measuring binding outputs, or even by the proliferation of actors and institutions at the EU level, but must be accompanied by an assessment of normative indicators and their application in member states...|$|E

" [author's abstract]In den 90 er Jahren kam es in praktisch allen europäischen Automobilwerken zum Abschluss von Kollektivvereinbarungen über Beschäftigung und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Ziel war die Schaffung oder Sicherung von Arbeitsplätzen und die Verbesserung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit eines Betriebs oder Unternehmens im eigenen und gegenüber fremden Konzernen. Der Verfasser stellt zwei Ansätze zur Analyse solcher Pakte vor und behandelt ausgewählte betriebliche Beschäftigungspakte in der europäischen Kraftfahrzeugindustrie. Er analysiert diese Vereinbarungen und diskutiert Implikationen für die Arbeitsbeziehungen. Der Verfasser kommt zu dem Schluss, dass diese Beschäftigungspakte eine neue Form kollektiv-konsensualer Arbeitsbeziehungen darstellen, mit der das Beschäftigungsverhältnis dem Imperativ des gemeinsamen Wettbewerbserfolgs unterworfen wird.

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>employment</b> {{strategy}} {{initiated in}} 1997 is critically {{dependent upon the}} further integration of women into the labor market. The European Union has set a specific target employment rate for women of 60 percent by 2010 and is also committed to providing more and better child care facilities. This gender focus {{is reinforced by the}} requirement for gender mainstreaming in all aspects of <b>European</b> <b>employment</b> policy. There is an implied Europe-wide, universal policy of encouraging female labor-market participation and reducing the care work performed by domestic labor. However, the European Commission continues to have limited competence in areas of family, social, and welfare policy. As a result, these common employment objectives for women are thus being pursued against a background of quite different systems of social, family, welfare, and indeed labor-market organization. These systems have different economic and employment implications, such that the outcomes of the common <b>European</b> <b>employment</b> strategy will also be highly variable.

Nonetheless, while spending in training schemes is featured by an apparent institutional and financial poverty, the educational reform needs time to produce its effects. The multinomial logit analysis of labour market participation on YUSE data suggests that educational qualification and work experience are the most important determinants of employability.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{concepts}} of flexicurity and mobication which were Coined {{in the context of}} <b>European</b> <b>Employment</b> Strategy.

However, since Leehman Shock in 2008 flexicurity has been criticized severely. Flexicurity policies are considered ineffective in the midst of serious economic crisis. Instead, mobication started to garner attention. Mobication means mobility for education for all people, inside and outside the labor market. The paper analizes arguments concerning flexicurity and defines the significance of mobication in the context of <b>European</b> <b>Employment</b> Strategy. In addition, the paper looks into the employment problems and policies in Japan from the viewpoint of flexicurity and mobication...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is solely to address two {{interlinked}} methodological and theoretical questions concerning the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), using the <b>European</b> <b>Employment</b> Strategy as a case: First, what is the most appropriate approach to learning in the analyses of the processes of the <b>European</b> <b>Employment</b> Strategy (EES) ? Second, how is mutual learning processes diffused among the Member States? In answering these two questions the paper draws on a social constructivist approach to learning thereby contributing to the debate about learning in the political science literature. At the same time, based on this concept of learning, it is concluded that the learning effects of the EES are probably somewhat larger than what is normally suggested, but that successful diffusion still depends on a variety of contextual factors. ...|$|R
