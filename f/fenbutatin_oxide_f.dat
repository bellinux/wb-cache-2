40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effects of two insecticides (deltamethrin and acetamiprid), and an acaricide (<b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide)</b> on diversity and abundance of mite fauna in replicate experiments carried out in an openeggplant field in Latakia, Syria. Each pesticide was applied three times with an interval of three weeks between two consecutive applications. Two phytophagous mites were observed in all treatments: Tetranychus urticae and olyphagotarsonemus latus. However, the number of predatory mite species (in particular Phytoseiidae) was different according to the pesticide applied and the lowest number observed was in the <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> treatment. This acaricide caused high mortality of T. urticae, decreased the abundance of P. latus, and negatively affected Phytoseiidae. Acetamiprid and deltamethrin induced the resurgences of T. urticae (3. 5 -fold and 1. 5 -fold for the former and the latter respectively). The abundance of P. latus was not affected by acetamiprid but by deltamethrin. The results clarified also that these insecticides seemed harmless to Phytoseiidae [i. e. Phytoseiulus persimilis, Phytoseius finitimus and Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) recki].

The residual action was evaluated at 2 hours and 1; 3; 5; 7; 10; 14 e 21 days after treatment. Ten adult females of N. californicus were transferred to each ring, together with an enough amount of Tetranychus urticae nymphs and adults to feed the predator. Mortality evaluations were performed at 72 hours after treatment. Bioassays indicate that the pesticides: acrinathrin, deltamethrin, dinocap, sulphur, fenpropathrin, <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> and propargite were innocuous to N. californicus.

40|$|The two-spotted {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae Koch is a {{worldwide}} pest, feeding on a large variety of plant families. As its resistance to acaricides spreads rapidly, {{it is crucial to}} develop new biological control tactics to manage its populations. In this respect, essential oils may be a good alternative, as they are currently considered minimumrisk pesticides. In this paper, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments to determine the susceptibility of adult females to 31 essential oils extracted from plants collected from Tunisia and compare it with the results obtained with two synthetic acaricides (spirodiclofen and <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide).</b> Details of the essential oil yield of these plants were also recorded. A maximum yield of 0. 5 % was obtained. Laboratory bioassay indicated that the development of the tetranychid mite population was significantly affected by the use of Deverra scoparia, Haplophyllum tuberculatum, Chrysanthemum coronarium and Mentha pulegium plant extracts that killed 97 %, 93 %, 93 % and 91 % of T. urticae, respectively. The chemical composition of the most effective extracts were characterized by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and fast GC-flame ionization detector (FID).

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to analyze the}} action of some acaricides, fungicides, {{insecticides}} and herbicides containing different active ingredients on Metarhizium anisopliae Metsch. (Sorokin) inoculated into autoclaved soil. The action of the pesticides was evaluated based on the fungal respiratory activity. The first assessment was done at 48 h after inoculation. The pesticides were then added and respiratory activity was determined nine times every 48 h and an additional five times every 4 days. Except for the fungicides, no significant effect (P > 0. 05) of the pesticides on M. anisopliae was observed. A reduction in CO 2 production was observed for the mancozeb treatment from day 4 to day 6 of incubation, and for tebuconazol between days 4 and 6, 8 and 10, and 32 and 36. The same was observed for copper oxychloride between days 10 and 12 and 32 and 36, and for chlorothalonyl between 8 and 10, 10 and 12, and 32 and 36 days of incubation. Identical effect occurred for the acaricides abamectin and <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide,</b> with a reduction in CO 2 production between 20 and 24 days of incubation. The herbicides glyphosate, trifluralin and ametrin reduced the respiratory activity of the fungus between days 10 and 12, while the insecticide trichlorfon reduced respiratory activity only from 32 to 40 days of incubation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Reversion of {{resistance}} to the organotin (OT) acaricide cyhexatin was documented for the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Koch), by laboratory isolation of a field resistant colony. After 22 generations of no selection the colony reverted back to susceptible. Studies were conducted in 1985 and 1986 on susceptible and resistant T. urticae to test whether relative fitness differences were responsible for OT reversion. Susceptible colonies had significantly shorter developmental times. In addition, a field susceptible strain had a higher female to male sex ratio, and percent survival (egg to adult) than the field resistant strain. These differences are assumed to contribute to reversion in laboratory isolated resistant colonies. The effect of immigration on organotin resistance was also investigated. An immigration (dilution) experiment revealed that dilution {{of resistance}} allowed a moderately resistant colony to revert to susceptible in ca. three generations. In the field several tactics for managing OT resistance were investigated. Formulation differences (i. e. wettable powder verses flowable) of cyhexatin and <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> were found to have an effect on efficacy. In addition cyhexatin efficacy was improved when organotin selection to a population of T. urticae from southern Oregon pear was reduced by substitution of an acaricide to which mites were not cross-resistant. Abamectin (avermectin B 1) was substituted for cyhexatin in 1984 and 1985 in an orchard block harboring resistant mites in 1983. After two years of relaxed selection a standard organotin treatment was reapplied to the abamectin treated block. Better control was achieved with cyhexatin in the abamectin block than in a block that had been continuously treated with cyhexatin over the same two year period. This suggests that reducing selection pressure, by substituting the noncross-resistant compound, allowed resistance to revert in the field. These results suggest a possible mechanism by which organotin resistance in T. urticae may be managed...|$|R

Methods Data were obtained from 895 members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study at age 32. The effects of sex, height, weight, lung function indices, smoking, atopy, asthma and rhinitis on F E NO were explored by unadjusted and adjusted linear regression analyses. Results The effect of sex on F E NO was both statistically and clinically significant, with F E NO levels approximately 25 % less in females. Overall, current smoking reduced F E NO up to 50 %, but this effect occurred predominantly in those who smoked {{on the day of the}} F E NO measurement. Atopy increased F E NO by 60 %. The sex-related differences in F E NO remained significant (p E NO. Conclusion Even after adjustment, F E NO values are significantly different in males and females. The derivation of reference values and the interpretation of F E NO in the clinical setting should be stratified by sex. Other common factors such as current smoking and atopy also require to be taken into account. </p...|$|R
40|$|With the {{upcoming}} {{availability of the}} next generation of high quality orbiting hyperspectral sensors, a major step toward improved regional soil mapping and monitoring and delivery of quantitative soil maps is expected. This study focuses on the determination of the prediction accuracy of spectral models for the mapping of common soil properties based on upcoming EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) satellite data using semi-operational soil models. Iron <b>oxide</b> (<b>Fed),</b> clay, and soil organic carbon (SOC) content are predicted in test areas in Spain and Luxembourg based on a semi-automatic Partial-Least-Square (PLS) regression approach using airborne hyperspectral, simulated EnMAP, and soil chemical datasets. A variance contribution analysis, accounting for errors in the dependent variables, is used alongside classical error measurements. Results show that EnMAP allows predicting iron oxide, clay, and SOC with an R 2 between 0. 53 and 0. 67 compared to Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) /Airborne Hyperspectral System (AHS) imagery with an R 2 between 0. 64 and 0. 74. Although a slight decrease in soil prediction accuracy is observed at the spaceborne scale compared to the airborne scale, the decrease in accuracy is still reasonable. Furthermore, spatial distribution is coherent between the HyMap/AHS mapping and simulated EnMAP mapping as shown with a spatial structure analysis with a systematically lower semivariance at the EnMAP scale...|$|R
40|$|The Eastern Harbor (EH)), a small shallow semicircular basin, is {{influenced}} by sewage disposal from Alexandria City. This study deals with regional distribution of total copper (TCu) and it species in the sediments of this polluted harbor. The high TCu content adjacent to the harbor’s opening reflects the effect of untreated sewage discharges {{and that of the}} boatyard area resulted from antifouling paints. The TCu data indicate the increase in metal concentrations by a factor of~ 10 during the last decades, confirming the effect of increased sewage discharges into this area, causing health problems. A five step sequential extraction technique was used to describe the chemical association of copper with major sedimentary phases; exchangeable (F 1), carbonates (<b>F</b> 2), Fe/Mn <b>oxides</b> (<b>F</b> 3), organic/sulfides (F 4), and residual associations (F 5). The Cu fractions in the EH’s sediments decreased in the following order: F 5 > F 4 > F 3 > F 2 > F 1. The distribution pattern of these fractions is mostly controlled by the mineral composition of sediments and the anthropogenic wastes introduced to the study area. The low association of copper with F 1 confirms that metal was low in the soluble form. The higher value of F 2 {{at the center of the}} EH coincided with abundance of the biogeni...|$|R
40|$|Electronic noses (e-noses), {{artificial}} sensor systems generally {{consisting of}} chemical sensor arrays {{for the detection}} of volatile compound profiles, have potential applications in respiratory medicine. We assessed within-day and between-day repeatability of an e-nose made from 32 sensors in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We also compared between-day repeatability of an e-nose, fraction of exhaled nitric <b>oxide</b> (<b>F</b> ENO) and pulmonary function testing. Within-day and between-day repeatability for the e-nose was assessed in two breath samples collected 30 min and seven days apart, respectively. Repeatability was expressed as an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). All sensors had ICC above 0. 5, a value that is considered acceptable for repeatability. Regarding within-day repeatability, ICC ranged from 0. 75 to 0. 84 (mean = 0. 80 ± 0. 004). Sensors 6 and 19 were the most reproducible sensors (both, ICC = 0. 84). Regarding between-day repeatability, ICC ranged from 0. 57 to 0. 76 (mean = 0. 68 ± 0. 01). Sensor 19 was the most reproducible sensor (ICC = 0. 76). Within-day e-nose repeatability was greater than between-day repeatability (P < 0. 0001). Between-day repeatability of FENO (ICC = 0. 91) and spirometry (ICC range = 0. 94 - 0. 98) was greater than that of e-nose (mean ICC = 0. 68). In patients with stable COPD, the e-nose used in this study has acceptable within-day and between-day repeatability which varies between different sensors. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} biosolid {{incorporation}} on arsenic distribution in Mollisol soils in central Chile was studied. Two soils were sequentially extracted for arsenic with a five-step method {{that accounts for}} the following arsenic forms: non-specifically adsorbed (F 1), specifically adsorbed (F 2), amorphous and poorly crystallized Fe and Al oxides (H), well-crystallized Fe and Al <b>oxides</b> (<b>F</b> 4) and residual (F 5). The arsenic residual fraction was predominant in Pintue soil, whereas in Graneros soil, arsenic was mostly associated to amorphous Fe and Al oxides. Graneros soil exhibited a higher As(V) adsorbing capacity than Pintue soil, which relates to the higher clay and iron and aluminum oxides contents, confirming that these components participation {{is essential for the}} adsorption of this metalloid. Biosolid application at a rate of 100 Mg ha(- 1) caused an increase in arsenic bound to amorphous Fe and Al oxides and in the residual fraction, in Pintue soil. When Pintue soil was spiked with arsenic, aged for two months, and treated with biosolid (100 Mg ha(- 1)), the content of arsenic in the most labile fractions decreased, thus showing a favorable effect in its application to soils with few specific sites for arsenic adsorption. Arsenic speciation was carried out in the first two fractions of the sequential extraction procedure. As(V) was the main form in both fractions. Biosolid incorporation at a rate of 100 ha(- 1) hat caused a significant increase in organic arsenic forms...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Asthma is a {{worldwide}} problem. It cannot be prevented or cured, {{but it is}} possible, at least in principle, to control asthma with modern management. Control usually is assessed by history of symptoms, physical examination, and measurement of lung function. A practical problem is that these measures of control {{may not be in}} agreement. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe agreement among different measures of asthma control in children. METHODS: A prospective sequential sample of children aged 4 to 11 years with atopic asthma attending a routine follow-up evaluation were studied. Patients were assessed with the following four steps: (1) fraction of exhaled nitric <b>oxide</b> (<b>F</b> ENO), (2) spirometry, (3) Childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT), and (4) conventional clinical assessment by a pediatrician. The outcome for each test was coded as controlled or uncontrolled asthma. Agreement among measures was examined by cross-tabulation and k statistics. RESULTS: Eighty children were enrolled, and nine were excluded. Mean F ENO in pediatricianjudged uncontrolled asthma was double that of controlled asthma (37 parts per billion vs 15 parts per billion, P,. 005). There was disagreement among measures of control. Spirometric indices revealed some correlation, but of the unrelated comparisons, those that agreed with each other most often (69 %) were clinical assessment by the pediatrician and the cACT. Worst agreement was noted for F ENO and cACT (49. 3 %). CONCLUSION: Overall, different measures to assess control of asthma showed a lack of agreement for all comparisons in this study.

40|$|Abstract Background Airway {{eosinophilia}} {{is considered}} a central event in the pathogenesis of asthma. Eotaxin {{plays a key role}} in selective eosinophil accumulation in the airways and, subsequently, their activation and degranulation. The study was undertaken to evaluate eotaxin- 1 levels in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of asthmatics with different degrees of asthma severity and to establish the possible correlation of these measurements with other recognized parameters of airway inflammation. Methods EBC was collected from 46 patients with allergic asthma (14 with steroid-naïve asthma, 16 with ICS-treated, stable asthma, 16 with ICS-treated unstable asthma) and 12 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of eotaxin- 1 were measured by ELISA. Results In the three groups of asthmatics, eotaxin- 1 concentrations in EBC were significantly higher compared with healthy volunteers (steroid-naïve asthma: 9. 70 pg/ml ± 1. 70, stable ICS-treated asthma: 10. 45 ± 2. 00, unstable ICS-treated asthma: 17. 97 ± 3. 60, healthy volunteers: 6. 24 ± 0. 70). Eotaxin- 1 levels were significantly higher in patients with unstable asthma than in the two groups with stable disease. We observed statistically significant correlations between the concentrations of eotaxin- 1 in EBC and exhaled nitric <b>oxide</b> (<b>F</b> ENO) or serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in the three studied groups of asthmatics. We also discovered a significantly positive correlation between eotaxin- 1 in EBC and blood eosinophil count in the groups of patients with unstable asthma and steroid-naïve asthma. Conclusions Measurements of eotaxin- 1 in the EBC of asthma patients may provide another useful diagnostic tool for detecting and monitoring airway inflammation and disease severity. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{sequential}} extraction method SEDEX (sedimentary extraction) modificated by ANDERSON & DELANEY (2000) {{has been}} used to quantify separately four sedimentary phosphorus reservoirs in sediments of the gulf of Paria and the venezuelan atlantic coast: adsorbed or labile plus P-associated to <b>oxides</b> (<b>F</b> 1), P-authigenic (F 2), P-detrital (F 3) and P-organic (F 4). The marine and continental origin of the sediments was determined by separation of detrital apatite (continental) and carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) of marine origin. The total phosphorus concentrations are low within the gulf of Paria and the atlantic venezuelan coast in comparison with other coastal areas (2. 38 μmol g- 1 to 6. 84 μmol g- 1) and is mainly in detrital form (0. 78 to 4. 61 μmol g- 1). In decreasing order the concentrations are: organic (0. 56 a 2. 47 μmol g- 1), adsorbed or labile phosphorus plus associated oxides (0, 04 to 0. 56 μmol g- 1) > autigenic phosphorus (0. 04 to 0. 31 μmol g- 1). ANOVA statistical tests (P < 0. 05) show discrepancies only in the concentrations of the adsorbed or labile phosphorus plus associated oxides fractions, values being lower in the gulf of Paria. The results suggests that the principal sources are terrestrial lithogenic apatite from eroded material of the orogenic belts of the coastal Andes and Guiana shield and venezuelan and colombian plains which was then carried by waters of the Orinoco river and redistributed there. The organic material contribution of native origin and aloctonal is the second factor that controls the presence of phosphorus in the sediment.

40|$|Sequential {{extraction}} {{procedures were}} used to investigate {{the influence of the}} microbes on the distribution of arsenic in a Chinese paddy soil under different long-term fertilization treatments. The paddy soil with four long-term fertilization treatments (CK, M, NPK and NPK+M) and three levels of arsenate addition (0, 50, 100 mgAs kg(- 1) dry soil), were selected to construct microcosms for laboratory incubation. After the incubation, soil samples were sequentially extracted to determine As in various fractions, i. e. water soluble (170), exchangeable (171), bound to carbonates (F 2), bound to Fe and Mn oxides (173), bound to organic matter and sulfides (F 4), and residual (F 5, mineral matrix). Results showed that most of the As was fixed by mineral matrix (F 5, ratios ranging from 46. 22 % to 96. 37 %), followed by As bound to Fe and Mn <b>oxides</b> (<b>F</b> 3, ratios ranging from 3. 14 % to 28. 18 %), and the ratios of the other four fractions (F 0, F 1, F 2 and F 4) were mostly less than 10 %. The microbes in the paddy soil could make As transform from inactive fraction (175) to relatively active fractions (F 0, F 1, F 2 and 173) and thus increase its environmental risk. With the increase of the As addition levels and with the application of manure or chemical NPK fertilizers, As was distributed more in the relatively active fractions (F 0, F 1, F 2, F 3 and F 4) in the paddy soil mediated by the microbes. In addition, Fe and Mn oxides could {{play an important role in}} decreasing the As leaching potential from the mineral matrix to soil solution and thus abate the As risk to human health.
