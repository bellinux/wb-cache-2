5|$|With {{the rise}} of {{numerous}} regional championships, {{as well as the}} growth in Olympic-style multi-sport events (such as the Commonwealth Games and the Pan-American Games), competitions between international track and field athletes became widespread. From the 1960s onwards, the sport gained more exposure and commercial appeal through television coverage and the increasing wealth of nations. After over <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>of</b> amateurism, the amateur status of the sport began to be displaced by growing professionalism in the late 1970s. As a result, the Amateur Athletic Union was dissolved in the United States and it was replaced with a non-amateur body solely focused on the sport of athletics: The Athletics Congress (later USA Track and Field). The IAAF soon followed suit in 1982, abandoning amateurism, and later removing all references to it from its name by rebranding itself as the International Association of Athletics Federations. The following year saw the establishment of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics—the first ever global competition just for athletics—which, with the Olympics, became one of track and field's most prestigious competitions.|$|E
5|$|The Later Zhou was {{the last}} of the Five Dynasties that had {{controlled}} northern China {{after the fall of the}} Tang dynasty in 907. Zhao Kuangyin, later known as Emperor Taizu (r. 960–976), usurped the throne and deposed the last Zhou ruler Guo Zongxun with the support of military commanders in 960, initiating the Song dynasty. Upon taking the throne, his first goal was the reunification of China after <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>of</b> political division. This included the conquests of Nanping, Wu-Yue, Southern Han, Later Shu, and Southern Tang in the south as well as the Northern Han and the Sixteen Prefectures in the north. With capable military officers such as Yang Ye (d. 986), Liu Tingrang (929–987), Cao Bin (931–999) and Huyan Zan (d. 1000), the early Song military became the dominant force in China. Innovative military tactics, such as defending supply lines across floating pontoon bridges led to success in battle such as the Song assault against the Southern Tang state while crossing the Yangzi River in 974. Using a mass of arrow fire from crossbowmen, Song forces were able to defeat the renowned war elephant corps of the Southern Han on January 23, 971, thus forcing the submission of Southern Han and terminating the first and last elephant corps that would make up a regular division within a Chinese army.|$|E

Ralliart (later Mitsubishi Motors Motor Sports), was Mitsubishi's racing subsidiary, although the company ceased competing formally in 2010.|$|E
25|$|This {{friendship}} was advantageous for the Jewish {{community and}} gave them a respite from the oppressive laws enacted against them. Later kings reversed Shapur's policy of religious tolerance. Under pressure from Zoroastrian Magi and influenced by the high-priest Kartir, Bahram I killed Mani and persecuted his followers. Bahram II was, like his father, amenable to {{the wishes of the}} Zoroastrian priesthood. During his reign, the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the Romans under Emperor Carus, and most of Armenia, after <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>of</b> Persian rule, was ceded to Diocletian.|$|E
25|$|The Swedes {{conducted}} {{a series of}} invasions into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the Deluge.

It became the lifetime task of Charles' son, Charles XI, to rebuild the economy and refit the army. His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden Charles XII, was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet. Sweden's largest threat at this time, Russia, had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training.|$|E

Renowned philosopher Baruch Spinoza was based close to Leiden during this period and interacted with numerous scholars at the university. The learning and reputation of Jacobus Gronovius, Herman Boerhaave, Tiberius Hemsterhuis and David Ruhnken, among others, enabled Leiden to maintain its reputation for excellence down {{to the end of}} the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the penitentiary}} cost {{much more to}} operate than other prisons (nearly $10 per {{prisoner}} per day, as opposed to $3 per prisoner per day at Atlanta), and <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>of</b> salt water saturation had severely eroded the buildings, then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered the penitentiary closed on March 21, 1963. In addition, citizens were increasingly protesting the environmental effects of sewage released into San Francisco Bay from the approximately 250 inmates and 60 Bureau of Prisons families on the island. That year, the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, on land, opened as the replacement facility for Alcatraz.|$|E
25|$|Periodic South Indian invasions, {{especially}} in the 9th century in the reign of Sena I, almost <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>of</b> Cola rule and the subsequent abandonment of the capital, Anuradhapura, led to {{the disintegration of the}} Abhayagiri Vihara. Despite efforts by Vijayabahu I and Parakramabahu I in the 13th century to renovate and resurrect the temple, its gradual destruction in the course of time could not be averted, particularly after the final transfer of the capital from Polonnaruwa in the Rajarata, or King's Country, to an alternative location in 1215 as a result of repeated Maga invasions.|$|E

25|$|Cricket {{has also}} had a hand to play in {{sporting}} diplomacy. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General Zia ul-Haq, attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur – a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions. Furthermore, following a fifteen-year lull in test matches, cricket tours between India and Pakistan were revived in 2004 {{in the wake of}} diplomatic initiatives to bury <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>of</b> mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.|$|E
25|$|The Mongol {{invasion}} of Iran resulted in {{tens of thousands}} of deaths and ruined many cities. The early Mongol invaders were, however, pagans or Buddhists so most of their attention was directed towards Muslims, whom they hated. However, within <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>of</b> the conquest, the leader of the Il-Khanate, Ghazan Khan, became a Muslim, which did not help the status of Zoroastrians in Iran. However, by the time that the Mongols were expelled, Pars province had escaped major damages and the Zoroastrians moved to the North of Pars mainly in the regions of Yazd and Kerman, where even today the main Zoroastrian communities are found.|$|E
25|$|In 29 BC, the Roman Senate {{ordered the}} closure of the doors to the Temple of Janus in the Roman Forum {{for the first time in}} over 200 years.

But the closure could not have been less appropriate. As Dio himself points out, there were ongoing major operations against the Treveri in Gaul, and the Cantabri and Astures in Spain. Furthermore, the closure inaugurated nearly <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>of</b> virtually incessant warfare, as a result of which the Roman Empire assumed the borders it would hold, with a few modifications, for its entire history.|$|E
