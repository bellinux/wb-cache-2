40|$|Seat test {{standards}} require {{human subjects}} {{to be used}} for measuring the vibration isolation of vehicle seats. Anthropodynamic dummies, based on passive mass–spring– damper systems, have been developed for testing seats but their performance has been limited at low excitation magnitudes by non-linear phenomena, such as friction in the mechanical components that provide damping. The use of an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuator</b> to generate damping forces, controlled by feedback from acceleration and force transducers, may help to overcome these limitations and provide additional benefits. The transmissibilities of five foam cushions have been measured using an actively controlled anthropodynamic dummy, in which damping and spring forces were supplied by an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuator.</b> The dummy could be set up to approximate alternative single-degree-of-freedom and two-degree-of-freedom apparent mass models of the seated human body by varying motion feedback parameters. Cushion transmissibilities were also measured with nine human subjects, having an average seated weight similar to the dummy. At frequencies greater than 4 Hz, mean cushion transmissibilities measured with subjects were in closer agreement with the transmissibilities obtained with a two degree-of-freedom dummy than with a single degree-of-freedom dummy. However, at frequencies between 2 and 4 Hz, cushion transmissibilities obtained with the two-degree-of-freedom dummy showed consistently larger differences from mean transmissibilities with subjects than single-degree-of-freedom dummies, indicating a need for further development of human apparent mass models to account for the effects of magnitude and spectral content of the input motion. Vertical vibration isolation efficiencies (SEAT values) of the five foams were measured with four input motions, including three motions measured in a car. The SEAT values obtained using the active dummy were highly correlated with the median SEAT values obtained with the nine human subjects, with the two-degree-of-freedom apparent mass dummy giving the highest agreement...|$|E

Recently it has been noted that a capacitor together with a negative resistance amplifier {{can also be used}} for shunt damping using <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuators</b> with a low cut-off frequency.

This study compares experimental and simulation results of three control approaches obtained with a simple electrodynamic shaker that has a high electrical cut-off frequency: first, proportional current feedback; second, induced voltage feedback estimated with a Wheatstone bridge and third, induced voltage feedback estimated with an Owens bridge which compensates for the inductance of the shaker. The study shows that induced voltage feedback using an Owens bridge results in a negative inductance component that is an appropriate means to obtain vibration damping of a single degree of freedom system.

The decentralized feedback loops are formed by a 3 × 3 array of coil-magnet <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuators</b> that react off the trim panel and a lightweight stiff frame structure {{located in the}} air {{gap between the two}} panels. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers are located {{on the opposite side of}} the trim panel in correspondence to the <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuators.</b> The grid structure is designed to provide an inertial reference to the actuators. In this way the velocity feedback control loops produce skyhook active damping on the double panel, which minimizes the vibrational response and sound radiation of the trim panel at low audio frequencies. Two configurations are considered where the grid structure is either weakly coupled or strongly coupled to the external panel. Both stability and control performance of the two configurations are analyzed experimentally. The study shows that the control configuration with the weakly coupled grid structure enables the implementation of larger stable feedback control gains, which lead to reductions of the sound radiated by the trim panel between 10 and 30 dB for the first seven resonance peaks...|$|R

One principal task consists in steering the system precisely to a prescribed target in minimal time or with minimal energy. To achieve this goal, we formulate an optimal control problem using a dynamical system derived in Zirn [19]. Since Coulombic friction is modelled by a jump function depending on {{the sign of the}} velocity, the optimal control problem belongs the class of nonsmooth optimization problems.

When a feedback control having a gain margin of about 6 dB is implemented, so that there is little control spillover effect around the fundamental resonance of the actuator, reductions of vibration between 5 dB and 10 dB in the frequency band between 80 Hz and 250 Hz have been measured at the control position...|$|E
40|$|For ground {{testing of}} {{controlled}} flexible space structures an active suspension design is proposed to eliminate dynamic reaction {{forces from the}} suspension cables. Thus, supporting only the constant weight forces at the hinges, an approximative dynamic g-compensation is achieved. The principle suspension actuator design is based upon apassive spring bias weight support, augmented by an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuator</b> which eliminates the spring restraint forces about equilibrium. Moving mass reaction forces are compensated for by feedback of a hinge mounted dynamic force sensor output. The salient feature of the voice-coil type actuator is the on- line compensation of the inherent non-linear force-displacement characteristic by a high-speed signal processor. Due to the simple mechanical design the actuator can be easily adapted with respect to range and output force level. Moreover the overall cost is considerably reduced by elimination of complex mechanical adjustment and calibration procedures and by utilization of respective software control instead...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} work {{is presented to}} compare the effect of decentralised velocity feedback control on thin homogeneous and sandwich panels. The decentralised control system consists of five control units, which are composed of a proof-mass <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuator</b> with an accelerometer underneath its footprint and an analogue controller. The stability of the feedback loops is analysed by considering the sensor-actuator open-loop frequency response function of each control unit and the eigenvalues of the fully populated matrix of open-loop frequency response functions between the five sensors and five actuators. The control performance is then analysed {{in terms of the}} time-averaged total kinetic energy and total sound power radiated by the two panels. The results show that for a stiff sandwich panel higher stable feedback gains can be implemented than on a thin homogeneous panel of comparable weight per unit area. Moreover the implementation of decentralised velocity feedback can offset some of the undesirable sound transmission properties of lightweight sandwich structures by efficiently reducing structural vibration and sound power radiation in the mid audio frequency range. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Control units {{comprising}} a proof-mass <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuator</b> and accelerometer-sensor {{pair with}} a time integrator and fixed gain controller are {{an effective way to}} implement velocity feedback control on panels. The control units produce active damping provided the fundamental resonance frequency of the actuator is well below that of the structure under control. Control stability limits arise from the actuator fundamental resonance which introduces a 180 ° phase lag in the control unit response, thus causing the feedback loop to be only conditionally stable. In contrast to previous studies, this paper discusses the response of the control unit in terms of the open and closed-circuit base impedance that it exerts on the structure. This allows for a straight forward physical interpretation of both stability and control performance. Experimental and simulation results show that the base impedance can be described as the sum of passive and active frequency response functions, where the active part of the control unit response depends on the actuator dynamics and also on the response of the analogue controller circuit. It is demonstrated that the control stability could be enhanced by implementing an appropriate compensator that shifts the fundamental resonance of the control units towards lower frequencies...|$|E

The force actuators are controlled by an analog controller that accepts rotor displacement as input. The controller is programmed with experimentally determined feedback coefficients; the output is a control signal to the force actuators. The tests showed that this active control method reduced the rotor resonance peaks due to unbalance from approximately 250 micrometers down to approximately 25 micrometers (essentially runout level).

The aim is to generate active damping {{in such a way}} as to control the low-frequency lightly damped resonances of the panel and thus reduce the sound radiation. It has been shown that collocated direct velocity feedback (DVFB) with ideal point force actuators mounted on a structure generates active damping and is unconditionally stable.

Each control unit consists of a proof-mass <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuator</b> with a velocity sensor at its base. The aim is to design light, simple, robust and low cost control units which can be attached in large numbers to flexible structures in order to control their spatially averaged response and sound radiation at low audio-frequencies. Thus four basic feedback control functions have been studied: (a) proportional, (b) integral (c) derivative and (d) PID. Two types of controllers have been considered which drive the actuators either with current or voltage signals. This paper shows that proportional control loops generate active damping which effectively reduces the frequency averaged response of the plate except at the fundamental resonance frequency of the actuator and at higher frequencies where control spillover effects take place. The PID control loops can mitigate these control spillover problems with no loss of control performance. Finally, integral and derivative control loops are characterized by important stability issues and also produce little control effects since they generate active stiffness and active mass effects which just shift the resonances of the plate structure...|$|E

First, a laboratory test bench consisting of a wheel/suspension/lower suspension A-arm assembly has been developed {{in order to identify}} the vibro-acoustic transmission paths (up to 250 Hz) for realistic road noise excitation of the wheel. Frequency Response Function (FRF) measurements between the excitation/control electrodynamic shakers and each suspension/chassis linkages are used to characterize the different transmission paths that transmit energy through the chassis of the car. Secondly, a FE/BE model (Finite/Boundary Elements) was developed to simulate the acoustic field of an automobile cabin interior. This model is used to predict the acoustic field inside the cabin {{as a response to the}} measured forces applied on the suspension/chassis linkages. Finally, an implemented optimal active control algorithm using a feedforward structure to perform the simulation of an optimal active structural acoustic control (ASAC) by using experimental and numerical FRFs is presented.

The first part of the thesis is focused on the identification of simple and effective single channel feedback control laws. In particular the stability properties and control performance produced by Proportional, Integral, Derivative, PI, PD, PID feedback control laws are assessed with reference to two simple problems where a single degrees of freedom system is controlled by an ideal reactive force actuator and by a practical proof mass actuator.

40|$|Using self-sensing in an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuator</b> for {{broadband}} active {{vibration damping}} requires compensation of the actuator resistance {{and of the}} self-inductance of the actuator with an appropriate shunted circuit. In order to reduce power consumption the actuator resistance should be small, but for robustness of self-sensing and a large bandwidth a large resistance is required. A high transducer coefficient is important to get high sensitivity of the induced voltage that {{is proportional to the}} vibration velocity of an attached mechanical structure. However, a large transducer coefficient implies a strong magnetic field that also increases the self-inductance so that the measurement bandwidth potentially is reduced. In this study, in order to eliminate the first trade-off between power consumption and robustness, an actuator with a primary driving coil and a secondary measurement coil is proposed. The primary coil is optimized for driving by choosing a small resistance, whereas the secondary coil is optimized for sensing by choosing a large resistance. It has been shown that the transformer coupling between the two coils could be reduced by decreasing the cross section of the secondary coil, but there is a geometric limit on the reduction of the cross section of the secondary coil. Therefore an analogue electronic compensation scheme is proposed to compensate for the transformer coupling between the primary and the secondary coil. Feedback of the sensed velocity in the secondary coil is implemented and experimental vibration damping results at a plate are presented.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental studies on decentralised velocity feedback control for thin homogeneous and lightweight sandwich panels. This research {{is motivated by}} the increasing interest in lightweight design for fuel efficient transportation vehicles. Lightweight sandwich panels are very appealing due to their high stiffness to weight ratio but also exhibit undesirable sound transmission properties which could cause problems with vehicle interior noise. The aim of this work is to assess the performance of decentralised velocity feedback control on lightweight sandwich panels. The {{first part of this}} thesis presents the theoretical model used to predict the structural response, sound radiation and sound transmission through active panels with decentralised velocity feedback loops. The model is then used in simulation studies on the intrinsic limitation of decentralised feedback control for thin homogeneous and sandwich active panels under distributed deterministic and stochastic excitations in the whole audio frequency range. The results suggest that decentralised velocity feedback control on lightweight sandwich panels is more efficient and can be applied over wider range of audio frequencies than for conventional thin homogeneous panels. The second part of this thesis presents experimental and simulation studies on a control system with five decentralised control units with proof-mass <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuators,</b> installed on conventional aluminium panel and a honeycomb sandwich panel. This study provides insight in the open and closed-loop response of the control units and gives a good understanding of the interaction between the panels and the control system.

40|$|The era of {{infinite}} storage seems near. To reach it, data storage capabilities need to grow, and new storage technologies must be developed. This thesis studies {{one aspect of}} one of the emergent storage technologies: optimizing electrostatic combdrive actuation for a parallel probe-based data storage system. It is no longer possible to store all created information. New storage technologies must be developed as current commercial technologies reach their fundamental limits. One promising technology is parallel probe-based data storage, using a nanometre-scale probe to write data on a moving platform. The working principle is very similar to that of a record player applied in parallel on the nano scale. In order to access all bits on the storage medium, a nano-positioner, or scanner, is used to move the storage medium relative to the read-out probes. Several nano-positioner designs for probe data storage are found in the literature. It is not clear which actuator type (electromagnetic, electrostatic, or piezoelectric) is most suited for probe data storage. We replaced the <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>actuators</b> by comb-drives in the scanner prototype by IBM, to enable a direct comparison. e comb-drive’s areal efficiency is low, due to a relatively low electrostatic force. e comb-drive finger profile is optimized for probe data storage, for an increased shock resistance. e suitability of electromagnetic and electrostatic actuation is, among others, determined by their energy consumption. Three (partly) hypothetical scanner designs using electrodynamic, electromagnetic and electrostatic comb-drive actuators are described. Their performance is approximately equal, however electrostatic comb-drive actuation requires an order of magnitude less energy. Equations are presented for further investigations into the performance and energy consumption of the different actuation types for different file-system use cases. We succeeded in making music with MEMS structures, and named our microinstrument ‘the micronium’. Due to fabrication inaccuracies, the instrument is outof- tune and requires tuning. Besides teaching students about MEMS technology in a fun way, the micronium succeeded in presenting MEMS technology to a broad audience...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{studies on}} velocity feedback control with an <b>electrodynamic</b> proof-mass <b>actuator.</b> It is {{demonstrated that the}} stability and performance of the feedback loop could be substantially improved by implementing an appropriate compensation filter. In the simulations the control unit is {{described in terms of}} the open and closed-loop base impedance it presents to the structure under control. This allows for a straight-forward physical interpretation of the control system and allows a direct derivation of the expression for the proposed compensator. Studies on the sensitivity of the compensation to uncertainties in the actuator parameters show that even for considerable variations in the actuator response the compensation filter provides significant improvement over the uncompensated case. One draw back of the compensator is the enhancement of the feedback signal at low frequencies. This may lead to stroke/force saturation of the actuator before the optimal control gain can be implemente...|$|R
40|$|Collocated direct {{velocity}} feedback with ideal point force actuators mounted on structures is unconditionally stable and generates active damping. When inertial actuators {{are used to}} generate the control force, the system can become unstable even for moderate {{velocity feedback}} gains due to an additional - 180 ° phase lag introduced by the fundamental axial resonant mode of the inertial actuator. In this study a relative velocity sensor is used to implement an inner velocity feedback loop that generates internal damping in a lightweight, <b>electrodynamic,</b> inertial <b>actuator.</b> Simulation results for a model problem with the actuator mounted on a clamped plate show that, when internal relative velocity feedback is used {{in addition to a}} conventional external velocity feedback loop, there is an optimum combination of internal and external velocity feedback gains, which, for a given gain margin, maximizes vibration reduction. These predictions are validated in experiments with a specially built lightweight inertial actuator. © 2006 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental {{work on a}} velocity feedback control unit with an <b>electrodynamic</b> proof-mass <b>actuator.</b> The study shows that the stability and performance of the feedback control loop can be substantially improved by implementing an appropriate compensation filter, which detunes the passive and active responses of the actuator. The control unit is analysed {{in terms of the}} open- and closed-loop base impedance it presents to the structure under control. In this way the analytical expression for the proposed compensator is derived directly from known actuator parameters. The compensation filter provides significant improvement over the uncompensated case, even for considerable variations in the actuator response. One drawback of the compensator is the enhancement of the feedback signal at low frequencies, which may lead to stroke/force saturation effects in the actuator. In this respect the study shows that it can be beneficial to implement an additional high pass filter, which however produces a loss in the phase and gain margin...|$|R
40|$|Of all {{manipulations}} to {{products in}} industry, planar motion {{is the most}} common. Planar actuators with low maintenance and operation costs and high flexibility are desired. In this paper, the design of an <b>electrodynamic</b> hovering planar <b>actuator</b> is described, starting from the previously designed 1 dimensional hovering actuator. Through simulation of typical configurations of this hovering actuator, and preliminary tests on simplified prototypes, a three phase three coil actuator was selected and a prototype was designed. The construction plans are demonstrated in this paper, and the control methodology for the actuator is explained in detail. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{structure is}} described which was constructed to demonstrate and validate recent emerging technologies {{in the active}} control and identification of large flexible space structures. The configuration consists of a large, 20 foot diameter antenna-like flexible structure in the horizontal plane with a gimballed central hub, a flexible feed-boom assembly hanging from the hub, and 12 flexible ribs radiating outward. Fourteen <b>electrodynamic</b> force <b>actuators</b> mounted to the hub and to the individual ribs provide the means to excite the structure and exert control forces. Thirty permanently mounted sensors, including optical encoders and analog induction devices provide measurements of structural response at widely distributed points. An experimental remote optical sensor provides sixteen additional sensing channels. A computer samples the sensors, computes the control updates and sends commands to the actuators in real time, while simultaneously displaying selected outputs on a graphics terminal and saving them in memory. Several control experiments were conducted thus far and are documented. These include implementation of distributed parameter system control, model reference adaptive control, and static shape control. These experiments have demonstrated the successful implementation of state-of-the-art control approaches using actual hardware...|$|R
