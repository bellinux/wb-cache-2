Since their discovery, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) have remained the standard of care for immunosuppression therapy in liver transplantation, improving both patient and graft survival. However, adverse events, particularly posttransplant nephrotoxicity, associated with long-term CNI use have necessitated the development of alternate treatment approaches. These include combination therapy with a CNI and the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor mycophenolic acid and use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Everolimus, a 40 -O-(2 -hydroxyethyl) derivative of mTOR inhibitor sirolimus, has a distinct pharmacokinetic profile. Several studies have assessed the role of everolimus in liver transplant recipients in combination with CNI reduction or as a CNI withdrawal strategy. The efficacy of everolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy has been demonstrated in both de novo and maintenance liver transplant recipients. A pivotal study in 719 de novo liver transplant recipients formed the basis of the recent approval of everolimus in combination with steroids and reduced-dose tacrolimus in liver transplantation. In this study, everolimus introduced at 30 days posttransplantation in combination with reduced-dose tacrolimus (exposure reduced by 39 %) showed comparable efficacy (composite efficacy failure rate of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death) and achieved superior renal function as early as month 1 and maintained it over 2 years versus standard exposure tacrolimus. This review provides an overview of the efficacy and safety of everolimus-based regimens in liver transplantation in the de novo and maintenance settings, as well as in special populations such as patients with hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence, hepatitis C virus-positive patients, and pediatric transplant recipients. We also provide an overview of ongoing studies and discuss potential expansion of the role for everolimus in these settings.

40|$|Integration between {{levels of}} {{care is not}} {{facilitated}} by the Belgian health system. Indeed, patients have uninhibited access to every level of care, there is no gatekeeping system, and no structural coordination between levels of care. Meanwhile, on one hand, the occurrence of more complex care situations in the ambulatory setting is enhancing the need for coordination while on the other hand, hospitals face financial constraints to provide care in the community. The {{aim of the research}} was to organize coordination between levels of care at the local level, in an urban setting. We used the “Local Health System” model (LHS) that aims at <b>integrating</b> <b>hospital</b> and primary <b>care</b> activities for a defined population at the local level.

Today, AD {{represents one of the}} most socially and economically costly diseases affecting sufferers and their carers alike. Stemming from the scientific strand of Medical Anthropology the present study highlights the social, economic, ethical and institutional problems involved in the care of AD patients. The thesis is divided into two parts: part I provides an updated literature review of research into mental and phisical disorders while focussing on the way society has dealt with them and on various therapeutical approaches. This part also proposes an anthropological reflection on the body and its ageing process as the disease advances. Part II is the result of fieldwork carried out in the province of Sassari. To this aim, families of AD sufferers were interviewed alongside medical staff (including volunteers) at the Centro Sperimentale Alzheimer in Sassari.

Then, the <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> system in Iran {{has been investigated}} from financial, utilization, and quality perspectives. In particular, we examined {{the extent to which}} health care system in Iran protects people from the financial consequence of health care expenses and whether inpatient care distributed according to need. We also empirically analyzed the quality of <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> in Iran using patient satisfaction information collected in a national health service survey. The Iranian health care system consists of unequal access to hospital care; mismatch between the distribution of services and inpatients' need; and high probability of financial catastrophe due to out-of-pocket payments for inpatient services. Our analysis indicates that the quality of <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> among Iranian provinces favors patients residing in provinces with high numbers of hospital beds per capita such as Esfahan and Yazd. Patients living in provinces with low levels of accessibility to <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> (e. g.

40|$|Summary Aim: The {{fragmentation}} of the care delivery system {{and the lack of}} integration along the entire care delivery process can result in avoidable harm to patients as well as expensive inefficiencies and waste to the delivery system. Intermountain Healthcare (IH) Utah - USA has <b>integrated</b> ambulatory and <b>hospital</b> <b>care</b> via its clinical integration programs. After presenting the organizational components of these programs, this paper studies the impact on patient medical utilization and claims expenditure resulting from the degree of participation of the patient's primary provider(s) in the IH clinical integration programs. Methods: This study uses a retrospective quasi- experimental design to follow a cohort of patients and their primary provider(s) longitudinally over 7 years and identify their degree of participation in the IH system. The study group includes patients whose primary provider(s) fully participate in IH clinical integration programs continuously over the study period. The control group includes patients whose primary provider(s) do not participate continuously over the study period. Results: When the patients' primary physician(s) participate(s) continuously in IH programs, the patients have on average one fewer encounter a year and $ 326 or 246 € less in annual expenses. In addition, the rate of health care expenditure growth for these patients is 1 % less a year. Conclusion: This study demonstrates differences in medical utilization and claim expenses based on differences in level of practice participation in IH clinical integration programs.

40|$|Abstract Background Elderly persons {{admitted}} to the hospital are at risk for hospital related functional loss. This evaluation aims to compare the effects of different levels of (integrated) health intervention care programs on preventing hospital related functional loss among elderly patients by comparing a new intervention program to two usual care programs. Methods/Design This study will include an effect, process and cost evaluation using a mixed methods design of quantitative and qualitative methods. Three hospitals in the Netherlands with different levels of integrated geriatric health care will be evaluated using a quasi-experimental study design. Data collection on outcomes will take place through a prospective cohort study, which will incorporate a nested randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a stay at the centre for prevention and reactivation for patients with complex problems. The study population will consist of elderly persons (65 years or older) at risk for functional loss who are {{admitted to}} one of the three hospitals. Data is prospectively collected at time of hospital admission (T 0), three months (T 1), and twelve months (T 2) after hospital admission. Patient and informal caregiver outcomes (e. g. health related quality of life, activities of daily living, burden of care, (re-) admission in hospital or nursing homes, mortality) as well as process measures (e. g. the cooperation and collaboration of multidisciplinary teams, patient and informal caregiver satisfaction with care) will be measured. A qualitative analysis will determine the fidelity of intervention implementation as well as provide further context and explanation for quantitative outcomes. Finally, costs will be determined from a societal viewpoint to allow for cost effectiveness calculations. Discussion It is anticipated that higher levels of <b>integrated</b> <b>hospital</b> health <b>care</b> for at risk elderly will result in prevention of loss of functioning and loss of quality of life after hospital discharge as well as in lower burden of care and higher quality of life for informal caregivers. Ultimately, {{the results of this study}} may contribute to the implementation of a national integrated health care program to prevent hospital related functional loss among elderly patients.
