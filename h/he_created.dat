Henry IV also demanded that three French cardinals go to Rome, and they were present at Clement's death on 3 March 1605.|$|E

5|$|Between 1907 and 1911, Caragiale studied Romanian {{heraldry}} and, to this goal, read Octav-George Lecca's Familii boierești române ("Romanian Boyar Families"). Many of {{the comments}} added by him to his {{copy of the book}} are polemic, sarcastic, or mysterious, while the sketches he made on the margin include portrayals of boyars being put to death in various ways, as well as caricatures (such as a blazon displaying a donkey's head, which he mockingly assigned to Octav-George Lecca himself). Several of the heraldic objects <b>he</b> <b>created</b> were destined for his own use. In June 1928, he raised a green over yellow ensign <b>he</b> <b>created</b> for the Caragiale family at his property in Fundulea. He also hoisted other symbols, including the flag of Hungary, which, he claimed, underlined his foreign origin.|$|E
5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as <b>he</b> <b>created</b> the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so <b>he</b> <b>created</b> Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E

Clement did not feel obligated to appoint a German cardinal because the Holy Roman Emperor had requested his assistance in Hungary.
