2500|$|Version 1.60, {{released}} on December 8, 2011, increased furniture limit in personal spaces and clubhouses from 50 to 100 items, allowing 4 active items to be placed. The update also improved targeting in personal spaces. Portable items and companions {{were made to}} automatically reactivate after entering and leaving games and spaces. A new help system was also introduced to help beginners. The 3-minute <b>inactivity</b> <b>timeout</b> for arcade games was removed, along with the [...] "Community" [...] option under Options in the Menu Pad. Additional tools were also added for developers {{to enable them to}} make better games.|$|E

5000|$|In POP {{connection}}s, {{the server}} will usually close a client connection {{after a certain}} period of <b>inactivity</b> (the <b>timeout</b> period). This ensures that connections do not persist forever, if the client crashes or the network goes down. Open connections consume resources, and may prevent other clients from accessing the same mailbox.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Common {{authentication}} methods {{based on}} pass-words, tokens, or fingerprints perform one-time authentication {{and rely on}} users to log out from the computer terminal when they leave. Users often do not log out, however, which is a security risk. The most common solution, <b>inactivity</b> <b>timeouts,</b> inevitably fail security (too long a timeout) or usability (too short a timeout) goals. One solution is to authenticate users con-tinuously while they are using the terminal and automatically log them out when they leave. Several solutions are based on user proximity, {{but these are not}} sufficient: they only confirm whether the user is nearby but not whether the user is actually using the terminal. Proposed solutions based on behavioral biometric authentication (e. g., keystroke dynamics) may not be reliable, as a recent study suggests. To address this problem we propose Zero-Effort Bilateral Recurring Authentication (ZEBRA). In ZEBRA, a user wears a bracelet (with a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and radio) on her dominant wrist. When the user interacts with a computer terminal, the bracelet records the wrist movement, processes it, and sends it to the terminal. The terminal compares the wrist movement with the inputs it receives from the user (via keyboard and mouse), and confirms the continued presence of the user only if they correlate. Because the bracelet is on the same hand that provides inputs to the terminal, the accelerometer and gyroscope data and input events received by the terminal should correlate because their source is the same – the user’s hand movement. In our experiments ZEBRA performed continuous authentication with 85 % accuracy in verifying the correct user and identified all adversaries within 11 s. For a different threshold that trades security for usability, ZEBRA correctly verified 90 % of users and identified all adversaries within 50 s. I...|$|R
40|$|Biometric {{techniques}} {{are often used}} as an extra security factor in authenticating human users. Numerous biometrics have been proposed and evaluated, {{each with its own}} set of benefits and pitfalls. Static biometrics (such as fingerprints) are geared for discrete operation, to identify users, which typically involves some user burden. Meanwhile, behavioral biometrics (such as keystroke dynamics) are well suited for continuous, and sometimes more unobtrusive, operation. One important application domain for biometrics is deauthentication, a means of quickly detecting absence of a previously authenticated user and immediately terminating that user's active secure sessions. Deauthentication is crucial for mitigating so called Lunchtime Attacks, whereby an insider adversary takes over (before any <b>inactivity</b> <b>timeout</b> kicks in) authenticated state of a careless user who walks away from her computer. Motivated primarily by the need for an unobtrusive and continuous biometric to support effective deauthentication, we introduce PoPa, a new hybrid biometric based on a human user's seated posture pattern. PoPa captures a unique combination of physiological and behavioral traits. We describe a low cost fully functioning prototype that involves an office chair instrumented with 16 tiny pressure sensors. We also explore (via user experiments) how PoPa {{can be used in a}} typical workplace to provide continuous authentication (and deauthentication) of users. We experimentally assess viability of PoPa in terms of uniqueness by collecting and evaluating posture patterns of a cohort of users. Results show that PoPa exhibits very low false positive, and even lower false negative, rates. In particular, users can be identified with, on average, 91. 0 % accuracy. Finally, we compare pros and cons of PoPa with those of several prominent biometric based deauthentication techniques...|$|E
