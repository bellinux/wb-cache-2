25|$|Newborns have {{a uniform}} monolayered lamina propria, which appears loose with no vocal ligament. The monolayered lamina propria is {{composed}} of ground substances such as <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> and fibronectin, fibroblasts, elastic fibers, and collagenous fibers. While the fibrous components are sparse, making the lamina propria structure loose, the <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> (HA) content is high.|$|E
25|$|Joint injections: The pastern joint can be {{injected}} directly, typically with {{a form of}} corticosteroid and <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Currently, fillers {{containing}} <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> like Restylane and Juvederm {{have captured}} the attention of consumers and physicians in Europe, North America, South America and Australia.|$|E
25|$|Endoscopic {{injection}} involves {{applying a}} gel around the ureteral opening {{to create a}} valve function and stop urine from flowing back up the ureter. The gel consists of two types of sugar-based molecules called dextranomer and <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid.</b> Trade names for this combination include Deflux and Zuidex. Both constituents are well-known from previous uses in medicine. They are also biocompatible, {{which means that they}} do not cause significant reactions within the body. In fact, <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> is produced and found naturally within the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{floaters}} is shrinkage of the vitreous humour. This gel-like substance consists of 99% water and 1% solid elements. The solid portion consists of a network of collagen and <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid,</b> with the latter retaining water molecules. Depolymerization of this network makes the <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> release its trapped water, thereby liquefying the gel. The collagen breaks down into fibrils, which ultimately are the floaters that plague the patient. Floaters caused in this way tend to be few in number and of a linear form.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{from the}} Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, {{announced}} in January 2010 {{that they had}} analysed the genetic code of 10 different pedigree dog breeds. In the Shar-pei, they discovered four small differences located in the gene HAS2 {{which is responsible for}} making <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase 2. That enzyme makes <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{which is one of the}} key components of the skin. There have been rare cases in which a mutation of the same gene has caused severe wrinkling in humans as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{gelatinous}} capsule {{is present}} in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be polysaccharide as in pneumococci, meningococci or polypeptide as Bacillus anthracis or <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> as in streptococci.|$|E
25|$|Other joint medications, like <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> and Adequan, {{may help}} {{alleviate}} the pain if the horse has mild bone spavin. However, {{they are less}} useful for treating moderate of severe cases. MSM may also help horses with moderate bone spavin.|$|E
25|$|Hyaluronidase (also {{known as}} {{spreading}} factor) breaks down <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> and helps in spreading it. S. aureus also produces deoxyribonuclease, which {{breaks down the}} DNA, lipase to digest lipids, staphylokinase to dissolve fibrin and aid in spread, and beta-lactamase for drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{vitreous}} is the transparent, colourless, {{gelatinous mass}} that fills {{the space between}} the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye. It is produced by certain retinal cells. It is of rather similar composition to the cornea, but contains very few cells (mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field, as well as the hyalocytes of Balazs of the surface of the vitreous, which reprocess the <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid),</b> no blood vessels, and 98–99% of its volume is water (as opposed to 75% in the cornea) with salts, sugars, vitrosin (a type of collagen), a network of collagen type II fibres with the mucopolysaccharide <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid,</b> and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts. Amazingly, with so little solid matter, it tautly holds the eye.|$|E
25|$|The {{myocardium}} thickens and secretes a {{thick layer}} of rich extracellular matrix containing <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> which separates the endothelium. Then mesothelial cells form the pericardium and migrate to form most of the epicardium. Then the heart tube is formed by the endocardium, which is the inner endothelial lining of the heart, and the myocardial muscle wall which is the epicardium that covers the outside of the tube.|$|E
25|$|Non-surgical {{rhinoplasty}} is {{a medical}} procedure in which injectable fillers, such as collagen or <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid,</b> are used to alter and shape a person's nose without invasive surgery. The procedure fills in depressed areas on the nose, lifting {{the angle of the}} tip or smoothing the appearance of bumps on the bridge. The procedure does not alter nose size, though {{it can be used to}} correct some functional birth defects.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of benefit in terms of live birth rate of using <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> as adherence medium for the embryo. Neither is there any evidence of benefit of having a full bladder, removal of cervical mucus, or flushing of the endometrial or endocervical cavity at the time of embryo transfer. Adjunctive antibiotics in the form of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate compared with no antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to damaging effects on brain cells, ischemia and infarction {{can result in}} loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels, partly through the release of matrix metalloproteases, which are zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that break down collagen, <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid,</b> and other elements of connective tissue. Other proteases also contribute to this process. The loss of vascular structural integrity results in {{a breakdown of the}} protective blood brain barrier that contributes to cerebral edema, which can cause secondary progression of the brain injury.|$|E
25|$|Joint {{injection}} of glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone) leads to short term pain relief that may last between {{a few weeks}} and a few months. Injections of <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis, but did increase risk of further pain. In ankle osteoarthritis, evidence is unclear. The effectiveness of injections of platelet-rich plasma is unclear; there are suggestions that such injections improve function but not pain, and are associated with increased risk. A 2015 Cochrane review found that intra-articular corticosteroid injections of the knee did not benefit quality of life, {{had no effect on}} knee joint space, and clinical effects one to six weeks after injection could not be determined clearly due to poor study quality.|$|E
25|$|Scaffolds {{may also}} be {{constructed}} from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Proteic materials, such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains. Among GAGs <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid,</b> possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), {{is one of the}} possible choices as scaffold material. Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E
25|$|HA is a bulky, {{negatively}} charged glycosaminoglycan, whose strong affinity with water procures HA its viscoelastic and shock absorbing properties essential to vocal biomechanics. Viscosity and elasticity {{are critical to}} voice production. Chan, Gray and Titze, quantified the effect of HA on both the viscosity and the elasticity of vocal folds (VF) by comparing the properties of tissues with and without HA. The results showed that removal of HA decreased the stiffness of VF {{by an average of}} 35%, but increased their dynamic viscosity by an average of 70% at frequencies higher than 1Hz. Newborns have been shown to cry an average of 6.7 hours per day during the first 3 months, with a sustained pitch of 400–600Hz, and a mean duration per day of 2 hours. Similar treatment on adult VF would quickly result in edema, and subsequently aphonia. Schweinfurth and al. presented the hypothesis that high <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> content and distribution in newborn VF is directly associated with newborn crying endurance. These differences in newborn vocal fold composition would also be responsible for newborns inability to articulate sounds, besides the fact that their lamina propria is a uniform structure with no vocal ligament. The layered structure necessary for phonation will start to develop during the infancy and until the adolescence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> (HA) is {{a widely}} used {{biomaterial}} {{as a result of}} its excellent biocompatibility and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation. HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its degradation products stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery. HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell ingrowth and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, the HA hydrogels modified with laminin were able to promote neurite extension. These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} form of {{pancreatic}} cancer (adenocarcinoma) is typically characterized by moderately to poorly differentiated glandular structures on microscopic examination. There is typically considerable desmoplasia or formation of a dense fibrous stroma or structural tissue consisting of a range of cell types (including myofibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells) and deposited material (such as type I collagen and <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid).</b> [...] This creates a tumor microenvironment that is short of blood vessels (hypovascular) and so of oxygen (tumor hypoxia). [...] It is thought that this prevents many chemotherapy drugs from reaching the tumor, as one factor making the cancer especially hard to treat.|$|E

2500|$|Mammalian sperm cells {{become even}} more active when they {{approach}} an egg cell in a process called sperm activation. Sperm activation {{has been shown to}} be caused by calcium ionophores in vitro, progesterone released by nearby cumulus cells and binding to ZP3 of the zona pellucida. [...] The cumulus cells are embedded in a gel-like substance made primarily of <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid,</b> and developed in the ovary with the egg and support it as it grows.|$|E
2500|$|Restylane, a non-animal, clear gel that is {{reported}} to be very close to the <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> found naturally in the body. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, there were 778,000 cases of Restylane injection [...] in 2006, the most recent year for which statistics are available. The substance usually lasts six months and, sometimes, longer. While Juvederm is extremely chemically close to Restylane; many surgeons report the former is slightly smoother to inject.|$|E
2500|$|The {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} arise from a mutation of several collagen genes during fetal development. It is a sex independent autosomal dominant trait meaning a person with the syndrome has a 50% chance of passing it on to each child. There are three [...] variants of Stickler syndrome identified, each associated with a collagen biosynthesis gene. [...] A metabolic defect concerning the <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> and the collagen of the 2-d type {{is assumed to be}} the cause of this syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|Type I {{collagen}} composes 90–95% of {{the organic}} matrix, with remainder of the matrix being a homogenous liquid called ground substance consisting of proteoglycans such as <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> and chondroitin sulfate , as well as non-collagenous proteins such as osteocalcin, osteopontin or bone sialoprotein [...] Collagen consists of strands of repeating units, which give bone tensile strength, and are arranged in an overlapping fashion that prevents shear stress. The function of ground substance is not fully known. Two types of bone can be identified microscopically according to the arrangement of collagen: woven and lamellar.|$|E
2500|$|A 2015 {{meta-analysis}} identified 128 people {{treated with}} surgery from eight studies that were useful to pool, with an age range of 18 to 64, {{most of whom}} had been suffering ENS symptoms for many years. [...] The most common surgical approach was creating a pocket under the mucosa and implanting material - the amount and location were based on the judgement of the surgeon. [...] In about half the cases a filler such as noncellular dermis, a medical-grade porous high-density polyethylene, or silastic was used and in about 40% cartilage taken from the person or from a cow was used. [...] In a few cases <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> was injected and in a few others tricalcium phosphate was used. [...] There were no complications caused by the surgery, although one person was over-corrected and developed chronic rhinosinusitis and two people were under-corrected. [...] The <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> was completely resorbed in the three people who received it at the one year follow up, and in six people some of the implant came out, but this did not affect the result as enough remained. [...] About 21% of the people had no or marginal improvement but the rest reported significant relief of their symptoms. [...] Since none of the studies used placebo or blinding there may be a strong placebo effect or bias in reporting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next three}} layers {{comprise}} lamina LPs, which is stratified by their histological composition of elastin and collagen fibers, with fibroblast, myofibroblast and macrophages interspersed sparsely. The superficial layer LPs (SLLPs), {{also known as}} Reinke's space, is composed of amorphous substance and microfibrils which allows this cover layer to “slide” over the deep layer easily. The vibratory and viscoelastic characteristics of human VFs are mainly attributed to the molecular composition of SLLPs. In normal vocal fold, the jelly-like “Reinke's space” is very loose and abundant with interstitial proteins such as <b>hyaluronic</b> <b>acid,</b> fibronectin, proteoglycan like fibromodulin, decorin and versican. All these ECM components together regulate the water content of vocal fold and render the viscous shear property for it. [...] The squamous epithelium and superficial lamina propria form the vocal mucosa which serves as vibratory component in phonation. The mucosa layer vibrates at a frequency range of 100–1000Hz and displacement at 1mm approximately. The intermediate layer of LPs consists primarily of elastic fiber while the deep layer LP consists of fewer elastin and more collagen fibers. These two layers have poor differentiated boundary but are increasingly stiffer than SLLPs. The intermediate and deep layers of LPs compose the vocal ligaments which are enclosed within the vocal folds and are responsible for strain in phonation. Within the ECM community of vocal ligament, fibrous proteins such as elastin and collagen are pivotal in maintaining the proper elastic biomechanical property of vocal fold. Elastin fibers impart the flexibility and elasticity of the vocal folds and, collagen {{is responsible for the}} resistance and resiliece to tensile strength. The normal strain level of vocal ligament ranges from 0–15% during phonation These fibrous proteins exhibit distribution variations spatially and temporally due to fibroblast turnover during tissue maturation and aging. Each vocal ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> (or [...] "hyaluronan") is a {{polysaccharide}} {{consisting of}} alternating residues of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, and unlike other GAGs, is not found as a proteoglycan. <b>Hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> in the extracellular space confers upon tissues {{the ability to}} resist compression by providing a counteracting turgor (swelling) force by absorbing significant amounts of water. <b>Hyaluronic</b> <b>acid</b> is thus found in abundance in the ECM of load-bearing joints.
