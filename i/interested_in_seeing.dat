5|$|In October of 2017, it was {{reported}} that pre-production had begun when the creative team and studio decided to postpone the release in order to further work on the script with intentions being to improve the story. Deadline reported that Javier Bardem and Angelina Jolie are still attached to the movie as Frankenstein's monster and the film's reluctant bride, respectively. The same month Condon stated that should Jolie decide to leave the project, he would be <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> Gal Gadot play the titular character.|$|E
5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that they were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities {{in order to reach}} a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} their {{contention}} that Kinne {{had been so}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> her husband removed {{that she had been}} willing to pay for his murder, supported by the grand-jury testimony of John Boldizs. Boldizs, though nominally a witness for the prosecution, weakened his testimony on the stand during the trial by claiming that Kinne's offer to pay him $1,000 in return for James Kinne's murder could have been a joke, and Hill was forced to attack his own witness's credibility. Further prosecution testimony alleged that the Kinne's marriage had been on the verge of dissolution at the time of James Kinne's death, that Sharon Kinne's adultery had been a cause of this, and that Sharon Kinne had known that she would collect her husband's $29,000 in life insurance policies only if she were still his wife.|$|E

I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.|$|E
25|$|The Kintampo site is {{most often}} studied by archaeologists who are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> how people made the change between {{foraging}} and horticulture and agriculture {{as a way of}} producing food. Kintampo is seen as an example of neither foraging or farming, but somewhere in between. As practitioners of sedentism, derived from the word sedentary, the people of Kintampo spent more time in their villages and less time wandering around, hunting and gathering food. They took advantage of plants that were native to the area, and although technically they were not farming, they did influence the evolution of plants, effectively being some of the first to domesticate plants in Africa.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} were listed as Grade II in 1975 for their importance {{as a site}} of historic school architecture. Mrs Jill Grey, a local educational historian, opened a small museum {{in one of the}} Edwardian classrooms. In July 1990 North Herts College left the site and Hertfordshire County Council put the buildings up for sale. The Hitchin British Schools Trust was formed and by 1994 were successful in purchasing the buildings. The Trust, mainly through the efforts of volunteers, has restored the schoolrooms to reflect their original condition, and work continues to improve them. The museum is visited by adults and groups of children {{from all over the country}} who are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> how their ancestors were taught.|$|E
25|$|Gwynn {{indirectly}} received exposure from scouts watching SDSU {{that were}} interested in Meacham, who would become a first-round pick in 1981. Gwynn had started the baseball season late in 1981 as the basketball team was still competing, and some scouts had already seen enough of Meacham and stopped following SDSU. Also on the Aztecs baseball team was Casey McKeon, son of Jack McKeon, who was the San Diego Padres general manager at the time. Given his son's involvement, McKeon often went to Aztecs games. He was initially <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> Meacham, but became more impressed by Gwynn after seeing him at an exhibition game between the Aztecs and Padres; Gwynn had just re-joined the baseball team five days earlier.|$|E
25|$|The new English {{language}} venture faced considerable {{regulatory and}} commercial hurdles in the North America market for its perceived sympathy with extremist causes. At the same time, others felt Al Jazeera's competitive advantage lay in programming in the Arabic language. There {{were hundreds of}} millions of potential viewers among the non-Arabic language speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who might be <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny Qatar, beyond even what had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the BBC World Service was preparing to launch its own Arabic language station in 2007.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was {{strategically}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> a club based in Sydney, {{as part of}} a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in Queensland and New South Wales. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the Sydney Cricket Ground annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the Fitzroy Lions staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and {{paved the way for the}} Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.|$|E
25|$|However, Bolen was not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> {{an aging}} show like Jeopardy! {{stand in the}} way of her plans for a more {{youthful}} image for NBC's daytime lineup. So, on July 1 of the same year, NBC moved Jeopardy! time slot again, this time to 1:30p.m. EST (12:30p.m. CST) (replacing Three on a Match, yet another Bob Stewart-produced game) and placed it against ABC's Let's Make a Deal and CBS' As the World Turns, both of which had easily beaten the ratings of several programs placed in that same time slot by NBC since December 1968. At that time, Deal moved to ABC from NBC, which had carried it in that very time slot during much of the 1960s, in a dispute by packagers Stefan Hatos and Monty Hall over the latter network's refusal to make a weekly prime time version of the show permanent.|$|E

500|$|Both Rachel and Janet are Detective Constables in the Major Incident Team of the Manchester Metropolitan Police Service, {{with the}} team headed by DCI Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore), who is loosely based on Diane Taylor. Producers were {{undecided}} on what age DCI Murray would be, but had originally pictured an actress older than Bullmore. After auditioning, Bullmore returned a month later, intent on playing Murray [...] "tough", however, when meeting casting director Beverley Keogh in the toilets beforehand, Bullmore recounted that Keogh said to her: [...] "That's not what we've got you back for. We were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> a warmer side".|$|E
500|$|Diefenbaker ran on a {{platform}} which concentrated on changes in domestic policies. He pledged {{to work with the}} provinces to reform the Senate. He proposed a vigorous new agricultural policy, seeking to stabilize income for farmers. He sought to reduce dependence on trade with the United States, and to seek closer ties with the United Kingdom. St. Laurent called the Tory platform [...] "a mere cream-puff of a thing—with more air than substance". Diefenbaker and the PC party used television adroitly, whereas St. Laurent stated that he was more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> people than in talking to cameras. Though the Liberals outspent the Progressive Conservatives three to one, according to Newman, their campaign had little imagination, and was based on telling voters that their only real option was to re-elect St. Laurent.|$|E

I'm very <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on."

500|$|In R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, {{ex parte}} Rose Theatre Trust Co. (1989), the High Court of England and Wales adopted a narrow and more {{restrictive}} approach to public standing. Justice Konrad Schiemann held {{that to have}} standing, an applicant must expressly or impliedly have [...] "a greater right or expectation than any other citizen of this country to have that decision taken lawfully". On the facts, an individual <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> {{the remains of a}} historically significant theatre in London called The Rose preserved and made accessible to the public lacked sufficient interest to challenge the Secretary of State for the Environment's decision not to list the theatre as a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The applicant, a trust company formed by a number of such people, did not have any greater claim to standing than its individual members.

500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel {{is kind of like}} our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law [...] "was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E
