The <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>approach</b> is the most realistic way to obtain these fruit.

The effect of different fruit:fly ratios from 1 : 5 to 1 : 50 for an exposure time of up to 3 days on the number of both decayed fruit and puparia per fruit was determined. Provided that an adequate fungicide treatment is applied before the infestation to avoid fruit decay, the use of a 1 : 10 fruit:fly ratio for 48 h is enough to obtain almost 20 healthy puparia per fruit.

However, the biological relevance or prognostic significance of tumor hardness remains poorly understood. Here we present a fracture mechanics based <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>approach</b> for characterizing the fracture toughness of biological tissue of human thyroid gland tumors. Methods In a prospective study, 609 solid thyroid gland tumors were percutaneously probed using standard 25 gauge fine needles, their tissue toughness ranked {{on the basis of the}} nature and strength of the haptic force feedback cues, and subjected to standard fine needle biopsy. The tumors' toughness rankings and final cytological diagnoses were combined and analyzed. The interpreting cytopathologist was blinded to the tumors' toughness rankings. Results Our data showed that cancerous and noncancerous tumors displayed remarkable haptically distinguishable differences in their material toughness. Conclusion The qualitative method described here, though subject to some operator bias, identifies a previously unreported <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>approach</b> to classify fracture toughness of a solid tumor that can be correlated with malignancy, and paves the way for the development of a mechanical device that can accurately quantify the tissue toughness of a human tumor. </p...|$|E

The experiments comprised repeated passages of a highly pathogenic VHSV isolate in a fish cell line in the presence of neutralizing fish serum (in vitro approach), and in rainbow trout immunized with the VHS DNA vaccine (<b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>approach).</b> For the in vitro approach, the virus collected from the last passage (passaged virus) was as sensitive as the parental virus to serum neutralization, suggesting that the passaging did not promote the selection of virus populations able to bypass the neutralization by serum antibodies.
