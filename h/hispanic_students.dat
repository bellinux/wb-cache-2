25|$|Segregation in {{education}} has major social repercussions.

These effects extend neither to white nor to <b>Hispanic</b> <b>students</b> in the school, implying that they are related to peer interactions and not to school quality. Moreover, {{it appears that the}} effect of black concentrations in schools is largest for high achieving black students.|$|E

25|$|City College began {{charging}} tuition in 1976. But {{after three}} decades, by 1999, the CUNY Board of Trustees voted to eliminate remedial classes at all CUNYs senior colleges, thereby eliminating a central {{pillar of the}} policy of Open Admissions and effectively ending it. Students who could not meet the academic entrance requirements for CUNY's senior colleges were forced to enroll in the system's community colleges, where they could prepare for an eventual transfer {{to one of the}} 4-year institutions. Since this decision, all CUNY senior colleges, especially CCNY, have begun to rise in prestige nationally, as evinced by school rankings and incoming freshman GPA and SAT scores. In addition, the end of open admissions sparked a change in CUNY's student demographics, with the number of Black and <b>Hispanic</b> <b>students</b> decreasing and the number of White Caucasian and Asian students increasing.|$|E
