5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his new book himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817. It was extremely successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the area}} where Bernetz Brook enters the La Chute, Captain Trépezet and his troop, who were {{attempting}} {{to return to the}} French lines, encountered Phineas Lyman's Connecticut regiment, sparking a skirmish in the woods. General Howe's column was near the action, so he led <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction. As they approached the battle scene, General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball. A column of Massachusetts provincials, also drawn to the battle, cut off the French patrol's rear. In desperate fighting, about 150 of Trepézet's men were killed, and another 150 were captured. Fifty men, including Trepézet, escaped by swimming across the La Chute. Trepézet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle.|$|E

5|$|The 1896 {{establishment}} of the Gympie Truth, a newspaper {{that he was to}} partly own, was part of his response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{worker for}} P. longiceps was {{collected}} by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1868. The fossil, which was preserved in Baltic amber from the Eocene, was formally described in Mayr's journal article Die Ameisen des baltischen Bernsteins, designating {{it as the}} type species by monotypy (the condition of a taxonomic group having only a single taxon described) for the newly established genus Prionomyrmex. Originally, the genus {{was placed in the}} subfamily Ponerinae by Mayr, but in 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the subfamily Myrmeciidae (now known as Myrmeciinae), the same year Emery established the subfamily. In 1915, the tribe Prionomyrmecini was erected by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler, who had placed Prionomyrmex in <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> year, Wheeler placed the genus back into Ponerinae without any means of justifying his decision. British myrmecologist Horace Donisthorpe would also retain the genus in Ponerinae without explanation, but William Brown Jr. would return it to Myrmeciinae in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time {{is similar to the}} way Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden image that {{is the same as the}} garden beginning Burnt Norton. The repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine discussed <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> memory allows one to understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to Christ as the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E

5|$|Hibbard {{wrote that}} the {{condition}} of the mental foramen and masseteric ridges excluded the specimen from Onychomys, Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, and Eligmodontia and that in these features and in its depth and size, the fossil more closely resembled Oryzomys; therefore, he placed <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> genus with a query. Oryzomys is a living genus that has occurred in the United States since at least 300,000 years ago. In 1966, Philip Hershkovitz wrote that Hibbard had reconsidered his opinion after re-examining ? O.pliocaenicus in 1952; he no longer thought that it was an Oryzomys and instead believed it may be a Bensonomys. The latter genus occurs in the late Miocene and early Pliocene of North America and has been variously interpreted as a close relative of the South American Calomys or merely as an evolutionarily convergent member of the North American subfamily Neotominae. Jon Baskin mentioned the animal in 1978 and 1986, asserting that it cannot be identified to genus level, but may be Bensonomys. Although some continue to list it under Oryzomys, it is now usually excluded from the genus. In 2008, Everett Lindsay listed ? O.pliocaenicus as a questionable species of Jacobsomys, a Pliocene North American genus which he said may be ancestral to Oryzomys.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of X-rays stimulated a veritable sensation.

Sensationalist reactions to the new discovery included publications linking the new kind of rays to occult and paranormal theories, such as telepathy.|$|E

A major difference from buddy breathing is that the diver using a redundant alternative air source need not alternate breathing with the donor, which can be a substantial advantage in many circumstances. There is a further significant advantage when the alternate air source is carried by the diver using <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it is not necessary to locate the buddy before it is available, but this comes at the cost of extra equipment.|$|E
25|$|However, Bolen was not {{interested}} in seeing an aging show like Jeopardy! {{stand in the way of}} her plans for a more youthful image for NBC's daytime lineup. So, on July 1 of the same year, NBC moved Jeopardy! time slot again, this time to 1:30p.m. EST (12:30p.m. CST) (replacing Three on a Match, yet another Bob Stewart-produced game) and placed it against ABC's Let's Make a Deal and CBS' As the World Turns, both of which had easily beaten the ratings of several programs placed in that same time slot by NBC since December 1968. At that time, Deal moved to ABC from NBC, which had carried <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> very time slot during much of the 1960s, in a dispute by packagers Stefan Hatos and Monty Hall over the latter network's refusal to make a weekly prime time version of the show permanent.|$|E

Based on the serious textual errors in the inscription, including the omission {{of a large number}} of signs from the Cyrus Cylinder, Wu Yuhong argued the inscriptions were most likely copied from the cylinder while housed in the British Museum or from an early modern publication based upon it. However he acknowledged the remote possibility it was copied in late antiquity. Irving Finkel disputed this conclusion based on the relative obscurity of the Cyrus Cylinder until recent decades and the mismatch in paleography between the bone inscriptions and the hand copies found in early editions from the 1880's.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus in 1996; their morphological cladistic analysis yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. They were uncertain of B.coccineas placement as it had highly autapomorphic characteristics which made analysis of its relationships difficult. Hence, in their arrangement it was located within series Banksia but not allocated to a subseries (incertae sedis). It was reclassified in its own section Coccinea in 1996 by Tina Maguire and colleagues; pollen compatibility tests indicated its pollen was most compatible with Banksia ericifolia, B.micrantha and B.sphaerocarpa, all of section Oncostylis. However, they did not place <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> section as all members of Oncostylis have hooked styles at anthesis.
