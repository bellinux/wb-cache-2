5|$|The first {{appearance}} {{of this species}} in the literature was in 1890, under the name Colus fusiformis, when Eduard Fischer wrote a description based on a painting he found in the Paris Museum of Natural History. In his 1944 monograph on the Gasteromycetes of Australia and New Zealand, Gordon Herriot Cunningham considered this naming to be a nomen nudum—not published with an adequate description. However, it was valid under {{the rules of the}} International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. In 1899 Penzig described the species Colus javanicus based on a single specimen found on Java, and a year later Fischer amended the name of <b>his</b> <b>original</b> Colus fusiformis to Colus javanicus, as he was not satisfied with the quality of <b>his</b> <b>original</b> description. Despite his doubts on the validity of his description, <b>his</b> <b>original</b> naming is both legitimate and has priority over C.javanicus.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars with its review by Scott Yanow stating, [...] "This is a {{particularly}} strong solo performance by the unique pianist Randy Weston. He interprets eight of <b>his</b> <b>originals,</b> {{all of which are}} to an extent influenced by African music".|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states [...] "Murray {{stretches}} out on four of <b>his</b> <b>originals</b> (which clock in between eight and twelve-and-a-half minutes) and shows plenty of fire {{but also a}} healthy dose of lyricism. This is exciting music very much in the avant-garde".|$|R

5|$|After {{some time}} Alder {{developed}} interest in <b>his</b> <b>original</b> family in Virginia.

5000|$|Gifford {{approached}} his task as an [...] "engineer" [...] creating intricate staccato passages which hurtled along {{as if on}} well oiled rollers from which the soloists were suddenly launched. <b>His</b> <b>originals</b> were like demonic steam trains where every moving part flashed and meshed in impossible displays of kinetic energy.|$|R
5|$|Akins re-signed {{with the}} Tiger-Cats {{before the start}} of the 2003 season. He was moved around in various {{positions}} throughout the season.

Later patents expanded on <b>his</b> <b>original</b> ideas.|$|E
5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with watercolor and oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, watercolor and color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn what he has forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling <b>his</b> <b>original</b> artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E
