25|$|Lars van der Hooten: Mia's very {{protective}} bodyguard. He voices his mind {{in a way}} that is annoying when he thinks Mia is being particularly ridiculous, but goes along with her schemes anyway. He also turns a blind eye to Mia and Michael when they make out, for which Mia is grateful. <b>He</b> <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> very well with Michael (especially in the first book when Lars seems to know that Michael likes Mia), never offers any opinion on Lilly, and becomes friends with Tina's bodyguard, Wahim. Lars also likes Mia's French teacher Mademoiselle Klein. He is known to be a 'big softie' deep down inside.|$|E
500|$|A's {{pitching}} coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson, [...] "You {{have to be}} careful because he can knock one out. But you don't want to be too careful because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> base he's more trouble still." [...] Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, [...] "Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate... Yet in the past quarter century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Beau Widgeon?" [...] {{said the}} Egg, impressed. [...] "What ho!" [...] A Crumpet shook his head. [...] "You won't catch Freddie joining any Foreign Legion, once <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> {{to the fact}} that it means missing his morning cup of tea. [...] " [...] (in [...] "Noblesse Oblige") ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it is," [...] responded Bob Grenwood, the {{quartermaster}} of {{the school}} battalion. [...] "How {{in the world did}} <b>he</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> that horse?" ...|$|R

60|$|The {{little man}} smiled and nodded. His bright face seemed uncommonly {{attractive}} to Mr Pancks. 'How's <b>he</b> <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> in his limb?' he asked Mrs Plornish.|$|R
2500|$|An Estonian {{stands by}} a railway track. Another Estonian passes by on a handcar, pushing the pump up and down. The first one asks: [...] "Iis iitt a llonngg wwayy ttoo Ttallinn?" [...] / [...] "Nnoot ttoo llonngg." [...] <b>He</b> <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> {{the car and}} joins pushing the pump up and down. After two hours of silent pumping the first Estonian asks again: [...] "Iis iitt a llonngg wwayy ttoo Ttallinn?" [...] / [...] "Nnnoooowww iiitt iiiis llonngg wwayy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The origins, {{background}} and eventual {{cancellation of the}} series would later be humorously referenced in 1987's [...] "The Secret Policeman's Third Ball" [...] in a sketch in which Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry present Cleese — who they comically misname [...] "Jim Cleese" [...] — with a Dick Emery Lifetime Achievement Award ("Silver Dick") for his contributions to comedy, then launch into a comical series of questions regarding the show, including Cleese's marriage and divorce from Booth, innocently ridiculing Cleese and reducing him to tears, to {{a point at which}} <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> his knees and crawls off the stage while crying.|$|E
2500|$|He took 4 for 79 for Wanganui {{against the}} touring Australians in February 1914, and after New Zealand's loss to Australia {{in the first}} of two {{international}} matches a few weeks later, several critics urged the selectors to choose talented players from outside the four main teams. The cricketer and clergyman Ernest Blamires said that of all bowlers in New Zealand none had impressed him as favourably as Holland: [...] "He is a fast-medium bowler, and the off break that <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> a fast wicket is remarkable." [...] Holland was selected for his first-class debut in the second [...] "test" [...] as one of seven changes, alongside Len McMahon from Poverty Bay. However, Holland took only one expensive wicket and New Zealand lost by an innings.|$|E

5000|$|... "My {{grandfather}} {{holds the}} highest title in Fasito'o Uta and <b>he's</b> <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> now and <b>he</b> needed {{to pass it}} on to keep the name in the family," [...] Vito explained.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know that}} they had {{translated}} it Barker in the revised version. Well, you must let me know how <b>he's</b> <b>getting</b> <b>on,</b> Sewell, {{and give me a}} chance at the revelation, too, if <b>he</b> ever <b>gets</b> troublesome to you again." ...|$|R
2500|$|While Rieber's {{personal}} connection to Tim gave the character {{a sense of}} realism, it also {{was a source of}} frustration for the writer: he later said, [...] "I've found it difficult to like Tim now and then. [...] Of course <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> my nerves. [...] He's a lot like someone I spent years learning not to be." [...] This dislike led to a perceived decline in the quality of the book as Rieber wrote his final batch of issues, with the character of Tim often sidelined in the stories in favor of his girlfriend, Molly. This preference also affected Tim's character in other ways, as Rieber requested that Molly not be used in the book after his departure to allow him to develop his own projects using her — causing the in-story break up of the two young lovers that led to them not seeing each other for many years.|$|E
2500|$|Warne {{played down}} his achievement, commenting that [...] "I {{was just trying}} to tie up an end and I got a bit lucky", while his skipper noted that [...] "Shane is like the West Indian bowlers – when <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>on</b> top he gets all over you". Atherton was unhappy at the post-match press conference. [...] "I don't like to see us lie down and die," [...] he said, {{referring}} to his decision to have Alec Stewart bat in the second innings despite a broken finger, but he admitted that [...] "we got walloped in the first two Tests... We've got some good players [...] we're not playing especially well at the moment." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald was less charitable towards England's performances to date, with Patrick Smith claiming that [...] "Wisden should count England wickets as just a half", and deploring Atherton's lack of aggression in the field. He also derided Gooch, Gatting and Hick, and picked out the way that the visitors' batsmen got themselves out so readily.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, yes; {{and how did}} <b>he</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> there? I cannot {{conceive}} poor Johnny keeping holiday {{with the}} earl and his sister. How did he behave to them, {{and how did they}} behave to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr Bevan, [...] "I gave it up. A man finds <b>he's</b> <b>getting</b> <b>on,</b> as {{the saying}} is, and it don't do to keep at it too long. I teach and I train, but I don't fight now." ...|$|R
