However, agreement on profi-ciency goals that accurately reflect the needs of a diverse student population has been problematic. Downward trends in U.

Concerns about alignment arose from the context surrounding Title <b>I</b> <b>legislation.</b> The sample for the survey of the alignment of state standards and assessments in elementary reading comprised all 50 states and the District,of Columbia.

40|$|Clear and {{effective}} legislation is a requisite to bring sustainable development from theory into practice. This paper develops a methodology to investigate how Italian regional legislation disciplines {{the use of}} Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), the procedure used in the European Union (EU) to pursue sustainable development of policies, plans, and programs (PPPs). Our case study is the Italian regional level, examined to identify eventual flaws and areas for improvement for each regional legislative framework. For this purpose, this study refers to a selection of analytical criteria recurring in the international debate on sustainability assessments. Statistical multi-dimensional analysis is used to identify Italian regions with similar SEA legislation. We recognize four taxonomies, depending on the way regional legislation provides information about <b>i)</b> <b>legislation</b> and guidelines, ii) integration between SEA and PPPs, iii) sustainability goals, iv) technical organization, v) participatory organization, and vi) monitoring. The results suggest that Italian administrators should cooperate to improve legislation at the regional level. Acknowledging the institution-centred nature of SEA, this methodology could drive the EU to better support SEA development in countries with diversified traditions...|$|E

40|$|During {{the first}} half of the XX century, both in Europe and North America, a {{profound}} dissatisfaction with the numerous different social insurance, unemployment, health and old age insurance systems began to make itself felt. The essay deals with the attitudes of the Western world, and in particular with the Italian one. As regards the United States, debate has spread since the second half of the XIX century on the so-called welfare work, and on welfare capitalism. In Europe social security systems began with their establishment by Bismarck’s German government. In the second half of the 19 th century the role played by local administrations augmented in several countries. Unfair distribution was considered to be the condition of the system that made it impossible to abolish need. In Italy assistance indicates a vast system of coordinated activities aimed at reforms that may contextualize arising social questions and define policies to solve them. The Italian regime basically followed the German model of welfare state, implementing social insurance in order to integrate and control the country. The solutions sprang from philanthropy and religious motivations, and also from the fear of the poor as potential criminals or rebels. After World War <b>I</b> <b>legislation</b> was issued predominantly on assistance to the disabled and on accident insurance. In the interwar period the solutions were strictly linked to the corporativistic-authoritarian formulation of the Fascist political system. In the immediate post-second WW period politicians and economists were inspired by the principle of universal social security and public services, and favoured interdependence among people in society.

40|$|In {{this article}} Professor Van Alstine explores the {{interaction}} between the limitations on the doctrine of federal common law and the power of federal courts to interpret the law within the scope of treaties. The article first reviews the constitutional foundation for the operation of treaties as directly applicable (2 ̆ 2 self-executing 2 ̆ 2) federal law. It then explains that, notwithstanding the Erie doctrine, federal courts may obtain lawmaking powers from either a delegation by Congress or in certain areas of 2 ̆ 2 uniquely federal interest. 2 ̆ 2 Professor Van Alstine then argues that the judicial relationship with self-executing treaty law in principle proceeds from the same source of authority as that for Article <b>I</b> <b>legislation.</b> No less than in the statutory context, therefore, a deliberate and circumscribed delegation of lawmaking powers by treaty does not run afoul of federalism or separation of powers limitations on federal common law. Even beyond such an express authorization, the special constitutional nature of treaties also profoundly affects the analysis of the lawmaking powers of federal courts in this context. As a formal expression both of national foreign affairs policy and of the international law obligations of the United States, treaty law operates at the intersection of the two most prominent fields of 2 ̆ 2 uniquely federal interest. 2 ̆ 2 As a result, Professor Van Alstine concludes that the decisive interests of national uniformity which arise in the context of formal treaty obligations - and which animate the two noted fields of established federal common law - mandate a different, and ultimately more accommodating, calculus for the interstitial lawmaking powers of federal courts within the scope of self-executing treaties...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{will try}} to address some {{criticism}} to Bruno Leoni’s general theory of law and society. In his well known book Freedom and the Law (1961) –in the opinion of some Italian scholars, {{to be considered a}} libertarian Manifesto–, he stressed at least five main points: <b>i)</b> <b>legislation</b> is incompatible with the long-run certainty of the law, that is when the law is not properly the result of the exercise of the arbitrary will of particular men; ii) courts of justice describe or discover the law, and do not make the law; iii) courts cannot be considered as legislators, not only because of their psychological attitude towards the law, which they discover, and do not create, but above all because of their fundamental dependance on the parties concerned in their process of making the law: so, a court must not be allowed to reverse its precedents – at least to a certain extent; iv) the whole process, and so the law, can be described as a sort of vast, continuous, and chiefly spontaneous collaboration between the judges and the judged in order to discover what the people’s will is in a series of definite instances –a collaboration that in many respects may be compared to that existing among all the partecipants in a free market; v) in our time, the mechanism of the judiciary in certain countries where supreme courts are established results in the imposition of the personal views of the members of these courts, or of a majority of them: it is a somewhat contradictory introduction of the legislative process under the deceptive label of lawyers’ or judiciary law at its highest stage. It seems to me that Leoni’s theory of law and society as a normative doctrine for a «libertarian», or «post-hayekian», society is not entirely successful: in particular, topics as the relation between law and legislation, the proper sense of legal concepts (if any), and the possibility to survive for individual freedom as a non-historical but ideological concept within an open, i. e. democratic, society, will be put under scrutiny in the paper, according to Leoni’s doctrine of law as an individual claim. ...|$|E

On 15 September 1819, William I decreed Dutch as the official language for justice and governmental administration although he did not prohibit the use of other languages.

William I [...] "believed or feigned to believe that French was introduced into the Walloon provinces only under the pressure of foreign influence." [...] The linguistic barrier [...] "acquired administrative significance for the first time in 1822 with William <b>I's</b> <b>legislation</b> on the use of Dutch in Flemish communes."
