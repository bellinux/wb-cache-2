5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen</b> to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
25|$|Surrounded by a picket fence, the Mapleton Drive {{house is}} two stories with a first <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen,</b> dining room, {{living room and}} {{adjoining}} patio, and at least three bedrooms on the second floor—one for the boys, one for the parents, and a guest room into which Beaver moves for a night. The cellar is accessible through a diagonal door in the kitchen. A kitchen door opens onto a small side yard, the driveway, and a single-car garage—a frequent setting for get-togethers between the boys, their father, and the boys' friends.|$|E
500|$|The Kitchen Tower {{stands on}} the north-west corner of the castle and was {{intended}} to supply Lord Hasting's large household. The tower only had two storeys, as the ground <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen</b> had a very high, [...] high vaulted ceiling, and its walls were [...] thick and made of yellow sandstone. The well-lit kitchen had several hearths and an oven for cooking, a well and a cellar for storage. Above the kitchen was a large room, probably used as a winter parlour. One wall of the tower was slighted in 1648. An underground passage, probably dating from the English Civil War, links the Great Tower with the Kitchen Tower.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1990s most {{tear-down}} replacement {{houses are}} row houses build using reinforced concrete, marbled floors, {{and stainless steel}} staircases. They have modern <b>flooring,</b> <b>kitchen</b> and bathroom amenities but still about three room downstairs and three room upstairs.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the house}} is {{maintained}} {{as if it were}} still a private home preserved in its original condition. Three floors are open to visitors: the lower ground <b>floor</b> (<b>kitchens),</b> upper ground <b>floor</b> (formal rooms), first floor (private apartments), and gardens.|$|R

2500|$|The {{home was}} built in 1873 in a Greek revival style by Kiel {{contractor}} August F. Neumann. It consisted of a current upstairs bedroom and first <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen</b> / dining room. The original home became {{the rear of the}} home during an addition in 1891. The addition was done in what was later called [...] "stick style" [...] architecture. The stick style was an 1860-1890 trend where carpentry and woodworking technology allowed for lots of trim detail. Timm’s unmarried children took over the home after his death. They turned the upstairs into a rental unit, and in 1954 upstairs and downstairs were both rented out. The home was donated by H. C. Timm II to the New Holstein Historic Society in 1974.|$|E
50|$|Public {{water wells}} {{in groups of}} two or three are usually located at the centre court; more luxurious tulous have {{in-house}} water well for each household in ground <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Most tulous have in built water pipes to offer protection to the upper wooden floors against fire (either accidental or as a result of attack).|$|E
5000|$|Corbett Tower - {{the setting}} {{for a wide variety}} of events, ranging from weddings and receptions to grand dinners and parties. It has seating for up to 300 and {{includes}} a stage, controlled sound and light systems, dance <b>floor,</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and bar facilities. Corbett Tower is located on the third floor near the front of the building.|$|E
5000|$|Its high {{overhanging}} roof is thatched, and {{its walls}} are half timbered. The casements admit just enough light to heighten the interior effect. The brick <b>floored</b> <b>kitchen,</b> {{or may be}} a parlour, is delightfully snug, and the walls are darkly panelled all round. This Hotel has been enlarged to meet modern requirements but the additional part is not shown as it spoils the effect.|$|R

5000|$|The newer part of {{the castle}} is a Tudor-style {{fortified}} house attached to the tower. This {{was built in the}} late 16th century or early 17th century. It had large corridors and its ground <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen</b> provided heat for the first floor rooms where the Lord lived. The doorway is cut limestone and there is an oriel window on its eastern wall.|$|E
50|$|Internally {{almost all}} the {{evidence}} of the building's use as a hospital has been lost in its change to office and residential use. Although the joinery has been retained, the northern wards and central corridor have been combined into one large office area and suspended ceilings installed. The original top <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen</b> has been converted into living quarters. The southern verandah is enclosed, and a fire stair has been constructed behind the facade facing Ann Street.|$|E
50|$|Like most Usonian houses, Suntop {{utilizes}} radiant {{hydronic heating}} in the first-floor slab, with radiators in upper rooms. Gravity convection efficiently circulates heated {{water to the}} living areas. In each dwelling, the heater room and its water-heater is also directly under the second floor bathroom, and near the second <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen.</b> This can enable instant-on hot water, at some cost in fuel to keep return hot-water loops warm. Wright even designed custom cedar radiator covers for Suntop.|$|E

The practice was stopped, and Home Depot offered a year of free credit monitoring through AllClearID for any customers who requested it.

5000|$|A {{cement board}} is a {{combination}} of cement and reinforcing fibers formed into 4 foot by 8 foot sheets (or 3 foot by 5 foot sheets), 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick that are typically used as a tile backing board. Cement board can be nailed or screwed to wood or steel studs to create a substrate for vertical tile and attached horizontally to plywood for tile <b>floors,</b> <b>kitchen</b> counters and backsplashes. It can be used on the exterior of buildings as a base for exterior plaster (stucco) systems and sometimes as the finish system itself.|$|R

50|$|The Delaware and Raritan Canal and {{the canal}} houses are {{now part of}} the New Jersey State Park system. In the 1970s, the Lawrence Historical Society began {{restoring}} the Port Mercer Canal House to the 1890-1920 time period. Around 1900, a first <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen</b> was added. Prior to this addition, Mrs. Arrowsmith, who was known as a good cook, did all of the cooking for the large family and friends by the fireplace {{in the basement of the}} house. The house and the Port Mercer area are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
50|$|The castle is {{a nearly}} square four-storey tower house, around 25 ft {{on each side}} and with walls up to 5 ft thick. In the {{south-east}} corner is a round staircase that protrudes from the building. Currently, the tower has a store at ground level, a living room on the first <b>floor,</b> <b>kitchen</b> on the second, and bedrooms and bathrooms on {{the third and fourth}} floors. A pitched roof has been re-erected as part of the restoration. In the 1990s, a stone extension was added on the east side.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, a Vision for St Laurence's was {{launched}} to address much needed repairs and improve community {{use of the}} building. Approximately £850,000 of repairs and other work have been completed including urgent conservation, high level masonry, roofs, {{as well as new}} heating and lighting. Target 3, the re-ordering of the nave, will be tackled in two phases beginning in 2016. The nave will be reorganised with moveable seating and will be made available for wider community use. Phase 2 will include a new nave <b>floor,</b> <b>kitchen,</b> toilets, shop and other facilities as well as conservation to historic stained glass and timber.|$|E

One wall of the tower was slighted in 1648. An underground passage, probably dating from the English Civil War, links the Great Tower with the Kitchen Tower.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the structure was originally primarily industrial. However, the entrance vestibule and first floor hallway have a marble stairway with marble faced walls and a vaulted ceiling. The garages and warehouse are open spaces with concrete floors and walls and exposed ceiling trusses. The remainder of the main building is painted brick and concrete block walls and concrete floors. Currently, areas that were built as open warehouse spaces have been subdivided into office areas. There is a third <b>floor</b> <b>kitchen</b> with glazed block walls and tile floors.
