5|$|Boosted by this spiritual experience, Afonso won {{the battle}} against an outnumbering enemy. Legend has it that Afonso killed the <b>five</b> Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja taifas, before decimating the enemy troops. Hence, in {{gratitude}} to Jesus, he incorporated <b>five</b> shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the <b>five</b> enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ's <b>five</b> wounds {{in the form of}} silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver.|$|E

50|$|There are {{variations}} of the game. Traditional Forty <b>Fives</b> goes to a score of 45 point (hence {{the name of the}} game).

Auction Forty <b>Fives</b> is closely related to the game One-hundred and ten (110) also described below.|$|R

50|$|Rugby <b>Fives,</b> {{developed}} at Rugby School, is {{played in a}} four wall court (quite similar to a squash court).

Rugby <b>Fives</b> is played as both a singles and a doubles game. The balls used in Rugby and Winchester <b>Fives</b> are fairly hard and hence the gloves worn are thicker than those used in Eton <b>Fives.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The game of Warminster <b>Fives</b> [...] - [...] {{based on}} Wessex <b>Fives</b> [...] - [...] {{is thought to}} have been played from as early as 1787 at Lord Weymouth School, now Warminster School. An 1860 Warminster <b>Fives</b> Court still exists at Warminster School and was in regular use until the late 1950s.

5000|$|ARC trooper <b>Fives,</b> CT-27-5555, serves {{alongside}} fellow ARC trooper Echo. He first {{appears in}} The Clone Wars season one episode [...] "Rookies" [...] {{as a regular}} trooper. He and his unit are assigned to a remote listening outpost that is invaded by Separatist droids. Though the invasion is successfully repelled, only <b>Fives</b> and Echo survive, and they are reassigned to the 501st Legion. The season three episode [...] "Clone Cadets" [...] depicts <b>Fives</b> and his unit as cadets in training on Kamino. The unit, called Domino squad, is initially unable {{to work together to}} pass their final test. <b>Fives</b> and Echo feel weighed down by the others in the squad and ask to be reassigned, but the request is denied. Under the advice of Jedi General Shaak Ti, <b>Fives</b> and Echo recommit themselves to Domino, and the squad is able to pass. <b>Fives</b> and Echo are eventually promoted to ARC troopers together for their actions while defending Kamino and continue serving with the 501st. When assigned to the command of Jedi General Krell, <b>Fives</b> finds Krell's disregard for clone trooper lives appalling and openly disagrees with Krell and with Captain Rex, who is insistent on following orders. <b>Fives</b> disobeys a direct order, and though his actions allow a Republic victory, Krell, without process of a court-martial, finds <b>Fives</b> guilty of treason and sentences him to execution by firing squad. However, <b>Fives</b> urges his fellow troopers to see this as an injustice, and the firing squad refuses to execute him.|$|R
