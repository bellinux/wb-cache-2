500|$|Romney {{joined the}} National Press Club and the Burning Tree and Congressional Country Clubs; one {{reporter}} watching Romney hurriedly play golf {{at the last}} said, [...] "There {{is a young man}} who <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is going." [...] Lenore's cultural refinement and hosting skills, along with her father's social and political connections, helped George in business, and the couple met the Hoovers, the Roosevelts, and other prominent Washington figures. [...] He was chosen by Pyke Johnson, a Denver newspaperman and automotive industry trade representative he met at the Press Club, to join the newly formed Trade Association Advisory Committee to the National Recovery Administration. [...] The committee's work continued even after the agency was declared unconstitutional in 1935. [...] During 1937 and 1938, Romney was also president of the Washington Trade Association Executives.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} the novel's title character, the President, is never named gives him a mythological dimension, rather than the {{personality}} of a specific Guatemalan dictator. Literary scholar Kevin Bauman notes that readers are not let {{into the mind of}} the President; instead his appearance is [...] "continually re-evaluated, re-defined, and, ultimately, re-constructed according to his perception by others, similar to Asturias's own novelistic (re)vision of Estrada Cabrera's regime". According to literary critic Hughes Davies, the President [...] "represents political corruption but his presentation as an evil deity who is worshiped in terms that mockingly echo religious ritual elevates him to a mythical plane" [...] and he is [...] "an inverted image of both the Christian and Mayan deities since he is the source only of death". The dictator also has an element of mystery about himit seems that no one <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is because he occupies several houses {{on the outskirts of the}} town. Mystery also surrounds the questions of when and how he sleeps. In the novel, rumors abound that he sleeps beside the telephone with a whip in his hand while others claim that he never sleeps at all.|$|E

500|$|Desmond, Sayid and Lapidus {{experience}} turbulence while {{flying the}} 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) {{distance from the}} island where they were stranded to Lapidus' team's freighter, the Kahana. Desmond's consciousness travels back eight years to 1996, when he is serving with the British Army's Royal Scots Regiment. [...] Moments later, when his consciousness returns to the present day, he neither <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is nor recognizes his companions, and has no memory of his life since 1996. [...] After the helicopter lands, Desmond continues to jump between 1996 and 2004. He is taken to the sick bay, where a man named Minkowski is strapped to a bed because he is experiencing similar problems. [...] Minkowski explains that someone sabotaged the radio room two days earlier and that Desmond's ex-girlfriend Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger) {{has been trying to}} contact the freighter. [...] Sayid uses the satellite phone to contact Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) on the island and explains that Desmond appears to have amnesia. Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), a physicist from the freighter, asks Jack whether Desmond has recently been exposed to a high level of radiation or electromagnetism. Jack is unsure, and so Daniel speaks to Desmond and asks him about his situation. [...] Desmond responds that he believes that he is in 1996 and is serving with the Royal Scots. Faraday understands and tells Desmond that when he returns to 1996, he needs to go to the physics department of The Queen's College, Oxford University in England to meet with Daniel's past self, and gives Desmond some mechanical settings to relay, along with an extra phrase that Daniel assures him will convince Daniel's past self that the story is legitimate.|$|E
2500|$|While both {{fighters were}} the same age (23), Corrales had several {{physical}} advantages over Mayweather: two inches in height, an inch in reach and (despite both arriving at the official weight-in at the 130-lb super-featherweight limit) unofficially 146lbs, versus Mayweather's 136½ lbs. In the bout, Mayweather won every round and knocked down Corrales five times (three times in round 7 and twice in round 10). After the fifth knockdown, Corrales' cornermen climbed onto the apron and stopped the fight, thereby establishing Mayweather as a claimant to boxing's mythical pound-for-pound title. At {{the time of the}} stoppage Mayweather was ahead on the scorecards, leading by 89–79, 90–79, and 90–78. Throughout the fight, HBO commentators analyzed Mayweather. Larry Merchant stated, [...] "Mayweather fights in a tradition of boxing and quick handedness that goes back in Michigan, all the way to fighters like Sugar Ray Robinson". Harold Lederman remarked, Jim (Lampley), I gotta tell ya, I'm terribly impressed, I don't think I've seen an exhibition of boxing like this since Willie Pep, this kid is unbelievable, great legs, great speed, unbelievable ring-generalship.
