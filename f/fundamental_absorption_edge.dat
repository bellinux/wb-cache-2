The red shift (radiation-induced optical darkening effect) is detected within the period of 2 - 3 months after y-irradiation able to cause the well-known static radiation-induced optical effect. The detected decrease in the slope of curve in the <b>fundamental</b> optical <b>absorption</b> <b>edge</b> region after y-irradiation, resulting in the maximum difference of optical transmittance for the unirradiated and y- irradiated samples max at the level 33. 5 %, can be interpreted within the radiationinduced defect formation processes occurring in the structural network of glass.

The lattice dynamics is characterized by a large number of phonons due to a low P 1 space group symmetry and a large unit cell with Z= 10. Unusually rich set of phonons was found in the low-energy part of the infrared and Raman spectra below 100 cm^- 1, which we tentatively assign to interlayer vibrations activated by a crystal superstructure and/or to weak force constants for modes related to some structural groups. Several phonons show anomalous behavior {{in the vicinity of the}} magnetic phase transition at T_N= 10 K thus evidencing magnetoelastic interaction. No new phonons were found below T_N, which excludes the spin-Peierls type of the magnetic transition.
