5|$|As a child, Marmaduke was academically {{gifted and}} also a keen boxer and long-distance swimmer. He also took a keen {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>mechanical</b> things, particularly combustion engines, and was building Meccano models of aircraft and other vehicles {{by the age of}} 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never a hard worker and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E

After flight {{training}} in Oklahoma, he was stationed in Alaska where {{he served as a}} F-4E Aircraft commander and NORAD Alert Force commander. During the Cold War, his duties included commanding squadrons to intercept Soviet military aircraft. In 1980, as budget cutbacks were reducing his squadron's flying time, Fletcher turned down a regular commission in the Air Force. He left the Air Force with the rank of captain, having received the Air Force Commendation Medal and the Outstanding Unit Award.|$|E

He re{{enlisted in the}} United States Air Force, earning his pilot's wings in 1951. Grissom flew over 100 combat missions during the Korean War, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with an oak leaf cluster. He was reassigned to work as a flight instructor at Bryan Air Force Base. He attended the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology for a year and earned a bachelor's degree in aeromechanics.|$|E

Despite problems understanding differential equations, and twice attempting to transfer to another school (which his father would not permit), he overcame his difficulties with complex mathematics and graduated in 1924 with a Bachelor of Science degree <b>in</b> <b>mechanical</b> engineering. While at Georgia Tech he participated in varsity football as a walk-on substitute, and boxing. Hansell was awarded Georgia Tech's highest individual recognition, membership in the ANAK Society.|$|E

In 1978, she received her degree <b>in</b> <b>mechanical</b> engineering from the University of Washington. Soon after graduation, Roffey married Jewell, and the couple moved to Oklahoma, both having accepted engineering jobs with Mobil.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the Georgia Institute of Technology {{can be traced back}} to Reconstruction-era plans to develop the {{industrial}} base of the Southern United States. Founded on October 13, 1885 in Atlanta as the Georgia School of Technology, the university opened in 1888 after the construction of Tech Tower and a shop building and only offered one degree <b>in</b> <b>mechanical</b> engineering. By 1901, degrees in electrical, civil, textile, and chemical engineering were also offered. In 1948, the name was changed to the Georgia Institute of Technology to reflect its evolution from an engineering school to a full technical institute and research university.|$|E

5|$|Those {{materials}} are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even {{higher than that}} of diamond. Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10nm is also reported to have Vickers hardness comparable or higher than diamond. Because of much better stability to heat and transition metals, c-BN surpasses diamond <b>in</b> <b>mechanical</b> applications, such as machining steel. The thermal conductivity of BN is among the highest of all electric insulators (see table).|$|E
5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs <b>in</b> <b>mechanical</b> industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E
