40|$|In actual {{hot runner}} {{systems for the}} {{injection}} moulding process, the control of polymers in gate is passive, {{which means that the}} melt temperature distribution and associated flow conductance is governed by a balance of heat convection by the flowing melt with heat conduction from the hot melt to the cold mould. This paper examines the rheological and thermal behaviour of a PA 66 during freeze-off and melt flow activation. Numerical simulations were carried out according to the Finite Volume Method as implemented in the Ansys CFX® code. Rheological and thermal data were obtained from a careful material characterization conducted on a capillary rheometer and a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The analyses indicated that relatively small changes in melt temperature and injection pressure can substantially increase the flow conductance and dynamically control both the gate freezing and the onset of melt flow in the subsequent cycle. Therefore, simple gate thermal actuators were designed and numerically implemented to active control the plastic melt flow. This numerical approach can be used to design and optimize the active control of <b>hot</b> <b>runners</b> gate when the use of mechanical actuation (i. e. valve gates) is not suitable due to excessive cost, critical maintenance or miniaturization of the entire system...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{pharmaceutical}} tablets {{are manufactured}} in large batch operations that have inefficiencies {{associated with the}} stopping, re-configuration and testing between batches. Continuous manufacturing {{has the potential to}} lower manufacturing costs and energy consumption while enhancing process reliability and flexibility. Although there are many manufacturing processes that could make an impact in this sector, I focused on hot extrusion molding. Hot extrusion molding consists of heat melting a pharmaceutical resin in an extruder and packing it in a mold where it is allowed to solidify until it is ready to be ejected. I designed a hot extrusion molding system after estimating the injection pressure and cooling parameters needed to meet functional requirements. As a result, I realized the importance of using a <b>hot</b> <b>runner</b> system in order to meet criteria and be able to produce the tablets. The <b>hot</b> <b>runner</b> allows for the temperature of the melt to be controlled up until it is to be extruded into the mold, preventing pre-mature solidification and clogging in the system.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} experiments focused {{on the study of}} rheological behavior of a polymer flowing through a narrow section at the forming by injection of thin-walled plastic parts. The paper addresses the use of ultrasonically activated injection for fabrication of polymeric parts with thin wall features. In the experiment, a part with six different geometric features has been created. The design-of-experiments approach is applied to correlate the quality of the parts with the processing parameters. Four processing parameters are investigated using a screening factorial experimentation plan to determine their possible effect on the filling quality of the moulded parts. The experiments have been conducted on a <b>hot</b> <b>runner</b> mould with two nests in which the final (nest) nozzle has been modified to host, as the central element, the ultrasonic horn of a sonic system. It has been found that the ultrasonic activation applied on the active part of the mould does not play an important role as a stand-alone factor but could amplify or strengthen the effect of classical setting parameters (and influence factors) of the process: the melt temperature and injection pressure. Because it is easier to stimulate and to control rheological properties of the melt by setting the intensity of ultrasonic energy and, more important, the effect is forthwith, the paper recommends the runner systems with ultrasonic activation as an alternative for the <b>hot</b> <b>runner</b> with heating elements...|$|R
