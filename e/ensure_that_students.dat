Meanwhile, to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> from low-income families have access to higher education, the government has initiated effective ways of assistance, with policies and measures as scholarships, work-study programs, subsidies for students with special economic difficulties, tuition reduction or exemption and state stipends.|$|E
25|$|The {{promotion}} and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise {{awareness about the}} benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population. For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary. One example for handwashing promotion in schools is the “Three Star Approach” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements. When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars. Building hand washing stations can be a part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.|$|E
25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected to do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> will be prepared for life after school.|$|E

2500|$|Caldwell also {{removed the}} {{controversial}} Youth News Network from Manitoba schools. [...] The network's parent company, Athena Education Partners, had previously offered free technology to schools {{in return for}} requiring students to watch daily YNN broadcasts, which included commercials from private corporations. [...] According to Todd Scarth of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, YNN televisions were equipped with two-way monitoring systems to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> were watching and that the volume was not adjusted. [...] Athena's contracts also required schools to hire a half-day technician to maintain YNN equipment. [...] Caldwell described YNN's programming as [...] "clearly an unsatisfactory curriculum choice" [...] for children, and oversaw the program's elimination once previously-signed contracts were concluded in August 2000. [...] The network was also banned in other provinces, and went off the air in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|John Harris, {{an expert}} in bioethics, {{has said that it}} would be {{unethical}} to stop healthy people taking the drug. He pointed out the logical non sequitur which would result if people were to draw a parallel between the claims of a university that they could [...] "set out deliberately to improve the mental capacities of its students; suppose its stated aims were to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> left the university more intelligent and learned than when they arrived. Suppose they further claimed that not only could they achieve this but that their students would be more intelligent and mentally alert than any students in history." [...] He then asked the rhetorical question of whether, [...] "if the claims could be sustained, should we be pleased?" [...] He argues that it would be [...] "not rational" [...] and against human enhancement to not use the drug to improve people's cognitive abilities.|$|E
2500|$|Self-determination is {{the ability}} to make choices and {{exercise}} a high degree of control, such as what the student does and how they do it (Deci et al., 1991; Reeve, Hamm, & Nix, 2003; Ryan & Deci, 2002). Self-determination can be supported by providing opportunities for students to be challenged, such as leadership opportunities, providing appropriate feedback and fostering, establishing and maintaining good relationships between teachers and students. These strategies can increase students' interest, competence, creativity and desire to be challenged and <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> are intrinsically motivated to study. On the other hand, students who lack self-determination are more likely to feel their success is out of their control. Such students lose motivation to study, which causes a state of [...] "helpless learning". Students who feel helpless readily believe they will fail and therefore cease to try. Over time, a vicious circle of low achievement develops.|$|E

Jackson came to Lewis Institute from the University of Kansas where he {{was head of the}} electrical engineering department, the same position held by his father at MIT. Addressing the First Assembly of the 1936–37 school year, Jackson noted that Lewis Institute must keep a vigilant eye on the courses offered, to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> would be prepared {{to meet the needs of}} business and industry—not only at the time, but for the industries of the future. During his short term of leadership, Jackson also contributed to the organization of the faculty, clarifying the roles of department heads within the institute.

2500|$|Best {{practices}} {{for school psychologists}} are to be multiculturally competent when providing the 10 domains of practices and services. [...] Through training and experiences, multicultural competence for school psychologists extends to race, ethnicity, social class, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age, and geographic region [...] [...] School psychologists realize the need to understand and accept their own cultural beliefs and values {{in order to understand}} the impact it may have when delivering services to clients and families. [...] For example, school psychologists <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> who are minorities, including African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans are being equally represented at the system level, in the classroom, and receiving special education services. [...] School psychologists also work with teachers and educators to provide an integrated multicultural education classroom and curriculum that allows more students to be represented in learning. The types of services that school psychologists need to provide in order to be multiculturally competent are [...] "culturally competent assessments and consultation services, social justice, sensitivity to ELL students, assessing cultural bias in tests, nondiscriminatory assessments and consultations, cultural literacy, culturally competent crisis response, disproportionality in special education, developing culturally sensitive prevention programs, culturally competent mental health services, and promoting home-school relationships with culturally diverse families". [...] School psychologists need to use their skills, knowledge, and professional practices in promoting diversity and advocating for services for all students, families, teachers, and schools.|$|E
