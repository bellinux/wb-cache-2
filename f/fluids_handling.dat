40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the distribution patterns and exposure concentrations of bioaerosols in industries suspected to have high levels of bioaerosol exposure. Methods: We selected 11 plants including 3 livestock feed plants (LF industry), 3 metal working <b>fluids</b> <b>handling</b> plants (MWFs industry), and 5 sawmills and measured total airborne bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, as well as dust. Airborne bacteria and fungi were measured with one stage impactor, six stage cascade impactor, and gelatin filters. Endotoxins were measured with polycarbonate filters. Results: The geometric means (GM) of the airborne concentrations of bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins were 1, 864, 2, 252  CFU/m 3, and 31. 5 EU/m 3, respectively at the sawmills, followed by the LF industry (535, 585  CFU/m 3, and 22. 0 EU/m 3) and MWFs industry (258, 331  CFU/m 3, and 8. 7 EU/m 3). These concentrations by industry type were significantly statistically different (p < 0. 01). The ratio of indoor to outdoor concentration was 6. 2, 1. 9, 3. 2, and 3. 2 for bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, and dust in the LF industry, 5. 0, 0. 9, 2. 3, and 12. 5 in the MWFs industry, and 3. 7, 4. 1, 3. 3, and 9. 7 in sawmills. The respiratory fractions of bioaerosols were differentiated by bioaerosol types and industry types: the respiratory fraction of bacteria in the LF industry, MWF industry, and sawmills was 59. 4 %, 72. 0 %, and 57. 7 %, respectively, and that of fungi was 77. 3 %, 89. 5 %, and 83. 7 % in the same order. Conclusion: We found that bioaerosol concentration was the highest in sawmills, followed by LF industry facilities and MWFs industry facilities. The indoor/outdoor ratio of microorganisms was larger than 1 and respiratory fraction of microorganisms was more than 50 % of the total microorganism concentrations which might penetrate respiratory tract easily. All these findings suggest that bioaerosol in the surveyed industries should be controlled to prevent worker respiratory diseases...|$|E

40|$|An {{extensive}} experimental {{program was}} initiated {{for the purpose}} of understanding the mechanisms leading to bubble generation during <b>fluid</b> <b>handling</b> procedures in a microgravity environment. Several key <b>fluid</b> <b>handling</b> procedures typical for PCG experiments were identified for analysis in that program. Experiments were designed to specifically understand how such procedures can lead to bubble formation. The experiments were then conducted aboard the NASA KC- 135 aircraft which is capable of simulating a low gravity environment by executing a parabolic flight attitude. However, such a flight attitude can only provide a low gravity environment of approximately 10 - 2 go for a maximum period of 30 seconds. Thus all of the tests conducted for these experiments were designed to last no longer than 20 seconds. Several experiments were designed to simulate some of the more relevant <b>fluid</b> <b>handling</b> procedures during protein crystal growth experiments. These include submerged liquid jet cavitation, filling of a cubical vessel, submerged surface scratch, attached drop growth, liquid jet impingement, and geysering experiments. To date, four separate KC- 135 flight campaigns were undertaken specifically for performing these experiments. However, different experiments were performed on different flights...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Fluid</b> <b>handling</b> {{systems such}} as pump and fan systems are {{found to have a}} {{significant}} potential for energy efficiency improvements. To deliver the energy saving potential, {{there is a need for}} easily implementable methods to monitor the system output. This is because information is needed to identify inefficient operation of the <b>fluid</b> <b>handling</b> system and to control the output of the pumping system according to process needs. Model-based pump or fan monitoring methods implemented in variable speed drives have proven to be able to give information on the system output without additional metering; however, the current model-based methods may not be usable or sufficiently accurate in the whole operation range of the <b>fluid</b> <b>handling</b> device. To apply model-based system monitoring in a wider selection of systems and to improve the accuracy of the monitoring, this paper proposes a new method for pump and fan output monitoring with variable-speed drives. The method uses a combination of already known operating point estimation methods. Laboratory measurements are used to verify the benefits and applicability of the improved estimation method, and the new method is compared with five previously introduced model-based estimation methods.

40|$|Wettable {{nonwoven}} topsheets {{are traditionally}} spunbond polypropylene nonwoven fabrics. The <b>fluid</b> <b>handling</b> performance of hydroentangled greige cotton nonwovens was studied {{to determine their}} suitability for topsheet applications based upon analysis of fluid rewet, strikethrough, and acquisition properties; and the relative contributions of nonwoven cotton’s cellulosic and wax components to hydrophobic and hydrophilic fluid transport properties are addressed. It was observed that mechanically cleaned greige cotton nonwovens exhibit certain <b>fluid</b> <b>handling</b> properties {{that are similar to}} polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets, {{partly as a result of}} the residual wax content. Subsequently, the surface polarity, swelling, and moisture uptake of 100 % greige cotton and 50 : 50 blends of greige cotton and polypropylene hydroentangled nonwovens were studied in comparison with the performance of a commercially available 100 % polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets. The surface polarity, swelling, and wettability values obtained from electrokinetic and water contact angle analysis were found to be in agreement with the hydrophobic polypropylene topsheets. Additionally, comfort assessment was undertaken based upon fabric handle profiles using the Leeds University Fabric Handle Evaluation System, which is an objective evaluation based on the quantification of fabric buckling deformations. Of the fabrics studied in this work, 50 : 50 greige cotton/polypropylene hydroentangled fabrics were the softest as determined by the Leeds University Fabric Handle Evaluation System and exhibited <b>fluid</b> <b>handling</b> properties consistent with the requirements of commercial topsheets...|$|R
