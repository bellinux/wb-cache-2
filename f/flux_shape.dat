40|$|Most modern nodal {{methods used}} today {{are based upon}} the {{transverse}} integration procedure in which the multi-dimensional <b>flux</b> <b>shape</b> is integrated over the transverse directions {{in order to produce}} a set of coupled one-dimensional flux shapes. The one-dimensional flux shapes are then solved either analytically or by representing the <b>flux</b> <b>shape</b> by a finite polynomial expansion. While these methods have been verified for most light-water reactor applications, they have been found to have difficulty predicting the large thermal flux gradients near the interfaces of highly-enriched MOX fuel assemblies. A new method is presented here in which the neutron flux is represented by a non-seperable, two-dimensional, semi-analytic flux expansion. The main features of this method are (1) the leakage terms from the node are modeled explicitly and therefore, the transverse integration procedure is not used, (2) the corner point flux values for each node are directly edited from the solution method, and a corner-point interpolation is not needed in the flux reconstruction, (3) the thermal flux expansion contains hyperbolic terms representing analytic solutions to the thermal flux diffusion equation, and (4) the thermal flux expansion contains a thermal to fast flux ratio term which reduces the number of polynomial expansion functions needed to represent the thermal flux. This new nodal method has been incorporated into the computer code COLOR 2 G and has been used to solve a two-dimensional, two-group colorset problem containing uranium and highly-enriched MOX fuel assemblies. The results from this calculation are compared to the results found using a code based on the traditional transverse integration procedure...|$|E

40|$|Breaking the up-down {{symmetry}} of tokamaks removes a constraint limiting intrinsic momentum transport, and hence toroidal rotation, to be small. Using gyrokinetic theory, we study {{the effect of}} different up-down asymmetric <b>flux</b> surface <b>shapes</b> on the turbulent transport of momentum. This is done by perturbatively expanding the gyrokinetic equation in large <b>flux</b> surface <b>shaping</b> mode number. It is found that the momentum <b>flux</b> generated by <b>shaping</b> that lacks mirror symmetry (which is necessarily up-down asymmetric) has a power law scaling with the shaping mode number. However, the momentum flux generated by mirror symmetric <b>flux</b> surface <b>shaping</b> (even if it is up-down asymmetric) decays exponentially with large shaping mode number. These scalings are consistent with nonlinear local gyrokinetic simulations and indicate that low mode number shaping effects (e. g. elongation, triangularity) are optimal for creating rotation.

This fact is used to investigate how different <b>flux</b> surface <b>shapes</b> penetrate from the edge. Then, a technique to separate {{the effects of}} magnetic pressure and tension in the Grad-Shafranov equation is presented and used to calculate radial profiles of strong elongation for nearly constant current profiles.

One dimensional mixing coefficients are computed using synthesis equations. The governing synthesis equations are derived by applying a variational principle.

However, mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel assemblies possess much higher absorption and fission cross- sections when compared to standard UO 2 assemblies.

It has already been reported that standard flux reconstruction methods (that recover the homogeneous intranodal <b>flux</b> <b>shape</b> using the converged nodal solution) yield large errors {{in the presence of}} MOX assemblies. In an accompanying paper, we compare diffusion and simplified PN calculations of a mixed-oxide benchmark problem to a reference transport calculation.

Then we include additional neutrino production modes, the neutrinos from muon decays, the magnetic field effects on all secondary species, and flavor mixing with the current parameter uncertainties. We demonstrate that the combination of these effects modifies the shape of the original Waxman-Bahcall GRB flux significantly, and changes the normalization by a factor of three to four. As a consequence, the gamma-ray burst search strategy of neutrino telescopes may be based on the wrong <b>flux</b> <b>shape,</b> and the constraints derived for the GRB neutrino flux, such as the baryonic loading, may in fact be already much stronger than anticipated.

40|$|One {{method of}} {{determining}} the flux density is flux synthesis which approximates the flux in the core by linear combinations of precomputed shape functions. In traditional flux synthesis, the unknown mixing coefficients are determined using a weighted residual method of solving the diffusion equation. In the instrumented synthesis method, the mixing coefficients are determined using count rates from neutron detectors in the core. In this way the mixing coefficients are linked to conditions in the reactor. Using the synthesized flux, kinetics parameters, notably reactivity, can be calculated in real time. An experimental evaluation has been performed in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Reactor, MITR-II. Detector measurements have been collected using fission chambers placed at {{the periphery of the}} core. The reactor was put into a number of various conditions, both static and transient, and data were collected using a digital acquisition system for later combination with shape functions. Transients included increasing power, decreasing power, and a reactor scram. The shape functions were generated using Version 3. 0 of the QUARTZ code, a quadratic nodal diffusion theory code in triangular-Z geometry. Supernodal analysis algorithms {{have been added to the}} original program, along with subroutines to guarantee diagonal dominance of the leakage matrix in the finite difference or quadratic current approximations in the coarse mesh. The agreement between coarse mesh and fine mesh in all cases is excellent, with finite difference coarse mesh solutions generally slightly better. The synthesis method has been shown to accurately reflect the changes from an initial condition by combining representative <b>flux</b> <b>shapes.</b> It can be concluded that, with proper calibration of the measurement system and inclusion of representative <b>flux</b> <b>shapes,</b> the instrumented synthesis method will properly predict the flux in the core under a number of conditions...|$|R
