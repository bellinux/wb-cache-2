500|$|Pavelić and his {{followers}} intended to create an [...] "ethnically pure" [...] Croatia through the mass murder and deportation of Serbs, Jews and other non-Croats. Only about {{fifty percent of the}} NDH's 6.2 million inhabitants were Croat. Nearly two million Serbs, about one-third of the NDH's total population, now found themselves within the borders of the newly formed state. In addition, Serb-majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's total landmass. [...] "The Croatian state cannot exist if 1.8 million Serbs are living in it and if we have a powerful Serbian state at our backs," [...] Croatia's future Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković explained. [...] "Therefore, we are trying to make the Serbs disappear from our regions." [...] Dido Kvaternik, a senior Ustaše official, was entrusted with [...] "cleansing" [...] Bjelovar and its surroundings. The younger Kvaternik recalled: [...] "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when Pavelić decided that I should take over the implementation of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed immediately and without hesitation because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> question had to be resolved {{for the future of the}} Croatian people and state, and that someone had to make the sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out." [...] Pavelić's orders for the extermination of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained.|$|E
2500|$|The son of {{an estate}} agent from a working-class background, Robert Fripp was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England. On Christmas Day 1957, aged 11, he got a [...] "very cheap" [...] guitar from his parents, saying [...] "almost {{immediately}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> guitar {{was going to be}} my life". Fripp took guitar lessons with teachers Kathleen Gartell and Don Strike, which quickly advanced his skills: at 11 years of age, he was playing rock, moving on to traditional jazz at 13 and modern jazz at 15. At this time he was influenced by such modern jazz players and composers as Charlie Parker and Charlie Mingus.|$|E
2500|$|Bublé grew up {{listening}} to his grandfather's collection of jazz records and credits his grandfather in encouraging his love for jazz music. [...] "My grandfather was really my best friend growing up. He was the one who opened me up to a whole world of music that seemed to have been passed over by my generation. Although I like rock and roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the Mills Brothers, something magical happened. The lyrics were so romantic, so real, the way a song should be for me. It was like seeing my future flash before me. I wanted to be a singer and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the music that I wanted to sing." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was when <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the real deal, that the magic was about to happen again. Suddenly we could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
60|$|I nodded, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was so. Then, at some whispered {{word from}} Martina, Heliodore spoke.|$|E
60|$|Thus he wailed, {{then came}} the sound of sword blows and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> prophet was dead also.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, Mademoiselle, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> more. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> hinted {{conspiracy}} {{against your}} father is a trumped-up lie to lure you to the coppice." ...|$|R
60|$|THE GRAND DUCHESS. You promised everything. You swore anything. [She marches as if {{in front}} of a regiment.] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> man alone can rouse the army to enthusiasm.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Of course <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{has been}} in both our minds, Rosa, and of course I am in honour bound to confess freely {{that it does not}} {{originate}} with you.’ ...|$|R
60|$|I {{forced a}} laugh. It rang hollow against the barrier that {{separated}} us. In my heart <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> barrier {{was not to}} be laughed away.|$|E
60|$|So I feared. A dreadful {{night was}} to pass before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{was the day}} of the release of Sanders Webster, and that frail Nanny had walked into Tilliedrum to meet him at the prison gate.|$|E
60|$|Instantly <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{newcomer}} had bribed his way {{within the}} garden. Then {{he turned in}} the direction of the two women, and I saw that he was none other than Thurid, the black dator of the First Born.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea," [...] {{said the}} Prior, [...] "so thou hast told me ere now, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> knight is so poor {{that he will}} gladly sign away his lands for two hundred pounds of hard money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can. I will be so, when <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is settled. <b>I</b> do {{not wish}} to {{interfere}} with his fortune. There is my letter to his mother, and now I will go back to Stratton." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{believe in}} the {{modality}} of abstraction as the core of human experience and expression. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> perception of abstraction is due to an indigenous and culturally-based disposition due to my being one half Navajo. - Lorenzo Clayton ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{returned}} to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> might last for many hours, {{and that it would}} probably end in the silence of the grave.|$|E
60|$|Then my spirits sank again, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was possible. There is a path, steep but short, {{across the}} hills between Thrums {{and the top}} of the glen, which Mr. Glendinning took {{frequently}} when he had to preach at both places on the same Sabbath. It is still called the Minister's Road.|$|E
60|$|I {{found it}} {{difficult}} to fit from laughing as the gestures of the Abbe, especially when I thought of my brother and how they would mock them; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be unpardonable bad taste, and as I had come in too late to have the clue to the discourse, I amused myself with looking about me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And how do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is {{not some}} infernal trap of yours? Tell me how you found out all this, or by Hercules (he had quite {{forgotten}} his Christianity by this time)--by Hercules and the Twelve Gods, I'll--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cease," [...] he answered, [...] "most beloved, I {{was weak}} and wandering, now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{is not a}} dream, and I thank Caleb who has brought us {{together}} again, against his wish, I think. Say, what must I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Again: [...] "I fancy that God {{ought to}} be good. But how do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He really is good? I see the world full of injustice, and misery, and death. How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not God's doing, God's fault in some way?" ...|$|R
60|$|And then {{suddenly}} I had the great idea. It {{came to me}} like a flash, I looked at her, crying there, and I looked over the rail at Charlie the Boy Wonder, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was where I got a stranglehold on my place in the Hall of Fame, along with the great thinkers of the age.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{reserved}} it till now," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> being the second night, {{you would find}} it impossible to get to sleep at all without something in you, however small. If you manage to sleep on this and the cup of hot tea, you'll maybe rest well till morning--and then--" ...|$|E
60|$|At last I heard Ja {{shouting}} to {{the survivors}} in the dugouts--they were all {{quite close to}} us now--offer-ing them their lives if they would surrender. Perry was standing close behind Ja, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> merciful action was prompted, perhaps commanded, by the old man; for no Pellucidarian {{would have thought of}} showing leniency to a defeated foe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mrs. Cliff, has {{anything}} happened to you? Have {{you had any}} set-backs? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a mighty queer world, and that even the richest people can often come down with a sudden thump just {{as if they had}} slipped on the ice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's just it," [...] I answered: [...] "and, M. de Cartienne, {{now that}} you have spoken to me of it, I will tell you something. Your son does play a good deal with Lord Silchester. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is so, for I have played myself occasionally." ...|$|R
2500|$|After Bush {{commuted}} Libby's sentence, Thompson {{released a}} statement: [...] "I am very happy for Scooter Libby. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{is a great}} relief to him, his wife and children. This will allow a good American, who {{has done a lot}} for his country, to resume his life." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted the}} men of Helium to see me {{and to know that}} their beloved princess was here, too, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{knowledge}} would inspire them to even greater deeds of valor than they had performed in the past, though great indeed must have been those which won for them a way into the almost impregnable palace of the tyrant of the north.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> remark {{applied to}} Grace's wish {{to dwell on}} the unknown future, and did not receive it as a reproach in any other sense. As she seemed calm, however, I was willing to indulge her wish to {{converse}} with me, so long as she dwelt on subjects that did not agitate her. Speaking of her hopes of heaven had a contrary effect, and I made no further opposition.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true as gospel, M. Henri. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{would be}} the worst of the whole affair to you. I knew you would sooner the château should have been burnt than have heard this. We are only waiting for you and M. de Lescure, to hang him as a traitor from the big {{chestnut}} out on the road-side. You might have seen as you came in, that they have the ropes and everything ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{would not}} suit you,--as I feel sure that such delay would gall you every day, as I doubt {{whether it would}} not make you sick of me long before the four years be over,--my advice is, that we should let this matter drop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed {{this will}} do," [...] said Mirah, entreatingly. [...] "It is all real, you know," [...] here {{she looked at}} Hans--"even if it seemed theatrical. Poor Berenice sitting on the ruins--any {{one might say that}} was theatrical, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is just what she would do." ...|$|R
50|$|I feel {{completely}} {{left out}} of the realm of everything that is so important to me. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is partly because punk rock is for and by boys mostly and partly because punk rock of this generation is coming of age in a time of mindless career-goal bands.|$|R
