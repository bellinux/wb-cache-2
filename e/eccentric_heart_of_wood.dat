50|$|He {{always gave}} his eyes a look indefinable. With the simple turn of their heads, {{or with a}} change of lighting, rose smiling expressions, or unhappy, or dreamers. This gave one the {{impression}} that the puppet hid more than it showed, and its <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> stored even more.|$|R

50|$|In his mature {{works the}} painter’s style becomes synthetic; his {{objective}} on the formal side is maximum simplicity. Material objects and narrative elements, considered redundant, are eliminated. The landscape becomes reduced to immaterial {{forces of nature}} and ungraspable impressions such as vast vacuous spaces, the darkness in the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>woods</b> or atmospheric phenomena e.g. the pre-storm blackness of heavens, the mist or the gust of wind during torrential rain.|$|R

5000|$|Ryhope Wood is {{an ancient}} {{woodland}} that has been undisturbed since {{the last ice age}} and appears no more than three square miles in area from the outside. Ryhope Wood {{is an example of a}} parallel universe that overlaps a section of the real world. The wood is much, much bigger on the inside than on the outside. Once penetrated, it grows larger, older and more unbearable as one approaches the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wood.</b> [...] Lavondyss is the name of the remote ice-age <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> Ryhope <b>wood.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "The superstition goes further," [...] Dominey continued. [...] "Our locals {{say that}} {{somewhere in the}} <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wood,</b> where I believe that no human being for many years has dared to penetrate, there is living in the spiritual sense {{some sort of a}} demon who comes out only at night and howls {{underneath}} my windows." ...|$|R

6000|$|From myself, {{although}} {{trained in}} the craft <b>of</b> the <b>woods,</b> I could not conceal the danger that I incurred. Yet the danger was almost forgotten in the extraordinary and novel interest that attached to the experiment. Would it prove possible for a man, unaided by our civilized arts and industries, to maintain himself naked--except for his union suit--in the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the <b>woods?</b> Could he do it, or could he not? And if he couldn't what then? ...|$|R
50|$|P. alba {{is often}} {{cultivated}} as an ornamental plant. In Cambodia pagodas especially choose this shrub, with the flowers used in ritual offerings to the deities, {{they are sometimes}} used to make necklaces which decorate coffins. In addition, the flowers are edible and eaten as fritters, while the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wood</b> is part <b>of</b> a traditional medical preparation taken as a vermifuge or as a laxative.|$|R
60|$|Only {{when the}} day was near its end did I give up my quest, feeling very keenly disappointed. It then struck me {{that the cause of}} the elusive creature's {{behaviour}} was that she had been piqued at my discovery of her in one of her most secret hiding-places in the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wood,</b> and that it had pleased her to pay me out in this manner.|$|R

60|$|Only the {{youngest}} sister {{he had not}} bewitched. He took her into the cottage, and from that time she was obliged to keep house for him. She was not very unhappy, but one thought troubled her. What if the old man should die and leave her here alone in the solitary cottage deep in the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wood!</b> She would be as 'terribly lonely' as he had formerly been.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} {{of the church is}} from <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> pine <b>wood</b> (the center <b>of</b> a pine tree, saturated with sap). This wood also is known in the West Florida dialect as [...] "Fat Lighter". The term [...] "fat" [...] refers to the saturated sap. The term [...] "Lighter" [...] refers to [...] "lighting" [...] or [...] "burning"; as small spikes <b>of</b> this special <b>wood</b> can be used to begin combustion. Upon aging, the wood becomes very strong, impervious to termites or water damage.|$|R
5000|$|As {{opposed to}} those who insist maps “represent” reality the {{critical}} cartographers, led by Wood, have insisted maps represent nothing. Instead, they present an argument about {{the world through the}} careful choice of content arranged graphically at a specific scale. [...] This thesis, and the mechanisms of its activation, is at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wood</b> and John Fels 2008 University of Chicago Press publication, The Natures of Maps. [...] As one reviewer put it: “In 1986 Wood and Fels took apart the map; describing ten codes through which its signs create meaning. Their argument was subsequently enfolded into <b>Wood’s</b> The Power <b>of</b> Maps …Twenty-one years later, Wood and Fels have put the map back together again ‘by replacing the whole idea of the map as a representation with that of the map as a system of propositions.’” “The map is not a picture,” Wood and Fels insist in this new book, “It is an argument … everything about a map, from top to bottom, is an argument.” ...|$|R
50|$|The pillar on {{one side}} of the tokonoma is usually made <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> {{specially}} prepared for the purpose. It can range from a seemingly raw trunk with bark still attached, to a square piece <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>wood</b> with very straight grain. The choice of toko-bashira determines the level of formality for the tokonoma.|$|R
50|$|The fragrance, {{signed by}} perfumer Pierre Negrin, {{is based on}} aromatic, fresh spicy and woody notes, while still giving off a fresh and clean smell.

60|$|Br'er Rabbit {{is a funny}} fellow. No {{wonder that}} Uncle Remus makes him the hero of so many adventures! Uncle Remus had watched him, no doubt, on some {{moonlight}} night when he gathered his boon companions together for a frolic. In the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the <b>woods</b> it was, in a little opening where the moonlight came streaming in through the pines, making soft gray shadows for hide-and-seek, and where no prowling fox ever dreamed of looking.|$|R

60|$|Half {{an hour of}} {{tramping}} {{brought the}} two Rover boys and their friends into the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the big <b>woods</b> Frank Newberry had mentioned. They had entered it {{by way of the}} road they had used on Hallowe'en, and were now almost directly behind Elias Lacy's farm. In fact, although they were not aware of this, a large section <b>of</b> the <b>woods</b> belonged to the old farmer.|$|R
60|$|No {{word was}} spoken by its inmates, as the coach bearing our young Enthusiast, Pierre, and his mournful party, sped forth through the dim dawn {{into the deep}} midnight, which still occupied, unrepulsed, the <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> the old <b>woods</b> through which the road wound, very shortly after quitting the village.|$|R
60|$|There {{is always}} a fascination in such places, where men have lived their simple lives in the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the <b>woods,</b> shut out from {{all the rest of}} the world during the long winter; so I began to prowl quietly about the shanties to see what I could find. The door of the low stable swung invitingly open, but it was a dark, musty, ill-smelling place now, though cozy enough in winter, and only the porcupines had invaded it. I left it after a glance and came round to the men's shanty.|$|R
5000|$|The Valia paani maram is {{a sacred}} {{instrument}} used only for rites in temples. It is made up <b>of</b> the <b>heart</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> jack <b>wood,</b> taken from the tree standing at the temple complex. On either side, it is covered with pieces of tanned leather of cow or bull-calf. Two hooks are provided on either side for tying a cloth so that the instrument rests either on the shoulder or wrist of the artist while beating it. It is beaten with palms. Before beating the drum {{it is essential that}} the player should change the cloth of the paani and have an unbleached new cloth. The leather on either side has to be rubbed with the paste of fresh boiled rice for smoothness.|$|R
60|$|As we {{sat there}} the Awkward Man passed by, with his gun over his {{shoulder}} and his dog at his side. He did not look like an awkward man, there in the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the maple <b>woods.</b> He strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed.|$|R
60|$|Jessamine {{opened her}} eyes with a little cry. They were on a remote country road, cool and dim and quiet, in the very <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the beech <b>woods.</b> Long banners <b>of</b> light fell athwart the grey boles. Along the roadsides grew sheets of {{feathery}} ferns. Above the sky was gloriously blue. The air was sweet with the wild woodsy smell of the forest.|$|R
