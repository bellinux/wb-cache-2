60|$|The affair {{occurred}} {{in one of}} the quick-grown Western cities in which the Sandersons were financially interested. They lived in the place for a number of months, and were soon the center of the fashionable! questionable! mushroom! set of <b>the</b> town. I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> an eye witness of the unique local travesty, which, together with my personal knowledge of the leading lady's adaptation for her part, enabled me to readily imagine the dramatic force of the situation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Damn that boy!' thought old Mr. Wardle to himself.--He <b>had</b> heard <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> his mother. 'Damn that boy! He {{must have}} been asleep. It's all imagination.' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had each}} told a <b>story,</b> and <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> usual {{assortment}} of mysterious noises and death warnings and sheeted spectres and so on, {{down through the}} whole catalogue of horrors--enough to satisfy any reasonable ghost-taster. But Jack, as usual, was dissatisfied. He said our stories were all second-hand stuff. There wasn't a man in <b>the</b> crowd who <b>had</b> ever seen or heard a ghost; all our so-called authentic stories had been told us by persons who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> other persons who saw the ghosts.|$|R

50|$|John Gilpin (18th century) was {{featured}} {{as the subject}} in a well-known comic ballad of 1782 by William Cowper, entitled The Diverting History of John Gilpin. Cowper <b>had</b> heard <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> his friend Lady Austen.|$|R
60|$|This version has, {{over all}} others, {{the merit of}} being written by an {{acquaintance}} of the seer, who was with him while the appearances were going on. The narrator was also present at an interview between the seer and Buckingham. His mention of Sir Ralph Freeman tallies with Clarendon's, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> Freeman. <b>The</b> ghost predicts the Restoration, and this is recorded before that happy event. Of course Mr. Towse may {{have been interested in}} Buckingham's career and may <b>have</b> invented <b>the</b> ghost (after discovering the secret token) {127} as an excuse for warning him.|$|R
5000|$|... "After <b>having</b> pitched <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> my {{life and}} finding out I had done {{something}} so unlikable, to have actual characters on television do that, I realized America wouldn't like them. That made me think twice about what to pitch next time." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Of {{the origin}} of the Hound of <b>the</b> Baskervilles there <b>have</b> been many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it {{occurred}} even as is here set forth. And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed. Learn then <b>from</b> this <b>story</b> not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.|$|R

5000|$|Kikuchi's {{book says}} that [...] "Ujou, who <b>had</b> heard <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> Kayo about Kimi being adopted, turned <b>the</b> <b>story</b> into a poem", but Kayo {{did not have}} many {{occasions}} to meet and talk with the Noguchis, {{and would not have}} been likely to discuss the illegitimate child she <b>had</b> before marriage. <b>The</b> relationship between the Noguchis and Suzukis probably never exceeded the men associating as co-workers and discussions about socialism.|$|R
5000|$|The {{short film}} Big Bad Wolves (2006) by Rajneel Singh takes a black-comedy-meets-fantasy {{approach}} by <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> told <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{point of view}} of Tarantino-style gangsters who try to convince each other that it is actually a fable about female sexuality. This version features a more classic, fairy tale approach to the narrative and visuals, but also utilizes a werewolf as a literal sexual predator.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mansour Effendi tells <b>the</b> <b>story</b> (vide supra, line 6) thus: Frosini was niece of the Archbishop of Joannina. Mouctar Pasha {{ordered her}} to come to his harem, and her father advised her to go; she did so. Mouctar, among other presents, gave her a ring of great value, which she wished to sell, and gave it for that purpose to a merchant, who offered it to the wife of Mouctar. That lady {{recognized}} the jewel as her own, and, discovering the intrigue, complained to Ali Pasha, who, the next night, seized her himself in his own house, and {{ordered her to}} be drowned. Mansour Effendi says he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brother and son of Frosini. This son was a child of six years old, and was in bed in his mother's chamber when Ali came to carry away his mother to death. He had a confused recollection of the horrid scene."--Travels in Albania, 1858, i. Ill, note 6.|$|R

50|$|While vacating the temple, the Dutch {{are said}} to have tried to destroy the {{structure}} by setting fire and bombardment. However their efforts were futile with the mandapams withstanding their battery attack. This is described by the French writer M Rennel, in his book A Description, Historical and Geographical, of India (1785), where the author claims he <b>has</b> heard <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> a former Dutch soldier {{who took part in the}} events.|$|R
50|$|Sir Walter Scott {{wrote that}} he <b>had</b> learned <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> an unsigned, undated letter, whose writer had learned it in turn from a Mrs. Helen Lawson Goldie of Dumfries. The {{original}} of Jeanie Deans was Helen Walker, whose experience was more austere than the fiction Scott wrote. Helen Walker died in late 1791. Sir Walter Scott erected a monument at Helen Walker's grave in the parish of Irongray, about six miles from Dumfries.|$|R
50|$|Onus himself, {{according}} to his daughter-in-law, who said she <b>had</b> heard <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> Onus's wife Mary, <b>had</b> picked up <b>the</b> word from a word list of indigenous terms. Some say he did it {{to get back at}} the city council for <b>having</b> deliberately upstaged <b>the</b> traditional Labour Day march with a popular carnival. Lin Onus, his son, stated that indeed his father had intended to play a prank in passing on the word with this sense.|$|R
50|$|Wagner {{claimed in}} his 1870 {{autobiography}} Mein Leben {{that he had}} been inspired to write the opera following a stormy sea crossing he made from Riga to London in July and August 1839. In his 1843 Autobiographic Sketch, Wagner acknowledged he <b>had</b> taken <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> Heinrich Heine's retelling of the legend in his 1833 satirical novel The Memoirs of Mister von Schnabelewopski (Aus den Memoiren des Herrn von Schnabelewopski). The central theme is redemption through love.|$|R
50|$|The Three Princes of Serendip is the English {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>story</b> Peregrinaggio di tre giovani figliuoli del re di Serendippo {{published}} by Michele Tramezzino in Venice in 1557.

50|$|After {{the death}} of Bruce Lee, several studios {{exploited}} the situation by making their own versions of Game of Death {{based on what they}} <b>had</b> learned of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> production stills and magazine articles.

5|$|Noteworthy also, {{is a story}} {{written down}} by Adam of Bremen in his Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) from 1075/6 about a certain {{foreigner}} called Hericus, who was slain and martyred while preaching among <b>the</b> Sueones. Adam <b>had</b> heard <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> King Sweyn II of Denmark. According to some historians, resemblance to later legend about an English-born Henricus, who was allegedly slain and martyred in Finland, is too striking to be a coincidence.|$|R

5000|$|Yohannes' {{body was}} carried back to Tigray guarded {{by a small}} party, who were {{overtaken}} by the Mahdist troops of Zeki Tummal near the Atbara River and who captured the sovereign's body.

5000|$|In March 1968, Bryan was prosecuted on an {{obscenity}} {{charge for}} printing {{an image of}} a nude woman in a record company advertisement for Leon Russell.

This incident occurred sometime in late 1859 or early 1860, but the police were unable to find any witnesses who would admit to <b>having</b> actually seen <b>the</b> body, only people who claimed to <b>have</b> heard <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>from</b> others.|$|R
