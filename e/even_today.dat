5|$|Even as a princely state, Mysore came to {{be counted}} among the more {{developed}} and urbanized regions of India. This period (1799–1947) also saw Mysore emerge {{as one of the}} important centres of art and culture in India. The Mysore kings were not only accomplished exponents of the fine arts and men of letters, they were enthusiastic patrons as well, and their legacies continue to influence music and art <b>even</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{sticking}} to the formulas of , which remain popular in Japan <b>even</b> <b>today,</b> Bashō aspired to reflect his real environment and emotions in his hokku.

5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} <b>even</b> <b>today</b> {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from {{the fact that he was}} a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.|$|E
5|$|As of 2003 {{there were}} still 138 Allied men with no known grave in the area, and they are commemorated at the Groesbeek Memorial. However, {{evidence}} of the battle is often discovered <b>even</b> <b>today,</b> and the bodies of Allied servicemen are reinterred at the Airborne Cemetery. When found, bodies are exhumed and Dutch Graves Registration staff attempt to identify them before they are reburied. One soldier of the Border Regiment was discovered and reburied in the cemetery in 2005 and another who had previously been unidentified was reburied in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Cubeb {{was thought}} {{by the people}} of Europe to be repulsive to demons, just as it was {{by the people of}} China. Ludovico Maria Sinistrari, a Catholic priest who wrote about methods of {{exorcism}} in the late 17th century, includes cubeb as an ingredient in an incense to ward off incubus. <b>Even</b> <b>today,</b> his formula for the incense is quoted by neopagan authors, some of whom also claim that cubeb can be used in love sachets and spells.|$|E

50|$|Aside {{from its}} ideological background, Orbin's main work {{was used for}} a long time {{as one of the few}} sources for {{segments}} of late medieval history of the South Slavs, from Carinthia and the Slovene Lands to Serbia and Bulgaria. <b>Even</b> <b>today's</b> historiography is often uncertain about how much truth there is in some of his writings and claims.|$|R

They are remembered for their activities in support of the consolidation of Albanian national awareness.|$|R
5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of purges that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt in North Korea <b>even</b> <b>today,</b> though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|In ca. 1550, Francisco de la Parra invented {{distinctive}} {{letters for}} ejectives in the Mayan languages of Guatemala, the tresillo and cuatrillo (and derivatives). These {{were used in}} all subsequent Franciscan writing, and are occasionally seen <b>even</b> <b>today.</b> In 1605, Alonso Urbano doubled consonants for ejectives in Otomi (pp, tt, ttz, cc / cqu), and similar systems were adapted to Mayan. Another approach, in Yucatec, was to add a bar to the letter, or to double the stem.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Erie had a {{significant}} Russian immigrant community, many members of which worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, {{a substantial number of}} these Russian immigrants were priestless (Bespopovtsy) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Orthodox Church. <b>Even</b> <b>today,</b> the gold-domed Church of the Nativity, on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{the second}} innings in Adelaide saw England set Australia a near-impossible 532 for victory; <b>even</b> <b>today,</b> the highest {{successful}} Test run chase is 418. Australia lost its first wicket at three when Jack Fingleton was bowled by Larwood. Woodfull {{was joined by}} Bradman, who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method, before being dismissed for 66. Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73, carrying his bat as his teammates capitulated around him. Australia was eventually all out for 193, with Oldfield unable to bat due to his fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|Most Democratic {{newspapers}} {{refused to}} support Bryan, the major exception being the New York Journal, controlled by William Randolph Hearst, whose fortune {{was based on}} silver mines. In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of Homer Davenport, Hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat, trampling on labor. McKinley was drawn as a child, easily controlled by big business. <b>Even</b> <b>today,</b> these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley: one as a heartless businessman, the other as a creature of Hanna and others of his ilk.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person. <b>Even</b> <b>today,</b> people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E
