40|$|Race {{cars are}} {{characterized}} by very high drive torques and handling performances. However, high torques are useless if they cannot be converted into vehicle acceleration due to macro-slippage of the <b>driven</b> <b>tyres.</b> On the other hand, extreme handling performances are obtained by designing a vehicle that is almost unstable. Thus, small driver errors {{can lead to a}} sudden and unexpected off-road. Traction and instability control is of fundamental importance to avoid macro-sliding of the tyres and to combine extremely high handling performances with a safety margin that allows the driver to stabilize the vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Every {{winter in}} Sweden, winter roadways pose {{problems}} for heavy vehicles. Steep gradients {{can be difficult}} to pass when it is slippery, which has implications also for other traffic when congestion occurs. To reduce the problems it has been discussed whether to impose a legal requirement for winter <b>tyres</b> on <b>drive</b> axle for trucks. This papers presents test results of the available snow grip from test track measurements comparing different <b>drive</b> axle <b>tyres.</b> A summer tyre, together with three winter tyres, of which one was retreaded, were selected for tests. The results of the traction tests show that there can be a big difference in grip between winter and summer tyres on packed snow. The difference between the tyres, however, is strongly dependent {{on the nature of the}} snow surface, so it is difficult to give general values. Theoretical calculations show that a vehicle’s rolling resistance can have a major impact on a vehicles climbing ability. With a high rolling resistance, which may be the result of loose snow on the road, the difference between good and bad grip on the <b>drive</b> <b>tyres</b> becomes even more significant...|$|R
50|$|On September 12, 2013, Alfa Romeo 4C (with Pirelli P Zero Trofeo <b>tyres)</b> <b>driven</b> by Horst von Saurma {{completed}} the Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit in 8 minutes 4 seconds.|$|R
50|$|It has a six speed gearbox {{and chain}} <b>drive,</b> balloon <b>tyres,</b> a dry mass of 117 kg and a seat height of 770 mm. The 'retro' styled VanVan is classed as a dual purpose bike, capable of {{cruising}} {{urban and suburban}} streets at 60 mph or riding on sandy or rough trails. It is not designed for heavy mud trails.|$|R
5000|$|The Mini Crossover Concept was {{unveiled}} in 2008 at the Paris Motor Show. [...] It was over 4 m long, with four-wheel <b>drive,</b> wide <b>tyres,</b> {{and a single}} piece rear door with a retractable rear window. Inside, it had a large glass ball in {{the centre of the}} instrument panel, called the 'Mini Centre Globe'; this system incorporated laser projection technology for 3D navigational routes and films. A production vehicle based on the Crossover Concept was launched in 2010 as the Mini Countryman.|$|R
50|$|Sepro <b>Tyre</b> <b>Driven</b> Grinding Mills are {{designed}} for small and medium capacity grinding applications, specifically small tonnage plants, regrinding mills, reagent prep and lime slaking. Sepro Pneumatic <b>Tyre</b> <b>Driven</b> (PTD) mills provide an alternative to standard trunnion drive systems. The drive consists of multiple gears boxes and electric motors directly connected and controlled through an AC variable frequency drive. Shell supported mills such as the Sepro PTD mills minimize stress on the mill shell by spreading the power drive over {{the full length of}} the mill. Sepro Mills are suitable for Ball, Rod and Pebble charges and are available with overflow or grate discharge to suit the application. Shell supported Mills such as the Sepro PTD Grinding Mills minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the unit.|$|R
5|$|Storm II is also {{produced}} in an armoured version, and is offered with an optional 2.8litre VM Motori turbodiesel, automatic transmission, right hand <b>drive,</b> and run-flat <b>tyres.</b> AIL {{is capable of}} completing ten vehicles daily. Due to recently passed tax laws, a civilian version is not yet available in the local market.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, the {{addition}} of an agglomeration drum has improved on the heap leaching process by allowing for a more efficient leach. The rotary drum agglomerator, such as the <b>tyre</b> <b>driven</b> Sepro Agglomeration Drum works by taking the crushed ore fines and agglomerating them into more uniform particles. This makes it much easier for the leaching solution to percolate through the pile, making {{its way through the}} channels between particles.|$|R
5000|$|Volkswagen's first {{joint venture}} into trucks {{outside of their}} own LT range was with MAN Nutzfahrzeuge (Commercial Vehicles) from 1977-1993. Truck {{production}} started in 1979 and ended in 1993 with 72,000 units produced. It was available with four engines and four wheelbases over its lifetime; {{there was also a}} 4X4 version called 8.150 FAE. FAE means [...] "forward control" [...] cab, all-wheel <b>drive,</b> single <b>tyres</b> so the F nomenclature means [...] "forward control" [...] cab. This series is usually referred to as the G90, from the most common model, but also as the [...] "G"-series. In the United Kingdom it was originally marketed as the [...] "MAN MT" [...] series. The original lineup in the UK consisted of the 6.90 and the 8.90 (the first digit denoting the GVW in tonnes, the second for power in metric horsepower) and the 8.136 and 9.136.|$|R
5000|$|From 1967 until 1977, MAN {{collaborated with}} France's Saviem, selling their light to medium duty trucks with MAN badging in Germany and certain other markets. After {{the end of}} this, a deal was struck with Volkswagen which lasted until 1993. Production of a truck using the Volkswagen LT body started in 1979 and ended in 1993 with 72,000 units produced.

2500|$|The {{simplicity}} of the design also led to a farcical situation with the official scrutineers. The regulations required [...] "means for reversing", which the White Triplex did not have. Mechanics first jury-rigged an electric motor and roller <b>drive</b> onto a <b>tyre,</b> but this was unable to rotate against the compression of the three large engines, {{which could not be}} un-clutched. An even more complicated contrivance was tried, an entire separate rear axle was fitted, held above ground until dropped by a release lever and then driven by a separate driveshaft. The device is not believed to have been fitted during the record attempt itself, but it satisfied the scrutineers.|$|R
5000|$|The Trojan Utility Car went {{onto the}} market at £230, which was reduced to £125 in 1925, {{the same as a}} Model T Ford. Nothing was conventional. Rather than a chassis the car had a punt shaped tray which housed the engine and {{transmission}} below the seats. The transmission used a chain to <b>drive</b> the solid <b>tyre</b> shod wheels. The 1527-cc engine to the ingenious Hounsfield design was started by pulling a lever on the right of the driver. To prove how economical the car was to run, the company ran the slogan [...] "Can you afford to walk?" [...] and calculated that over 200 mi it would cost more in shoes and socks than to cover the distance by Trojan car.|$|R
50|$|At the Belgian Grand Prix, mixed {{conditions}} in qualifying meant that Massa would start the race from 4th and Alonso from 8th. The start went {{very well with}} Alonso taking 5th immediately and Massa moving up to third. As the race progressed, Alonso came closer and passed both Hamilton and team-mate Massa for third. Soon Vettel pitted, and Alonso overtook Rosberg taking the lead at that moment, but when the safety car was deployed, he didn't come to the pits and so had to <b>drive</b> on older <b>tyres</b> than Vettel. Soon he was overtaken by Vettel, and as the race progressed, worse pace on harder tyres meant Alonso would end up losing 2nd to Webber and then 3rd to Button two laps {{before the end of}} the race, finishing 4th at the end.|$|R
50|$|The 1902 Gordon Bennett Cup was {{run over}} a {{distance}} of 565 km from Paris to Innsbruck {{in conjunction with the}} Paris-Vienna motor car race. The race started in Paris on June 26. Competing were 30 heavy cars, 48 light cars, six voiturettes, three motorcycles, and three motorcyclettes. Each nation was allowed to nominate up to three cars to compete for the Gordon Bennett Cup, but only six entries were received, three French and three British. The Automobile Club of Great Britain announced that car No. 160 driven by Mr White, and car No. 45, made by Napier & Son of London with Dunlop <b>tyres,</b> <b>driven</b> by Mr Edge would represent the club. The Times announced on June 30 that Edge had won the Gordon Bennett Cup. It was announced in Vienna on July 1 that M. Marcel Renault had won the Paris-Vienna race, with M. Henri Farman second.|$|R
50|$|Scrubbers are {{material}} washers used {{to break}} down and disperse clays in order to prepare mineral ores or construction aggregates for further processing. Sepro <b>Tyre</b> <b>Drive</b> Scrubbers are manufactured up to 3.6m in diameter and are capable of processing up to 1500 tonnes per hour of material. Shell supported Scrubbers such as the Sepro PTD Scrubber minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over {{the full length of}} the washing drum. These scrubbers operate in many applications on feeds with high clay content, and are commonly used for difficult ore and stone washing duties. A few specified applications of Sepro Scrubbers include removal of gold “robbing” carboniferous material and other contaminants from gold ores, the processing of bauxite ores for aluminum production, the washing of laterites (gold, nickel, cobalt) to liberate fine metals for gravity recovery, and the washing of crushed aggregate, gravel and sand to remove clay contamination.|$|R
50|$|A typical type of fine grinder is {{the ball}} mill. A {{slightly}} inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls, usually stone or metal, which grind {{material to the}} necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%. Ball mills are characterized by their smaller (comparatively) diameter and longer length, and often have a length 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter. The feed is {{at one end of}} the cylinder and the discharge is at the other. Ball mills are commonly used in the manufacture of Portland cement and finer grinding stages of mineral processing, one example being the Sepro <b>tyre</b> <b>drive</b> Grinding Mill. Industrial ball mills can be as large as 8.5 m (28 ft) in diameter with a 22 MW motor, drawing approximately 0.0011% of the total world's power (see List of countries by electricity consumption). However, small versions of ball mills can be found in laboratories where they are used for grinding sample material for quality assurance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1920 Trojan in Britain {{made its}} first series of six cars from a works in Croydon and the final revised {{production}} version was shown at the 1922 London Motor Show. An agreement was reached with Leyland Motors to produce the cars at their Kingston upon Thames factory where work on reconditioning ex RAF wartime trucks was running down. This arrangement would continue until 1928 when Leyland wanted factory space for truck production. During the nearly seven years of the agreement 11,000 cars and 6700 vans were made. The car known as the Trojan Utility Car went onto the market at £230, reducing to £125 in 1925, {{the same as a}} Model T Ford. Nothing was conventional. Rather than a chassis the car had a punt shaped tray which housed the engine and transmission below the seats. This is a similar idea to the chassis-less design of the contemporary 1922 Italian Lancia Lambda luxury car. The transmission used a chain to <b>drive</b> the solid <b>tyre</b> shod wheels. The 1527-cc engine to the ingenious Hounsfield design was started by pulling a lever on the right of the driver. To prove how economical the car was to run, the company ran the slogan [...] "Can you afford to walk?"
