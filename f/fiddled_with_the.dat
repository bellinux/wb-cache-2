Perry's contribution to the track, however, was toned down - the band went back and <b>fiddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> song themselves to bring the guitars out and played down the echo Perry had dropped on it.

5000|$|The unusual name 'Flourmill' {{dates to}} a land survey in 1921 along the Clearwater River. Flourmill Creek, which flows {{southeast}} from the volcanic area, {{was found to}} enter the Clearwater River exactly four miles (6.5 km) due north of the Mahood confluence. With great logic, the surveyors named it Four Mile Creek. When map-makers in the Department of Lands were about to place this designation on the official map, they realized that there were already several Four Mile Creeks in British Columbia and wisely decided that a less trite name was needed. So they <b>fiddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> letters and produced Flourmill Creek instead. The creek was named first and the name was extended to the volcanoes in the 1974 edition of the book, Exploring Wells Gray Park. (In 2015, British Columbia had 12 Four Mile Creeks, 3 Four Mile Lakes, and 3 Four Mile Mountains.) ...|$|E
50|$|Lasseter's student film at CalArts, The Lady and the Lamp (1979), applied Walt Disney's {{observation}} that giving lifelike qualities to inanimate objects held comic potential. Luxo Jr. displayed a further insight, however: that inanimate objects as characters held {{the potential for}} dramatic value as well. The film would come from Lasseter's experiments with modeling his Luxo lamp. He had felt inspiration strike when fellow employee Tom Porter brought his infant son Spencer to work one day and Lasseter, playing with the child, became fascinated with his proportions. A baby's head was huge compared {{with the rest of}} its body, Lasseter realized. It struck Lasseter as humorous and he began to wonder what a young lamp would look like. He <b>fiddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dimensions of all the parts of his Luxo model—all but the bulb, since lightbulbs come from a store and don't grow, he reasoned—and he emerged with a second character, Luxo Jr.|$|E

5000|$|Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine {{described}} the Kills's fourth album as [...] "another mostly successful attempt to wrench effective material from a barebones method of hollow attitude and instrumental minimalism". Masters of [...] "a high-wire act" [...] involving [...] "a small {{bag of tricks}} shaken up a little differently each time", the Kills [...] "write songs that are invariably concave structures, spacious echo chambers for lurching, fuzzed-out guitar and softly staccato talk-singing", keeping [...] "drawing blood from this stone, readjusting and tweaking their formula", the reviewer expands. According to Cataldo, [...] "Starting with 2005's No Wow, The Kills have produced three almost skeletal meditations {{on the kind of}} black-hearted, fatalist sound originally fashioned by artists like Nick Cave. Each has <b>fiddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proportions of straightforward stomp and slinky ambience: No Wow was sharp and spindly, ruled by the unsettling tremor of its omnipresent drum machines; Midnight Boom was in some ways a step in an even sparser direction, full of empty spaces and off-kilter melodies; and Blood Pressures pushes back into more forceful territory, leaning on noise and distortion and dropping most pretenses of subtlety." ...|$|E
5000|$|All I did was {{get that}} very first Moog synthesizer, {{with the big}} patch unit and the {{keyboards}} that you could never tune, and I put a microphone into a tape machine … So whatever came out when I <b>fiddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> knobs went on tape - but some amazing sounds did happen. - George Harrison, 1987 Zapple {{was intended as a}} creative outlet for avant-garde musical works and spoken-word albums. The music on Electronic Sound, consisting of two extended instrumental pieces - [...] "Under the Mersey Wall" [...] and [...] "No Time or Space" [...] - was performed on a Moog IIIc modular system. Harrison bought the system directly from Robert Moog and later had it set up at EMI Studios in London for the Beatles to use on their recordings. In author Alan Clayson's view, the album was Harrison's [...] "gesture of artistic solidarity" [...] towards John Lennon and Yoko Ono, whose experimental collaborations, having first appeared on the Beatles' 1968 track [...] "Revolution 9", made up Zapple's other inaugural album, Life with the Lions. In a 1987 interview, Harrison said that Electronic Sound, like the Lennon-Ono album, was an example of Zapple's ethos of [...] "letting serendipity take hold" [...] rather than a formal creative work.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} anachronisms and {{historical}} inaccuracies within the show received attention, {{especially in the}} costumes and locations used in the series. Pat Stacey of the Irish Evening Herald newspaper, said that [...] "the historical howlers are piling up like bodies on a battlefield, week after week", comparing it to the [...] "flaws" [...] spotted by [...] "nitpickers" [...] in Downton Abbey and Foyle's War. Deborah Ross, of the Daily Mail newspaper, criticised the cleanliness and [...] "amazing teeth" [...] of the actors involved, whilst also pointing out glimpses of a modern drainpipe and stair-rail. Bernadette McNulty, of The Daily Telegraph newspaper, commented that in the final episode of the series, the Battle of Bosworth Field appears {{to take place in}} a forest rather than a field. Mary McNamara, of the LA Times newspaper, states that in order to fit thirty years of history into ten episodes, [...] "Years collapse into minutes, intricate policy is condensed into cardboard personalities, and the characters are swiftly categorized as good or evil." [...] Others questioned the depiction of the major characters. Amy Licence, Cecily's biographer, states that Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, is portrayed in the first episode as [...] "a Cecily straight from the pages of a novel rather than the actual proud aristocrat who asserted her own right to rule". Historian Michael Hicks commented, [...] "They've <b>fiddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chronology" [...] but added, [...] "I can see why they decided to restrict the cast of characters, and play up the rivalry between Elizabeth and the Earl of Warwick," [...] and also said [...] "As with Philippa Gregory's source novels, they've done their research".|$|E

40|$|Extract] Though half in jest, Les Murray {{speaks of}} his prose {{writings}} - {{in comparison with}} his poetry - as 'Narrowspeak'. Not long ago he had hte chance of speaking to a whole people and to posterity through his prose. The paragraphs for which Murray might have been remembered in Australia have been struck from the record. Invited by the Prime Minister, John Howard, to write a new Preamble for the Australian Constitution (and perhaps one that might {{have become part of}} public memory, unlike the first) Murray chanced his arm. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister decided that he was il miglior fabbro; could play editor Eliot to Murray's poet Pound as it were, and <b>fiddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> draft. 'Mateship' (a word that scarcely figures in Murray's lexicon) was inserted, as if it spoke to a shared tradition of Australian men and women. Because of that, and other mangling changes, Murray bailed out. In the 1999 referendum, a model for a system of government some distance from Murray's long and often enunciated idea of 'the vernacular republic' was shamefully rejected. Howard's tin-eared preamble went down to a far heavier defeat. And that was {{about the end of the}} consolation in this sorry exercise...|$|E

Bandula used to <b>fiddle</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hook until it slid apart when it was aligned.
