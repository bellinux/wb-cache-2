40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the conditions under}} which we can obtain reasonable qualitative results in scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analysis of trace elements in <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> using a diluted ionic liquid (EMI-CH 3 COO) and changing probe current. Below 100 nA, electrical charging of <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> was prevented. The probe current of 10 nA was suitable for qualitative analysis because the intensities of peaks from these materials were strong enough to detect trace elements at the concentration of 0. 1 wt. % in the sample without interference by sum peaks. Diluted EMI-CH 3 COO can also be used for SEM-EDX quantitative analysis of <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> as discharging agents. In contrast, when <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> were electrically charged, the obtained spectra contained characteristic X-rays of the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> with low energies and of materials other than the samples such as the sample stage and the collimator in the X-ray detector. This is because electrons from the electron beam were decelerated by and deflected from the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials.</b> By coating the <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> with the diluted EMI-CH 3 COO, the deceleration and deflection of the electron beam were prevented...|$|R

25|$|Many {{applications}} of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, {{giving rise to}} their primary use as window panes. Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities {{have led to the}} extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal <b>insulating</b> <b>material,</b> and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of {{out-of-phase}} supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by <b>insulating</b> <b>material,</b> typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|E

500|$|A {{radiative}} air well {{is designed}} to cool a substrate by radiating heat to the night sky. The substrate has a low mass so that it cannot hold onto heat, and it is thermally isolated from any mass, including the ground. A typical radiative collector presents a condensing surface at an angle of 30° from the horizontal. The condensing surface is backed by {{a thick layer of}} <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> such as polystyrene foam and supported [...] above ground level. Such condensers may be conveniently installed on the ridge roofs of low buildings or supported by a simple frame. Although other heights do not typically work quite so well, it may be less expensive or more convenient to mount a collector near to ground level or on a two-story building.|$|E
