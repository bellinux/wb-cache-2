5|$|<b>GoldenEye</b> was {{the second}} and final Bond film to be adapted to a novel by novelist John Gardner. The book closely follows the film's storyline, but Gardner added a violent {{sequence}} prior to the opening bungee jump in which Bond kills a group of Russian guards, a change that the video game <b>GoldenEye</b> 007 retained.|$|E

40|$|Waterfowl (Anseriformes) {{generally}} have high energetic costs for reproduction because they lay large, energy-rich eggs. Consequently, many temperate nesting ducks (Anatinae) occupy seasonally productive environments to meet nutritional requirements for egg production. However, ducks in the genus Bucephala often breed in unproductive boreal and montane regions. This {{study was conducted}} to investigate nutritional aspects of reproduction in female Buffleheads (Bucephala albeola) and Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Goldeneyes</b> (Bucephala islandica) breeding in central British Columbia.;Diet composition of breeding female Buffleheads and Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Goldeneyes,</b> which consisted primarily of benthic insects, was similar, providing support for the food defense hypothesis as an explanation for evolution of fixed space territorially in the genus Bucephala.;Mean egg laying interval (dollar±dollarSE) for Buffleheads was 48. 36 dollar±dollar 2. 35 hr. which was similar to that of Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Goldeneyes</b> that laid, on average, every 45. 32 dollar±dollar 1. 40 hr. As a consequence of slower rates of egg production, daily energetic costs of reproduction in female Buffleheads and Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Goldeneyes,</b> evaluated relative to their basal metabolic requirements, are among the lowest documented for ducks.;Patterns of lipogenesis differed between female Buffleheads and Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Goldeneyes,</b> but both species catabolized somatic fat for egg production. Buffleheads maintained stable body protein during reproduction, and thus relied exclusively on dietary protein for clutch formation, whereas <b>Goldeneyes</b> catabolized small amounts of somatic protein to produce egg protein in 1993. Use of body protein by a primarily carnivorous duck suggests that protein availability, i. e. invertebrate abundance, in breeding habitats used by <b>Goldeneyes</b> was periodically deficient. Somatic mineral supplied approximately 8...|$|R

5|$|Admiral Godfrey put Fleming {{in charge}} of Operation <b>Goldeneye</b> between 1941 and 1942; <b>Goldeneye</b> was a plan to {{maintain}} an intelligence framework in Spain {{in the event of}} a German takeover of the territory. Fleming's plan involved maintaining communication with Gibraltar and launching sabotage operations against the Nazis. In 1941 he liaised with Donovan over American involvement in a measure intended to ensure that the Germans did not dominate the seaways.|$|E
5|$|After <b>GoldenEye</b> 007 was released, Rare began {{development}} of a spiritual successor titled Perfect Dark. Using an upgraded version of the <b>GoldenEye</b> 007 game engine, Perfect Dark was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. Although the game features a setting and storyline unrelated to James Bond, it shares many gameplay features, including a similar control scheme, mission objectives that vary with the difficulty setting, and cheat options unlockable through quick level completions. While Perfect Dark was still in development, Martin Hollis left Rare {{to work as a}} consultant {{on the development of the}} GameCube at Nintendo of America. He would then form his own company, Zoonami, in 2000. Other members of the <b>GoldenEye</b> 007 team also left Rare to form Free Radical Design. The company would develop the TimeSplitters first-person shooters for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox. These games contain several references to <b>GoldenEye</b> 007, including the design of the health-HUD, the nature of the aiming system, and the dam setting of the opening level of TimeSplitters 2.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Bond and Alec Trevelyan—agent 006—infiltrate an illicit Soviet {{chemical}} weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes {{from the facility}} as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation Janus of a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an electromagnetic pulse. Janus uses the helicopter to steal the control disk for the dual <b>GoldenEye</b> satellite weapons, using the <b>GoldenEye</b> to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse; there are two survivors of the attack, a programmer, Natalya Simonova, and Boris Grishenko.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the pattern of variation in group structure and feeding behaviour of wintering Common <b>Goldeneyes</b> (Bucephala clangula) on the Saint-Lawrence River, by comparing two major habitats for this species in the province of Quebec, one in freshwater and one in saltwater. Groups of <b>goldeneyes</b> were smaller in Montreal than in the estuary and consisted of twice as many males. Individuals spent a greater proportion of time feeding in Montreal than in the estuary. At Montreal, <b>goldeneyes</b> spent more time feeding under water. Temporal variables had a major influence on group structure and on diving time. At Montreal, time of day explained most of variation whereas in the estuary, tide was more important...|$|R
40|$|I studied remigial molt phenology, {{body mass}} dynamics, {{foraging}} effort, and survival of Barrow’s <b>Goldeneyes</b> (Bucephala islandica) on Cardinal and Leddy Lakes, Alberta {{to evaluate whether}} the postbreeding period imposed nutritional or demographic constraints that could affect population dynamics. Adult male Barrow’s <b>Goldeneyes,</b> the predominant cohort on the study sites, arrived by mid-June and departed by mid-November. Remigial molt lasted 39 days during which body mass increased despite low foraging effort by adult males; mass and foraging patterns differed between lakes. Cumulative survival of adult males during remigial molt was high (95 %). Taken together, {{these results indicate that}} remigial molt was not a period of nutritional limitation or high mortality risk for Barrow’s <b>Goldeneyes</b> and that molt strategy was responsive to local conditions. Cumulative adult male survival during fall staging (71 %) was substantially lower than during remigial molt with at least half of mortalities on Cardinal Lake attributed to hunting...|$|R

5|$|Rare then {{developed}} Blast Corps for the Nintendo 64. The game sold {{one million}} copies, which was considered disappointing by Rare. At that time, Rare was split into several teams, working on different projects. A large-scaled platformer {{was set to}} be released afterwards but was delayed. As a result, Rare changed their schedule and released their smaller projects first. The first project was <b>GoldenEye</b> 007, a game based on the titular film. The project was led by Martin Hollis and development was conducted by an inexperienced team. Inspired by Sega's Virtua Cop, <b>Goldeneye</b> 007 had originally been an on-rail shooter before the team decided to expand the gameplay {{and turn it into}} a free-roaming first-person shooter. New elements, such as stealth, headshot mechanics and reloading, were introduced. A split-screen multiplayer was added to the game by the end of its development. <b>GoldenEye</b> 007 was the first console first-person shooter developed by Rare and it was released two years after the release of the film. The game received very high critical praise and received numerous awards. It is often credited for having revolutionised the genre of first-person shooting video games. <b>Goldeneye</b> 007 remained as one of the best-selling games for two years, and sold more than eight million units worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Retrospectively, <b>GoldenEye</b> 007 is {{considered}} an important game {{in the history of}} first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited {{as one of the greatest}} video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled <b>GoldenEye</b> 007, was released in 2010.|$|E

5|$|<b>GoldenEye</b> 007 is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare {{and based on}} the 1995 James Bond film <b>GoldenEye.</b> It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to fish, the lake provides habitat {{for a wide}} variety of bird species. From the Forest Service campgrounds along the lake shore, birdwatchers can view waterfowl, songbirds, and birds of prey. Common waterfowl include red-necked grebes, Pacific loons, common loons, hooded mergansers, red-breasted mergansers, lesser scaup, surf scoters, white-winged scoters, common <b>goldeneyes,</b> and Barrow's <b>goldeneyes.</b> The lake also attracts birds of prey such as red-tailed hawk, osprey and bald eagles. Both the osprey and eagles normally stay well into the fall to feed on brown trout and kokanee salmon that spawn in Link Creek, between Suttle and Blue lakes.|$|R
50|$|The {{bufflehead}} {{was formerly}} separated {{in its own}} genus Charitonetta, while the <b>goldeneyes</b> proper were mistakenly placed in Clangula (as Clangula americana), the genus of the long-tailed duck, which {{at that time was}} placed in Harelda.|$|R
