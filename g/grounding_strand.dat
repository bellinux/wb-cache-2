40|$|With {{increasing}} demand for safety {{of life at}} sea and protection of the environment, there has been considerable interest to predict the damages an accident will cause to the ship so that the consequences {{in terms of human}} life, property loss and marine pollution can be appropriately accounted for at the design stage. Standards for design against accidents should be developed and should include definition of accident scenarios, procedures for evaluating consequences and criteria for approval or acceptance of a design. One of the key issues for such a standard is the tool used to estimate the damage extents of a ship in accidents. Simulation tools and full scale model tests are commonly used in passenger car designs to mitigate consequences of road accidents. Similar tools for obvious reasons cannot be used on a regular basis for ship design. However they have been used in a limited scale for research purposes. More recently emerging simplified analytical methods become available. These methods are based on simplified characteristics of damage process and employ theoretical formulae to predict behaviors of structural components. As a result of extensive studies, many damage characteristics of ship structures have been identified and solved using simple expressions. These methods and more newly developed methods have been successfully applied to a variety of accident scenarios, including ship-ship collision, ship-platform collision, ship-bridge collision, <b>grounding,</b> <b>stranding.</b> These methods are discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Vessels {{are rarely}} {{subjected}} to accidental loads {{such as the}} collision, <b>grounding</b> and <b>stranding.</b> But these accidental loads {{cause a lot of}} damages to hull structure including a large deformation, fracture, tearing and so on. In case of carrying dangerous goods such as crude oil, these accidents can induce a serious environmental pollution. All ocean-going vessels were made by welding. The welding residual stress is a significant shortcoming of welding remains at the hull structure, even though welding technology in shipbuilding field has provided a variety of advantages, e. g. remarkable shortening of the shipbuilding time. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effects of the residual stress in a grounding accident. When a ship runs aground against a sea-obstacle like a rock, this accident can be classified as a grounding. Among parameters of grounding accident scenarios such as the ship speed, the initial striking point, and loading conditions of the ship, only ship speed varies from 10 to 15 knots under ballast condition with/without consideration of residual stress(this sentence is not clear to the read). The initial striking point is at the bow of the center line of ship. A series of nonlinear numerical simulations with large deformation and fracture were carried out using LS-DYNA. As a result, two cases with residual stress have longer damage length. The difference seems to be relatively small, but not negligible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Background: Comparative {{mitochondrial}} genomic {{analyses are}} rare among crustaceans below {{the family or}} genus level. The obliged subterranean crustacean amphipods of the family Metacrangonyctidae, found from the Hispaniola (Antilles) to the Middle East, including the Canary Islands and the peri-Mediterranean region, have an evolutionary history and peculiar biogeography that can respond to Tethyan vicariance. Indeed, recent phylogenetic analysis using all protein-coding mitochondrial sequences and one nuclear ribosomal gene have lent support to this hypothesis (Bauzà-Ribot et al. 2012). Results: We present the analyses of mitochondrial genome sequences of 21 metacrangonyctids in the genera Metacrangonyx and Longipodacrangonyx, covering the entire geographical range of the family. Most mitogenomes were attained by next-generation sequencing techniques using long-PCR fragments sequenced by Roche FLX/ 454 or GS Junior pyro-sequencing, obtaining a coverage depth per nucleotide of up to 281 ×. All mitogenomes were AT-rich and included the usual 37 genes of the metazoan mitochondrial genome, but showed a unique derived gene order not matched in any other amphipod mitogenome. We compare and discuss features such as strand bias, phylogenetic informativeness, non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rates and other mitogenomic characteristics, including ribosomal and transfer RNAs annotation and structure. Conclusions: Next-generation sequencing of pooled long-PCR amplicons can help to rapidly generate mitogenomic information of {{a high number of}} related species to be used in phylogenetic and genomic evolutionary studies. The mitogenomes of the Metacrangonyctidae have the usual characteristics of the metazoan mitogenomes (circular molecules of 15, 000 - 16, 000 bp, coding for 13 protein genes, 22 tRNAs and two ribosomal genes) and show a conserved gene order with several rearrangements with respect to the presumed Pancrustacean <b>ground</b> pattern. <b>Strand</b> nucleotide bias appears to be reversed with respect to the condition displayed in the majority of crustacean mitogenomes since metacrangonyctids show a GC-skew at the (+) and (−) strands; this feature has been reported also in the few mitogenomes of Isopoda (Peracarida) known thus far.

40|$|Decision-making, incentives, {{environmental}} frameworks {{and support}} mechanism are often subject to entrepreneurship research striving {{to explain how}} and why academics engage in entrepreneurial activities. The focus is most often on the academics' rather linear individual transformation from an idea owner to a new business entrepreneur. This paper proposes an alternative network based view of academic entrepreneurship drawing concepts from interdisciplinary theories. Entrepreneurship is described as: (1) integrated in formal and informal networks; (2) hindered or eased by these linkages; and (3) shaped by the opportunities (idea recognition, experience, finance etc.) within these networks. The academia produces new knowledge that through entrepreneurial activities transform into innovations in the market place. Academic entrepreneurship therefore naturally combines the perspectives of entrepreneurship and innovation. However, despite many common touching <b>grounds</b> these <b>strands</b> of research are rarely conceptually intertwined. Research {{on the role of}} the academia within the innovation process of knowledge-based economies highlight the meaning of inter-institutional links and give reason to assume that closer links between industry and the academia would benefit commercialization. However, little is known about the structure, strength and nature of these links. This paper has two purposes. 1) To examine the structure, strength and significance of networking to entrepreneurship with a deepened focus on opportunity recognition (commercial value) and exploitation in the perspective of academic entrepreneurship. 2) To develop a working hypothesis to be empirically tested with the aim to contribute towards theory building for these unanswered questions, for which it does not exist a cohesive normative, predictive, or explanatory theory. Method 2 ̆ 013 Using an interdisciplinary theoretical framework a sample of academic entrepreneurs in the region of Fujian province in China is analyzed through data based on interviews. Paper contribution - This framing has potential for practical relevance and academic inquiry. It forces acknowledgement of the close connection between social and economic conditions for academic entrepreneurship and the role of networks for academic entrepreneurship. It also untangles a web of formal support systems and informal entrepreneurial networks. Conclusion - The process of the idea commercialized on the market may not be seen as a linear process, in which the academic owns the idea (identification of the commercial viable science) and becomes the entrepreneur by starting a company but rather as a dynamic process in which the origin of the idea may come from outside, indentified by members within the network of the academic and the appreciation of its commercial value, and the necessary resources (finance, entrepreneurial experience, re-innovation processes etc.) is added by yet others within the network.

Heavy German artillery and machine gun fire continued to pound and sweep [...] "Blue" [...] beach so severely that it was dubbed one of the two invasion points [...] "most difficult for the invaders to negotiate." [...] Under heavy fire, LST 389 attempted to comply with the orders but could not. Stuck fast to [...] "Blue" [...] beach, the gallant tank landing ship then proceeded to carry out her original orders. Her crew deployed the pontoon unit; and, a little over an hour later at 1354, the first tank roared out of the ship's gaping bow doors. By the time she finally managed to clear the beach at 1509, LST-389 had endured much at the hands of German gunners. Some 60 shells had been fired at the ship. At 1313, a shell demolished the captain's cabin while wounding a number of men. Fire sweeping the exposed bridge prompted its abandonment, but two volunteers remained to maintain uninterrupted telephone contact with all stations on board. The crew of her lone 3 in gun claimed to have silenced two or three of the deadly German 88-millimeter guns.|$|R
