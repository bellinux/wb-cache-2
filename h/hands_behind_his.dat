5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a short man who walked with his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back and hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell rang, however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At {{the end of the}} match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him {{in the back of the}} head with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.|$|E
25|$|After Scott {{was shot}} and had dropped to the ground, Slager {{approached}} him, repeatedly instructed him to place his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, and handcuffed him, leaving him {{face down on the}} ground. Although police reports stated that officers performed CPR on Scott, no such action is visible on the video. The video shows that Slager ran back toward where the initial scuffle occurred and picked something up off the ground. Moments later, he dropped the object, possibly the Taser, beside Scott's body.|$|E

60|$|The silent, {{hard-faced}} Hans leant {{forward and}} stared up the darkling water, <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> ear.|$|R
60|$|Throughout {{this and}} much more cross-examination, which turned again and again around the 'nice point,' James sat with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> ear, his eyes fixed upon his son.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, Jones {{retained}} {{his title}} by knocking out Australian boxer Glen Kelly in seven rounds via knockout. Jones put both <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back. As Kelly moved in behind a jab, Jones {{went over the}} jab with a right to the head. Kelly went down and was counted out. Jones landed 124 of 249 punches (50%) and Kelly connected on 42 of 171 (25%). Before this bout, Jones was controversially awarded The Ring Championship belt, despite Dariusz Michalczewski still being regarded as the Lineal champion in the same weight class.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Bonin's mother {{placed her}} sons in an orphanage {{in an effort}} to protect her {{children}} from their father's physical violence. This establishment was known to severely discipline the children it housed for both minor and major breaches of conduct, with the punishments administered including severe beatings, enduring various stress positions, and partial drowning in sinks filled with water. Although Bonin later freely discussed many aspects of his childhood and adolescence, he refused to discuss his memories of being housed within this establishment beyond divulging that he consented to sexual advances from older males only if his abuser would first tie his (Bonin's) <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back. He was to remain at this orphanage until the age of 9, when he returned to live with his parents in the town of Mansfield.|$|E
25|$|Post {{punishment}} {{would become}} the symbol of this detention. The principle was simple: the prisoner was attached to a post, a tree or against a wall, <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, and had to remain in this position, which prevented him from moving, for {{a certain amount of}} time, without eating or drinking. Several variations on this punishment were invented, such as one where the prisoner was raised onto bricks while being attached and once he was solidly attached, the bricks were removed, rendering the punishment even more painful. The Hague Convention specified that “Prisoners of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations, and orders in force in the army of the State in whose power they are. Any act of insubordination justifies the adoption towards them of such measures of severity as may be considered necessary”. Post punishment was applied in the German Army until its abolition on 18 May 1917; for prisoners, abolition came at the end of 1916 after a complaint by France.|$|E

60|$|Presently {{along came}} old Mr. Toad. Now Mr. Toad looks very grumpy {{and out of}} sorts, but that is because {{you do not know}} old Mr. Toad. When he reached the house of Danny Meadow Mouse he stopped right in front of Danny. He put <b>his</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> right ear and listened. Then he put <b>his</b> left <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> left ear and listened some more. Finally he put both hands on his hips and began to laugh.|$|R
500|$|The younger alternate-timeline Spock. Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think those are all things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed his interest in the role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, he fell [...] while showing {{students}} how to rely on their legs when climbing. He kept his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back on an easy route but lost his balance and fell headfirst, shattering both wrists. He went into another coma and spent two months in the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the labor}} {{workforce}} of PDM Contractors consisted {{of high school students}} and young men. One of these youths was a 15-year-old named Anthony Antonucci, whom Gacy had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at the youth's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied the youth with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed Antonucci's <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back. The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the handcuff after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci—a member of his high school wrestling team—pounced upon him. The youth wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house. Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay on the floor: [...] "Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me." ...|$|E
50|$|Afterward, Abbruzzese {{worked with}} HairyApesBMX. He mixed, produced, and {{engineered}} the band's 2000 album, Out Demons. Abbruzzese also lent the band a <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> drum kit on its Midwestern tour.|$|R

2500|$|After leaving Parliament, Johnson {{continued}} {{as a local}} solicitor, and directed his political energies towards animal rights campaigning. He worked with Donald Chapman, a Labour MP, going to campaign against fox hunts, which outraged the huntsman. On 29 October 1959 the Southdown hunt with 14 hounds charged into Johnson's [...] garden at Ditchling in Sussex, wrecking the hedges and damaging crops. When one huntsman dismounted and advanced on Johnson brandishing his riding crop and threatening to [...] "teach him a lesson", Johnson urged the man to hit him and promised to keep his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back if he did. Johnson remarked [...] "I told him it would suit me admirably if he hit me, as it would show others what hunting people are like." [...] Instead the man rode off.|$|E
2500|$|... "Officer Pirone {{directed}} Officer Mehserle {{to arrest}} {{two of the}} individuals {{who had not been}} handcuffed. One of the individuals to be arrested was Oscar Grant, and Officer Pirone’s direction to Mehserle was overheard by Grant. Grant, upon hearing that he was under arrest, attempted to stand up, but was forced to the ground face first. Both Officer Mehserle and Officer Pirone attempted to restrain Mr. Grant and to seek his compliance by ordering him to put his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back to be handcuffed, but Mr. Grant resisted and refused to submit to handcuffing. Officer Mehserle was pulling at Mr. Grant’s right hand and arm, which remained under his torso near his waistband. Mr. Grant had not been searched by any officer for weapons, neither prior to his initial detention nor after being seated near the wall." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the bedroom, Mueller noted {{there was}} indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, {{contained}} scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies {{in various stages of}} dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked into the living room to show them to his partner, uttering the words, [...] "These are for real." [...] When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf. As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: [...] "For what I did I should be dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|Unc' {{poked his}} head a little farther out and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> ear {{as if he were}} a little hard of hearing. [...] "What's that, Bre'r Rabbit? Am I a what?" [...] he demanded.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have," [...] said he, now {{standing}} also, but still playing away on his fiddle with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back. [...] "I have, Sir Abraham; {{and she and}} I are completely agreed on this subject." ...|$|R

2500|$|The lower scene, {{in which}} the figures are less readily identifiable, [...] depicts the {{erection}} of a tropaion. In some interpretations of the scene, all the lower figures are by design anonymous. [...] Other interpretations attribute definite real or mythological persons to the figures. [...] At left, the seated male and female figures (combined in #11) are either Celts or Germans, as is apparent from their clothing and hair styles, including the man's beard, and represent prisoners of war, symbolizing the Roman victory. [...] The man is bound with his <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, and both are apparently about to be tied {{to the base of}} the as yet half-erected tropaion (figure #19_, a trophy of war displayed upon winning a battle, usually fixed into the ground at the position of the [...] "turning-point" [...] of the battle in favour of the victors. [...] The trophy consists of a wooden cross, designed to support human clothing. [...] A helmet is placed on top, and the breastplate and weaponry of the enemy is placed upon it. [...] In the scene, four young men are raising the trophy into a vertical position. [...] Figure #18 is the least identifiable, but his helmet [...] has led some to believe that he may be a Macedonian soldier of King Rhoemetalces I, who helped Tiberius in Pannonia.|$|E
2500|$|The police department's {{handling}} of the Strauss-Kahn case was heavily criticized in his native France. Élisabeth Guigou, who as French minister of justice in 2000 had lobbied successfully for {{the passage of a}} law that forbids the publication of any images of an identifiable defendant in handcuffs who has not yet been convicted, criticized the walk, stating: [...] "I found that image to be incredibly brutal, violent and cruel...I don't see what the publication of images of this type adds." [...] Another former member of the French cabinet, Jack Lang, Minister of Culture in the early 1980s, likened the perp walk to a lynching. French Senator Jean-Pierre Chevènement, a longtime acquaintance of Strauss-Kahn's, wrote on his blog that [...] "The heart can only contract before these humiliating and poignant images...A horrible global lynching! And what if it were all a monstrous injustice?" [...] The French newspaper Le Monde editorialized: [...] "When one of the world's most powerful men is turned over to press photos, coming out of a police station handcuffed, <b>hands</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, he is already being subjected to a sentence which is specific to him...Is it necessary that a man's fame deprive him of his presumption of innocence in the media? Because if they must assuredly be equal before the justice system, all men are not equal before the press." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the leg's second Roadblock, the {{teammate}} who did {{not perform}} the first Roadblock had to play the video game Street Fighter V against a professional video game player. The racers underwent a coaching session before facing off against the professional players, which included Seon-woo [...] "Infiltration" [...] Lee and Lee Chung [...] "Poongko" [...] Gon, and had to defeat the professional gamer in one round {{of the game in}} order to receive their next clue. If the racer was unsuccessful after 10 rounds the professional gamer would continue playing with one <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back; if the racer was unsuccessful after 10 additional rounds the professional gamer would continue playing blindfolded with one <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back until he was defeated.|$|R

60|$|These sounds {{issued from}} the Vampire's lips as the warrior king, {{speechless}} with wrath, passed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back, and viciously twisted {{up a piece}} of the speaker's skin.
