5|$|The final victim, {{killed on}} 31 October 1828, was Margaret Docherty, a middle-aged Irish woman. Burke lured {{her into the}} Broggan lodging house by {{claiming}} {{that his mother was}} also a Docherty from the same area of Ireland, and the pair began drinking. At one point Burke left Docherty in the company of Helen McDougal while he went out, ostensibly to buy more whisky, but actually to get Hare. Two other lodgers—Ann and James Gray—were an inconvenience to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare's lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret Hare had joined in. At around 9:00pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows {{at some point in the}} evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at the end of the bed.|$|E

25|$|Black {{flight is}} a term applied to the out-migration of African Americans from {{predominantly}} black or mixed inner-city areas in the United States to suburbs and outlying edge cities of newer home construction. While more {{attention has been paid}} to this since the 1990s, the movement of blacks to the suburbs has been underway for some time, with nine million people having migrated from 1960 to 2000. Their goals have been similar to those of the white middle class, whose out-migration was called white flight: newer housing, better schools <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> attractive environments. From 1990 to 2000, the percentage of African Americans who lived in the suburbs increased to a total of 39 percent, rising 5 percent in that decade.

25|$|The {{golden age}} of toy {{development}} was {{at the turn of}} the 20th century.

Intellectual emphasis was also increasingly being placed on the importance of a wholesome and happy childhood for the future development of children. William Harbutt, an English painter, invented plasticine in 1897, and in 1900 commercial production of the material as a children's toy began. Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture and was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles in the twentieth century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys.|$|E

500|$|Although Godwin admired Wollstonecraft's writings, he did {{not agree}} with her that women should receive the same {{education}} as men. Therefore, he occasionally read to Fanny and Mary from Sarah Trimmer's Fabulous Histories (1786) and Anna Laetitia Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79), but, according to Todd, {{he did not}} take great pains with their educations and disregarded the books Wollstonecraft had written for Fanny. [...] William St Clair, in his biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, argues that Godwin and Wollstonecraft spoke extensively about the education they wanted <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> that Godwin's writings in The Enquirer reflect these discussions. He contends that after Wollstonecraft's death Godwin wrote to a former pupil to whom she had been close, now Lady Mountcashell, asking her advice on how to raise and educate his daughters. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour agrees with St Clair, arguing that [...] "everything we know about his daughter's [...] early years suggests that she was being taught in a way of which her mother would have approved", pointing out that she had a governess, a tutor, a French-speaking stepmother, and a father who wrote children's books whose drafts he read to his own first. It was the new Mrs Godwin who was primarily responsible for the education given to the girls, but she taught her own daughter more, including French. Fanny received no formal education after her stepfather's marriage. Yet, the adult Imlay is described by C. Kegan Paul, one of Godwin's earliest biographers, as [...] "well educated, sprightly, clever, a good letter-writer, and an excellent domestic manager". Fanny excelled in drawing and was taught music. Despite Godwin's atheism, all of the children were taken to an Anglican church.|$|E

25|$|Experiences in a person's {{life are}} {{a major source of}} how {{self-esteem}} develops. In the early years of a child's life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have. Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected. These feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older. Students in elementary school who have high self-esteem tend to have authoritative parents who are caring, supportive adults who set clear standards <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> allow them to voice their opinion in decision making.|$|R
500|$|Those who {{adopted a}} more {{negative}} {{view at the}} time of the film's release came mostly from the classical music community. Many took fault with Stokowski's rearrangements and abridgements of the music. Igor Stravinsky, the only living composer whose music was featured in the film, expressed displeasure at how in Stokowski's arrangement of The Rite of Spring, [...] "the order of the pieces had been shuffled, and the most difficult of them eliminated", and criticized the orchestra's performance, observing that the simplification of the score [...] "did not save the musical performance, which was execrable". Other composers and music critics leveled criticism at the premise of the film itself, arguing that presenting classical music with visual images would rob the musical pieces of their integrity. Composer and music critic Virgil Thomson praised Fantasound which he thought offered [...] "good transmission of music", but disliked the [...] "musical taste" [...] of Stokowski, with exception to The Sorcerer's Apprentice and The Rite of Spring. Olin Downes of The New York Times too hailed the quality of sound that Fantasound presented, but said, [...] "much of Fantasia distracted from or directly injured the scores". Film critic Pauline Kael dismissed parts of Fantasia as [...] "grotesquely kitschy". Some parents resisted paying the higher roadshow prices <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> several complained that the Night on Bald Mountain segment had frightened them. There were also a few negative reactions that were more political in nature, especially since the film's release happened at a time when Nazi Germany reigned supreme in Europe. One review of the film in this manner, written by Dorothy Thompson for The New York Herald Tribune on November 25, 1940, was especially harsh. Thompson claimed that she [...] "left the theater in a condition bordering on nervous breakdown", because the film was a [...] "remarkable nightmare". Thompson went on to compare the film to rampant Nazism, which she described as [...] "the abuse of power" [...] and [...] "the perverted betrayal of the best instincts". Thompson also claimed that the film depicted nature as being [...] "titanic" [...] while man was only [...] "a moving lichen on the stone of time". She concluded that the film was [...] "cruel", [...] "brutal and brutalizing", and a negative [...] "caricature of the Decline of the West". In fact, Thompson claimed that she was so distraught by the film that she even walked out of it before she saw the two last segments, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria, because she did not want to be subject to any more of the film's [...] "brutalization".|$|E

40|$|DESIGN: Cross-sectional {{qualitative}} study. DATA SOURCES: Interviews with purposeful {{sample of}} 25 recently bereaved parents. METHODS: Semi-structured in-depth interviews. RESULTS: Four analytically distinct processes {{were identified in}} the responses of parents {{to the death of}} a child. These are referred to as 'piloting', 'providing', 'protecting' and 'preserving'. Regardless of individual circumstances, these processes were integral to all parents' coping, enabling an active 'doing' <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> family throughout the trajectory of <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> illness <b>and</b> into bereavement. CONCLUSIONS: Facilitating the capacity of parents to 'do' is central to coping with the stress and uncertainty of living through the death of a child.
