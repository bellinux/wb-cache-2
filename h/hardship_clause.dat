50|$|The <b>hardship</b> <b>clause</b> is {{sometimes}} used {{in relation to}} force majeure, particularly because they share similar features and they both cater to situations of changed circumstances. The {{difference between the two}} concepts is that hardship is the performance of the disadvantaged party becoming much more burdensome but still possible. Force majeure refers to a party's contractual requirements have become impossible, at least temporarily.|$|E

30|$|In Poland it is {{rare for}} a {{collective}} agreement {{in the private sector}} to provide for wage and terms of employment that are more favourable than the minimum stipulated in the law. Many agreements stipulate conditions even below legal standards, although the proportion of agreements with sub-minimal norms appears to have decreased from about one-half to one-fifth of all agreements between 2005 and 2009, according to the state’s inspectorate. In 2002 the then socialist government felt it necessary to amend the law and allow for the suspension of (clauses in) the collective agreement in case of financial hardship. The idea seems to have been that this additional flexibility would make collective bargaining more attractive for employers. The incidence of such <b>hardship</b> <b>clauses</b> increased in following years, but bargaining activity (number and coverage of agreements) decreased. Firms facing financial difficulties did not go to the trouble of suspending or renegotiating particular provisions in the collective agreement but rescinded the agreement instead (Towalski 2005).|$|R
40|$|Decentralising wage {{setting in}} times of crisis? The {{regulation}} and use of wage-related derogation clauses in seven European countries The author addresses the issue of wage setting decentralisation from the inter-sectoral to company level {{through the use of}} derogation clauses. Sectoral and inter-sectoral level collective agreements are a key feature of industrial relations in most Western European countries. Traditionally inter-sectoral bargaining has had the function of homogenising wages and working conditions for entire sectors or countries, of bringing stability to the relations between workers and employers and of relieving company level actors from engaging in time consuming and possibly conflict-ridden bargaining processes. In recent decades, however, the rationale for such inter-sectoral agreements has been questioned for an advancing globalisation of competition and for a greater requirement from employers of decentralisation and flexibility in the setting of wages and working conditions. A specific form of decentralisation is the opening up of possibilities for companies, through various kinds of derogation <b>clauses</b> (opening <b>clauses,</b> <b>hardship</b> <b>clauses,</b> opt-out clauses, inability-to-pay clauses, etc.), to deviate from pay norms set under inter-sectoral or sectoral agreements when they suffer from temporary economic hardship. The article provides a summary of the results of a comparative study on the regulations, practices and politics of wage derogation clauses in seven EU countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain. It provides a detailed and original contribution to the political and academic debate on labour law and industrial relations...|$|R

30|$|Temporary opening or ‘inability to pay’ clauses {{have become}} rather popular during the Recession. They {{are to be}} {{distinguished}} from the general derogation clauses discussed in the previous paragraph. General derogation clauses delegate particular issues to be decided at enterprise level under conditions specified in the sector agreement and with outcomes that can deviate from sectoral minima or standards. In the limit case, as in some sector agreements in manufacturing in Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands the sector agreement does not specify (minimum) pay provisions. Temporary ‘inability to pay’ clauses allow the suspension or renegotiation of (part of) the agreement in cases of hardship, although how tightly this is defined varies. General opening or derogation clauses are an instrument of organized decentralisation within sectoral agreements; they {{have no place in}} enterprise agreements. Temporary <b>hardship</b> <b>clauses</b> can apply to any collective agreement at any level and rather being an element of decentralisation they are a safety valve in agreements that define hard minimum or standard conditions, and in agreements that cover a period longer than one year.|$|R
30|$|Specific one-off <b>hardship</b> <b>clauses,</b> {{related to}} the recession, in Germany’s {{chemicals}} and metalworking sector agreements in 2009 and 2010 {{made it possible to}} vary the implementation of elements of the wage settlement in these years. In Finland, several sector agreements in 2010 included a similar clause allowing individual companies to adjust the agreed wage increase to reflect their own financial circumstances. In Norway, a one-off opening clause in most private sector agreements provided local negotiators with the option not to implement the sector increase agreed for 2009. Proposals of the industrial employers to add specific opening clauses to industry agreements have routinely been rejected by the Swedish unions. In 2009, however, under pressure of sharply rising unemployment combined with the government’s refusal to raise the level of unemployment benefits, the metal workers union conceded a temporary two-years crisis agreement reminiscent of German-style opening clauses (Kjellberg 2012 : 63). In Austria, in addition, the 2011 metalworkers’ collective agreement contains a clause allowing companies which {{in the last three years}} did not have a positive operating result to split the agreed wage increase for the sector in a general and a contingent part.|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} {{of constitutional law}} for private law in general lies in its grant of selective guarantees. Moreover, it contains guidelines and provides impulses. Family law is no exception since in its case, too, the Basic Law contains {{a set of rules}} which traces out the crucial, guiding principles merely to be fleshed out and concretized by the legislator. Nevertheless, {{there is no doubt that}} through its fundamental declarations the Basic Law (influences family law or attempts to influence it. The Basic Law does not contain a system of family law as such. The declarations of the Basic Law on marriage and the family have not provided impulses for the reforms in the post-war period which have transformed the whole of family law, at least not to the extent that is often assumed with a certain constitutional fervour. This accords with the clear recognition that ordinary statute law too can only direct social behaviour within very narrow limits. Family law is a mirror of social reality; it shapes that reality only slightly. This may disappoint the family law judge. The merits of the Constitution — or more precisely, the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court — are to be found in the manner in which it concretises basic rights in a binding way and, in view of the numerous reforms of the post-war period, in the possibility it presents for judicial review. Moreover, the decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court have lead to an increase in sensitivity towards those basic rights, to a change in values and to rationalisation. Problems are created by the almost total lack of acceptance of standarizing legal rules. This is part of a general development for which the Federal Constitutional Court is certainly not responsible. However, the Court ought to resist this development, expressed in legislation by the use of blanket — and <b>hardship</b> <b>clauses</b> and in the courts through decisions based on principles of fairness, more strongly at least where family law is concerned.

This convention does not have any special provision for force majeure and hardship. However, provision of Art. 79 has the same effects as force majeure. But the question is, is it possible to include the hardship situation into the scope of this article, or must we go via national law. The opinions differ. The „impediment“ according pt the Art. 79 (1) may be interpreted, according to prevailing opinions, also as economic or financial hardship. However, the core of problem is with the different consequences of the typical hardship situation - application before courts or arbitrators.

This {{has not been}} the case until recent years: collective bargaining and the rigid system of wage setting have been often cited as {{one of the reasons for}} Germany's high structural unemployment.
