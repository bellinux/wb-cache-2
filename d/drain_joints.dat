All were seen in our outpatient clinic with severely painful knees with effusion. Blood tests, synovial fluid analysis, including polarised light microscopic examination for crystals, and x rays confirmed the clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis. They were treated successively with aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, and intra-articular injections of steroids, all without success.

In this model, the KRN transgenic T cells and nontransgenic B cells both recognize the glycolytic enzyme glucose- 6 -phosphate-isomerase (GPI) as an autoantigen. Here, {{we followed the}} anti-GPI B cell response that naturally arises in K/BxN mice. The anti-GPI B cell response was robust and arose {{at the same time}} as the development of serum anti-GPI autoantibody and joint inflammation.

In lymphotoxin-β receptor-Ig-treated mice, which lack LNs, the development of arthritis was completely inhibited up to 5 – 6 weeks. At later times, some arthritis did develop, but at a significantly reduced level. Thus, in this spontaneous model of autoimmunity, the LNs <b>draining</b> the distal <b>joints</b> are essential for both the inhibition and amplification of the arthritogenic B cell response.

40|$|Michigan {{is located}} in a wet-freeze climate zone. During winter the deicing-salt {{application}} is needed to melt snow on highways. Freezing {{in the presence of a}} deicing salt solution is considered a severe concrete exposure condition. Prolonged exposure in pavement joints has been found to erode the concrete binder material (portland cement paste) when coupled with its low internal frost resistance (i. e. insufficient air and poorly <b>drained</b> <b>joints).</b> This creates a weak zone resulting in joint spalling from heavy wheel loading. Many highways have been found to suffer this type of distress within ten years requiring expensive joint repairs. This research investigates the material level mechanisms for frost deterioration under deicing salt exposure by the aid of systematic application of various experimental techniques, such as sub-freezing length change measurement, micro- and macro-characterization of scaling properties and nitrogen sorption test. A new conceptual model is provided for the surface deterioration that occurs within a thin surface layer when exposed to a deicing salt solution. The major stress producing mechanism is ice-growth within the capillary pores exacerbated by cryogenic suction of the liquid brine present on the surface, thus feeding further ice-growth and leading to high tensile stresses in the direction of least internal restraint and “popping” of thin mortar flakes. This process repeats itself for every freeze-thaw cycle. These findings pave the way for the proposal of sorptivity as a performance-based criterion to evaluate scaling resistance in concrete and its theoretical nature is enhanced by a refined model capable of capturing the effect of pore size characteristics (pore volume, its size distribution and connectivity). This further leads to the identification and application of effective mitigation techniques, including reconfiguration of paste pore system towards a more refined and discontinued structure and utilization of a hydrophobic pore liner in the silicate substrate of hydration products as surface treatment...|$|R

The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes.

While draining, water and organic acid from the soil slowly (over thousands or millions of years) enlarges these cracks, dissolving the calcium carbonate and carrying it away in solution. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. Cooling groundwater or mixing of different groundwaters will also create conditions suitable for cave formation.|$|R
50|$|Trench drains {{are made}} in a factory that specializes in making {{concrete}} shapes. The channel pieces range in width and length, larger channels requiring heavy equipment to move them, however most channels can be picked up and moved easily by hand. The channels are formed in large metal forms that (usually) have a pre-determined channel width, depth, and slope. Like in the cast-in-place method, a metal frame {{is attached to the}} form and concrete is poured and finished in a factory atmosphere. The advantage to the pre-cast trench drain is again time savings - big time savings at the job site. Pre-cast trench drains made of a polymer concrete are also more sturdy and reliable than cast-in-place trenches. Once a trough is dug, the pre-cast trench sections can be installed and quickly be put into service through numerous methods. A patty method can be used by placing clumps of concrete at each trench <b>drain</b> channel <b>joint</b> and the channels can be levelled and set as such. Further installation methods involve clipping rebar through installation device used with the channel. Concrete will need to be poured to surround the trench drain so that the load can be transferred from the channel and grate to the surrounding areas.|$|R

Osteochondrosis and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae were the most common causes of nonsuppurative joint disease in the joints examined. The major macroscopic differences between these two arthropathies were in the nature and severity of the synovial and cartilaginous lesions and involvement of the lymph node <b>draining</b> the diseased <b>joint.</b> Typically, in osteochondrosis, the changes are feathery hypertrophy of villi, focal full-thickness cartilage buckles, ulcers or flaps, and no change in the draining lymph node, whereas in Erysipelothrix- caused arthritis, the villous hypertrophy is severe and polypoid in nature, there is diffuse erosion of articular cartilage, and the draining lymph node is consistently hypertrophic and often cystic...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{epidemiologic}} {{evidence supports}} {{a link between}} periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis. The actual involvement of periodontitis in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and the underlying mechanisms remain, however, poorly understood. We investigated the influence of concomitant periodontitis on clinical and histopathologic characteristics of T cell-mediated experimental arthritis and evaluated modulation of type II collagen (CII) -reactive Th cell phenotype as a potential mechanism. Repeated oral inoculations of periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella nigrescens induced periodontitis in mice, as evidenced by alveolar bone resorption. Interestingly, concurrent periodontitis induced by both bacteria significantly aggravated the severity of collagen-induced arthritis. Exacerbation of arthritis was characterized by increased arthritic bone erosion, whereas cartilage damage remained unaffected. Both P. gingivalis and P. nigrescens skewed the CII-specific T cell response in lymph nodes <b>draining</b> arthritic <b>joints</b> toward the Th 17 phenotype without affecting Th 1. Importantly, the levels of IL- 17 induced by periodontal pathogens in CII-specific T cells directly correlated with the intensity of arthritic bone erosion, suggesting relevance in pathology. Furthermore, IL- 17 production was significantly correlated with periodontal disease-induced IL- 6 in lymph node cell cultures. The effects of the two bacteria diverged in that P. nigrescens, in contrast to P. gingivalis, suppressed the joint-protective type 2 cytokines, including IL- 4. Further in vitro studies showed that the Th 17 induction strongly depended on TLR 2 expression on APCs and was highly promoted by IL- 1. Our data provide evidence of the involvement of periodontitis in the pathogenesis of T cell-driven arthritis through induction of Ag-specific Th 17 response...|$|R
40|$|Collagen-induced {{arthritis}} (CIA) in DBA- 1 lac/J mice {{often has}} a low incidence, with gradual disease expression occurring over a broad time span (between days 35 and 70). The exact mechanisms underlying spontaneous expression are still poorly understood, although {{it is evident that}} some inflammatory cytokines like IL- 1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are potent accelerators. We have investigated whether we could trigger collagen type II-driven inflammation by: (i) enhancing anti-collagen type II (CII) antibodies, or (ii) a non-related inflammatory process. Male DBA- 1 lac/J mice were immunized with 100 micrograms bovine type II collagen in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), resulting in a low disease expression at day 28. Addition of anti-CII antibodies slightly enhanced the expression of CIA. Zymosan (3 mg), given intraperitoneally, induced consistent expression of CIA after 1 week, whereas a retarded onset was noted with higher dosages. Local injection of a low dose of Zymosan (60 micrograms) in the knee joint, clearly potentiated the expression of CIA at that particular site. Higher concentrations not only elicited prolonged CIA expression at the injection site, but also induced marked CIA in the <b>draining</b> ankle <b>joint.</b> In contrast, intra-articular injection of Zymosan in nonimmunized DBAs or methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) /FCA-immunized controls only induced transient joint inflammation. The nature of the highly erosive CIA was confirmed histologically, and could easily be discriminated from the reversible changes induced with Zymosan.

Uptake of label {{was observed in}} the inflamed paws of arthritic rats and cells were located in synovium and periarticular bone marrow by autoradiography. Uptake was greater with lymphoblasts from donors in the late prodromal phase of adjuvant-induced arthritis (arthritic donors) than from normal donors. With arthritic donors, recruitment of lymphoblasts from TD lymph was greater than from mesenteric duct lymph, suggesting {{that most of the}} joint-seeking lymphoblasts in arthritic rats arose in peripheral lymphoid tissues. Lymphoblasts from arthritic donors were also detected in the synovium of paws from normal rats. Recovery of lymphoblasts was monitored in other tissues; this revealed, in arthritic recipients, competition among extra-articular sites of inflammation (adjuvant injection site, draining lymph nodes, and lymph nodes <b>draining</b> affected <b>joints),</b> the lungs, and the inflamed synovium for recruitment of lymphoblasts from arthritic donors. In contrast, while some lymphoblasts from normal donors were recruited to inflamed joints, the small intestine was the main site of recruitment. The results reflect the known propensity of T lymphoblasts generated in peripheral lymphoid tissues to enter inflamed tissues. However, some mesenteric duct lymphoblasts also entered inflamed synovium. The observed pattern of recruitment of lymphoblasts to synovium is pertinent to the pathogenesis of arthritis, the potential roles of arthritogenic and "bystander" lymphocytes and the known links between the joints and inflammation in the intestine...|$|R

40|$|A {{single dose}} of either cyclosporin-A (CsA) or {{lobenzarit}} (CCA) given with an arthrogenic adjuvant completely prevented expression of experimental adjuvant arthritis in rats. The {{aim of this}} study was to understand how these drugs prevented the arthritis expression by studying the popliteal lymph nodes <b>draining</b> the arthritic <b>joints</b> at various times after adjuvant injection. Neither drug affected the proliferation in popliteal lymph nodes at the time arthritis was normally expressed, however, there was a marked change in the types of cells present. Immunofluorescence assays showed a reduction in the proportion of CD 4 + cells, while the proportion of B-lymphocytes was almost doubled. This coincided with a marked elevation in the ability of these cells to produce interleukin (IL) - 6. At the same time production of other cytokines (IL- 2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN) -gamma) was not greatly affected. However, one day after adjuvant injection IL- 2 and IFN-gamma production was reduced. In vitro experiments showed that IL- 6 production by lymphoid cells was relatively unaffected by CsA and CCA but IL- 2, TNF and IFN-gamma were suppressed by CsA. The results indicate that CsA and CCA may modify the response to the arthritic adjuvant by specifically inhibiting IL- 2, TNF and IFN-gamma production at the time of adjuvant injection. The lack of inhibition of IL- 6 by these drugs reveals it may not play a key role in the initiation of this model of chronic inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Synovial fluid <b>drains</b> out of <b>joints</b> {{through an}} {{interstitial}} pathway. Hyaluronan, the major polysaccharide of synovial fluid, attenuates this fluid drainage; {{it creates a}} graded opposition to outflow that increases with pressure (outflow ‘buffering’). This {{has been attributed to}} size-related molecular reflection at the interstitium-fluid interface. Chain length is reduced in inflammatory arthritis. We therefore investigated the dependence of outflow buffering on hyaluronan chain length. Hyaluronan molecules of mean molecular mass ≈ 2200, 530, 300 and 90 kDa and concentration 3. 6 mg ml− 1 were infused into the knees of anaesthetized rabbits, with Ringer solution as control in the contralateral joint. Trans-synovial drainage rate was recorded at known joint pressures. Pressure was raised in steps every 30 – 60 min (range 2 – 24 cmH 2 O). With hyaluronan- 90 and hyaluronan- 300 the fluid drainage rate was reduced relative to Ringer solution (P < 0. 001, ANOVA) but increased steeply with pressure. The opposition to outflow, defined as the pressure required to drive unit outflow, did not increase with pressure, i. e. there was no outflow buffering. With hyaluronan- 530 and hyaluronan- 2000 the fluid drainage rate became relatively insensitive to pressure, causing a near plateau of flow. Opposition to outflow increased markedly with pressure, by up to 3. 3 times over the explored pressures. Hyaluronan concentration in the joint cavity increased over the drainage period, indicating partial reflection of hyaluronan by synovial interstitium. Reflected fractions were 0. 12, 0. 33, 0. 25 and 0. 79 for hyaluronan- 90, - 300, - 530 and - 2200, respectively. Thus the flow-buffering effect of hyaluronan depended on chain length, and shortening the chains reduced the degree of molecular reflection. The latter should reduce the concentration polarization at the tissue interface, and hence the local osmotic pressure opposing fluid drainage. In rheumatoid arthritis the reduced chain length will facilitate the escape of hyaluronan and fluid...|$|R
40|$|Background: Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates {{the relevance of}} intestinal microbiota in shaping the immune response and supports its contribution {{to the development of}} autoimmune diseases. Prebiotic non-digestible oligosaccharides are known to selectively support growth of commensal Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli and adjust the microbiota composition. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy of microbiota modulation using non-digestible oligosaccharides as a therapeutic approach for T cell-dependent autoimmune arthritis. Methods: IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) deficient mice spontaneously developing an autoimmune T cell-dependent arthritis were used for this study. To examine the feasibility of microbiota modulation as a therapeutic approach during established disease, IL- 1 Ra-/-mice which had already developed arthritis under conventional microbial status were orally fed a prebiotic diet containing shortchain galacto- and long-chain fructooligosaccharides (scGos:lcFos, 9 : 1). Disease progression was monitored and intestinal and systemic T cell differentiation was studied. Multiplex 454 pyrosequencing of fecal bacterial 16 S rRNA was used to asses changes in composition of microbiota. Results: Oral treatment of arthritic IL- 1 Ra-/-mice with scGoslcFos significantly suppressed the progression of arthritis. Gene expression of T-bet and RORγt, the Th 1 and Th 17 -related transcription factors, in lymph nodes <b>draining</b> the arthritic <b>joints</b> was significantly reduced in the group receiving the scGoslcFos diet. Furthermore, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning revealed that a prebiotic diet containing scGoslcFos significantly improved bone mineral density and tended to increase bone mineral content in arthritic IL- 1 Ra-/-mice. High-throughput pyrosequencing revealed a that scGoslcFos has a profound effect on relative abundance of bacteria in different taxa. The most notable alterations concerned a significant increase in Lactobacilli and a strong decrease in the genus Turicibacter. Interestingly, intestinal gene expression of the Treg-related transcription factor FoxP 3 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 were increased with scGoslcFos. Accordingly, small intestine lamina propria lymphocytes of mice receiving the scGoslcFos diet produced significant higher levels of IL- 10 upon ex vivo stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Production of IL- 4 and IFNγ also tended to be increased, while production of TNFα, IL- 6 and IL- 17 was not affected by the prebiotic diet. Conclusions: Our data suggest that scGoslcFos suppresses arthritis progression, potentially through induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 10 and IL- 4. Suppression of disease progression using dietary intervention with prebiotic scGoslcFos may be applicable as a therapeutic approach to suppress autoimmune arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Vaccination in {{autoimmunity}} {{can have}} beneficial, but also detrimental effects. In this thesis, {{we tried to}} identify {{factors that contribute to}} a favourable or an unfavourable outcome of vaccination in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and experimental arthritis. In the first part, we focused on the potential unwanted effects of vaccination against Meningitis type C in two studies in JIA patients receiving the Meningococcal C vaccine. In chapter 2 we describe that no clinical disease aggravation was detected after MenC vaccination in a large cohort of JIA patients. Although geometric mean titers of anti-MenC antibodies were lower in treatment groups receiving immune suppressive medication, functional MenC bactericidal capacity of these antibodies was adequate in all patients. These were encouraging results, supporting the positive advice of administration of vaccines to children with JIA. However, the results of chapter 3 raise a concern for JIA patients with non-remitting disease. The increased pro-inflammatory cytokine profile raised by vaccine specific T cells after vaccination in these patients in combination with an aberrant FOXP 3 + regulatory T cell (Treg) response theoretically could hold a risk for aggravating autoimmunity, although this potential clinical effect was not observed in our study. For the second part of this thesis, we studied the potential protective effects of nasal peptide vaccination against rat adjuvant induced arthritis. First, we hypothesized that mucosal vaccination with a bystander antigen like heat shock protein (HSP) (peptide immunotherapy) may be able to protect against autoimmune arthritis (reviewed in chapter 4). In chapter 5 we show that mucosal administration of such a bystander peptide derived from bacterial HSP 60 protects against experimental arthritis, and that this protection was transferable by CD 4 + T cells. Skewing of the peptide-specific immune response towards a regulatory phenotype might have played a role, as peptide treatment was associated with a reduction of peptide specific tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) production by CD 4 +Tcells and the presence of suppressive CD 4 +FoxP 3 + Treg cells. Addition of a mucosal adjuvant (CpG) to peptide specific immunotherapy clearly enhanced clinical efficacy in experimental arthritis (chapter 6). Co-treatment of p 1 with CpG increased both the number and activation status of plasmacytoid DC in draining MLN, which was accompanied by augmented p 1 -specific T cell proliferation and IL- 10 production. After arthritis induction, p 1 - and p 1 /CpG-treated rats showed increased amounts of CD 4 +FoxP 3 + Tregs in the <b>joint</b> <b>draining</b> lymph nodes, which correlated with lower arthritis scores. The data in chapter 7 show an improvement in the clinical and immunological effect of nasal HSP peptide immunotherapy in a therapeutic (instead of preventive) setting. Peptide immunotherapy with a bacterial HSP 60 peptide after initiation of adjuvant arthritis was most effective when combined with low dose TNFα receptor blockade (Etanercept), reaching the same level of protection as full dose Etanercept treatment. Combination treatment led to an increase in peptide specific IL- 10 production by CD 4 + T cells and an upregulation of FoxP 3 gene expression in CD 4 +CD 25 + Treg cells. These new approaches for more effective peptide immunotherapy could pave the way for a promising future of peptide specific immunotherapy in autoimmune disease...|$|R
