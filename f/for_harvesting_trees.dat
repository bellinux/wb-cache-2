40|$|There are {{extensive}} revegetation {{programs in}} the wheatbelt of Western Australia. Revegetation has many objectives including lowering water tables to combat water logging and soil salinisation, improving agricultural productivity, and producing a commercial crop of trees <b>for</b> <b>harvesting.</b> <b>Trees</b> are planted by farmers, conservation groups and Government authorities to rehabilitate, beautify and manage degraded agricultural land, parks and road verges. In addition to improving plant diversity and restoring ecosystem functions, revegetation {{is an opportunity to}} provide food and habitat for wildlife and to conserve regional biodiversity. The objective of the study reported here was to investigate whether the tree species planted in the wheatbelt are colonized by invertebrates (e. g. insects and spiders) and whether the abundance and variety of invertebrates on planted trees differs between tree species and between revegetation and remnant native vegetation. The study also investigated the use of revegetation by birds and compared this to bird communities in remnant vegetation. Invertebrates were sampled on trees planted along the Great Eastern Highway as part of the Main Roads Department 2 ̆ 7 Ribbons of Green 2 ̆ 7 program, as well as trees planted by community groups and Greening Western Australia. We asked whether the best species of trees were being planted to restore and enhance regional biodiversity. The canopy invertebrate fauna of 10 trees of each of eight species of Eucalyptus and jam wattle (Acacia acuminata) was sampled by chemical knockdown. Jam wattle and three of the eucalypts, including wandoo (E. wandoo), are indigenous to the Northam District. Three of the eucalypts are indigenous to the south coast of Western Australia, one to northwestern Western Australia, and the eighth is indigenous to coastal South Australia. Wandoo was sampled in both revegetation and remnant natural vegetation. In addition to sampling invertebrates, leaf toughness and levels of foliar nutrients (NPK) were sampled for all tree species. Leaf toughness and foliar nutrients were measured as other studies had found relationships between toughness and nutrients, with the abundance and variety of canopy invertebrates. Moderate to high invertebrate densities were found on all tree species. Indigenous trees tended to support the most diverse and abundant invertebrate faunas: species originating from southern coastal regions and northwestern Western Australia supported the least. Wandoo trees in revegetation tended to have higher populations of some insects than wandoo growing in remnant vegetation. Leaf toughness appeared to affect the size of invertebrate populations on some eucalypt species, but the effects of foliar nutrients were inconsistent, possibly because nutrient levels were elevated as a result of fertiliser applications. During winter (June),three patches of remnant vegetation and seven replanted areas were surveyed for birds. Twenty-five species of birds were recorded of which three were found only in remnant vegetation and six were found only on the replanted areas. However, all species recorded are widely distributed throughout the Western Australian wheatbelt and, {{with the possible exception of}} the White-browed Babbler (Pomatostomus supercilosus), no significance can be attributed to the differences in bird species composition between remnant and replanted areas: at least in winter, birds are as likely to use revegetated areas as remnant vegetation. The absence of the babbler from revegetated areas is possibly due to the lack of logs and woody debris on the planted sites. Sixteen of the 25 bird species are predominantly insectivorous, four are nectarivores, four are seed-eaters, and one is a frugivore. This suggests that a similar range of foraging resources are available in both remnant vegetation and revegetation. To restore and enhance regional biodiversity, we recommend that revegetation programs, including commercial plantings, should use a variety of tree species and emphasise regional species. Where this is not possible, species from nearby regions should be used. Planted areas should also be diversified by using a variety of indigenous shrubs and herbs, as well as trees, and by adding logs and coarse woody debris to the area planted. Provision of nest boxes would accelerate the colonization of revegetated areas by hole-nesting birds...|$|E
40|$|In peach industry, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} cost of the land, energy and salaries, in {{the last thirty years}} have been developed horticultural strategies to increase the productivity of the orchards and to reduce the employment of hand workers. In areas in which large part of the days are brilliant, clean sky, with high levels of light intensity, and relative humidity is low, as those with a Mediterranean climate, to reach the above mentioned goal have been developed planting systems based on high tree densities and new tree shapes. In Southern Italy, technicians have been particularly active in performing new tree canopy architectures and growers showed to be very sensitive to these innovations as evidenced from the replacement of the traditional open vase with “inclined double walls” systems Y, V and Tatura trellis. These new planting systems, respect to those based on the “open vase“ allowed to obtain higher yield together with a larger amount of top quality fruits and this as consequence of the increased amount of light intercepted and more uniformly distributed within the tree. In this last decade, {{the increasing}} costs of the trellis components (iron wires and poles) to build up the trellis and the costs of the trees, due to the royalties protecting the new released cultivars, became the major limits of this super-intensive planting systems. For this reasons, despite the high efficiency of the workers in practicing the manual techniques (fruit thinning, harvest and pruning) the “inclined double walls” started to be abandoned and technicians and growers start to move to the catalan vase. This new system has been develop recently in Spain, being a new tree shape, a dwarfed vase named catalano, that complies relative high density with low cost for orchard planting and management. This training system, to control vegetative excessive growth, is based on several treatments of topping, some of them, particularly during the summer season, are performed mechanically. Preliminary observations carried out in Sibari, seem to confirm that the vasetto catalano - even managed without treatments with paclobutrazol, a growth retardant, as used in Spain, - could represent a valid planting system to produce both fruit for the fresh and for the processed (fresh cut, sliced fruits) fruits market. In greenhouse production, where precocious and high yield are the required conditions to have early return, planting systems have to be based on tree shapes that fit with high densities, as Y and V, currently the only one able to provide fruit of optimal quality for out-of-season peaches market. In California, although a certain agronomic success has been obtained by the KAC V, the “inclined double wall “systems were unsuccessful. Other shapes as “Quad V” and “Hex-V”, that are a sort of compromise between the perpendicular “V” system and the traditional open vase, have been developed in order to address some of the vigor issue inherent in the two scaffold perpendicular system as well as to reduce planting densities and orchard establishment cost. Scientist and field technicians are still searching for the molecule for fruit thinning and to build up the right machine <b>for</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>trees</b> trained to open vase. Unfortunately, so far, only summer pruning mechanization has been developed. In Chile most of the information necessary to develop the important advances of fruit industry occurred in the last 25 years have been introduced or adapted from abroad. Peach orchards have been steadily intensified, predominantly using denser orchards with refined form of the open vase system, with the perpendicular V or three arm trees currently being the most common system. Generally, tree size reduction {{has been one of the}} main objective of breeders by searching for compact and brachitic vegetative habitus and for dwarfing rootstocks but no satisfactory genotypes has been selected yet and this last still remain a potential tool for high density planting systems. The researches on the use of chemical agents able to control vegetative growth were abandoned in many Countries because the environmentalist movements hardly contrasted such kind of solution. However, rational irrigation, mineral nutrition and soil management (controlled water stress, fertirrigation according to phenologic tree phase and real absorption, cover crops) could contribute to improve planting systems, controlling the vigor trees in orchard...|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} in even aged timber {{management}} is to select a suitable stand <b>for</b> <b>harvest.</b> <b>Trees</b> must be of merchantable size, a desirable species, and in an area accessible to harvesting equipment. Once selected, the stand is harvested (usually using feller-bunchers, skidders, and processors). Merchantable trees (trees with boles {{large enough to be}} sold to a mill) are harvested and processed whereas unmerchantable trees (trees that are too small or of an undesirable species) are either crushed by machinery or cut to make equipment movement easier. This process is called clearcutting, and the end result is a cutblock. At this stage, the forestry company is required to replant the same proportion of species that were there previous to harvest. Usually, silviculture techniques are employed to ensure that species survive and grow in the proper proportion. Shade-intolerant species such as trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and marsh reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis) will thrive in the open conditions of a clearcut, outcompeting shade-tolerant species such as white spruce (Picea glauca). Mechanical site preparation and herbicide treatments are often applied initially to allow for adequate shade-tolerant growth. This way, the shade-tolerants are given a head start and the shade-intolerants will catch up over time once silviculture treatments are stopped, resulting in an even-aged stand of trees with little vertical stratification.|$|R

Experiences in Nordic countries and Canada have shown that retrieval of stem volume and mean tree height on a tree or stand level from laser scanner data performs as well as, or better than, photogrammetric methods, and better than other remote sensing methods. The increasing interest in laser data for forestry applications {{has led to the}} present research, which quantifies forest growth and detects possible changes over time using repeated multi-temporal laser surveys over boreal forests. For the thesis, methods and techniques were developed for detecting change automatically and estimating forest growth using multi-temporal airborne {{laser scanning}}. The performance of these methods was evaluated based on the field measurements consisting of individual trees or sample plots. All the component studies were carried out in boreal forest at a test site in southern Finland. For the detection of change, e. g. <b>harvested</b> or fallen <b>trees,</b> an automatic method was developed based on the image differencing technique applied to digital canopy height models generated from laser data from different dates. New scientific approaches developed for height and volume growth estimation were the individual tree-top differencing method, digital surface differencing and canopy height distribution based analysis. In the individual tree-top differencing method, growth estimation was based on individual tree identification and a tree-to-tree matching algorithm. The digital surface differencing method was based on the difference image of digital surface models. In the analysis based on canopy height distribution, growth was determined {{as a function of the}} difference in corresponding percentiles of the canopy height distribution between different laser acquisitions. These methods can be applied at both the individual tree level and the plot/stand level.

These sinks can potentially be traded, providing the landowner with another income source. For 2 ̆ 2 oil mallees 2 ̆ 2 to realise the potential outlined above, there is a need to obtain information on their growth characteristics, particularly that of the below-ground structures. The aims of the research presented in this thesis were to determine the biomass and amount of carbon being sequested by the below ground organs of E. kochii subsp. plenissima at four different ages, and of E. loxophleba subsp. lissophloia at two ages and to compare these differences to the above ground growth. In addition, the impact of harvesting of the above ground biomass for oil production on the carbon sequestration and growth of the below ground organs was also determined. E. plenissima and E. lissophloia present contrasting stories about the effects harvesting has on biomass sequestration. E. plenissima displayed no significant difference between unharvested and <b>harvested</b> <b>trees</b> <b>for</b> lignotuber biomass. Annual re-growth of the above ground biomass <b>for</b> the <b>harvested</b> <b>trees</b> was 4. 3 tonnes per hectare per year and unharvested trees recorded only slightly higher average annual growth (5. 2 tonnes/km hedge). At age 2. 5 years, E. plenissima has enough carbon reserves within the lignotuber to fund rapid re-growth after harvesting and establish a leaf area that is large enough to restock the Iignotuber and maintain above ground growth...|$|R

Pines are also commercially grown and <b>harvested</b> <b>for</b> Christmas <b>trees.</b> Pine cones, the largest and most durable of all conifer cones, are craft favorites. Pine boughs, appreciated especially in wintertime for their pleasant smell and greenery, are popularly cut for decorations. A number of species are attacked by nematodes, causing pine wilt disease, which can kill some quickly. Pine needles are also used for making decorative articles like baskets, trays, pots, etc. This Native American skill is now being replicated across the world. Pine needle handicrafts are made in the US, Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua and India. Pine needles serve as food for various Lepidoptera. See List of Lepidoptera that feed on pines.|$|R
