His first goal, a header, appeared to have been scored from an offside position, but for the second, in the 86th minute, he dispossessed Philippe Mexès, evaded two more opponents, and bent the ball into the top corner from [...] with his weaker left foot.

2500|$|The {{review was}} devastating, and I wasn't clever enough to {{understand}} or use the possible notoriety attached to that performance (after all, obviously no one was bored) in a positive career move. I had discovered that publicly performing my own work placed me in an exceedingly vulnerable position emotionally and physically, and I wanted none of it. I believe now that I was basically uncommitted to my work and unable to take responsibility publicly for my decisions. [...] I had worked mainly for the positive response of my peers and of an audience, not gearing my work towards that response but expecting it as the dividends of having worked. [...] When the audience and my peers turned on me, I picked up my marbles and went home. [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> to stop making work.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{began taking}} shape {{towards the end}} of the hiatus. Burnley stated that after growing {{frustrated}} with the lack of answers concerning his health condition, he decided to focus on writing music, saying on That Metal Show, [...] "I literally took my medical records [...] and I slammed them down like, 'You know what, forget this, I'm not getting anywhere with this', so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> to stop trying to find out whatever it was and just focus on our music, and that's when Dark Before Dawn really started to take shape." [...] After the album was mostly written, Burnley began assembling new members of the band, including Jasen Rauch (lead guitar; originally from Red), Keith Wallen (rhythm guitar and backing vocals; originally from Adelitas Way), Aaron Bruch (bass), and Shaun Foist (drums; originally from Picture Me Broken).|$|E
2500|$|The song {{inspired}} songwriter Margo Guryan to {{move into}} writing pop music. She said: [...] "I {{thought it was just}} gorgeous. I bought the record and played it a million times, then sat down and wrote 'Think of Rain.' That's really how I started writing that way. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> it was better than what was happening in jazz." [...] Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne wrote that [...] "It's impossible to exaggerate how beautiful this song is. Everywhere, it takes risks." [...] Bono said in October 2006 during Brian Wilson's induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame that [...] "the string arrangement on 'God Only Knows' is fact and proof of angels". Jimmy Webb, an American popular music composer, has also stated his love for the song, stating, [...] "I love 'God Only Knows' and its bow to the baroque that goes {{all the way back to}} 1740 and Johann Sebastian Bach. It represents the whole tradition of liturgical music that I feel is a spiritual part of Brian's music. And Carl's singing is pretty much at its pinnacle—as good as it ever got." [...] In a 2003 solo concert in Tel Aviv, Steven Wilson, frontman of Porcupine Tree, declared [...] "God Only Knows" [...] as his favorite song of all time. On the Insurgentes listening party that took place in Mexico City in 2009, Steven Wilson said it was a perfect song. Simon Neil of Scottish band Biffy Clyro has the lyrics [...] "God only knows what I'd be without you" [...] tattooed across his chest.|$|E

5000|$|Bejar {{admits that}} {{when it came to}} {{recording}} the album there was initially a scary lack of ideas coming into the record ... The songs, in a performative way, weren't really coming together. They all had really awesome parts, but as a band, it just kinda sounded like a bunch of noise, sometimes. So <b>I</b> kind of <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> to make a bit more of a studio record. That's never really my intention, but that's what happens. I kind of wanted to make things dreamier sounding then they had been of late. The album's sound was also influenced by the fact that Destroyer's piano player Ted Bois took it upon himself, as an alternative to keyboard and piano accompaniment, to create all string and synth arrangements for the songs. Bejar maintains [...] "That stuff I didn't even see coming. I didn't even know {{it was going to happen}} until we got into the studio. A lot of the songs <b>I</b> <b>just</b> had no idea they were going to be so symphonic, at least half of them.

2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world.

But it didn't hurt me a bit and so I couldn't get out of going to church. So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> I would put my boots on and go that way.

He was in the study thinking of his sermon and other heavenly things, and I kept out of his way before I went to Sunday School. Father does not look at people's legs in church, so of course he did not notice mine, but all the gossips did and talked about it, and that is why I am writing this letter to the Journal to explain. I suppose I did very wrong, since everybody says so, and I am sorry and I am wearing those awful stockings to punish myself, although father bought me two nice new black pairs as soon as Mr. Flagg's store opened on Monday morning.

5000|$|Following {{the release}} of Lopez's single [...] "Dance Again" [...] in April 2012, she stated that she was unsure {{whether or not it}} was the lead single of a {{greatest}} hits album, or a new studio album. That May, she released the track [...] "Goin' In" [...] which was featured on the soundtrack for the film Step Up Revolution; she still was unsure.

He spoke impeccable English and but for his beard and some of his gestures might well have been taken for an English public school type. Our first impressions were unfavourable. He was restless, smoked incessantly and seemed too intent on making a good impression. Halfway through the evening, our attitude completely changed. We recognized that he was not only an unusually gifted man, but that he had the indefinable something that marks the man who has worked seriously upon himself...
