50|$|Both lakes are {{stocked with}} {{incredible}} goldfish {{that allow the}} visitor to literally <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> fish pellets straight into their gaping mouths. Throwing some pellets into the water makes the water look like it begins to boil as the fish start to feed.|$|E
50|$|The GAU-18/A, is a {{lightweight}} {{variant of the}} M2/M3, and is used on the USAF's MH-53 Pave Low and HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters. These weapons do not use the M2HB barrel, and are typically set up as left-hand feed, right-hand charging weapons, but on the HH-60 Pavehawks that use the EGMS (External Gun Mount System) the gun is isolated from the shooter by a recoil absorbing cradle and all weapons are set up as right hand charge but vary between left and right <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> depending on what side of the aircraft it is on. A feed chute adapter {{is attached to the}} left or right <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> pawl bracket allowing the weapon to receive ammunition through a feed chute system connected to externally mounted ammunition containers holding 600 rounds each.|$|E
50|$|Hand-reared budgies {{may take}} {{slightly}} longer to wean than parent-raised chicks. <b>Hand</b> <b>feeding</b> is not routinely done with budgerigars, {{due to their}} small size and because young parent raised birds can be readily tamed.|$|R
50|$|With <b>hand</b> <b>feeding</b> {{and hides}} {{situated}} {{all over the}} centre, visitors can get close {{to many of the}} ducks. These features, as well as the large number of habitats and different species, are common in WWT centres.|$|R

Orana has contributed to the managed zoo-based programme and over 15 giraffes have been bred, most of which were transferred to other zoos.|$|E
50|$|The Gulf of Mexico tank {{is a large}} 120,000 gallon tank in the {{aquarium}} with two full grown Nurse sharks and Bonnet-head sharks. Other fish such as, Atlantic tarpon, porcupinefish, and a large Goliath grouper live in the tank. Periodically throughout the day, SCUBA Divers <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> the sharks and fish for an audience.|$|E

50|$|Fractures are {{problematic}} because chinchillas {{will want to}} sit on their hind legs and eat with their front paws, so many types of injuries will disturb their natural eating behavior. An animal with a cast may be comforted by <b>hand</b> <b>feeding.</b>|$|R

Children can feed corn {{to some of the}} animals (notably the deer and goats) and the zoo has a restaurant and gift shop. Feeding time for the big cats and bears is a popular zoo attraction. Owner Gail Rogerson enters the cages of these animals and will <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> them meat that is collected from local farms and surrounding areas.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{they are}} seaducks, {{most of the}} mergansers prefer {{riverine}} habitats, with only the red-breasted merganser being common at sea. These large fish-eaters typically have black-and-white, brown and/or green hues in their plumage, and most have somewhat shaggy crests. All have serrated edges to their long and thin bills that help them grip their prey. Along with the smew and hooded merganser, they are therefore often known as [...] "sawbills". The goldeneyes, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>feed</b> mainly on mollusks, and therefore have a more typical duck-bill.|$|E
50|$|The label's first {{release was}} the debut LP of Bree's band The Brunettes. Released October 2002, Holding <b>Hands,</b> <b>Feeding</b> Ducks was a joint release with EMI New Zealand.

50|$|They {{prefer to}} feed on live fish which they catch with their special technique, but will readily feed on other types of meat or leafy {{vegetables}} if offered. <b>Hand</b> <b>feeding</b> is dangerous. Extreme temperatures are known to affect the turtle's appetite and {{would result in the}} turtle refusing to feed until it has been remedied.|$|R
50|$|These {{concrete}} mixers {{are further}} divided {{based on their}} loading mechanism. Cement, sand and other aggregates are loaded in a hydraulically operated hopper and then poured in the mixing drum for final mixing and then can be unloaded by tilting the drum. While in <b>Hand</b> <b>Feed</b> Concrete Mixers, cement, sand and other aggregates are directly added to the mixing drum manually. These both type of concrete mixers are highly popular and used in regular construction activities in Africa, some Middle Eastern Countries and in the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
50|$|Because the M2 was {{intentionally}} {{designed to}} operate in many configurations, it {{can be adapted to}} feed from the left or right side of the weapon by exchanging the belt-holding pawls, and the front and rear cartridge stops (three-piece set to include link stripper), then reversing the bolt switch. The operator must also convert the top-cover belt feed slide assembly from left to right <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> as well as the spring and plunger in the feed arm. This will take a well trained individual less than two minutes to perform.|$|E
50|$|As {{discussed}} above, larvae feed {{either on}} catkins or oak leaves and twigs {{depending upon the}} season. Adults, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>feed</b> on nectar. Studies on Lepidoptera have found that feeding behavior is in fact triggered by sugar-receptor communication with chemosensilla, and that both starch and sucrose compete for taste receptor sites along the sensilla. When starch and sucrose were artificially added to bind to sensilla receptor sites, Lepodoptera stopped food-sucking behavior all together. Even though they were still hungry, their artificially occupied receptor sites signaled otherwise.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that Maharajah Udaibhan Singh of Dholpur had a great liking for the wild animals of Van Vihar. He used to <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> not only the deer and antelopes in the reserve but also animals like foxes, jackals and birds. There is an old forest rest house in Van Vihar. It was initially built by the rulers of Dholpur. Ramsagar part of the sanctuary has Ramsagar Lake.

50|$|In early 2015, a {{proposal}} to locate a tourism venture offshore from Granite Island was made by Oceanic Victor to the Government of South Australia. It received the final necessary approval from the Development Assessment Commission in December 2015. The attraction will involve a floating seacage aquaculture pen, containing up to five tonnes of southern bluefin tuna, which paying customers {{will be able to}} swim with and <b>hand</b> <b>feed.</b> Lesser quantities of other local marine species will also be able to be seen via a floating underwater observatory within the pen and two touch-tank aquaria. The operation previously ran under the name Swim with the Tuna, located in Boston Bay near Port Lincoln from 2010 to 2015.|$|E
