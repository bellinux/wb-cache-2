In addition, we treated a serum containing hepatitis B virus in the same way. Both of these samples were also sham extracted as controls. Known chloroform-sensitive and chloroform-resistant viruses were added directly to the hepatitis-containing serum or plasma as internal controls or to fetal calf serum as external controls and were assayed for infectivity in vitro after chloroform extraction or sham extraction. All infectivity of the diluted plasma that contained at least 10 (4) chimpanzee infective doses of <b>non-A,</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> agent and all infectivity of the serum that contained 10 (3. 5) chimpanzee infective doses of hepatitis B virus were destroyed by chloroform.

40|$|Abstract. We {{reviewed}} {{the medical records}} of 177 patients who at 31 December 1985 had been on dialysis treatment {{for at least one}} year.

The difference was not related to blood transfusions but to the high prevalence of non-A, non-B in hospital patients who had not been transfused. The time on dialysis before the onset of <b>non-A,</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> became gradually shorter, from an average of 82 months before 1980 to 5. 7 months in the patients starting haemodialysis after 1983.

The differentiation of these forms of hepatitis is primarily serologic. The development of antibody to hepatitis A virus can be detected by radioimmunoassay as well as by other test systems. The serologic diagnosis of type B hepatitis rests on the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen or on the development of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen or hepatitis B surface antigen. The serologic diagnosis of <b>non-A</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> is a diagnosis of exclusion for assay systems for this form of disease are not yet available...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} Aeromonas hydrophila endocarditis in a 66 -year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome and <b>non-A,</b> non-B <b>hepatitis,</b> The infection resolved with antibiotic therapy, but the patient succumbed to complications of his underlying illness. This is the second case of Aeromonas endocarditis reported in the world literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) in donor blood {{and the development of}} hepatitis in recipients of that blood was studied in 6293 blood donors and 481 recipients who were followed for 6 to 9 months after transfusion. Of 193 recipients of at least 1 unit of blood positive for anti-HBc, 23 (11. 9 %) developed <b>non-A,</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> compared with 12 (4. 2 %) of 288 recipients of only anti-HBc-negative blood (p< 0. 001). Donor anti-HBc status was not significantly associated with the development of hepatitis B in the recipient and was negatively associated with the development of cytomegalovirus hepatitis. The relationship of donor anti-HBc status and the development of <b>non-A,</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> in the recipient was independent of transfusion volume and elevated donor transaminas...|$|R
40|$|To {{test whether}} {{interferon}} can prevent acute <b>non-A,</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> from becoming chronic, a prospective controlled trial {{was conducted in}} 25 patients; 11 were treated {{for an average of}} 30 days with a mean of 52 megaunits of interferon and 14 acted as controls. 4 patients in the treatment group who continued to have raised serum aminotransferase concentrations after a year's follow-up were given a second course of interferon. Follow-up at 3 years has revealed that all but 1 of those treated showed normal serum aminotransferase, whereas only 3 controls showed such change (p < 0. 02). Serum hepatitis C virus RNA became undetectable in 10 of 11 treated and in only 1 of 12 control patients, which suggests that interferon prevents the progression of acute <b>non-A,</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> to chronicity by eradicating HCV...|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{patients}} who had not previously received treatment with factor VIII concentrate or who had been treated only infrequently with factor VIII concentrate were studied after a transfusion of factor VIII. Tests of liver function were performed frequently. Four patients had evidence of chronic liver disease before transfusion. In 17 of the remaining 26 patients serum transaminase activities became raised and 10 patients developed jaundice. All of the nine {{patients who}} had not previously received factor VIII transfusion developed <b>non-A</b> non-B <b>hepatitis.</b> Four out of 10 patients followed up for a year had persisting abnormalities of liver function. The pattern of illness suggests {{that more than one}} serotype of <b>non-A</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> virus may be transmitted by factor VIII concentrate prepared by the National Health Service from volunteer donors in the United Kingdom...|$|R
50|$|HCV {{infection}} is frequently found {{in children who}} have previously been presumed to have <b>non-A,</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> and cryptogenic liver disease. The presentation in childhood may be asymptomatic or with elevated liver function tests. While {{infection is}} commonly asymptomatic both cirrhosis with liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma may occur in childhood.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} low dose interferon alfa (human lymphoblastoid interferon) on aminotransferase activities in chronic <b>non-A</b> non-B <b>hepatitis.</b> DESIGN [...] Prospective randomised controlled parallel group study of active treatment versus no treatment carried out over 16 weeks and preceded by baseline measurements at weeks 8 and 4 and time zero. SETTING [...] HEPATOLOGY outpatient clinics in secondary referral centres. PATIENTS [...] Fourteen adults with histologically proved chronic hepatitis and persistently raised aminotransferase activities for six months or more. INTERVENTIONS [...] Seven patients randomised to receive interferon alfa 5 megaunits (MU) daily for one week, reducing to 5 MU thrice weekly for seven weeks, then 3 MU thrice weekly for eight weeks. Controls not treated. END POINT [...] Control of hepatic enzyme activity in chronic <b>non-A</b> non-B <b>hepatitis.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Serum aspartate aminotransferase activity remained raised in controls (mean increase in study period 23. 4 U/l) but fell rapidly to normal in the treated group (mean decrease 106. 4 U/l). In four cases values were normal by eight weeks and in five cases by 16 weeks. Only minor side effects were recorded (fever, myalgia), which became less common as treatment progressed. CONCLUSIONS [...] Continuous low dose interferon alfa reduces aspartate aminotransferase activity to normal in most patients with chronic <b>non-A</b> non-B <b>hepatitis</b> and may prevent progression to cirrhosis...|$|R
