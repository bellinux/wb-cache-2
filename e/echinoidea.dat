2500|$|Sea urchins or urchins (...) , archaically called sea hedgehogs, [...] are small, spiny, {{globular}} animals that, {{with their}} close kin, such as sand dollars, constitute the class <b>Echinoidea</b> of the echinoderm phylum. About 950 species of echinoids inhabit all oceans from the intertidal to [...] deep. The shell, or [...] "test", of sea urchins is round and spiny, typically from [...] across. Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, blue, and red. Sea urchins move slowly, feeding primarily on algae. Sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, triggerfish, and other predators hunt and feed on sea urchins. The name [...] "urchin" [...] {{is an old}} word for hedgehog, which sea urchins resemble.|$|E
2500|$|Tissue {{regeneration}} {{is widespread}} among echinoderms {{and has been}} well documented in starfish (Asteroidea), sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea), and sea urchins (<b>Echinoidea).</b> Appendage regeneration in echinoderms has been studied since at least the 19th century. [...] In addition to appendages, some species can regenerate internal organs and parts of their central nervous system. In response to injury starfish can autotomize damaged appendages. Autotomy is the self-amputation of a body part, usually an appendage. Depending on severity, starfish will then go through a four-week process where the appendage will be regenerated. Some species must retain mouth cells in order to regenerate an appendage, due to the need for energy. [...] The first organs to regenerate, in all species documented to date, are associated with the digestive tract. Thus, most of our knowledge about visceral regeneration in holothurians concerns this system.|$|E
