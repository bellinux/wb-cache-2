40|$|The {{demand for}} {{smaller and more}} uniform {{features}} on photomasks has inspired consideration of a DUV (257 nm) resist process for optical pattern generation. Chemically amplified resists require storage and exposure in carbon filtered environments, and they require post-exposure bakes. Few mask facilities are set up to handle chemically amplified resists commonly used in <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> <b>wafer</b> fabrication process. Hence, {{it is appropriate to}} explore the lithographic performance of non-chemically amplified resist materials for 257 nm laser photomask lithography. Resist characterization and lithography simulation were used to formulate a 257 nm resist from DNQ / novolak materials provided by a commercial resist supplier. Diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) / novolak resists have not been used for DUV Integrated Circuit (IC) applications mainly due to the low sensitivity and the strong absorbance of the DNQ photoactive compound (PAC) at 248 nm. However, a 2, 1, 4 DNQ based resist has been characterized that bleaches at 257 nm and inhibits novolak. The photoproduct of the 2, 1, 4 DNQ PAC is much more transparent at 257 nm than 248 nm. Novolak resin also has an absorbance minimum in the DUV at 257 nm that provides transparency similar to poly (hydroxystyrene). Traditional photoresist formulation requires tedious, iterative, and expensive manufacturing trials. Resist characterization and lithography simulation can be used to relate lithographic performance (resolution, sidewall an...|$|R

40|$|Vibrations within high-precision {{machines}} are often badly damped, and may easily {{show up as}} {{a major factor in}} limiting the achievable accuracy. As it is hard to damp these vibrations by passive means, active vibration control may become inevitable within such machines. Robust active damping can be obtained by applying integral force feedback to so-called ‘Smart Discs’, i. e., active structural elements consisting of a piezoelectric position actuator and a collocated piezoelectric force sensor, which are inserted at appropriate locations within a machine frame.

The laser beam used for LSA is focused on a wafer through the projection lens. The alignment marks on the wafer are {{in the shape of}} diffraction gratings. The mark detection is performed by moving the wafer stage so that the alignment mark travels across the laser beam.

The position of the alignment mark is accurately measured by the laser interferomter attached to the wafer stage. The LSA system achieves overlay accuracy (2 aa) less than 0. 15 um for processed wafers.

A variety of practical photon-counting detectors have been developed employing materials and technologies that cover the waveband from <b>deep</b> ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> to the near-infrared. However, until recently, photoemissive detectors (photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and their variants) were the only viable technology for photon-counting in the <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> region of the spectrum. While PMTs exhibit extremely low dark count rates and large active area, they have other characteristics which make them unsuitable for certain applications.

30|$|High-brightness deep {{ultraviolet}} light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) have {{attracted much attention}} in areas of air/water sterilization and decontamination, bioagent detection and natural light, identification, UV curing, and biomedical and analytical instrumentation [1]. To date, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) for commercialization of <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> LEDs is 3 % at the wavelength of 280 nm [2, 3]. Various reasons can account for the poor EQE, mainly such as relatively low-resistance ohmic contacts, low hole concentration in p-type AlGaN layer, {{and the absence of}} transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) electrode in the <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> wavelength region [4, 5]. In particular, it is believed that the development of high-performance TCOs electrode in the <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> region is a key to increase the EQE of UV LEDs. Conventionally, indium tin oxide (ITO), which exhibits high conductance and good transparency in a visible region, has been widely used as the TCOs electrodes in LEDs and solar cells [6, 7]. However, it has an opaque property in the <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> (< 300 nm) region due to a small bandgap (approximately 3.2 eV), and hence, new TCO materials need to be explored for <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> LEDs. The wide bandgap materials such as SiO 2, Si 3 N 4, HfO 2 are attractive as TCOs for <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> LEDs because of their high transmittance in <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> regions, {{but it is difficult to}} provide electrical conductivity into these materials. In the meantime, the gallium oxide with β phase (β-Ga 2 O 3) having a large optical bandgap of 4.9 eV has been reported as a deep-UV TCO material [8] because its conductivity can be improved by thermal annealing, impurity doping, or incorporating some conducting paths using SWNTs. The Ga 2 O 3 film has also excellent adhesion to GaN surfaces [9]. For example, since undoped Ga 2 O 3 film has insulating properties (i.e., conductivity (σ) < 10 - 9 Ω- 1 [*]·[*]Cm- 1), it was doped with tin (Sn) atoms to increase the conductivity at the expense of optical transmittance. For 3 mol% Sn-doped Ga 2 O 3 films, the conductivity was increased up to 375 Ω- 1 [*]·[*]Cm- 1 (42 Ω/square) but the transmittance decreased to approximately 15 % in the <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> region (280 nm) [10]. In order to improve the low optical properties, several groups have reported synthesized TCO layer by wet-based nanoparticles (NPs), such as ITO, indium zinc oxide (IZO), antimony zinc oxide (AZO), antimony tin oxide (ATO), etc. [11 – 14]. This small particle size (i.e., NPs size), typically < 30 nm, guarantees a low light scattering and thus allows a high optical quality of the materials [15]. Unfortunately, even with some improvement of optical properties, these synthesized TCO NP layers still do not satisfy the requirement for <b>deep</b> <b>UV</b> applications due to the added dopants such as Sn, Sb, In, Ga, etc. [16].|$|R
