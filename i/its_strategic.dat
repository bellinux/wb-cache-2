5|$|A small hill {{known as}} Bukit Puteri {{can be found}} nearby to Pasar Payang. The hill is about 200 metres high, located near the banks of Terengganu River.

During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a century-old brass bell known as genta will be rung to signify that it is time for iftar, or the end of the fasting on that day.|$|E
5|$|After the Jesuits {{established}} the Christian community in Baclayon, {{they moved to}} Loboc and established a second Christian settlement in Bohol. The parish was established in 1602, and the present coral stone church was completed in 1734.

In 1768, upon the expulsion of the Jesuits, the town was transferred to the Augustinian Recollects.|$|E

5|$|Shiloh was the costliest {{battle in}} American history {{to that point}} and the {{staggering}} 23,746 total casualties stunned the nation. Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon mired in controversy. The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and accused him of drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others {{with him at the}} time. However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> advantage in the West.|$|E
5|$|The Kings County Association of Governments {{has plans}} to improve the state {{highways}} within the county. Developers are interested in building distribution warehouses in Kings County because of <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> location midway between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, but they are currently {{turned off by the}} lack of freeway access. For SR 198, the plan is to extend the freeway segment from Naval Air Station Lemoore to I-5. However, Kings County voters have shown little interest in passing any transportation taxes to fund these projects.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet period saw a rapid {{increase}} of the population, although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization, including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> position and {{the discovery of the}} vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage, including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting.|$|E

The Sultan used Lamu Fort as a base for defeating the Mazrui rebels in Mombasa, and for establishing control over the East African coast. He moved the capital of his sultanate to Zanzibar.

These walls are 1.5 to 5 meters (5–16feet) thick, depending on their location and <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> importance. The purpose of these walls were to help defend the city from sea-based attacks, particularly from the Republic of Venice, which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik's safety.|$|E

5|$|The ruined and {{recently}} renovated Devín Castle {{is in the}} borough of Devín, {{on top of a}} rock where the Morava River, which forms the border between Austria and Slovakia, enters the Danube. It {{is one of the most}} important Slovak archaeological sites and contains a museum dedicated to its history. Due to <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> location, Devín Castle was a very important frontier castle of Great Moravia and the early Hungarian state. It was destroyed by Napoleon's troops in 1809. It is an important symbol of Slovak and Slavic history.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> importance, {{the castle}} and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly {{neglected}} during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at anchor in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple of days, before they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E
5|$|Gulf {{also participated}} in a {{partnership}} with other majors, including Texaco, to build the Pembroke Catalytic Cracker refinery at Milford Haven and the associated Mainline Pipelines fuel distribution network. The eventual reopening of the Suez canal and upgrading of the older European oil terminals (Europoort and Marchwood) meant that the financial return from these projects was not all that had been hoped for. The Bantry terminal was devastated by the explosion of a Total tanker, the Betelgeuse, in January 1979 (Whiddy Island Disaster) and it was never fully reopened. The Irish government took over ownership of the terminal in 1986 and held <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> oil reserve there.|$|E

5|$|In {{consolidating}} his power, Muhammad Ali, {{the rebel}} governor of Ottoman Egypt, was modeling his {{rule on the}} bureaucratic organization characteristic of modern European states. Like earlier rulers of Egypt, Muhammad Ali desired to exercise control over greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), both for <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> value and for its natural resources. In addition to its abundant natural resources, Syria also had a prospering international trading community with well-developed markets. In addition, in Ali's strategy, Syria {{would serve as a}} captive market for goods being produced in Egypt. Moreover, the extension of Egyptian control over Syria was sought because it would serve as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople. Ali was attempting to become independent of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Japan was a {{signatory}} of the Treaty of Versailles, which stipulated harsh repercussions for Germany. In the Pacific, Japan gained Germany's islands {{north of}} the equator (the Marshall Islands, the Carolines, the Marianas, the Palau Islands) and Kiautschou/Tsingtao in China. Article 156 of the Treaty also transferred German concessions in Shandong to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to China, an issue soon {{to be known as}} Shandong Problem. Chinese outrage over this provision led to demonstrations, and a cultural movement known as the May Fourth Movement influenced China not to sign the treaty. China declared the end of its war against Germany in September 1919 and signed a separate treaty with Germany in 1921. This fact greatly contributed to Germany relying on China, and not Japan, as <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> partner in East Asia for the coming years.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1948, in {{the first}} stage of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Lajjun was {{captured}} by Israel's Golani Brigade in Operation Gideon. The capture was particularly important for the Israelis because of <b>its</b> <b>strategic</b> location at the entrance of the Wadi Ara, which thus, brought their forces closer to Jenin. During the second truce between Israel and the Arab coalition, in early September, a United Nations official fixed the permanent truce line in the area of Lajjun, according to press reports. A 500-yard strip was established {{on both sides of the}} line in which Arabs and Jews were allowed to harvest their crops. Lajjun was used as transit place by the Israel Defense Forces to transfer 1,400 Arab women, children and elderly from Ijzim, who then were sent on foot to Jenin.|$|E
