40|$|Habitat {{degradation}} affects mixed-species bird <b>flocks</b> (<b>flock</b> hereafter) {{through two}} mechanisms – {{changes in the}} bird community from which <b>flocks</b> are drawn {{and changes in the}} propensities of species to <b>flock.</b> We determined the relative influence of these two mechanisms by examining variation in <b>flocks</b> across nine rain-forest fragments (range 11 – 2600 ha) in a plantation landscape in the Western Ghats, India. We found differences between fragments in average number of species (range 10. 8 – 15. 2) and individuals (range 19. 0 – 37. 6) per <b>flock,</b> number of species that participated in <b>flocks</b> (range 34 – 59), encounter rates (range 0. 5 – 2. 4 <b>flocks</b> $h^{- 1 }$) and <b>flock</b> composition. Multiple regression and randomization tests revealed that different mechanisms contributed to this variation. Three <b>flock</b> variables (open-forest individuals per <b>flock,</b> total open-forest species that participated in <b>flocks</b> in a fragment, <b>flock</b> composition) mainly reflected changes in the bird communities of fragments. Habitat structure strongly influenced three <b>flock</b> variables (open-forest species per <b>flock,</b> total and rain-forest individuals per <b>flock)</b> and <b>flock</b> composition to a lesser extent.

The objective in this study was to assess levels of connectedness in the genetic evaluation of weaning weight among Targhee and Suffolk <b>flocks</b> participating in the US National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP). Among <b>flocks</b> currently participating in the NSIP, a total of 25, 404 weaning weight and 35, 794 pedigree records were available for 16 Targhee <b>flocks,</b> and 14, 017 weaning weight and 18, 311 pedigree records were available for 24 Suffolk <b>flocks.</b> Connectedness was measured by using 2 different methods. First, numbers of progeny with recorded weaning weights from linking sires (defined as sires with progeny in multiple <b>flocks</b> or sires born in one <b>flock</b> with progeny in another <b>flock)</b> were counted. Second, connectedness was measured by calculating the average prediction error correlation of mean <b>flock</b> EBV (<b>flock</b> rij). Benchmarks for <b>flock</b> rij were established, with 0. 10 and 0. 05 representing low and moderate risk of bias associated with comparing EBV among <b>flocks,</b> respectively. From 1995 through 2004, 44 % of Targhee lambs with weaning weights were born to linking sires; in Suffolk lambs, that value was 23 %. In 1990, 1995, and 2005, average <b>flock</b> rij were 0. 10, 0. 19, and 0. 28, respectively, among Targhee <b>flocks,</b> and 0. 02, 0. 02, and 0. 04, respectively, among Suffolk <b>flocks</b> that participated in NSIP in all 3 yr. Among all active <b>flocks</b> in 2005, <b>flock</b> rij averaged 0. 13 in Targhees and 0. 03 in Suffolks. Hierarchical clustering of <b>flocks</b> based on <b>flock</b> rij revealed that all active Targhee <b>flocks</b> connected at a level near or above 0. 10. In Suffolk <b>flocks,</b> 2 distinct clusters had formed, in which connectedness was relatively high within each cluster (<b>flock</b> rij near 0. 10) but was near zero between clusters.

In the <b>flock</b> with manifested respiratory disorders which was marked as <b>flock</b> number one (<b>flock</b> 1), high seroprevalence of specific antibodies for O. rhinotracheale (46 %) was found in 30 -day-old broiler chickens. The symptoms presented were: depression, reduction in feed consumption and water intake, sneezing, mucosal nasal discharge and facial edema. Production results were below technological standards due to increased mortality, decreased growth range and increased number of stunted chickens. Autopsy found frequent changes in the trachea, air sacs and lungs, which were manifested as: tracheitis catarrhalis, aerosacculitis fibrinosa and pneumonia fibrinosa. In control <b>flocks</b> marked as <b>flock</b> number two (<b>flock</b> 2) and <b>flock</b> number three (<b>flock</b> 3) where 4 % and 8 % of seropositive chickens were found, there were no clinical signs which would indicate illness, and production results were much closer to technological standards as compared with <b>flock</b> 1.
