5|$|In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won {{numerous}} victories {{early on}} and declared independence. However, the declaration contradicted {{the principles of the}} Congress of Vienna and of the Holy Alliance, which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> stop the liberal Greek insurgents.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humanity}} and the Overlords have peaceful relations, some believe human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant. One {{of these groups}} establishes New Athens, an island colony {{in the middle of}} the Pacific Ocean devoted to the creative arts, which George and Jean Greggson join. The Overlords conceal a special interest in the Greggsons' children, Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne, and <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> save Jeffrey's life when a tsunami strikes the island. The Overlords have been watching them since the incident with the Ouija board, which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the Buddhist Uprising {{erupted in}} central Vietnam, {{in which some}} Buddhist leaders fomented civil unrest against the war, hoping to end foreign {{involvement}} in Vietnam and end the conflict through a peace deal with the communists. The VNQDD remained implacably opposed to any coexistence with the communists. Members of the VNQDD made alliances with Catholics, collected arms, and engaged in pro-war street clashes with the Buddhists, forcing elements of the ARVN to <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> stop them.|$|E

5|$|Iraqi–British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short cooling-down period {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to detain Patriarch Shimun in order to defuse tensions. The British were also wary of Iraqi military leaders and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> dissuade Faysal from personally leading a tribal force to punish the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September, {{the family}} of Laurence McKeown became the fourth family to {{intervene}} and asked for medical treatment to save his life, and Cahal Daly issued a statement calling on republican prisoners to end the hunger strike. A week later, James Prior replaced Humphrey Atkins as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and met with prisoners {{in an attempt to}} end the strike. Liam McCloskey ended his strike on 26 September after his family said they would ask for medical intervention if he became unconscious, and {{it became clear that the}} families of the remaining hunger strikers would also <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> save their lives.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} two themes: morality and the UN effectiveness. Off characterized Dallaire and Arbour as morally correct and MacKenzie morally wrong. In Rwanda, Dallaire lobbied the UN to <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> stop the genocide. In Yugoslavia, MacKenzie {{is accused of}} being an apologist for the Serbs. In an interview Off admitted that she would prefer MacKenzie to be her son's commander but would want Dallaire if her people were being attacked because one puts his soldiers before the mission and the other the mission before the soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The Athenians seem to {{have offered}} Philip Pydna in {{exchange}} for Amphipolis, perhaps during the later stages of the siege, {{but it is not}} clear whether Philip agreed to this. By this stage, the Social War of 357–355 BC had broken out between Athens and their erstwhile allies, and they would now have been unable to <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> help Amphipolis. Philip eventually succeeded in breaching the walls of Amphipolis, through the use of siege engines and battering rams; his forces then stormed and captured the city. Philip expelled those who were hostile to him but, according to Diodorus, treated the rest of the population considerately.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} reigns of King Richard I {{and his brother}} John, the castle and manor were held by the Crown. King John, however, lost many of his lands in France which in turn deprived key English nobles of their own estatesJohn became concerned about possible opposition to his rule. Accordingly, in 1203 John transferred Goodrich Castle and the surrounding manor to William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, to partially compensate him for his lost lands on the continent. Marshal was a famous English knight with reputation as a heroic warrior, and he expanded Goodrich by building an additional towered curtain wall in stone, around the existing keep. Marshal had to <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> protect Goodrich Castle from Welsh attack, most famously in 1216 when he was obliged to leave Henry III's coronation feast in Gloucester to hurry back to Goodrich to reinforce the castle.|$|E

5|$|Fruit, {{fish and}} wild pigs provide {{plentiful}} food, {{and at first}} the boys' life on the island is idyllic. They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe. Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large outrigger canoes in the distance, one pursued by the other. The two groups of Polynesians disembark {{on the beach and}} engage in battle; the victors take fifteen prisoners, and kill and eat one immediately. But when they threaten to kill one of the three women captured, along with two children, the boys <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> defeat the pursuers, earning them the gratitude of the chief, Tararo. The next morning they prevent another act of cannibalism. The natives leave, and the boys are alone once more.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, few Brazilians opposed {{slavery and}} even fewer openly {{condemned}} it. PedroII, who did not own slaves, {{was one of the}} few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. PedroII wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy. With no constitutional authority to directly <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.|$|E
5|$|Unhappy {{with this}} change of policy by the Portuguese government, Napoleon {{negotiated}} a secret treaty with Charles IV of Spain and sent an army to invade Portugal. On 17 October 1807, 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish cooperation and headed towards Portugal to enforce Napoleon's orders. This attack {{was the first}} step in what would eventually become the Peninsular War, a six-year struggle that significantly sapped French strength. Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the Spanish royal family. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> mediate between the rival political factions in the country. Marshal Murat led 120,000 troops into Spain and the French arrived in Madrid on 24 March, where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later. Napoleon appointed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout the country. The shocking French defeat at the Battle of Bailén in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.|$|E

On 17 October 1807, 24,000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish {{cooperation}} and headed towards Portugal to enforce Napoleon's Continental System. This {{was the first step}} in what would become the six-year-long Peninsular War, a struggle that sapped much of the French Empire's strength. Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the Spanish royal family. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialised when Napoleon announced that he would <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> mediate between the rival political factions in the Spanish royal family.

The shocking French defeat at the Battle of Bailén in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person. A new French army commanded by Napoleon crossed the Ebro in autumn and dealt blow after blow to the opposing Spanish forces. Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops. He then unleashed his troops against Moore's British forces. The British were swiftly driven to the coast, and, after a last stand at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809, withdrew from Spain entirely.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{newly elected}} {{government}} in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, {{and that its}} fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP {{as opposed to the}} 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the eurozone's maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's Stability and Growth Pact. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery {{in the wake of the}} Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion bailout for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German Federal Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Lexie {{continues}} to harbor romantic feelings for George, {{oblivious to the}} fact that he doesn't see her in the same way. Their relationship is a mirror foil of George's previous infatuation with the oblivious Meredith. She prioritizes helping George study over taking part in a surgery with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), but feels betrayed when George doesn't request that she become one of his interns after passing his exam. Finally realizing that he doesn't feel the same way, Lexie gives up on her feelings for George and the pair's friendship begins to fizzle out. She later begins a flirtation with Mark, and the pair begin an unlikely romantic relationship, though they are forced to keep it a secret when Meredith and Derek warn Mark away from Lexie. Lexie discovers that some of her fellow interns have secretly been performing simple procedures on each other and begins taking part to prove she's hardcore. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) joins the society, and seeking a more daring procedure, suggests removing her appendix. Though Lexie agrees, she quickly finds herself out of her depth, resulting in Meredith and Cristina having to <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> save Sadie's life. Lexie and the other interns are put on probation. Derek finds Lexie distraught at the day's events, and allows her to move into the attic at his and Meredith's house. Mark comes clean to Derek about his relationship with Lexie, resulting in the two men getting into a fist fight. The pair continue to feud, resulting in Lexie beginning to stress eat until they eventually reconcile. Lexie is delighted when Meredith asks her to be a bridesmaid at her and Derek's wedding, though they eventually give the ceremony to Alex and cancer-stricken Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). Mark decides to purchase a house and invites Lexie to move in with him, however she declines, concerned about how fast their relationship is progressing.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly <b>intervene</b> <b>to</b> resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E
