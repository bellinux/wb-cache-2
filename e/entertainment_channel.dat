It was initially released to 1500 screens worldwide. The film was released in overseas markets by Eros International {{as part of a}} four-film deal between Eros and Viacom 18 studios. The rights to television broadcasting belonged to Viacom18's flagship general <b>entertainment</b> <b>channel</b> Colors. The film was not released in Kom's home state of Manipur because of the ban on Bollywood films by the Imphal-based separatist militant group, Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF) since 2000. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Kom expressed her sadness that people from her own state {{would not be able to}} see her biopic. However, unauthorised DVDs and VCDs flooded the state, with the DVD format in great demand as the only option for native people to watch the film.|$|E
