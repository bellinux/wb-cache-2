25|$|Matisse {{was visiting}} Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 {{but managed to}} make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and {{remained}} in Nice, in Vichy France. “It seemed to me as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?” Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E
2500|$|As well as kazoos, {{the song}} {{features}} a saxophone and organ, and an orchestra arranged by Gorgoni. [...] She also recorded {{a version of}} [...] "Dumb Head" [...] in Japanese. [...] Arnell said:The record was a hit over in Asia and they asked me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> nice enough to record the song in Japanese for them. [...] I thought [...] "What?!" [...] But MGM was very good about sending a tutor [...] {{taught me how to}} sing it phonetically. [...] It was very exciting and it came out OK. [...] I don't know if it's word-for-word as the American version, but it sure is nice to listen to...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{knew that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> yielded <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> carried away into some moment of terrible agony, so I {{struggled}} to remain quiet, holding my knees together with my hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{think of}} a hiccup!--fricasseed shadow!! Now, damme!--hiccup!--humph! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> such a--hiccup!--nincompoop! My soul, Mr.--humph!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> told--it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{for other}} reasons. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> were to betray your hiding-place it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> because society demands the {{punishment}} of criminals." ...|$|R
2500|$|Charles Grean of Dot Records had {{arranged}} with {{the studio to}} do an album of space music based on music from Star Trek, {{and he has a}} teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from Star Trek, then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted me and asked me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both. ...That was the first album we did, which was called Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space. It was very well received and successful enough that Dot then approached me and asked me to sign a long-term contract.|$|E
2500|$|During the inquest into Kopechne's death, Kennedy {{testified that}} he left the party at [...] "approximately 11:15 p.m." [...] When he {{announced}} {{that he was about to}} leave, Kopechne told him [...] "that she was desirous of leaving, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> kind enough to drop her back at her hotel." [...] Kennedy then requested the keys to his mother's car from his chauffeur, Crimmins. Asked why he did not have his chauffeur drive them both, Kennedy explained that Crimmins and some other guests [...] "were concluding their meal, enjoying the fellowship and it didn't appear to me necessary to require him to bring me back to Edgartown." [...] Kopechne told no one that she was leaving with Kennedy, and left her purse and hotel key at the party.|$|E
2500|$|Former city clerk, Rebecca Valez, {{testified at}} the hearing that she was {{instructed}} by Rizzo to lie to resident, Roger Ramirez, who had enquired about council members salaries. The first witness at the preliminary hearing, Ramirez testified that when he confronted Rizzo at a city council meeting, regarding [...] the rumors [...] that he was paid $400,000 a year, [...] "He immediately said, 'No, Mr. Ramirez, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> making $400,000 a year I wouldn't be working here". Ramirez had previously filed a public records request with City Hall. The bogus records he was given showed Rizzo was earning about $15,000 per month, and City Council members a couple hundred dollars per month. Valez, who has partial immunity, stated she prepared the documents and Rizzo changed the correct figures {{much lower than the}} actual salaries; she was ordered to show the falsified lowered figures to Ramirez. She also testified that Rizzo awarded himself contracts with hefty raises without any approval from the city attorney.|$|E

60|$|I {{spoke to}} Secretary McCulloch about giving Mrs. Porter a clerkship in the Treasury and he promised {{me he would}} do it, but has not yet. Now, <b>I</b> fancy, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have much influence, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very careful about using it.|$|R
6000|$|MARY. Nothing! O nothing! I am in trouble, and I {{know not}} what I say. And I cannot help you; I cannot help you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> He <b>is</b> not here; and I believe he was; and ill ... ill; {{and he is}} not--he is ... O, I think I shall lose my mind! ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{produced}} the Black Crowes, and Jimmy joined {{them for a}} run of live dates in 1999. I saw the show in New York, and then I went to California and recorded the shows, took the tapes away, and fixed them up a little and mixed them. I did Live at the Greek without any input from anyone, as it wasn't originally {{going to be an}} official release. But I think everyone was impressed with it; certainly Jimmy said he was. Then, when Jimmy decided to do a new [...] DVD, he started looking for someone familiar with the modern applications necessary for surround sound mixing. If you listen to the Royal Albert Hall [...] opening in 5.1, you can see Jimmy had this audio concept really early on of giving people a sense of the band going onstage and the audience swells around you. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements needed for the DVD project audio, and afterward, he asked <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interested in ‘helping’ him.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} I must simplify my {{language}} and spread my words apart, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> understood by this English scholar.|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't {{the captain}} allow you {{anything}} for your services?" [...] I asked, {{at the same}} time wondering <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> paid for what I was called upon to do.|$|E
60|$|I {{worked as}} lively as I ever did in my life, and it surely seemed as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> {{allowed to go}} on board the Avenger until the entire cargo had been eaten, {{therefore}} I called for Jerry to help me, after our small lot had been dumped on the ship's hold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quarrel with you! I {{could not}} quarrel with you, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> No;--there shall <b>be</b> no quarrel. But I do not suppose {{we shall see}} each other very often." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{knew that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> yielded <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> carried away into some moment of terrible agony, so I {{struggled}} to remain quiet, holding my knees together with my hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you indeed? As <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> troubled with you! Away to mamma and Mistress Snowe, {{and tell}} them to put you to bed." [...] The auburn head and bright flushed face vanished,--the door shut peremptorily. She was stunned.|$|E
60|$|As {{the evening}} wore on I {{wondered}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to sleep. There {{was no use}} worrying about matters, as it would do no good, so I was inclined to treat the affair philosophically and {{make the best of}} it.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the tone}} to take <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> respected. Had I {{proposed}} {{that we should}} journey in company I should not have earned me the half of the deference which was accorded to my haughtily granted leave that they might follow me if they so chose.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{partly for}} the sake of giving change to Bertha, and letting her see what nice people really are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That’s queer, too, lad, if {{they came}} here. Fust thing I’d think about, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrecked, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{to put up a}} signal o’ distress.” ...|$|R
60|$|MERCY. Then said young Mercy (for she was but young), <b>If</b> <b>I</b> {{thought it}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to purpose {{to go with}} you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never go near the town any more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Death," [...] replied Everard, [...] "I should indeed deserve, but {{not from}} you, perhaps; but fortunately, I cannot, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> <b>be</b> guilty of the treachery you would punish. Know that I had this day secret notice, and from Cromwell himself, that the young Man has escaped by sea from Bristol." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{queen of}} a mere nest of robbers and freebooters,' she said. 'You forget, Messires, {{that my sister}} is daughter-in-law to the King of France. We must long ago have been missed, and I expect every hour that my brother, the Dauphin, will be here with his troops.' ...|$|E
60|$|Not seemly, was it, that I {{should expect}} these kind people, {{even though they}} were of my own country, to do more for me than they had already done. So, when I had eaten and drunk, I made my obeisance as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> trudging towards Chinon, adding many thanks, as well I might.|$|E
40|$|Polis Intern and LSE MSc student Donna Susan Mathew {{reports on}} the latest Polis Media Agenda Talk {{featuring}} Gabrielle Smith and Vinay Patel. So this one time, an Irish, a Kenyan, an Ecuadorian, a Chinese and a Japanese person sat down to watch a Bollywood movie. <b>I</b> doubt <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> able to witness a moment like this anywhere other than in London...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Because <b>if</b> she <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> {{very glad}} to marry her. D'ye know if she's got any other young man hanging about her at all?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{the future}} there are guys like GSPand Matt Hughes, who I'm sure {{are going to}} be hall-of-famers — Serra said before the event. - <b>If</b> <b>I</b> get Matt Hughes under my belt and take care of him, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> {{considered}} one of the best ever, I'd have some victories over some guys who will be. I can live with that." [...] -Matt Serra.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I do. But {{that you}} should have seen it,--{{that you should}} have come to {{understand}} that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> your wife I would sing every note out of my body,--to do you good if it were possible. How have you been enlightened so far as to see {{that this is the way}} in which you may best make yourself happy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wept {{the first}} six months almost without ceasing, and then I told myself that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> strong and resist I must weep no more. If a bird in a cage once takes to pining he is sure not to live long. There are few of us here the news of whose death would not give {{pleasure}} to those who shut us up, and I for one resolved that I would live in spite of all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man lied to me," [...] he declared. [...] "Now I {{will tell}} you just what has {{happened}} to me. You know that I have a room in the Theba Place. Well, to-night, as I was about to prepare for dinner, a messenger, a native Thetian he seemed to me, brought a note to my rooms. It was neither signed nor addressed. But it bade me follow the bearer without question <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> of service to Theos." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{was just}} thinking. Mamma thinks that I {{might go to}} college. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> went it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> nice if we went to two places that were near each other." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1945 she said:"You see Im {{a mighty}} proud gal and I cant {{for the life}} of me, find any valid reason why anyone should lie about their origin or {{anything}} else for that matter.

5000|$|... "In June 1993, {{they removed}} all my powers," [...] he told The Middle East in an interview. [...] "I was {{isolated}} {{in a cell}} for three months and interrogated for 52 days before being tried in February 1995. The trial lasted only one day.I was warned that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> continued to defend my ideas, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> executed. <b>If</b> not, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> pardoned. A lawyer? Out of the question. The trial was conducted under {{the law of the}} mountain." ...|$|R
