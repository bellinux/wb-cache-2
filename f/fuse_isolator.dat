All {{distribution board}}s (fuse boxes) are required to have a 'main fuse' or 'main breaker' rated at the maximum permissible load for that installation.

40|$|An {{experimental}} survey concerning physical {{interpretations of}} the dominant phenomena which may develop during the operation of no-load switching contacts in laboratory environments is presented. Measurements are performed on industrial switches with the following nominal values: isolation switches 400 V/ 100 A, isolation switches 20 kV/ 200 A, and <b>fuse</b> <b>isolators</b> 20 kV/ 100 A. It is shown that beyond a threshold field intensity (corresponding to smaller currents than the nominal values) a nonlinear current-voltage relationship may develop, leading to bistability and negative differential conductance phenomena.

40|$|No-load {{switching}} contacts may {{be operated}} when the associated electric circuit is power disconnected. Their practical characterization is mainly {{based on the}} resistance value between the contacting joints. Contact resistance evaluations are usually based on various parameters, such as geometry, pressure, effective contact area, heat dissipation, and foreign matter on contacting surfaces, i. e., dust particles, atmospheric contamination, and thin oxide layers. In this paper, data are presented which may aid physical interpretations concerning no-load switching contacts under high current density operation. Measurements were performed on industrial switches having the following nominal values: isolation switches 400 V/ 100 A, isolation switches 20 kV/ 200 A, and <b>fuse</b> <b>isolators</b> 20 kV/ 100 A. It is convincingly shown that beyond a threshold field intensity (corresponding to smaller currents than the nominal values) nonlinear I-V relationship may develop, leading to bistability and negative differential conductance phenomena. This {{has been attributed to}} the dominating tunnelling current component between oxidized (or nonideally contacted) metallic surfaces at high electric fields, resulting in an increased effective area of contact. The well established metal-insulator-metal (MIM) theory, as well as that concerning nonlinear current voltage phenomena developing in insulating solids at high electric fields, provide the required theoretical basis for the interpretation of the obtained curves...|$|R
40|$|Tn this work, an {{experimental}} investigation is attempted, concerning electrical contacts evaluation through analog to digital measurements and physical {{interpretations of the}} dominant phenomena are presented. The circuit employed is in agreement with IEC 0660 specifications concerning switch overheat tests. The commercial switches used for the measurements, had the following nominal characteristics: isolators 20 kV/ 200 A, <b>fuse</b> <b>isolators</b> 20 kV/ 65 A and isolators 500 V/ 100 A. The measurements were performed through AID converters with a sampling frequency of 4 MSPS, and waveforms of the voltage drop and current were obtained for the nominal current values of the specimens. Current-voltage plots (I-V plots) by time elimination corresponding to {{a part of the}} waveforms are also presented. Further analysis of the data obtained is performed and it can easily be concluded that the thickness of the interfacial layer determines the conduction mechanisms. In the case of contacts in advanced degradation the current conduction is mainly attributed to field emission or field ionization processes. The above dominant effects characterize high rates of electronic conduction via stationary metal contacts at a state where linear behavior has ceased and instabilities have developed. The data which resulted lead to an effective test for industrial switching contacts and could aid technoeconomical selections. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{parameter}} {{of interest}} influencing {{the performance of}} electrical contacts is the contact temperature during operation, dependent on the heat generation and dissipation rates around the system of sliding contact/conductors. A theoretical investigation is attempted and an experimental survey is displayed concerning the overheating of sliding contacts. The experimental results present satisfactory consistency {{with the results of}} the suggested mathematical relations. It is convincingly shown that the heat generated at the contacts is dissipated to the surrounding area basically by the conductors or bars, and that fact is determinant as far as the contact temperature is concerned. This could aid selections of conductors and industrial components (circuit breakers, <b>fuse</b> carriers, <b>isolators,</b> etc.) in LV or MV electrical panels, and installations where requirements of high reliability exist. © IEE, 1996...|$|R

Please notify councils when roads are safe (!)* Pye monitor - no frame lock - V10 replaced (low ins). Monitor overheating due to fan choked up with dust- cleaned out, motor lubricated and fan blades reset.* Evening :- Glendenning, Bottom, Redgrove* 1265 ft Mast :- Fell down across Jagger Lane (corner of Common Lane) at 17:01:45. Police, I.T.A. HQ, R.O., etc., all notified.* Mast Power <b>Isolator</b> :- <b>Fuses</b> removed & <b>isolator</b> locked in the [...] "OFF" [...] position. All isolators in basement feeding mast stump also switched off. Dehydrators & TXs switched off. The collapse left sections of twisted mast strewn over the transmitter site, and across the junction of Common Lane and Jagger Lane, and the surrounding fields. Although a falling stay cable cut through a local church and across the transmitter site buildings, no one was injured. It completely disabled the BBC2 UHF transmitter and the ITV VHF transmitter, leaving several million people without service. BBC1 VHF television transmissions continued from Holme Moss. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) owned a collapsible emergency mast, 61 m tall, which was moved to Emley from the Lichfield transmitting station so that some service could be restored. ITV signals were restored to 2.5 million viewers within four days. The BBC provided a mobile mast on an outside broadcast van to restore a restricted BBC2 colour service within two days. The ITA bought a larger temporary mast from a Swedish company. A crew of Polish riggers were hired, and a 204 m mast was erected in under 28 days {{at a cost of}} £100,000. This mast could hold only one set of antennas, so many viewers in outlying areas still could not receive colour programmes. The taller mast was brought into service on 16 April. Some weeks later, the BBC erected a 91 m mast, improving coverage.|$|R
