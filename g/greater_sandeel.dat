40|$|High {{stranding}} {{frequency of}} porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, along the Dutch coast since 2006 {{has led to}} increased interest in the ecology of porpoises in the North Sea. Stranded porpoises were collected along the Dutch coast (2006 – 2008) and their diet was assessed through stomach content and stable isotope analysis (d 13 C and d 15 N) of porpoise muscle and prey. Stable isotope analysis (SIAR) was used to estimate the con- tribution of prey species to the porpoises’ diet. This was compared to prey composi- tion from stomach contents, to analyze differences between long- and short-term diet. According to stomach contents, 90. 5 % of the diet consisted of gobies, whiting, lesser sandeel, herring, cod, and sprat. Stable isotope analysis revealed that 70 - 83 % of the diet consisted of poor cod, mackerel, <b>greater</b> <b>sandeel,</b> lesser sandeel, sprat, and gobies, highlighting a higher importance of pelagic, schooling species in the porpoises’ diet compared to stomach contents. This {{could be due to}} prey distribution as well as differ- ences in behavior of porpoises and prey between the coastal zone and offshore waters. This study supports the need for multi-method approaches. Future ecological and fishery impact assessment studies and management decisions for porpoise conservation should acknowledge this difference between the long- and short-term diet.

40|$|During the 20 th {{century the}} numbers of nesting Sandwich Terns Sterna sandvicensis in The Netherlands have fluctuated heavily. After the {{collapse}} in the 19605 the number of breeding pairs increased only slowly and stabilised at a low level. Earlier studies showed that population trends {{may be related to}} changes in food availability. Since the Sandwich Tern is a highly specialised piscivorous seabird, which feeds almost exclusively on tour species of fish (herring, sprat, sandeel and <b>greater</b> <b>sandeel),</b> the Sandwich Tern is probably highly vulnerable to changes in the availability of its prey species. To determine the key factors influencing population size the Institute for Forestry and Nature research (IBN-DLO), in co-operation with the Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research (RIVO-DLO) and the National Institute of Coastal and Marine Management (RIKZ), started a study on the population dynamics of the species in 1995. The study was conducted on Griend, the largest Sandwich Tern colony in western Europe. The target of this study was twofold, namely: (1) To assess to what extent emigration to other colonies takes place. (2) To come {{to a better understanding of}} the importance of food availability during the breeding season for chick and post-fledging survival, and ultimately for population dynamics. In 1992 - 1997, the provisioning of food to the chicks fluctuated stronglv from year to year. Parallel with these changes the condition of the breeding adults and parental effort changed. These parameters can be regarded as indicative for the food situation in the local foraging areas. Changes in adult condition, the amount of food supplied to the chicks (in particular herring) and parental effort coincided with a parallel change in the number of breeding pairs. In years in which these parameters indicated a scarcitv of food, the number of breeding pairs was accordingly low. In 1995, a sampling programme was started to investigate whether the assumed fluctuations in food availabilitv as measured in the colony on Griend, were reflected by changes in food abundance in the local foraging areas. Isaac's Kidd Middwater Trawl net catches indicated that food availabilitv decreased from 1995 - 1997. Although a parallel decrease was seen in the terns population size, the fish catches did not reflect other changes in the colony on Griend. The used sampling method was probably not suitable to detect changes in the amount of food availability for the terns. However, the fish sampling programme made clear that fish availabilitv was greatlv influenced by water clarity. In relatively clear water the fish was present at greater depths, thus beyond the reach of foraging terns. Sandeels were even IV distributed over the five sampling locations, but herring availabilitv increased towards the northern positions. At sampling points where herring availability was high, the number of foraging terns were accordinglv high. Along with the changes in the number of breeding pairs, the age composition of the population on Griend showed large fluctuations. In 1995, the proportion of older birds was relatively high, whereas in 1996 and in 1997 a large proportion of young birds nested on Griend. These changes were related to a high local survival rate of 3 - and 4 -year old birds in 1996 and 1997. A considerable part of both the population nesting on Griend and the Danish population consists of birds immigrated from other colonies. However, site fidelity of the terns on Griend was much higher than in Denmark. The majority of the emigrating terns settled in colonies less than 200 km away from their original colony...|$|E
40|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} and white-beaked dolphins are {{the most}} common small cetaceans in the North Sea and Dutch coastal waters. The distribution and relative abundance of harbour porpoises and white-beaked dolphins from the Dutch coastal waters has changed significantly over the past decades. This thesis describes the past and present feeding ecology of these two species in Dutch coastal waters and investigates whether changes in abundance and relative distribution of porpoises reflect changes in their foodbase. For porpoises, three techniques for dietary analyses were combined, including stomach contents-, stable isotope- and fatty acid analysis, providing the most detailed description of their diet in time and space, elucidating differences between their short- and longer term diet. Stable isotope analysis (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) were carried out in bone and muscle samples collected from porpoises stranded along the Dutch coast. Muscle δ 15 N values revealed that neonatal enrichment occurred and that larger porpoises, in particular males, seem to feed on lower trophic level species, compared to smaller individuals. Also bone δ 15 N values show that larger animals had fed on lower trophic levels in distant times. Seasonal variation in bone δ 15 N and δ 13 C values revealed two distinct groups of porpoises along the Dutch coast, a winter group (mainly males) that migrated from neighbouring regions and a Dutch subpopulation in summer (Chapter 2). To assess the contribution of prey species to the porpoises’ diet, stable isotope analysis in both porpoise muscle and prey were carried out. With the use of a mixing model (Stable Isotope Analysis in R, SIAR), we revealed that 70 - 83 % of the diet of porpoises consisted mainly of poor cod, mackerel, <b>greater</b> <b>sandeel</b> lesser sandeel, sprat and gobies. This highlights a higher importance of pelagic, schooling species in the porpoises’ diet compared to stomach contents, where 90. 5 % of the diet consisted of gobies, whiting, lesser sandeel, herring, cod and sprat. Porpoises thus also feed offshore on pelagic, schooling species, while they feed closer to shore on more benthic and demersal species shortly before they strand. This could be due to the distribution of prey species as well as differences in behaviour of porpoises and their prey between the coastal zone and offshore waters (Chapter 3). The use of Quantitative Fatty Acid Analysis (QFASA) showed that the diet of porpoises consisted mainly of gobies, mackerel, smelt, herring and dragonet, pointing towards profound differences between the diet as estimated by QFASA and as deduced from stomach contents. This study revealed that the longer term diet of porpoises in Dutch coastal waters consists both of coastal species (e. g. gobies, smelt and dragonet) and also pelagic, schooling species (e. g. mackerel and herring). The results also brought to dawn possible methodological problems in using QFASA for porpoise diet estimation, emphasizing the importance of applying different dietary analysis techniques when studying marine mammal diets and the need for controlled feeding experiments in order to improve the interpretation of dietary analysis results (Chapter 5). Besides new insights in the feeding ecology of porpoises, stable isotope analysis also elicited a non-food related conservation ecology issue. Distinct δ 13 C values in muscle of porpoises stranded in the Eastern Scheldt revealed that these porpoises foraged there for a longer period. This distinct δ 13 C signature of animals from the Eastern Scheldt was not observed in bone tissue, which suggests a relatively recent shift in habitat use rather than life-long residency of porpoises within the Eastern Scheldt. The high number of strandings within the Eastern Scheldt revealed a higher mortality rate compared to the Dutch coastal zone, indicating that along with other changes in the physical environment, the building of the storm surge barrier may {{play an important role in}} determining the residency of porpoises in the Eastern Scheldt, and that the area might act as an ecological trap for porpoises entering it. This is an example of the impact on marine species due to protection structures that emerge and respectively increase worldwide in response to the effects of global warming and climate change. It highlights that even semi-open structures, which are meant to ameliorate habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, may still affect the abundance and distribution of migratory marine mammal species (Chapter 4). The analysis of stomach contents of white-beaked dolphins showed that their diet was dominated by Gadidae. All other prey species combined contributed little to the diet by weight. The two most important prey species based in weight were whiting and cod. In numbers, gobies were most common, but these contributed little to the diet by weight. The overall diet showed a lasting predominance of whiting and cod, without clear changes over time (35 years) or differences between sexes or size-classes of dolphins and revealed that white-beaked dolphins in the south-eastern North Sea are specialist feeders, with a strong preference for whiting and cod (Chapter 6). Stomach contents of juvenile white-beaked dolphins in our study revealed that at the age of about 1. 5 years old, they had started feeding on solid food by taking a variety of small fish and invertebrate prey, mostly shrimp and squid. Immatures in our study, estimated to be 2 - 4 years old, still take small prey, including small gadoids, but also take larger gadoids. Calves apparently gradually learn to eat big fish by taking prey that is much smaller than those normally taken by their mothers. This study illustrates novel techniques for diet estimation to reconstruct sizes of shrimp and whiting from tail flaps and eye lenses, respectively (Chapter 7). Most dietary studies on porpoises and white-beaked dolphins are deduced from stomach contents. This thesis has demonstrated that using indirect methods for studying the feeding ecology of marine mammals is a valuable addition to the more direct approach using stomach contents. It supports the need for multi-method approaches because by using only one technique, key prey species in the predator-prey relation may be missed or underestimated. Future ecological and fishery impact assessment studies and management decisions for the conservation of porpoises and white-beaked dolphins should acknowledge a difference between their long- and short-term diet. Large improvement in the interpretation of the results from diet analyses can be established either by controlled feeding experiments with animals in captivity or by studies that help to understand the common principals in dietary analyses (e. g. digestion rates, turnover rates of tissues, tissue-dependent isotopic fractionation between predator and prey and lipid metabolism within the animal) and variation of these between species...|$|E
