40|$|Three {{dimensional}} simulations on the viscous folding in diverging microchannels {{reported by}} Cubaud and Mason are performed using the parallel code BLUE for multi-phase flows. The more viscous liquid L_ 1 is {{injected into the}} channel from the center inlet, and the less viscous liquid L_ 2 from two side inlets. Liquid L_ 1 {{takes the form of}} a thin filament due to hydrodynamic focusing in the long channel that leads to the diverging region. The thread then becomes unstable to a folding instability, due to the longitudinal compressive stress applied to it by the diverging flow of liquid L_ 2. Given the long computation time, we were limited to a parameter study comprising five simulations in which the flow rate ratio, the viscosity ratio, the Reynolds number, and the shape of the channel were varied relative to a reference model. In our simulations, the cross section of the thread produced by focusing is elliptical rather than circular. The initial <b>folding</b> <b>axis</b> can be either parallel or perpendicular to the narrow dimension of the chamber. In the former case, the folding slowly transforms via twisting to perpendicular folding, or it may remain parallel. The direction of folding onset is determined by the velocity profile and the elliptical shape of the thread cross section in the channel that feeds the diverging part of the cell. Due to the high viscosity contrast and very low Reynolds numbers, direct numerical simulations of this two-phase flow are very challenging and to our knowledge these are the first three-dimensional direct parallel numerical simulations of viscous threads in microchannels. Our simulations provide good qualitative comparison of the early time onset of the folding instability however since the computational time for these simulations is quite long, for such viscous threads, long-time comparisons with experiments for quantities such as folding frequency are limited.

40|$|Measuring the {{orientation}} of fold axes is a routine component of field-based structural analysis. Determining the real-space orientations of small-scale folds in drill cores, however, remains a time consuming and often cumbersome task unless the <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> lies on an exposed plane. We present a method for accurately determining {{the orientation}} of fold axes that do not lie on exposed planes in drill core, provided the core is oriented or can be reoriented using the assumed orientation {{of one of the}} fabrics within it. Two angles that uniquely specify {{the orientation of}} the <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> with respect to the core are measured. One is the angle between the <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> and the core axis. The other, measured in a plane perpendicular to core axis, couples the orientation of the <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> to either a core orientation mark or another fabric of known orientation. The real-space orientation of the <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> can either be calculated from the two measured angles and the plunge and azimuth of the drill hole or determined using a simple stereonet construction. Measurements are made with respect to the two points of intersection between the <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> and the outer surface of the core.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in developing}} shape-changing soft materials for potential applications in drug delivery, microfluidics and biosensing. These shape- changing materials are inspired by the morphological changes exhibited by plants in nature, such as the Venus flytrap. One specific class of shape-change is that from a flat sheet to a folded structure (e. g., a tube). Such “self-folding” materials are usually composed of polymer hydrogels, and these typically fold in response to external stimuli such as pH and temperature. In order to develop these hydrogels for the previously described applications, {{it is necessary to}} expand the range of triggers. The focus of this dissertation is the advancement of shape-changing polymer hydrogels that are sensitive to uncommon cues such as specific biomolecules (enzymes), the substrates for such enzymes, or specific multivalent cations. First, we describe a hybrid gel that responds to the presence of low concentrations of a class of enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The hybrid gel was created by utilizing photolithographic techniques to combine two or more gels with distinct chemical composition into the same material. Certain portions of the hybrid gel are composed of a biopolymer derivative with crosslinkable groups. The hybrid gel is flat in water; however, in the presence of MMPs, the regions containing the biopolymer are degraded and the flat sheet folds to form a 3 D structure. We demonstrate that hydrogels with different patterns can transform into different 3 D structures such as tubes, helices and pancakes. Furthermore, this shape change can be made to occur at physiological concentrations of enzymes. Next, we report a gel with two layers that undergoes a shape change in the presence of glucose. The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) is immobilized in one of the layers. GOx catalyzes the conversion of glucose to gluconic acid. The production of gluconic acid decreases the local pH. The decrease in local pH causes one of the layers to swell. As a result, the flat sheet folds to form a tube. The tube unfolds to form a flat sheet when it is transferred to a solution with no glucose present. Therefore, this biomolecule- triggered shape transformation is reversible, meaning the glucose sensing gel is reusable. Furthermore, this shape change only occurs in the presence of glucose and it does not occur in the presence of other small sugars such as fructose. In our final study, we report the shape change of a gel with two layers in the presence of multivalent ions such as Ca 2 + and Sr 2 +. The gel consists of a passive layer and an active layer. The passive layer is composed of dimethylyacrylamide (DMAA), which does not interact with multivalent ions. The active layer consists of DMAA and the biopolymer alginate. In the presence of Ca 2 + ions, the alginate chains crosslink and the active layer shrinks. As a result, the gel converts from a flat sheet to a folded tube. What is particularly unusual is the direction of folding. In most cases, when flat rectangular gels fold, they do so about their short-side. However, our gels typically fold about their long-side. We hypothesize that non-homogeneous swelling determines the <b>folding</b> <b>axis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional folding {{behavior}} of an elasto-viscous layer induced by transpression, and biaxial compression on the boundary is studied. The factors studied include the strain rate, elastic competency contrast, and viscous competency contrast. It {{was found that}} the influence of elastic competency contrast fades as the strain rate slows until finally folding behavior is completely controlled by viscous behavior. If biaxial compression is applied, induced folding along each principal stress direction is dependent. The resulting wavelength in any particular direction will not be affected by initial shortening applied in another direction. The final fold form is the supposition of fold forms in two individual directions. For transpression, the resulting <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> may deviate from being perpendicular to the direction of boundary displacement. As the strain rate decreases, wavelength increases. The <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> can be curved at slow strain rates. The directions of principal stress and the <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> are nearly perpendicular to one another in most cases. However, for medium strain rates (˙ε = 10 - 13 ~ 10 - 14 sec- 1), the angle of deviation from the mutual perpendicular direction may reach 20 degrees.

The mean magnetic susceptibility of these samples is 0. 25 • 10 - SI, suggesting low concen-trations of ferromagnetic phases. AMS ellipsoids have a mean corrected anisotropy degree of 1. 03 and a mean shape parameter of- 0. 54 (prolate).

40|$|Detailed 3 -D {{analysis}} of inclusion trails in garnet porphyroblasts and matrix foliations preserved around a hand-sample scale, tight, upright fold has revealed a complex deformation history. The fold, dominated by interlayered quartz–mica schist and quartz-rich veins, preserves a crenulation cleavage {{that has a}} synthetic bulk shear sense {{to that of the}} macroscopic fold and transects the axis in mica-rich layers. Garnet porphyroblasts with asymmetric inclusion trails occur on both limbs of the fold and display two stages of growth shown by textural discontinuities. Garnet porphyroblast cores and rims pre-date the macroscopic fold and preserve successive foliation inflection/intersection axes (FIAs), which have the same trend but opposing plunges on each limb of the fold, and trend NNE–SSW and NE–SW, respectively. The FIAs are oblique to the main fold, which plunges gently to the WSW. Inclusion trail surfaces in the cores of idioblastic porphyroblasts within mica-rich layers define an apparent <b>fold</b> with an <b>axis</b> oblique to the macroscopic <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> by 32 °, whereas equivalent surfaces in tabular garnet adjacent to quartz-rich layers define a tighter apparent <b>fold</b> with an <b>axis</b> oblique to the main <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> by 17 °.

Tectonic data were mainly collected in Lower Carboniferous to Permian carbonates and sandstones. In both rock matrix and veins, calcite twins recorded three different tectonic stages: the first stage is a pre-Laramide (Sevier) layer-parallel shortening (LPS) parallel to <b>fold</b> <b>axis,</b> the second one is a Laramide LPS perpendicular to the <b>fold</b> <b>axis,</b> and the third stage corresponds to Laramide late fold tightening with compression also perpendicular to the <b>fold</b> <b>axis.</b> Stress and strain orientations and regimes at the microscale agree with the polyphase stress evolution revealed by populations of fractures and striated microfaults, testifying for the homogeneity of stress record at different scales through time. Calcite twin analysis additionally reveals significant variations of differential stress magnitudes between fold limbs. Our results especially point to an increase of differential stress magnitudes related to Laramide LPS from the backlimb to the forelimb of the fold possibly in relation with motion of an underlying basement thrust fault that likely induced stress concentrations at its upper tip.

The calcite twin have been measured in folded Lower Carboniferous to Permian age carbonates and sandstones.

Both pre- folding and post-folding NE-directed compressional stress and/or shortening were recorded within pre-folding veins (set I) {{as well as in}} fold-related veins (sets II and III). Set III veins also recorded outer rim extension along the fold hinge line. Besides, calcite twin analysis allow us to quantify stress and strain.

To filter out the effects of later folding the fold rotation angles are plotted against the coordinates of the fold frame.

These studies have involved the mapping of the orientation, age and distribution of cleavages related to recumbent folding. Using a variety of techniques, including grain shape analysis, measurement of conglomerate pebbles, magnetic anisotropy and palaeomagnetism strain patterns have been obtained for these nappes. Different rock types control the style of folding, and, in part, the sequence of structures developed. The development of. each recumbent fold is a multistage process and prior to each change of mechanism {{the rate of the}} current meahanism declines. It is suggested that each change of mechanism is an attempt by the developing structure to maintain the displacement rate required by the thrust belt as a whole.

The area was {{subjected}} to many tectonic movements {{that led to the}} formation of a complex structural environment. The present work is to study the different structural features of folding and faulting. Approach: The study evaluated the tectonic settings from previous studies and developed a three-dimensional structure model using petrel software and through the analysis of core samples. Result: Tectonic movement is the main reason for the deformation of the sedimentar y basin and for the division of the basin from north to south. Moreover, the Yanshan and Himalayan movements have led to the division of the basin system into Yanqi uplift, static depression, and the Bohu depression. The Yanshan (Early Jurassic) movement is also responsible for the folding of the sedimentary layers because of the southwest (SW) -northwest (NW) pressure resulting from the subduction of the Indian plate beneath the Eurasian plate. Due to the inhomogeneit y of the movement force, the compression force in the middle of the fold is much greater than at the peripheries. The <b>axis</b> of this <b>folding</b> extends from northsouth (NS) to southeast; therefore, the resultant <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> is in the NS of the southern part.

The studied fold is of class- 2 and the samples collected around the fold have essentially the same microstructures. Quartz [c]-axes plotted in the tectonic coordinate system exhibit an apparent reverse obliquity on opposing limbs. Muscovite fabrics are controlled essentially by the orientation of { 001 } planes. If the CPO data are plotted in a common reference frame (e. g. either fold or geographical), all samples exhibit essentially the same patterns for both minerals.

It trends from E–W and it is a transcurrent fault which displaces the fold nose resulting in the double plunging of the <b>fold</b> <b>axis.</b> Field observation according to Anifowose and Borode (2007) shows that fractures in the area are predominantly trending in the E–W direction, while a few of them are in ENE–WSW directions.|$|R
40|$|The Mössbauer {{effect at}} the 161 Dy nucleus {{has been used}} to {{investigate}} the magnetic properties of Dy 2 O 2 S. The nuclear parameters {{have been found to be}} : g 1 /g 0 = - 1. 243 ± 0. 010, Q 1 /Q 0 = + 1. 007 ± 0. 010. In a single crystal experiment, the disappearance of the Ɗm = 0 lines demonstrates that the antiferromagnetic axis is parallel to the c-axis (three <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> for the Dy 3 + site of C 3 v symmetry), contrary to previous neutron diffraction results; the value found for the magnetic moment at saturation is (8. 0 ± 0. 3) µB, showing a net influence of the crystalline field...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method for}} tilt correction of paleomagnetic data assumes that rock bodies rotate about horizontal axes during deformations. Apparent tectonic rotations, which may produce anomalous declination readings of paleomagnetic directions and other linear elements, {{can result from}} the use of such a procedure if the rock bodies deform about inclined axes. The error (declination anomaly) resulting from two apparent tectonic rotations, 1) single rotations about an oblique axis and 2) continuous rotations about a precessing <b>fold</b> <b>axis,</b> can be determined algebraically for given orientations of rotation axis and angles of rotation. A declination anomaly chart (DAC) is constructed for each of the two processes to determine graphically whether anomalous paleomagnetic data obtained from a study area can result from the process. -from Authorlink_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Mud volcano emplacement modify the regional stress field related to the subduction of the African plate below the Eurasian plate, and originate a fold system with concentric hinge lin es around the area with highest quantity of mud volcanoes. Mud volcanoes can be formed from anticlinal folds whose nucleus have been intruded by breccias with a high content of mud matrix. Flows of mud breccias from anticlinal emission areas produce mud volcanoes whose elongation is parallel to <b>fold</b> <b>axis</b> trend...|$|R
