Then Mallinckrodt created a setup to investigate the effect scientifically. He connected an aluminum plate through a variable current limiting resistor to a 60 Hz, 110v power supply. Half of the aluminum plate was coated with an <b>insulating</b> <b>varnish</b> while the rest was left uncoated. As {{a result of the}} test he identified that the feeling of friction only appears when there is an insulating barrier between the conductive surface and the sliding finger. He concluded that the finger gets electrically polarized and this induced charge creates a force between that finger and the surface. He named this phenomenon [...] "Electrically Induced Vibrations".|$|E
5000|$|Although {{described}} as [...] "enameled", enameled wire is not, in fact, coated {{with either a}} layer of enamel paint nor with vitreous enamel made of fused glass powder. Modern magnet wire typically uses one to four layers (in the case of quad-film type wire) of polymer film insulation, often of two different compositions, to provide a tough, continuous insulating layer. Magnet wire insulating films use (in order of increasing temperature range) polyvinyl formal (Formvar), polyurethane, polyamide, polyester, polyester-polyimide, polyamide-polyimide (or amide-imide), and polyimide. Polyimide insulated magnet wire is capable of operation at up to 250 °C. The insulation of thicker square or rectangular magnet wire is often augmented by wrapping it with a high-temperature polyimide or fiberglass tape, and completed windings are often vacuum impregnated with an <b>insulating</b> <b>varnish</b> to improve insulation strength and long-term reliability of the winding.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} insulation material is air. A variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous insulators {{are also used}} in electrical apparatus. In smaller transformers, generators, and electric motors, insulation on the wire coils consists of up to four thin layers of polymer <b>varnish</b> film. Film <b>insulated</b> magnet wire permits a manufacturer to obtain {{the maximum number of}} turns within the available space. Windings that use thicker conductors are often wrapped with supplemental fiberglass insulating tape. Windings may also be impregnated with <b>insulating</b> <b>varnishes</b> to prevent electrical corona and reduce magnetically induced wire vibration. Large power transformer windings are still mostly insulated with paper, wood, varnish, and mineral oil; although these materials have been used for more than 100 years, they still provide a good balance of economy and adequate performance. Busbars and circuit breakers in switchgear may be insulated with glass-reinforced plastic insulation, treated to have low flame spread and to prevent tracking of current across the material.|$|R

40|$|Triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) {{is mainly}} used in polyester-based powder paints, {{but also in}} laminates, <b>insulating</b> <b>varnishes,</b> {{coatings}} and adhesives. Several cases of contact allergy to TGIC have been reported during the last 10 years. Contact allergy to TGIC has developed in a factory producing the chemical, in a factory producing powder paints containing TGIC, and in industries using powder coating. In this paper, we report a man who developed a work-related dermatitis when working on the painting of metal frames. He was exposed to polyester powder pigments containing TGIC. When patch tested, he was negative to TGIC (prepared in 1988) 3 x and positive to polyester powder pigment. Only when a new test preparation of fresh TGIC powder was tested, was a positive reaction obtained. Chemical analyses showed {{that there was no}} TGIC in the test preparation from 1988, and that in the TGIC powder from 1988, there was only 30 % of the expected amount of TGIC. The investigations, clinical and chemical, strongly indicate degradation of TGIC in the test preparation and powder. Both substances and the test preparations made from them may change over time. Therefore, if a false-negative reaction due to a test preparation is strongly suspected, we recommend a re-test of the patient with a new test preparation of fresh material. As a general rule, patch testing should be performed with fresh substances and test preparations made from them, unless their stability and durability are known. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Robert Allen Boyer (September 30, 1909 in Toledo, Ohio [...] - [...] November 11, 1989 in Dunedin, Florida) was {{a chemist}} {{employed}} by Henry Ford, {{he was extremely}} proficient at inventing ways to convert soybeans into paints and plastic parts used on Ford automobiles.Robert Allen Boyer, your average “B” chemistry student was given an extraordinary opportunity that changed his future {{and the future of}} automobile production in the U.S. (Plastic) Boyer, born on 30 September 1909 in Toledo, Ohio was given this chance when Ford hired his father to run the nation's oldest hotel, the Wayside Inn, in South Sudbury, Massachusetts. Ford frequented the inn and that is where Boyer was discovered. Ford claimed that Boyer had a “keen active mind”. He asked Boyer to enroll in the new Henry Ford Trade School and participate in its unique work-study program instead of following his plans to enter Andover prep school and then Dartmouth College (Shurtleff). Boyer excelled in the Ford Trade School and took to exploring concepts such as how to manufacture synthetic wool from soybeans. These were the types of problems that stumped the experts (Plastic). Boyer graduated the Ford Trade School at the age of 21 with a promising chemistry career in front of him. He started this career {{as the head of the}} soybean lab at the Edison Institute (Shurtleff). Here Boyer’s career took off. He started working to use soybeans in ways they had never been used before. Boyer has done things from extracting lubricating and paint oils from the soybean to creating a synthetic wool made from soybeans and pressing <b>insulating</b> <b>varnish</b> for starters and generators (Plastic). One of Boyer’s first projects began in 1932 and included building “a small solvent extractor to separate the bean into soy oil and protein-rich meal” (Shurtleff). The soybean oil became the most crucial commercial soy products on Ford cars. In 1934 the five to eight coats of lacquer that cars previously had been finished with was replaced with a synthetic baked enamel paint which contained about 35% soy oil. This new synthetic paint with soy oil saved considerable time and money. In 1937, Boyer developed a curved plastic sheet which he hoped would replace steel in the auto bodies of ford cars. He was so confident in his product that he took an axe to it in the middle of a crowd of reporters and critics. He also jumped up and down on the curved sheet. When there was no bending in the sheet and no shattering due to the axe and the weight of him jumping on the sheet, people were astounded (shurtleff). This soy protein plastic sheet consist of 70% cellulose and 30% resin binder pressed into cloth. “The new rust-free, dent-proof plastic was reportedly 50% lighter and 50% cheaper to produce than steel” (Shurtleff). This new plastic body cut the total weight of the car from 3,000 lb. to 2,000 (Dearborn). The sheets look like polished steel and can be bent but just snap back into place, therefor when caught in fender benders, the fender would bounce back like “rubber balls” (Shurtleff). Needless to say, this product was a breakthrough in the world of automobile production. Boyer also used the soy isolates to produce the world's first plant protein fiber in 1938. (Shurtleff.) This fiber resembled a soft wool, it was tan in color, had a medium luster and a soft warm feel. “it has 80% the strength of wool, took the same dyes, had good elongation, and did not wet as easily as wool.”(Shurtleff). Boyer figured this fiber could be used for upholstery in cars, filling in felt hats, or for clothing. Boyer changed the way the soybean was used and created innovative products we use daily.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} and compares different methods {{for evaluating the}} relative importance of variables involved in insulation lifespan models. Parametric and non-parametric models are derived from accelerated aging tests on twisted pairs covered with an <b>insulating</b> <b>varnish</b> under different stress constraints (voltage, frequency and temperature). Parametric models establish a simple stress-lifespan relationship and the variable importance can be evaluated from the estimated parameters. As an alternative approach, non-parametric models explain the stress-lifespan relationship by means of regression trees or random forests (RF) for instance. Regression trees naturally provide a hierarchy between the variables. However, they suffer from a high dependency with respect to the training set. We show that RF provide a more robust model while allowing a quantitative variable importance assessment. Comparisons of the different models are performed on different training and test sets obtained through experiments...|$|E

It has also been used in <b>insulating</b> boards, ropes, <b>varnishes,</b> animal feed, and as medicinal agents. Cannabis has potential to be used for phytoremediation: however, its cultivation is strictly controlled due to its psychoactive nature and usage in producing drugs such as marijuana, and hashish. In this study, psychoactive type Cannabis samples, which were seized from 23 different locations of Turkey, and nine hemp type Cannabis accessions, as well as an unknown accession were used. Our interest was to identify the genetic relatedness of the seized samples and to separate drug and hemp type plants. Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSRs) were employed for analysis based on single plant material (SET 1) and bulked samples of them (SET 2). Data was analysed via cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). PCoA analyses, by using SET 1 and SET 2, were able to efficiently discriminate the seized samples from the fiber type accessions. However, separation of the plants was not clear via unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) dendogram in SET 1, while they were clearly separated in SET 2.

40|$|Abstract. The {{status and}} {{progress}} of high pressure resistant insulation material {{at home and}} abroad were reviewed from aspects like high thermal conductivity, high temperature resistance, environ-mental protection and modification of nano-particles. High thermal conductivity insulation materials can improve the efficiency of cooling system and decrease the energy loss of electric machines. Some famous foreign companies keep ahead in this field. Current domestic high temperature resistant solvent less <b>insulating</b> <b>varnish</b> can only be used in small and medium sized generators instead of high voltage generators. Therefore this kind of material should be improved in either resin rich or resin less insulation systems.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{investigate}} methods by which a vacuum-safe resin coating can used to manufacture UHV-compatible parts in LIGO. We use poli-hymide resins because of their low outgassing properties. The resin initially used was Cycom 3001, now going out of production. Presently we are using resin PI- 2525. Because of their high curing temperature, these polymers can withstand high temperature baking (above 350 o C). These resins {{have been developed for}} the silicon microchip industry and as <b>insulating</b> <b>varnish</b> for transformer wires. In these applications the resin is used in very thin films. In LIGO it would be used as coatings to isolate and freeze the windings of actuation and sensing coils. Much thicker layers form, especially between successive windings in a coil. Past tests have shown that the curing process of thick films can cause foaming (in the industry this effect is called Yellow Powder Syndrome. It is generated because the curing process generates water molecules that in thin films can diffuse to the surface and boil off, but in thick films remain trapped in the volume in the form of bubbles). Foaming in the resin is totally unacceptable in UHV environment, as it can trap dirt or liquids (as well as trapping the water and solvent vapor that generate the foaming), which cannot be cleaned or removed...|$|E
