40|$|Direct {{endoscopic}} necrosectomy of walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WOPN) {{has recently}} been reported to have comparable success rates to surgery, but with lower morbidity and mortality [1] [2]. The procedure is, however, time consuming and requires multiple device exchanges [3], which may {{increase the risk of}} complications. A novel, dedicated device, the Hot AXIOS (Xlumena Inc., Mountain View, California, USA) ([Fig. â€Š 1]), has recently become available. This consists of a large-diameter, fully covered self-expanding metal stent (FCSEMS) with antimigration flanges, which is mounted on a 10. 8 -Fr delivery system with an <b>electrocautery</b> <b>blade</b> at its distal tip...|$|E
40|$|Gaseous {{byproducts}} {{produced during}} electrocautery, laser surgery {{or the use}} of ultrasonic scalpels are usually referred to as 'surgical smoke'. This smoke, produced with or without a heating process, contains bio-aerosols with viable and non-viable cellular material that subsequently poses a risk of infection (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus) and causes irritation to the lungs leading to acute and chronic inflammatory changes. Furthermore, cytotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic effects have been demonstrated. The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration have estimated that 500000 workers are exposed to laser and electrosurgical smoke each year. The use of standard surgical masks alone does not provide adequate protection from surgical smoke. While higher quality filter masks and/or double masking may increase the filtration capability, a smoke evacuation device or filter placed near (2 - 5 cm) the <b>electrocautery</b> <b>blade</b> or on endoscope valves offers additional (and necessary) safety for operating personnel and patients...|$|E
