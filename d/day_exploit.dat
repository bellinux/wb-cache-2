50|$|Parts of NSA's toolkit of {{exploits}} {{are believed}} to have somehow leaked or been hacked in 2013, and then published in 2016 (Snowden speculates that the hacking and leaking party was the Russians). Among the exploits revealed was e.g. a zero <b>day</b> <b>exploit</b> allowing remote code execution on some Cisco equipment. Cisco is a US company, and the vulnerable Cisco equipment was presumably used by US government institutions and US companies, however the NSA had apparently not notified Cisco of this vulnerability. NSA's lack of disclosure to Cisco was presumable because of the NOBUS policy, with NSA assuming that only it knew about the exploit.|$|E

30|$|Cloud {{security}} transparency Security {{incidents in}} cloud environments occur and (normally) get fixed by the cloud provider. But, to our best knowledge, no cloud provider so far provides {{a system which}} informs user promptly if the cloud infrastructure gets attacked, enabling them to evaluate the risk of keeping their cloud services productive during the attack. Thereby the customer must not necessarily be {{a victim of the}} attack, but still might be informed to decide about the continuity of his running cloud service. Furthermore, no cloud provider so far shares information about possible security issues caused by software running directly on cloud host machines. In an event of a possible zero <b>day</b> <b>exploit</b> in software running on cloud hosts (e.g., hypervisor, OS kernel) cloud customer blindly depend on a working patch management of the cloud provider. Cloud providers usually do not disclose information on this processes to customers. By this issue the information security core principles textit integrity, availability and non-repudiation are affected.|$|E
40|$|A {{programmable}} logic controller (PLC) is a small industrial computer made to withstand the harsh environment it operates in. PLCs were designed for a closed, trusted network with little emphasis on security. Since their introduction, the automation world has changed, and the line between traditional IT and automation has slowly faded away. By integrating well known, low cost, technology such as commodity operating systems and TCP/IP into the automation realm, new threats are emerging. Security by obscurity was long deemed sufficient for industrial networks. If this was ever true, it is not anymore,especially when considering where PLCs are deployed; PLCs are part of virtually every industrial control {{system in the world}} and {{is at the heart of}} systems such as power production (including nuclear), pipelines, oil and gas refineries, water and waste, and weapon systems. A compromised system could mean financial loss, damage to equipment or in some cases, loss of life. This thesis looks at PLC security from an attacker?s perspective. That is, given logicalnetwork access, what will an attacker attempt to accomplish and how will he or she proceed? In order to answer these questions, and more, this thesis discusses techniques and tools that can be used to compromise a PLC. Studying PLC security in detail, this thesis include both theoretical and practical aspects of security in PLCs. In-depth security tests are performed on a widely used PLC; uncovering several critical security vulnerabilities, including a new XML parser vulnerability accompanied by a zero <b>day</b> <b>exploit</b> allowing the adversary to perform a DoS attack that completely disables the PLC, including communication capabilities. Other exploits are also developed and their consequences run the gamut from arbitrary code execution, file read/write permissions, installing customized firmware, to manipulating actuators. The research culminates in a set of python scripts, an exploit suite, implementing all the exploits developed. This thesis shows that an adversary with network access can perform devastating attacks with relative ease. In the hands of the wrong people, the weaponized exploit suite, can cause tremendous damage. Shutting down, or altering, an industrial process will in many cases have severe financial and/or safety consequences. </p...|$|E

40|$|New {{applications}} are emerging every <b>day</b> <b>exploiting</b> the huge data volume in community photo collections. Most focus on popular subsets, e. g., images containing landmarks or associated to Wikipedia articles. In this work {{we are concerned}} with the problem of accurately finding the location where a photo is taken without needing any metadata, that is, solely by its visual content. We also recognize landmarks where applicable, automatically linking them to Wikipedia. We show that the time is right for automating the geo-tagging process, and we show how this can work at large scale. In doing so, we do exploit redundancy of content in popular locations-but unlike most existing solutions, we do not restrict to landmarks. In other words, we can compactly represent the visual content of all thousands of images depicting e. g., the Parthenon and still retrieve any single, isolated, non-landmark image like a house or a graffiti on a wall. Starting from an existing, geo-tagged dataset, we cluster images into sets of different views of the same scene. This is a very efficient, scalable, and fully automated mining process. We then align all views in a set to one reference image and construct a 2 D scene map. Our indexing scheme operates directly on scene maps. We evaluate our solution on a challenging one million urban image dataset and provide public access to our service through our online application, VIRaL. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
