Are potential differences driven by country-specific or firm-specific factors? Are the size and structure of their financial markets important factors to explain any cross-country differences on SME capital structure?

We construct a new data set on thin capitalization rules in 54 countries for the period 1982 - 2004. Using confidential data on the internal and total leverage of foreign affiliates of US multinationals, we find that thin capitalization rules affect multinational firm capital structure in a significant way. Specifically, restrictions on an affiliateâs debt-to-assets ratio reduce this ratio on average by 1. 9 %, while restrictions on an affiliateâs borrowing from the parent-to-equity ratio reduce this ratio by 6. 3 %. Also, restrictions on borrowing from the parent reduce the affiliateâs <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> <b>ratio</b> by 0. 8 %, which shows that rules targeting internal leverage have an indirect effect on the overall indebtedness of affiliate firms. The impact of capitalization rules on affiliate leverage is higher if their application is automatic rather than discretionary. Furthermore, we show that thin capitalization regimes have aggregate firm effects: they reduce the firmâs aggregate interest expense bill but lower firm valuation. Overall, our results show than thin capitalization rules, which thus far have been understudied, have a substantial effect on the capital structure within multinational firms, with implications for the firmâs market valuation. ...|$|E
40|$|Dimovski (2010) {{finds that}} the time from {{prospectus}} registration to listing is significantly positively related {{to the amount of}} underpricing amongst 45 Australian Real Estate Investment Trust (A-REIT) initial public offerings (IPOs) from 2002 to 2008. This makes the understanding of the time from prospectus registration to listing for A-REITs an important matter. This study analyses 82 A-REIT IPOs from 1994 to 2008 using a Cox proportional hazard model to analyse the duration from prospectus date to listing date. The study finds that A-REIT IPOs issued after 2000 listed more quickly, as did those A-REITs that were underwritten and also those that sought to raise larger amounts of equity capital. Those that proposed higher <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> <b>ratios</b> in their prospectuses listed more slowly. When the data is partitioned into 1994 to 1999 and 2002 to 2008 groupings, earlier A-REIT IPOs listed more quickly if they were larger while in the more recent group, those that had higher <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratios</b> took longer <b>to</b> fill their subscriptions. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} studying the effect of independent variables underpricing and <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> assset ratio to the dependent variable trading volume of IPO (Initial Public Offering) {{at the time of}} the first listing on secondary market at Indonesia Stock Exchange. This study is a development of previous research that conducted by YÃ¼ksel (2006), and Khodavandloo & Zakaria (2016) who studied the effect of underpricing and debt measured using the <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratio</b> which effect on trading volume in the secondary market. The sample population in this study is a company that did an IPO at the period 2007 - 2015 in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The analytical method used in testing variable in this study using multiple regression analysis. The results in this study is that there is a significant positive effect between independent variables underpricing to the trading volume and the significant negative result between variable <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>to</b> the trading volume as dependent variable. This result is due to high investor interest to get the returns directly when the IPO first listings in secondary market and investors tend to avoid stocks that have the solvency and financial problems...|$|R
30|$|This paper using a large {{panel of}} Pakistani {{non-financial}} firms {{over the period}} 2000 â 2013 examines the role of financial constraints in establishing the relationship between cash flows and external financing. The paper also investigates the credit multiplier effect for financially constrained and unconstrained firms. We use three different measures namely Kaplan and Zingales index (hereafterÂ KZ index), the <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the interest coverage ratio to classify the firm-year observations into financially constrained and unconstrained.|$|R
