5000|$|In the USA, {{the federal}} <b>grazing</b> <b>fee,</b> which applies to Federal lands in 16 Western states {{on public lands}} managed by the BLM and the U.S. Forest Service, is {{adjusted}} annually and is calculated by using a formula originally set by Congress in the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978. Under this formula, as modified and extended by a presidential Executive Order issued in 1986, the <b>grazing</b> <b>fee</b> cannot fall below $1.35 per animal unit month (AUM); also, any fee increase or decrease cannot exceed 25 percent of the previous year’s level.

5000|$|Grazing. The BLM manages {{livestock}} grazing {{on nearly}} 155 e6acre km2 million acres under the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. The agency has granted more than 18,000 permits and leases to ranchers who graze their livestock, mostly cattle and sheep, {{at least part}} of the year on BLM public lands. Permits and leases generally cover a 10-year period and are renewable if the BLM determines that the terms and conditions of the expiring permit or lease are being met.

Under this formula, the <b>grazing</b> <b>fee</b> cannot fall below $1.35 per animal unit month (AUM), nor can any fee increase or decrease exceed 25 percent of the previous year’s level. The <b>grazing</b> <b>fee</b> for 2014 was set at $1.35 per AUM, the same level as for 2013. Over time there has been a gradual decrease in the amount of grazing that takes place on BLM-managed land.

40|$|Abstract: Livestock grazing {{on public}} lands {{continues}} {{to be a source of}} intense conflict and debate. We analyze this problem using a dynamic resource use game. Low <b>grazing</b> <b>fees</b> let ranchers capture more rent from grazing. This increases the incentive to comply with federally mandated regulations. Optimal grazing contracts therefore include <b>grazing</b> <b>fees</b> that are lower than competitive private rates. The optimal policy also includes random monitoring to prevent strategic learning by cheating ranchers and avoid wasteful efforts to disguise noncompliant behavior. Finally, an optimal policy includes a penalty for cheating beyond terminating the lease. This penalty must be large enough that the rancher who would profit the most from cheating experiences a negative expected net return...|$|R

50|$|The Prices paid {{index is}} an index that {{measures}} {{changes in the}} prices paid {{for goods and services}} used in crop and livestock production and family living. The production component of the index accounts for over 65% of the total, and family living expenses represented by the CPI-U account for less than 20% of the index. The remaining components are interest charges on farm real estate and non-real estate debt, taxes payable on farm real estate, and wage rates paid to hired farm labor. NASS currently publishes the index on a 1990-92 = 100 base. Used in calculating the federal <b>grazing</b> <b>fee,</b> among other purposes. The index of prices paid on a 1910-14 = 100 base is called the parity index and is used in calculating the parity ratio.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. {{sheep and}} wool {{industry}} {{is one of}} the oldest agricultural industries within the country. Since the mid 1940 ’s the industry has witnessed dramatic annual declines in sheep inventories. Many factors have contributed to the decline of the sheep industry including declining consumption of lamb and mutton, the growth in man-made fiber use, scarcity of labor, and predator losses. The U. S. congress has attempted to slow this decline throughout the years with various policy including the use of wool marketing loan programs. Such programs are intended to help bring stability as well as to mitigate price risk within the industry. However, despite these efforts the industry continues to experience annual declines in inventory. The United States has vast quantities of public land especially within the western states that is utilized for grazing of livestock every year. Public-land grazing is an important element within the sheep industry with a large portion of sheep producers utilizing the resources available through public-land grazing. For the vast majority of this public land, the fee to graze livestock is charged on a per AUM (animal unit month) basis and is established annually through the use of a set formula. Public <b>grazing</b> <b>fee</b> policy is a widely debated topic with many opposing viewpoints. This research will attempt to evaluate the effects on the sheep and wool industry of policy change in regards to increasing or decreasing the public <b>grazing</b> <b>fee.</b> This analysis uses capital stock inventory accounting methodology to create an econometric model of the U. S. sheep and wool industry. The model is then used to quantify the impact of different levels of public grazing fees under three scenarios which represent a baseline (current level of <b>grazing</b> <b>fee),</b> an increase in the public <b>grazing</b> <b>fee,</b> as well as a decrease in the <b>grazing</b> <b>fee,</b> respectively. Results indicate under a baseline no change scenario the sheep industry will remain relatively stable with some modest decline in numbers expected within the next five years. Abolishment of the public <b>grazing</b> <b>fee</b> would be expected to bring added stability to the sheep and wool industries with total sheep inventories expected to remain fairly constant with some modest growth projected within the next five years. This suggests that lowering the public <b>grazing</b> <b>fee</b> could be a possible policy alternative which could be implemented to help bring stability to the sheep and wool industries. Conversely, projections indicate that raising the <b>grazing</b> <b>fee</b> would have an adverse effect on these industries and contribute to a projected increase in the rate of decline of the sheep and wool industries...|$|E

LP models that do not consistently allocate non fee costs for all types of forage result in shadow prices that can not be compared: Forage values derived using LP models must therefore be carefully evaluated with respect to the allocation of non <b>fee</b> costs of <b>grazing</b> before these values can be used to set <b>grazing</b> <b>fees...</b>|$|R
