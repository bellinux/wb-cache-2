A <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input is a computer input device used to read executable computer programs, source code, and data from <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> Most early computers used <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> as their main input device. Along with a <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers were an earlier method of entering data and running programs before {{the current generation of}} input devices existed. A <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> is an output device that <b>punches</b> holes in <b>cards</b> under computer control. Sometimes card readers were combined with <b>card</b> <b>punches</b> and, later, other devices to form multifunction machines.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{combination}} of <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> and typewriter, permitting selected text to be typed and punched, {{was developed by}} the Powers company in 1925. [...] The IBM 824 Typewriter <b>Card</b> <b>Punch</b> was an IBM 024 where the 024 keyboard was replaced by an IBM electric typewriter. [...] Similarly, the IBM 826 used an IBM 026 Keypunch.|$|R

50|$|The {{card reader}} could read 600 {{standard}} <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> per minute, {{each with a}} capacity of up to 80 characters. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> could <b>punch</b> 100 <b>cards</b> per minute.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had {{a maximum}} rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite {{critical}} throughout {{the operation of}} the <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> the <b>card</b> reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80 column <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical [...] "dog" [...] clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe stopping dog clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most emergency maintenance time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> had a preread station, a punch station and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 [...] "points" [...] or [...] "Bull degrees".|$|R
50|$|A lace <b>card</b> is a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> {{with all}} holes punched (also called a whoopee card, {{ventilator}} card, flyswatter card, or IBM doily). They were mainly used as practical jokes to cause unwanted disruption in card readers. Card readers tended to jam when a lace card was inserted, as the resulting card had too little structural strength to avoid buckling inside the mechanism. <b>Card</b> <b>punches</b> could also jam trying to produce cards with all holes punched, owing to power-supply problems. When a lace card was fed through the reader, a card knife or card saw (a flat tool used with <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers and <b>card</b> <b>punches)</b> {{was needed to}} clear the jam.|$|R

The heart of the 024 and 026 keypunches was a set of twelve precision <b>punches,</b> one per <b>card</b> row, each with an actuator of relatively high power. <b>Punch</b> <b>cards</b> were stepped across the punch one column at a time, and the appropriate punches were activated to create the holes, resulting in a distinctive [...] "chunk, chunk" [...] sound as columns were punched.
