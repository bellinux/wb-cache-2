500|$|After an {{instrumental}} introduction, {{there are two}} verses, followed by a guitar solo, which {{has been described as}} [...] "richly melodic" [...] by biographer Keith Shadwick. [...] Shapiro noted the song's brevity: [...] "The song fades on a magical solo after only two minutes and twenty-five seconds. Even live, 'Little Wing' was hardly any longer – <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> he wanted to say and stopped".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

2500|$|He sought {{re-election}} for a {{third term}} in 1984 but was defeated by Rafael Hernández Colón. After the elections, Romero-Barceló's reaction to the defeat, in response to TV news reporter Rafael Bracero, was ¿Derrota, qué Derrota? (Defeat, what defeat?). For him, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> had occurred was not a defeat, but simply an [...] "electoral loss". The comment has become legendary in Puerto Rican politics.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} [...] "The Gretel Incident", Michael {{suggested}} that Friday Night Live and Big Brother UpLate host Mike Goldman, or Friday Night Live co-host and former housemate Ryan Fitzgerald, {{would be better}} hosts of Big Brother than Gretel Killeen. As has become custom over {{the history of the}} show, Michael appeared along with all the other 2006 housemates on the Rove Live episode of the week of the final. In his usual style <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> everyone wanted to say but were too afraid to. As soon as he was asked to speak, he immediately questioned why John and Ashley were not present, and attempted to get the host to bring them on.|$|E
2500|$|Russert testified, however, that he {{does not}} believe that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> Eckenrode reports; while he {{acknowledged}} on cross examination that he was not asked about any conversations he may have had with David Gregory or Andrea Mitchell regarding Plame during his deposition with Fitzgerald, he also told the jury that [...] "they never came forward" [...] to share with him anything they were learning about Joe Wilson or Valerie Plame from administration officials, and he testified that after Novak's column was published, the NBC Washington bureau (which he heads) debated whether pursuing Plame's role in the story would compromise her job at the CIA and ultimately decided to pursue the story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I ring?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> after <b>what</b> {{seemed to}} her a long while. She moved her head in assent, and after ringing {{he went to his}} dressing-room.|$|R
6000|$|Bradley {{looked at}} the fire, with a working face, and {{was silent for a}} while. At last <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> with <b>what</b> seemed an {{inconsistent}} composure of voice and feature: ...|$|R

2500|$|Natalie: [...] "We {{tried to}} write about the {{incident}} a few times, but you get nervous that you're being too preachy or too victimized or too nonchalant. Dan came in with an idea that was some kind of concession, more 'can't we all just get along?' and I said, nope, I can't say that, can't do it. And we talked about it, and <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> about [...] "I'm not ready to make nice?" [...] From the outside, normal people really weren't aware of how bizarre and absurd it got. Dan was really good at cluing in to that, saying something that didn't back down, but still had a vulnerability to it. This album was therapy. To write these songs allowed me to find peace with everything and move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Creedence Clearwater Revival was {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Robertson in performing three songs: [...] "Who'll Stop the Rain", [...] "Born on the Bayou" [...] and [...] "Green River". During the induction speech, Springsteen said, [...] "As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [...] He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist. [...] Funny, too. [...] He was severe, he was precise, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> he had to say and he got out of there." ...|$|E
60|$|ANDERSON (goodhumoredly {{cutting her}} short). Pooh! Richard said! <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> {{he thought would}} frighten you and frighten me, my dear. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> perhaps (God forgive him!) {{he would like to}} believe. It's a terrible thing to think of what death must mean for a man like that. I felt that I must warn him. I left a message for him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{found her}} {{address in the}} {{telephone}} book. She could be quite alone to him if he wouldn't mind [...] "just me." [...] It was, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> desired.|$|R

6000|$|... --Metempsychosis, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> is <b>what</b> {{the ancient}} Greeks called it. They used {{to believe you}} could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance. What they called nymphs, for example.|$|R
60|$|That {{is what he}} said--and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> he believed; and {{not only}} believed, but felt.|$|E
60|$|SIR PATRICK. Word {{for word}} almost, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> you say. No more drugs. Nothing but inoculation.|$|E
60|$|He {{was silent}} for a long time, and then <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> I knew was in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pull easy," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{would find}} there. He {{tried to imagine}} Linda and her father, and discovered a strange reluctance within himself. [...] "Pull easy," [...] he repeated.|$|R

6000|$|... 'We {{never saw}} you before now, {{and we never}} heard of Mary Lavelle,' said {{the man of the}} house. 'And who is she,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'and <b>what</b> is it you are talking about?' ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{they reached}} the silent house <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> he had not ventured to say before, 'Fix the day--you have decided that {{it is to be}} soon, and that I am not to go?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no! <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> {{you said}} just now, and (oddly enough) almost {{in the same}} words. But I don't at all despair of persuading him to change his mind--and you can help me." ...|$|E
60|$|I said I did not understand, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> {{he wanted}} was my true name, for he guessed I picked up this one since I stole my last chickens. They all laughed loudly at that.|$|E
6000|$|As the dame turned away, Marco couldn't help {{slapping}} on {{the climax}} while {{the thing was}} hot; so <b>he</b> <b>said</b> with <b>what</b> was meant for a languid composure but was a poor imitation of it: ...|$|R

60|$|Joe {{was very}} much excited and half tipsy; but <b>he</b> only <b>said</b> <b>what</b> {{most of them were}} waiting to hear <b>said,</b> and <b>what</b> each of them expected; not one voice was raised in dissent. Pat said nothing, but smoked and gazed on the fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "You idiotic boy, {{take that}} pillow {{out of your}} mouth, and tell me the whole thing,--what <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> she said, and what they both did. It was all fun of course, but I'd like to hear about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is too late," [...] she said. [...] "I {{have been}} to another oculist--a stranger. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Sebright said: he doubted {{if there was ever}} any chance for me: he thought the {{operation}} ought never to have been performed." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when they}} galloped after Hereward, he sent them back. He {{did not know}} yet, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> he would do. Better that they should gather their forces, and see what men they could afford him, in case of open battle. And he rode swiftly on.|$|E
6000|$|Leonard {{saw that}} he must comply, for time pressed. He {{sat down at the}} table. Taking up a pen and drawing a sheet of paper towards him, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> with <b>what</b> command of his voice he could: ...|$|R
