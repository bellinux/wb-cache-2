5|$|In most cases, {{rainfall}} is {{the only}} effect that these cyclones have on California. Sometimes, the rainfall is severe enough to cause flooding and damage. For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen devastated Ocotillo, California and killed several people. Precipitation other than rainfall <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> tropical cyclones, because of their weak updrafts and lack of supercooled water.|$|E

5|$|Stela J {{was erected}} by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD702 and {{was his first}} monument. It stood at the eastern {{entrance}} {{to the city and}} <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> being topped by a sculpted stone roof, converting the monument into a symbolic house. It bears a hieroglyphic text that is woven into a criss-cross mat design to form a convoluted puzzle that must be read in precisely the right order to be understood.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a small}} bird of prey with short, broad {{wings and}} a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much. Marked size difference in this direction <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey, and most marked in birds of prey which hunt birds.|$|E

5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> {{that it can}} climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|About 20 radioisotopes and 7 {{nuclear isomers}} between 233Cm and 252Cm {{are known for}} curium, and no stable isotopes. The longest half-lives have been {{reported}} for 247Cm (15.6 million years) and 248Cm (348,000 years). Other long-lived isotopes are 245Cm (half-life 8500 years), 250Cm (8,300 years) and 246Cm (4,760 years). Curium-250 <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> that it predominantly (about 86%) decays via spontaneous fission.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored the work, like other cantatas written in Weimar, {{for a small}} ensemble of three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), bass (B)), a four-part choir only in the chorales, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four violas (Va), cello (Vc), bassoon (Fg) and basso continuo. The setting for four violas <b>is</b> <b>unusual.</b> <b>In</b> a similar orchestration, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 also omits violins.|$|E
5|$|Cranham forms {{part of the}} Hornchurch and Upminster UK Parliament constituency, and {{is partly}} within the Havering wards of Upminster and Cranham. Together these form the Upminster Area Committee. The current MP is Angela Watkinson. Each ward elects three councillors to Havering London Borough Council. All six councillors elected in 2010 for the two wards were the Upminster and Cranham Residents' Association {{candidates}} and the area <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> that the residents' association is strongly active. From 1945 to 1974 Cranham formed part of the Hornchurch constituency and from 1974 to 2010 it formed part of the Upminster constituency. Cranham is within the Havering and Redbridge London Assembly constituency and the London European Parliament constituency.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus madens, {{described}} by Ripley and Watson in 1963, <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> having some sexual dichromatism. If the Barbary falcon (see below) {{is considered a}} distinct species, it is sometimes placed therein. It {{is found in the}} Cape Verde Islands, and is non-migratory; it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving. Males have a rufous wash on crown, nape, ears, and back; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown. Females are tinged rich brown overall, especially on the crown and nape.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was {{severely}} weakened. In 1389 Norway {{entered into a}} personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in Copenhagen regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited, but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> Norway compared to other European countries.|$|E
5|$|Justinian and {{his successors}} modernized {{frontier}} fortifications throughout the century. The example at Qasr ibn Wardan (564) {{in the desert}} of eastern Syria is particularly impressive, containing a governor's palace, barracks, and a church built with techniques and to plans possibly imported from Constantinople. The church dome <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> that the pendentives sprang from an octagonal drum, rather than the four main arches, and {{in that it was}} made of brick, which was rare in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary Christian music (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> that {{it began in}} CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but {{they may also be}} interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E
