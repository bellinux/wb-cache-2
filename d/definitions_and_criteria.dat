This article {{reports the}} results of a survey of the 51 State Departments of Education (including Washington, DC) {{regarding}} their learning disabilities <b>definitions,</b> identification <b>criteria,</b> <b>and</b> operationalization procedures. A conceptual framework consisting of eight components was used in analyzing the <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> identification <b>criteria.</b> While revealing variations, results showed the continued impact of the 1977 federal <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>criteria.</b> For example, several state definitions now include the discrepancy component, and the use of language criteria is increasing. To determine current trends, the data are compared with those from a similar survey published in 1985. Findings are discussed in terms of trends, prereferral interventions, assessment instruments, and discrepancy models. Since the inception of the learning disability (LD) label in the 1960 s, controversy has surrounded the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>criteria</b> for LD placement (Franken-berger & Harper, 1987). Originally, the term learn-ing disability was conceptualized to describe...|$|R

These revisions addressed changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard program as required by EISA.

The revised statutory requirements also include new <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>criteria</b> for both renewable fuels and the feedstocks used to produce them, including new greenhouse gas emission (GHG) thresholds for renewable fuels.

50|$|Such {{characters}} are often portrayed in an exaggerated fashion and typically {{in the role}} of a villain or antihero, where the general characteristics of a psychopath are useful to facilitate conflict and danger. Because the <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>criteria</b> in the history of psychopathy have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath {{at the time of the}} film's production or release, but not necessarily in subsequent years. There are several stereotypical images of psychopathy in both lay and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits: the charming con artist, the deranged serial killer, the successful corporate psychopath, or the chronic low-level offender with juvenile delinquency. The public concept reflects some combination of fear of the mythical bogeyman, fascination with human evil, and sometimes perhaps envy of people who might appear to go through life unencumbered by the same levels of guilt, anguish or insecurity.|$|E

A further objective was to develop three case study scenarios to probe issues surrounding the definition of essentiality using dietary fibre, plant sterols and polyphenols. Current <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>criteria</b> for 2 ÃÜ 2 essentiality 2 ÃÜ 2 were reviewed through an environmental scan of the scientific literature. Additionally, international regulatory bodies were asked whether the terms 2 ÃÜ 2 nutrient 2 ÃÜ 2 and/or 2 ÃÜ 2 essential nutrient 2 ÃÜ 2 are regulated in their respective jurisdictions. Regulatory bodies including the EFSA, the US FDA, HC and FSANZ were found not to currently possess regulated definitions for the term 2 ÃÜ 2 essential nutrient 2 ÃÜ 2. Case studies examining fibre, plant sterols and polyphenols served as a means of presenting evidence for expanding the list of functional food constituents regarded as meeting criteria for essentiality. For each example, certain instances applied where these case study bioactives met criteria of essentiality. Thus, in order to reflect advances in current science, a series of non-classical compounds known to have bioactivity should be considered for their potential essentiality under certain situations...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Education, 2001 Postgraduate {{training}} {{is one of}} the most important issues in education in Vietnam. However, the quality of such training has recently become a controversial issue. There has never been any appraisal of the quality of postgraduate training in Vietnam's higher education institutions. The purpose of this study was to provide instruments to explore the quality of postgraduate training in higher education institutions in Vietnam. The study employed the Rasch rating model and the confirmatory factor analysis method to define variables. <b>Definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>criteria</b> of quality were provided. These <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>criteria</b> were accepted by higher education institutions. The perceptions of quality differed across the group of universities and the group of research institutes. These perceptions also differed across groups of institutions classified by training programmes. The study also indicated that a large proportion of institutions still did not meet the government guidelines and requirements in term of organisation, management and academic staff. Further studies such as an in-depth study of one or more similar universities and research institutes, even nation-wide studies, could usefully make use of the definitions, criteria and measurement scales set up in this study to assess the quality of postgraduate training.
