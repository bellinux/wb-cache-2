50|$|The median is {{the most}} trimmed {{statistic}} (nominally 50%), as it discards {{all but the most}} central data, and equals the <b>fully</b> <b>trimmed</b> mean - or indeed <b>fully</b> <b>trimmed</b> mid-range, or (for odd size data sets) the <b>fully</b> <b>trimmed</b> maximum or minimum. Likewise, no degree of trimming has any effect on the median - a trimmed median is the median - because trimming always excludes an equal number of the lowest and highest values.|$|R

40|$|Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) are {{standard}} methods in {{the automotive industry}} for the prediction of vibrational and acoustical response of vehicles. However, both methods are not capable of handling the so called “mid frequency problem”, where both short and long wavelength components {{are present in the}} same system. A Hybrid method has been recently proposed that rigorously couples SEA and FEM. In this work, the Hybrid FE-SEA method has been used to create fast/efficient model of structure-borne noise in a <b>fully</b> <b>trimmed</b> vehicle from 200 Hz to 1 kHz. This paper first describes simple guidelines used to partition the vehicle into stiff components described with FE and modally dense components described with SEA. It is also demonstrated how detailed local FE models can be used to improve SEA descriptions of car panels and couplings. After review of the Hybrid FE-SEA models of a full vehicle that were built, sample experimental validation results of interior Sound Pressure Levels and panel vibration are shown for both bare and <b>fully</b> <b>trimmed</b> vehicle configurations...|$|R
