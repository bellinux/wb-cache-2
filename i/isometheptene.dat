50|$|<b>Isometheptene</b> (usually as <b>isometheptene</b> mucate) is a {{sympathomimetic}} amine {{sometimes used}} {{in the treatment of}} migraines and tension headaches due to its vasoconstricting properties; that is, it causes constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels (arteries and veins).

50|$|Dichloralphenazone is a 1:2 {{mixture of}} antipyrine with chloral hydrate.

Performance impairments are common with this drug and caution is advised, for example when driving motor vehicles.

40|$|Introduction <b>Isometheptene</b> {{is thought}} to be the active {{ingredient}} of the commonly known headache medication, Midrin. Previously, we found only the (R) enantiomer to be effective in alleviating headache behavior in two models of headache compared to the (S) enantiomer. Experiments using electrical and mechanical stimulation of the dura in animals with no history of head pain have been used to elucidate the mechanisms of the trigeminovascular system {{at the level of the}} trigeminal ganglion, trigeminal nucleus caudalis, periaqueductal gray, and the thalamus. The limitation of these acute models is that electrical and mechanical stimulation of the dural blood vessels does not cause long lasting pain similar to recurrent headache pain in humans. Two animal models for the investigation of headache pathophysiology that include aspects of the chronic nature of headache were included in this study. These models provide a new approach to study the pathophysiology of recurrent headache and support validation of novel treatments. Using behavior methods of monitoring trigeminal allodynia in rats, our group discovered a rat with spontaneous episodic trigeminal allodynia (STA) (Oshinsky et al, 2012). The model was established through 18 generations of inbreeding for testing analgesics and the further understanding of mechanisms of migraine. STA rats experience similar symptoms to human migraine patients, such as episodic trigeminal sensitivity, phonophobia, responsiveness to abortive and prophylactic headache treatments, and sensitivity to migraine triggers. A second well-characterized model of repeated dural inflammatory stimulation (IS), in which an inflammatory stimulant is infused over the dura, also results in persistent headache behavior that has been accepted as a valid model for drug testing. Although the pathological mechanisms between the two models are different, one being considered idiopathic or a spontaneous model and the other inflammatory in nature, the precise mechanism(s) remain elusive. The aim of this study is to determine the dose response of the (R) -isomer of <b>isometheptene</b> on trigeminal sensitivity in the STA and IS rat models and study the mechanism of action of <b>isometheptene.</b> Poster presented at: American Headache Society 58 th Annual Scientific Meeting in San Diego CA.

40|$|Migraine {{affects a}} {{substantial}} {{fraction of the}} world population and is {{a major cause of}} disability in the work place. Migraine is a recurrent incapacitating neurovascular disorder characterized by attacks of debilitating pain associated with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and vomiting. Though the pathophysiology of migraine is still unclear, it is believed to be a neurovascular disorder. The drugs used in the treatment of migraine affect vascular receptors. In earlier days, α-adrenoceptors agonists (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, <b>isometheptene)</b> where used. The last decade has witnessed the advent of sumatriptan and the ‘second generation triptans’, which belong to a class of drugs known as 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonists. The triptans have a well-established efficacy in aborting migraine attacks. Current prophylactic treatments for migraine include 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonists and β-adrenoceptor blockers. In view of the complexity of migraine etiology, the disease still remains under diagnosed, despite progress in migraine research and available therapies are underused. In this chapter, pharmacological targets, particularly those based on 5 -HT, adrenergic and CGRP receptors, will be discussed in relation to migraine therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} and tolerability {{of a combination}} of dipyrone 600 mg, <b>isometheptene</b> 60 mg and caffeine 60 mg for the acute treatment of mild-to-moderate episodic primary headaches were evaluated against paracetamol 1000 mg and placebo. A total of 84 adult patients with two to six primary headache episodes (mild or moderate severity) per month were enrolled in this prospective, multicenter, randomized, two-period crossover study. Patients had a mean of 4. 4 headache episodes/month (mean duration: 13 h; mean severity: 50. 5 mm; assessed by visual analog scale (VAS). in patients with no improvement, rescue medications were allowed after 2 h. the primary outcome parameter was sustained pain-free rate. Secondary outcomes were evolution of pain severity (at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 240 min after treatment), presence of associated symptoms, and recurrence of episodes. Analyses included 243 headache episodes (81 patients). Sustained pain-free rates were 57. 1 % for combination therapy, 46. 8 % for paracetamol and 46. 8 % for placebo (not statistically significant). Pain improvement (assessed by VAS) occurred in 72. 5, 54. 5 and 49. 2 % of patients, respectively, after 120 min. the mean reduction in pain severity (assessed by VAS) was significantly lower in those receiving placebo and paracetamol compared with combination therapy (p < 0. 001 at 90 and 120 min). Fewer patients required rescue medication after receiving combination therapy (18. 4 %), compared with paracetamol (37. 7 %; p = 0. 008) or placebo (43. 8 %; p = 0. 0007). Adverse events were infrequent and mild. We conclude that, despite failing to meet the primary outcome, the combination of dipyrone, <b>isometheptene</b> and caffeine is effective for the acute treatment of mild-to-moderate primary headache episodes, with excellent tolerability.

40|$|Abstract Migraine is a {{recurrent}} incapacitating neuro-vascular disorder characterized by unilateral and throbbing headaches associated with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Current specific drugs {{used in the}} acute treatment of migraine interact with vascular receptors, a fact that has raised concerns about their cardiovascular safety. In the past, α-adrenoceptor agonists (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, <b>isometheptene)</b> were used. The last two decades have witnessed the advent of 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonists (sumatriptan and second-generation triptans), which have a well-established efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine. Moreover, current prophylactic treatments of migraine include 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonists, Ca 2 + channel blockers, and β-adrenoceptor antagonists. Despite the progress in migraine research and in view of its complex etiology, this disease still remains underdiagnosed, and available therapies are underused. In this review, we have discussed pharmacological targets in migraine, with special emphasis on compounds acting on 5 -HT (5 -HT 1 – 7), adrenergic (α 1, α 2, and β), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP 1 and CGRP 2), adenosine (A 1, A 2, and A 3), glutamate (NMDA, AMPA, kainate, and metabotropic), dopamine, endothelin, and female hormone (estrogen and progesterone) receptors. In addition, we have considered some other targets, including gamma-aminobutyric acid, angiotensin, bradykinin, histamine, and ionotropic receptors, in relation to antimigraine therapy. Finally, the cardiovascular safety of current and prospective antimigraine therapies is touched upon...|$|E
