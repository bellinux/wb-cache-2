40|$|A {{tropopause}} fold {{developed on}} the western flank of a trough in the 300 mb flow on 6 Oct. 1990. Radiosonde ascents over western Europe showed very dry stable layers beneath the jet stream in the potential temperature range 310 to 315 K. These were evident on profiles from 12 h on 6 Oct. to 00 h on 8 Oct. ECMWF model assimilations were examined for this period to determine how well the model represented the radiosonde observations. Humidity fields were found to give better agreement than potential vorticity, probably because the PV {{is affected by the}} limited vertical resolution of the model. Isentropic trajectories were calculated for the air in the fold as represented by the ECMWF assimilation at 00 h on 7 Oct. Those {{on the western}} edge of the <b>fold</b> <b>split</b> from the main flow and transferred to the troposphere, while those on the eastern side ended up in the cut-off low. A lower bound of 1. 1 x 10 (exp 14) kg is estimated for the amount of stratospheric air transferred into the troposphere by this fold...|$|E
40|$|SchemaSQL is a {{recently}} proposed extension to SQL for enabling multi-database interoperability. Several recently identified applications for SchemaSQL, however, mainly rely on {{its ability to}} treat data and schema labels in a uniform manner, and call for an efficient implementation of it on a single RDBMS. We first develop a logical algebra for SchemaSQL by combining classical relational algebra with four restructuring operators - unfold, <b>fold,</b> <b>split,</b> and unite - originally introduced {{in the context of the}} tabular data model by Gyssens et al. [GLS 96], and suitably adapted to fit the needs of SchemaSQL. We give an algorithm for translating SchemaSQL queries/views involving restructuring, into the logical algebra above. We also provide physical algebraic operators which are useful for query optimization. Using the various operators as a vehicle, we give several alternate implementation strategies for SchemaSQL queries/views. All the proposed strategies can be implemented non-intrusively on top of existing relational DBMS, in that they do not require any additions to the existing set of plan operators. We conducted a series of performance experiments based on TPC-D benchmark data, using the IBM DB 2 DBMS running on Windows/NT. In addition to showing the relative tradeoffs between Various alternate strategies, our experiments show the feasibility of implementing SchemaSQL on top of traditional RDBMS in a non-intrusive manner. Further more, they also suggest new plan operators which might profitably be added to the existing set available to relational query optimizers, to further boost their performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{suppression}} of mutual coupling is achieved using compact waveguided metamaterials (WG-MTMs) in between {{elements of a}} densely packed microstrip array. Both the E-plane internally <b>folded</b> complementary <b>split</b> ring resonator and the H-plane internally <b>folded</b> complementary <b>split</b> ring resonator are employed to reduce the mutual coupling between adjacent elements. Coupling {{suppression of}} 18 dB and 9 dB, for elements in the E-plane and H-plane, respectively, is demonstrated. Due to the compact size of the waveguided metamaterials, the edge-to-edge separation between elements is kept at only 0. 093 λ 0. With the same element spacing, a 2 × 2 array is also simulated with compact WG-MTMs. The proposed structure reduces the array size and enables the implementation of compact Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{design of}} aperture-coupled {{microstrip}} antenna with ultra-wideband low {{radar cross section}} (RCS) is proposed. Hybrid frequency selective surface (FSS) structures consisting of two kinds of polarization-dependent <b>folded</b> <b>split</b> ring resonators (PDFSRRs) and square patches are utilized to replace the conventional metallic ground. By orthogonally arranging the PDFSRRs in a chessboard-like configuration, the band-stop characteristic contributes to the gain enhancement, while the zero degree points of reflection phase and wave-transmission characteristic are utilized to achieve RCS reduction both in-band and out-of-band. Furthermore, with square patches periodically etched {{on the bottom of}} FSS structure, a new zero degree reflection phase is introduced to enhance the effect of RCS reduction. Full wave simulations and measurements demonstrate that the proposed antenna achieves RCS reduction from 1 GHz to 18 GHz and gain enhancement compared with traditional microstrip antenna...|$|R
40|$|An over-under double pass {{interferometer}} {{in which}} the beamsplitter area and thickness {{can be reduced to}} conform only with optical flatness considerations was achieved by offsetting the optical center line of one cat's-eye retroreflector relative to the optical center line of the other in order that one <b>split</b> beam be <b>folded</b> into a plane distinct from the other <b>folded</b> <b>split</b> beam. The beamsplitter is made transparent in one area for a first folded beam to be passed to a mirror for doubling back and is made totally reflective in another area for the second folded beam to be reflected to a mirror for doubling back. The two beams thus doubled back are combined in the central, beamsplitting area of the beamsplitting and passed to a detector. This makes the beamsplitter insensitive to minimum thickness requirements and selection of material...|$|R

5000|$|In animal development, {{organogenesis}} (organo-genesis, {{compound of}} the Greek words όργανον [...] "that with which one works", and γένεσις [...] "origin, creation, generation") {{is the process}} by which the ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm develop into the internal organs of the organism. This process can be studied using both embryos and organoids. Internal organs initiate development in humans within the 3rd to 8th weeks in utero. The germ layers in organogenesis differ by three processes: <b>folds,</b> <b>splits,</b> and condensation. Developing early during this stage in chordate animals are the notochord, which induces the formation of the neural plate, and ultimately the neural tube. Vertebrate animals all differentiate from the gastrula the same way. Vertebrates develop a neural crest that differentiates into many structures, including some bones, muscles, and components of the peripheral nervous system. The coelom of the body forms from a split of the mesoderm along the somite axis.|$|R

40|$|The two {{molecules}} {{nitrogen dioxide}} and chlorine dioxide present an intriguing array of energy levels for the spectroscopist to unravel. When {{considered as a}} rigid molecular frame the molecules possess rotational levels characterized by the usual asymmetric rotor theory. Nitrogen dioxide has been discussed {{from this point of}} view and complete structural parameters have been determined. However, these relatively simple rigid rotor levels are split by the effects of the magnetic moments of the unpaired electron and the nuclear spin. Therefore, the microwave spectrum is more complex than expected from the rigid rotor point of view. Ordinarily, one would expect a removal of the two fold degeneracy due to the electron spin and the 2 I + 1 fold degeneracy from the nuclear spin. This arises because of the magnetic interaction between these spins and the field generated by the rotating nuclear frame. For nitrogen dioxide there is a six <b>fold</b> <b>splitting</b> of each rotational level and one would expect a group of transitions as depicted in Figure 3. Since analogous remarks hold for chlorine dioxide we shall only mention that eight fine structure levels will result from these interactions...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{key features}} of a recently uncovered mode of plastic flow sinuous flow with vortex like components on the mesoscale. Based on high-resolution, in situ imaging of a hard wedge (asperity) sliding against a metal surface, we contrast this flow with the more well-known smooth homogeneous (laminar) flow in wear and large strain deformation processes. Sinuous flow is characterized by folding, and arises in both pure sliding and cutting of metals with large strain hardening capacity. The folds mediating the flow can transform into wear particles and surface defects by delamination via <b>fold</b> <b>splitting.</b> Examples of this occurrence have been captured in situ, by high speed imaging of the sliding contact. This provides a direct mechanism for delamination wear, {{in just a few}} passes of sliding. Material heterogeneity {{plays an important role in}} the folding, as revealed by finite element simulation and experiment. This combined experiment-simulation approach reveals a number of ways in which folding can be triggered, suggesting an important role for sinuous flow in delamination wear. A close relationship between sinuous flow and mechanochemical Rehbinder effects in machining of metals is also highlighted. Technological implications of sinuous flow for sliding wear and manufacturing processes are briefly discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Moreover, the metamaterial loaded antenna has better far-field radiation patterns compared with the reference antenna.

40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} {{mechanism}} of the reassembly and folding process of two fragments of a split lattice protein by using forward flux sampling (FFS). Our results confirmed previous thermodynamics and kinetics analyses that suggested that the disruption of the critical core (of an unsplit protein that folds by a nucleation mechanism) {{plays a key role}} in the reassembly mechanism of the split system. For several split systems derived from a parent 48 -mer model, we estimated the reaction coordinates in terms of collective variables by using the FFS least-square estimation method and found that the reassembly transition is best described by a combination of the total number of native contacts, the number of interchain native contacts, and the total conformational energy of the split system. We also analyzed the transition path ensemble obtained from FFS simulations using the estimated reaction coordinates as order parameters to identify the microscopic features that differentiate the reassembly of the different split systems studied. We found that in the fastest <b>folding</b> <b>split</b> system, a balanced distribution of the original-core amino acids (of the unsplit system) between protein fragments propitiates interchain interactions at early stages of the folding process. Only this system exhibits a different reassembly mechanism from that of the unsplit protein, involving the formation of a different folding nucleus. In the slowest folding system, the concentration of the folding nucleus in one fragment causes its early prefolding, whereas the second fragment tends to remain as a detached random coil. We also show that the reassembly rate can be either increased or decreased by tuning interchain cooperativeness via the introduction of a single point mutation that either strengthens or weakens one of the native interchain contacts (prevalent in the transition state ensemble) ...|$|R
