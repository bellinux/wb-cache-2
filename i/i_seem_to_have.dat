500|$|In a {{study of}} a working-class lesbian {{community}} in Buffalo, New York, in the 1940s and 1950s, The Well of Loneliness was the only work of lesbian literature anyone had read or heard of. For many young lesbians in the 1950s, {{it was the only}} source of information about lesbianism. The Wells name recognition made it possible to find when bookstores and libraries did not yet have sections devoted to LGBT literature. As late as 1994, an article in Feminist Review noted that The Well [...] "regularly appears in coming-out stories– and not just those of older lesbians". It has often been mocked: Terry Castle says that [...] "like many bookish lesbians <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> spent much of my adult life making jokes about it", and Mary Renault, who read it in 1938, remembered laughing at its [...] "earnest humourlessness" [...] and [...] "impermissible allowance of self-pity". Yet it has also produced powerful emotional responses, both positive and negative. One woman was so angry at the thought of how The Well would affect an [...] "isolated emerging lesbian" [...] that she [...] "wrote a note in the library book, to tell other readers that women loving women can be beautiful". A Holocaust survivor said, [...] "Remembering that book, I wanted to live long enough to kiss another woman." ...|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> reached a point where I must draw the line. It looks as though the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E
