5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in <b>electric</b> <b>heating.</b> While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than <b>electric</b> <b>heating.</b> However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E

5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and <b>electric</b> <b>heating.</b> Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon monoxide poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E
5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E

5|$|With over 100 {{transmission}} lines paralyzed by the ice, Quebec {{fell into a}} massive power outage in the cold Canadian winter. Even though power restoration initiated after the first blackouts, large numbers of Quebecers were in the dark. At {{the height of the}} blackout, some 1.4–1.5 million homes and customers, housing three to more than four million people, were in the dark. Private companies and other utilities from other parts of Canada and the United States were sent in to help Hydro-Québec undertake this massive restoration task, but these efforts were complicated by the widespread damage of the power grid. Blackouts in some areas lasted for 33 days, and 90% of those affected by the blackout had no power for more than seven days. Although power was fully restored to all locations in Quebec by February 8, 1998, it wasn't until mid-March that the power facilities were back in service. By then, much social and economic damage had occurred, such as ruined food and deaths resulting from lack of <b>electric</b> <b>heating.</b>|$|E

25|$|Advantages of <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> methods {{over other}} forms include {{precision}} control of temperature {{and distribution of}} heat energy, combustion not used to develop heat, {{and the ability to}} attain temperatures not readily achievable with chemical combustion.

40|$|International audienceThe {{residential}} sector {{is responsible for}} more than 35 % of the final energy consumption in the European Union, and is increasingly constrained by thermal regulations, resulting in a significant rise of new efficient heating technologies. This paper presents {{a comparison of the}} energetic and environmental performances of six heating systems installed in a low energy house: a gas-fired condensing boiler, a wood pellet boiler, a micro-combined heat and power (MCHP), an air-to-water <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> pump, an air-to-water gas absorption heat pump and an exhaust air-to-air <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> pump. The comparison is made with respect to the annual primary energy consumption and the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and carried out under various climates and electricity generation mixes. The results indicate that, based on an ideal sizing, the MCHP and the absorption heat pump achieve the highest energy performances. However, both technologies suffer from small size unavailability, leading to significant oversizing which impacts their performances. Based on current size availability, the air-to-water <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> pump benefits from the previous systems oversizing and thus appears as the most efficient technology. However, current sizing practice also causes significant oversizing which impacts the performances of thermodynamic systems. Without significant sizing practice improvements, the air-to-water <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> pump merit decreases in favor of the MCHP. In terms of environmental impact, the wood boiler causes the lowest GHG emissions, whatever the electricity generation mix considered...|$|R

25|$|A battery's {{characteristics}} {{may vary}} over load cycle, over charge cycle, and over lifetime due to many factors including internal chemistry, current drain, and temperature.
