25|$|Two joined monosaccharides {{are called}} a {{disaccharide}} {{and these are}} the simplest polysaccharides. Examples include sucrose and lactose. They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a covalent bond known as a <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkage</b> formed via a dehydration reaction, resulting in the loss of a hydrogen atom from one monosaccharide and a hydroxyl group from the other. The formula of unmodified disaccharides is C12H22O11. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.|$|E
2500|$|One type of archaeal {{cell wall}} is that {{composed}} of pseudopeptidoglycan (also called pseudomurein). [...] This type of wall {{is found in}} some methanogens, such as Methanobacterium and Methanothermus. [...] While the overall structure of archaeal pseudopeptidoglycan superficially resembles that of bacterial peptidoglycan, {{there are a number}} of significant chemical differences. Like the peptidoglycan found in bacterial cell walls, pseudopeptidoglycan consists of polymer chains of glycan cross-linked by short peptide connections. [...] However, unlike peptidoglycan, the sugar N-acetylmuramic acid is replaced by N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid, and the two sugars are bonded with a β,1-3 <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkage</b> instead of [...] β,1-4. [...] Additionally, the cross-linking peptides are L-amino acids rather than D-amino acids as they are in bacteria.|$|E

5000|$|To name a {{polysaccharide}} {{composed of}} a single type of monosaccharide, that is a homopolysaccharide, the ending “-ose” of the monosaccharide is replaced with “-an”. For example, a glucose polymer is named glucan, a mannose polymer is named mannan, and a galactose polymer is named galactan. When the <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkages</b> and configurations of the monosaccharides are known, they may be included as a prefix to the name, with the notation for <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkages</b> preceding the symbols designating the configuration.

2500|$|In sucrose, the {{components}} glucose and fructose are linked via an ether bond between C1 on the glucosyl subunit and C2 on the fructosyl unit. The bond {{is called a}} <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkage.</b> Glucose exists predominantly as two isomeric [...] "pyranoses" [...] (α and β), but {{only one of these}} forms links to the fructose. Fructose itself exists as a mixture of [...] "furanoses", each of which having α and β isomers, but only one particular isomer links to the glucosyl unit. What is notable about sucrose is that, unlike most disaccharides, the glycosidic bond is formed between the reducing ends of both glucose and fructose, and not between the reducing end of one and the nonreducing end of the other. This linkage inhibits further bonding to other saccharide units. Since it contains no anomeric hydroxyl groups, it is classified as a non-reducing sugar.|$|E

40|$|A short {{synthesis}} of the calicheamicin oligosaccharide is reported. All the <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkages</b> have been constructed using the sulfoxide glycosylation reaction, demonstrating {{the efficacy of the}} method. A general method to introduce N-O <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkages</b> in oligosaccharides has been developed and employed to construct the N-O bond that connects rings A and B. In the final step of the synthesis, the two halves of the calicheamicin oligosaccharide are coupled in a completely deprotected form.

50|$|Trehalose is {{the major}} {{carbohydrate}} energy storage molecule used by insects for flight. One possible {{reason for this is}} that the <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkage</b> of trehalose, when acted upon by an insect trehalase, releases two molecules of glucose, which is required for the rapid energy requirements of flight. This is double the efficiency of glucose release from the storage polymer starch, for which cleavage of one <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkage</b> releases only one glucose molecule.|$|E

50|$|Glucansucrase enzymes can {{synthesize}} {{a variety}} of glucans with differing solubilities, rheology, and other properties by altering the type of <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkage,</b> degree of branching, length, mass, and conformation of the polymers. Glucansucrases are classified according to the <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkage</b> they catalyze. They can be mutansucrases, dextransucrases, alternansucrases, or reuteransucrases. This versatility has made glucansucrase useful for industrial applications. Glucansucrase’s role in cariogenesis is a major point of interest. Glucan polymers stick to teeth in the human mouth and cause tooth decay. There is hope to make dental caries {{a thing of the}} past by knocking out this enzyme.|$|E
5000|$|The {{straight}} chain consists of α-1,6 <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkages</b> between glucose molecules, while branches begin from α-1,3 linkages.

40|$|A 3 -step method {{shows the}} <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkages</b> and abs. {{configuration}} of oligosaccharide moieties {{attached to a}} complex labile aglycon by measuring the split CD curves resulting from interacting benzoate chromophores on the hexopyranose ring. Thus, the chromosome units of chromomycin A 3 in the oligosaccharide moiety are all 2, 6 -deoxy sugars and hence lack sufficient OH groups which can be benzoylated to give coupled benzoate groups. Accordingly, the anomeric position were benzoylated as well; chromomycin A 3 was directly permethylated in DMF/NaH with MeI, hydrolyzed with 50 % AcOH, and per-p-bromobenzoylated. The coupled CD spectra resulting from chiral interaction between the 1 -benzoate groups attached to other carbons were used to det. the position of <b>glycosidic</b> <b>linkages</b> and abs. configurations...|$|R
