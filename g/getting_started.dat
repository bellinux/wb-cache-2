5|$|During high school, Barbera {{worked as}} a tailor's {{delivery}} boy. During the Great Depression, he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a magazine called The NY Hits Magazine. He supported himself with {{a job at a}} bank, and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in Redbook, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier'sâ€”the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on <b>getting</b> <b>started</b> in the animation industry. Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was <b>getting</b> <b>started</b> for the sequel Faerch had grown {{too big for the}} part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with this}} information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While {{fighting}} the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers {{that the best}} way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him. By the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the point of no return by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood. Cortana believes it's over but the Master Chief tells her that they're just <b>getting</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time <b>getting</b> <b>started</b> as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

25|$|Indianapolis {{businessman}} Carl G. Fisher first envisioned {{building the}} speedway in 1905 after assisting friends racing in France and seeing that Europe held {{the upper hand}} in automobile design and craftsmanship. Fisher began thinking of a better means of testing cars before delivering them to consumers. At the time, racing was just <b>getting</b> <b>started</b> on horse tracks and public roads. Fisher noticed how dangerous and ill-suited the makeshift courses were for racing and testing. He also argued that spectators did not get their money's worth, as they were only able to get a brief glimpse of cars speeding down a linear road.|$|E
25|$|There {{are places}} other than sport {{that can be}} {{affected}} by the hot-hand fallacy. A study conducted by Joseph Johnson et al. examined the characteristics of an individual's buying and selling behavior as it pertained to the hot hand and gambler's heuristic. Both of these occur when a consumer misunderstands random events in the market and is influenced by a belief that a small sample is able to represent the underlying process. To examine the effect of the hot hand and gambler's heuristic on the buying and selling behaviors of consumers, three hypotheses were made. Hypothesis one stated that consumers that were given stocks with positive and negative trends in earning {{would be more likely to}} buy a stock that was positive when it was first <b>getting</b> <b>started</b> but would become less likely to do so as the trend lengthened. Hypothesis two was that consumers would be more likely to sell a stock with negative earnings as the trend length initially increased but would decrease as the trend length increased more. Finally, the third hypothesis was that consumers in the buy condition would be more likely to choose a winning stock over those in the selling condition.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers finally {{carried out}} their {{original}} plan for Demeter {{for the most}} part, set {{all the way back}} in September 1956. He became the new starter in center field, while Duke Snider was moved over to right field. Don had a very successful spring training and was expected to be the opening day starting centerfielder against the Chicago Cubs, but instead he rode the bench {{for the duration of the}} game. The next day, Duke Snider's lingering knee problems came back, and Demeter was given his first start of the season with the temperature around 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The new and improved Don Demeter made the best first impression he could, hitting a home run and a single while driving in two runs en route to a 5-3 win. Snider started the next game, the series opener against the St. Louis Cardinals. In his second start the next day, Don hit another homer. The next day, another home run. In just three starts, Don already had three home runs and six runs batted in. Demeter was only just <b>getting</b> <b>started</b> with his April tear.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not long}} before major {{corporations}} started taking an interest in computer graphics. TRW, Lockheed-Georgia, General Electric and Sperry Rand are among the many companies that were <b>getting</b> <b>started</b> in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the IBM 2250 graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer. Ralph Baer, a supervising engineer at Sanders Associates, came up with a home video game in 1966 that was later licensed to Magnavox and called the Odyssey. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. David C. Evans was director of engineering at Bendix Corporation's computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked {{for the next five years}} as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the University of Utah recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics.|$|E

500|$|In October 2011, {{scientists}} found using spectroscopy that cosmic dust contains complex organic compounds ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure") {{that could be}} created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. The compounds are so complex that their chemical structures resemble the makeup of coal and petroleum; such chemical complexity was previously thought to arise only from living organisms.

[...] Kirkus Reviews referred to the book as [...] "an enlightening cautionary take" [...] and [...] "a charmingly personal account", but also as [...] "loosely organized and occasionally sparse on detail".
