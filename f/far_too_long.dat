50|$|Decoration is not {{the main}} purpose of a Kolam. In olden days, kolams were drawn in coarse rice flour, so the ants would not have to walk <b>too</b> <b>far</b> or <b>too</b> <b>long</b> for a meal. The rice powder also invited birds and other small creatures to eat it, thus {{welcoming}} other beings into one's home and everyday life: a daily tribute to harmonious co-existence. It is a sign of invitation to welcome all into the home, not the least of whom is Lakshmi, the Goddess of prosperity and wealth. The patterns range between geometric and mathematical line drawings around a matrix of dots to free form art work and closed shapes. Folklore has evolved to mandate that the lines must be completed so as to symbolically prevent evil spirits from entering the inside of the shapes, and thus are they prevented from entering the inside of the home.|$|R
25|$|Mathis {{continued}} {{to survive in}} Hollywood despite being involved {{in two of the}} greatest fiascoes of the 1920s. When Erich von Stroheim presented Goldwyn Pictures with his masterpiece Greed, following Frank Norris's novel McTeague very closely, it was 42 reels and 10 hours long. Stroheim himself realized the original version was <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>long,</b> so he reduced it to 24 reels (6 hours), hoping the film could be screened with intermissions in two successive evenings. But Goldwyn executives demanded further cuts. Stroheim allowed his close friend Rex Ingram to reduce it to 18 reels (4½ hours).|$|E

The idea was not popular among Koreans and riots broke out. To contain them, the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December 1945 and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and the PRK People's Committees on 12 December 1945. The right-wing Representative Democratic Council, led by Syngman Rhee, who had arrived with the U.S. military, opposed the trusteeship, arguing that Korea had already suffered from foreign occupation <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>long.</b> Following further large-scale civilian unrest, the USAMGIK declared martial law.|$|E

In a wet summer all four Test matches were affected by rain. Evans highest two scores of the series – 25 and 31 – came {{in the first and}} third Tests, which were both drawn. In the fourth Test he was promoted to number six in the batting order as England omitted Trevor Bailey and chose five specialist bowlers. It proved unsuccessful as England collapsed chasing 168, Wisden noting England's 'tail proved <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> for a Test Match'. Evans scored 0 and 3 in his two innings, but by taking three catches he became the Test record holder for dismissals. A catch to take the wicket of Abdul Kardar was his 131st dismissal in Tests, taking him past the previous highest total of 130 by Bert Oldfield.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{theatrical}} {{release in}} the United States was 'a box office disappointment' and reviews were 'generally mixed'. The New York Times wrote:"See No Evil {{has its share}} of thrills. Cheap thrills, to be sure, but thrills none the less - and everything in the rest of Richard Fleischer's new movie... encourages us to value small favors. Attempting on the one hand to mean something {{and on the other hand}} trying to crank up the terror, Fleischer keeps suggesting confrontations between the rich and the poor, the old and the young, families with daughters to protect and men with warped desires. For all the potency of a camera movement, it can never have exactly the power of a conceptual image, and therefore [...] "See No Evil" [...] is better with its mindless terror than with its witless meaning. And although everything becomes <b>far</b> <b>too</b> much <b>long</b> before it is over, the movie is generally at it most ridiculous precisely where it hopes to make sense." ...|$|R

6000|$|Becket {{has been}} highly praised by Sir Henry Irving himself, for its [...] "moments {{of passion and}} pathos, [...] . which, when they exist, atone to an {{audience}} for the endurance of long acts." [...] But why should the audience have such long acts to endure? The reader, one fears, is apt to use his privilege of skipping. The long speeches of Walter Map and the immense period of Margery tempt the student to exercise his agility. A [...] "chronicle play" [...] has the privilege of wandering, but Becket wanders <b>too</b> <b>far</b> and <b>too</b> <b>long.</b> The political details of the quarrel between Church and State, with its domestic and international complexities, are apt to fatigue the attention. Inevitable and insoluble as the situation was, neither protagonist is entirely sympathetic, whether in the play or in history. The struggle in Becket between his love of the king and his duty to the Church (or what he takes to be his duty) is nobly presented, and is truly dramatic, while there is grotesque and terrible relief in the banquet of the Beggars. In {{the scene of the}} assassination the poet [...] "never stoops his wing," [...] and there are passages of tender pathos between Henry and Rosamund, while Becket's keen memories of his early days, just before his death, are moving.|$|R
25|$|In May, 2010, the new Coalition {{government}} {{said that the}} 'Labour's 13-year war on the motorist is over' and that the new government 'pledged to scrap public funding for speed cameras' In July Mike Penning, the Road safety minister reduced the Road Safety Grant for the current year to Local Authorities from £95 million to £57 million, saying that local authorities had relied too heavily on safety cameras for <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> {{and that he was}} pleased that some councils were now focusing on other road safety measures. It is estimated that as a result the Treasury is now distributing £40 million less in Road Safety Grant than is raised from fines in the year. Dorset and Essex announced plans to review camera provision with a view to possibly ending the scheme in their counties, however Dorset strongly affirmed its support for the scheme, albeit reducing financial contributions in line with the reduction in government grant. Seven counties also announced plans to turn off some or all of their cameras, amidst warnings from the country's most senior traffic policeman that this would result in an increase in deaths and injuries. Gloucestershire cancelled plans to update cameras and has reduced or cancelled maintenance contracts.|$|E

In line with his self-image as a musician, regardless of his past as a Beatle, Harrison included [...] "Who Can See It" [...] in the setlist for his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, the first tour there by a former Beatle since the band's break-up.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} poorly {{received}} by Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online, who {{called it a}} largely unsuccessful experiment due to its [...] "repetitiveness and inappropriateness". He felt {{that several of the}} tracks went on for <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> without any change, and that the music did not fit the game due to Square not providing feedback to Arai about how the tracks were to be used. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot, in his review of the game, called the soundtrack [...] "a bunch of dizzying techno that doesn't suit the onscreen grandeur".|$|E

40|$|Cells of Escherichia coli, {{tethered}} to glass {{by a single}} flagellum, were subjected to constant flow of a medium containing the attractant alpha-methyl-DL-aspartate. The concentration of this chemical was varied with a programmable mixing apparatus over a range spanning the dissociation constant of the chemoreceptor at rates comparable to those experienced by cells swimming in spatial gradients. When an exponentially increasing ramp was turned on (a ramp that increases the chemoreceptor occupancy linearly), the rotational bias of the cells (the fraction of time spent spinning counterclockwise) changed rapidly to a higher stable level, which persisted {{for the duration of}} the ramp. The change in bias increased with ramp rate, i. e., with the time rate of change of chemoreceptor occupancy. This behavior can be accounted for by a model for adaptation involving proportional control, in which the flagellar motors respond to an error signal proportional to the difference between the current occupancy and the occupancy averaged over the recent past. Distributions of clockwise and counterclockwise rotation intervals were found to be exponential. This result cannot be explained by a response regular model in which transitions between rotational states are generated by threshold crossings of a regular subject to statistical fluctuation; this mechanism generates distributions with <b>far</b> <b>too</b> many <b>long</b> events. However, the data can be fit by a model in which transitions between rotational states are governed by first-order rate constants. The error signal acts as a bias regulator, controlling the values of these constants...|$|R

Edward Keyes of Newsday {{described}} the track as [...] "exuberant", he was critical of its placement on the album: [...] "The production, courtesy of the reliable Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, feels boilerplate at best. At 17 songs, the record is <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>long,</b> {{and by the time}} the exuberant 'Up Out My Face' arrives, it feels like it was grafted on from a better record."

500|$|Some recent reviewers {{have been}} less enthusiastic, with PopMatters' Zeth Lundy opining that, rather than Harrison's more [...] "stripped-down" [...] {{production}} aesthetic, [...] "Who Can See It" [...] would have benefited from [...] "the hyper-drama of All Things Must Pass resonant abyss". Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot similarly bemoaned the [...] "hymn-like calm" [...] of the performance and its falling short of the [...] "transcendent heights" [...] of Harrison's 1970 triple set. In their Solo Beatles Compendium, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter dismiss the track as a [...] "song which goes on <b>far</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> to make its simple point", a situation not helped by a [...] "histrionic" [...] vocal from Harrison.|$|E

60|$|He had {{appointed}} his son Richard {{to succeed}} him, and after there had been, at Somerset House in the Strand, a lying in state more splendid than sensible--as all such vanities after death are, I think--Richard became Lord Protector. He was an amiable country gentleman, but {{had none of}} his father's great genius, and was quite unfit for such a post in such a storm of parties. Richard's Protectorate, which only lasted {{a year and a}} half, is a history of quarrels between the officers of the army and the Parliament, and between the officers among themselves; and of a growing discontent among the people, who had <b>far</b> <b>too</b> many <b>long</b> sermons and <b>far</b> <b>too</b> few amusements, and wanted a change. At last, General Monk got the army well into his own hands, and then in pursuance of a secret plan he seems to have entertained from the time of Oliver's death, declared for the King's cause. He did not do this openly; but, in his place in the House of Commons, as one of the members for Devonshire, strongly advocated the proposals of one SIR JOHN GREENVILLE, who came to the House with a letter from Charles, dated from Breda, and with whom he had previously been in secret communication. There had been plots and counterplots, and a recall of the last members of the Long Parliament, and an end of the Long Parliament, and risings of the Royalists that were made too soon; and most men being tired out, and there being no one to head the country now great Oliver was dead, it was readily agreed to welcome Charles Stuart. Some of the wiser and better members said--what was most true--that in the letter from Breda, he gave no real promise to govern well, {{and that it would be}} best to make him pledge himself beforehand as to what he should be bound to do for the benefit of the kingdom. Monk said, however, it would be all right when he came, and he could not come too soon.|$|R
