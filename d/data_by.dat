The type {{of the research}} is descriptive qualitative. The object {{of the study is}} suffix –ic and –al on Oxford Learner’s Pocket Dictionary. The data source of this research is Oxford Learner’s Pocket Dictionary. In collecting the data the writer uses documentation and the steps are reading, selecting, collecting and retyping the data. The techniques of analyzing data of this research are identifying the data, classifying and describing the data based on the characteristics, functions and drawing conclusion. The results of this research are as follows: the characteristics of suffix –ic are followed by noun ended with vowel [a]: 7 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> noun ended with vowel [d]: 2 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> noun, adjective, and verb ended with vowel [e]: 15 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> verb ended with vowel [h]: 2 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> ended with vowel [l]: 2 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> noun ended with vowel [m]: 3 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> noun ended with vowel [n]: 3 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> noun ended with vowel [o]: 3 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> noun ended with vowel [s]: 1 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> noun ended with vowel [t]: 19 <b>data,</b> followed <b>by</b> noun ended vowel [y]: 20 data.

The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit.

5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar <b>data</b> <b>by</b> computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E
5|$|On March6, meteorologists from University College London at TropicalStormRisk.com {{issued a}} {{forecast}} {{for the season}} for above average activity, since sea surface temperatures {{were expected to be}} slightly warmer than usual; the group used <b>data</b> <b>by</b> the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), and compared the potential 28.6storms to the 30-year average of 26.3. The group raised the number of predicted storms in April to 29.6, and again in early May to 30.5. They ultimately overestimated the number of storms that would form. The Laboratory for Atmospheric Research at the City University of Hong Kong also issued a season forecast in April 2002, predicting 27storms with a margin of error of 3, of which 11 would become typhoons, with a margin of error of 2. The agency noted a stronger than normal subtropical ridge over the open Pacific Ocean, as well as ongoing El Niño conditions that favored development, but expected below-normal development in the South China Sea. These predictions proved to be largely accurate.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} line {{of research}} that culminated in Astronomia nova (A New Astronomy)—including the first two laws of planetary motion—began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an equant (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two arcminutes (the average measurement error). But he was {{not satisfied with the}} complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the <b>data</b> <b>by</b> up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to the data.|$|E

5|$|While the {{government}} brought in foreign experts (yatoi) during {{the building of}} the country's modern infrastructure, the high seismicity in Japan proved to be an ideal laboratory setting during the establishment of the new science of seismology. In 1876, John Milne came from England to teach at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo. Following the earthquake of February 22, 1880, Milne's attention turned to seismology as a primary area of study. That earthquake also triggered the formation of the Seismological Society of Japan, which was an organization to help foreign scientists stay coordinated in their efforts. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese had their own organization (the Japan Meteorological Agency) that had taken control of an earthquake reporting system that was initially created by Milne. Ultimately, the system and the 1891 earthquake provided <b>data</b> <b>by</b> which seismologist Fusakichi Omori developed a law of decay for aftershocks.|$|E
