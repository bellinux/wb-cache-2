5|$|The opening beauty pass {{of the new}} Enterprise was the {{responsibility}} of visual-effects cinematographer Marty Rosenberg, who handled all the other miniatures, explosions, and some live-action bluescreen elements. Rosenberg had previously shot some of the Enterprise-D effects <b>for</b> <b>Generations,</b> but had to adjust his techniques for the new model; the cinematographer used a 50mm lens instead of the 35mm used <b>for</b> <b>Generations</b> because the smaller lens made the new Enterprises dish appear stretched out. Knoll decided to shoot the model from above and below as much as possible; side views made the ship appear too flat and elongated. Rosenberg preferred motion-control passes of ships over computer-generated versions, as it was much easier to capture {{a high level of}} detail with physical models rather than trying to recreate it by computer graphics.|$|E

Younger generations live much more intellectually diverse lives and cites much user generated content as being mostly produced outside of the monetary economy.

5|$|However, in a {{field study}} {{published}} in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the scarlet and white ibises overlap along the coast and in the Llanos region of Colombia and Venezuela. They observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers; their proposal that these birds be classified as a single species, has been followed by least one field guide. Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the scarlet ibis has been introduced into wild populations of American white ibis. Birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted <b>for</b> <b>generations.</b>|$|E
