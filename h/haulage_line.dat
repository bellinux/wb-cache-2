5000|$|... #Caption: The Hercules <b>Haulage</b> <b>Line</b> {{connected}} the Williamsford township to the Hercules Mine above ...|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} the {{location}} of the Hercules Haulage - a 2-foot gauge <b>haulage</b> <b>line</b> on the western slope of Mount Read, and the later Rosebery - Williamsford Aerial Ropeway.|$|E
5000|$|The Hercules Haulage {{also known}} as the Mount Read Haulage, the Hercules Tram [...] and the Williamsford <b>Haulage</b> <b>Line,</b> was a {{self-acting}} [...] narrow gauge tramway on the side of Mount Read in Western Tasmania, that connected the Hercules Mine with Williamsford and then to the North East Dundas Tramway.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} list is {{of most of}} {{the significant}} named lines {{but it is not a}} complete list. There have also been <b>haulage</b> <b>lines,</b> and other tramlines within small areas that existed in mining leases and forest areas.|$|R
50|$|Starting at Bridge Mandi, uphill trek lies along <b>haulage</b> railway <b>line.</b> After {{reaching}} Winch Camp, one has {{the option}} to trek along the railway trek via Head Gear, Katheru and Zero point to reach Barot or can choose the easier route via Jalani village, although the distance remains same.|$|R
50|$|The Blayney-Demondrille railway line is {{a railway}} line in New South Wales, Australia. It is used mainly for grain <b>haulage.</b> The <b>line</b> {{is owned by the}} NSW government, however in 2004 the Australian Rail Track Corporation became {{responsible}} for operations over the line. The Lachlan Valley Railway operated heritage and tourist trains over the line, based at Cowra. It previously also operated general goods trains.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924, Charles Whitham wrote:- Williamsford is the {{township}} attached to Mount Read, and is {{right at the}} foot of the steepest and longest <b>haulage</b> <b>line</b> we have...5 miles from Rosbery by road, and 18 miles from Zeehan by tramway, and if you like rugged and wild scenery you will find it a charming place ...|$|E
5000|$|The Jōbu Railway (上武鉄道) {{opened the}} section between [...] and [...] on 7 October 1901 {{operated}} {{by the use of}} steam <b>haulage.</b> The <b>line</b> was extended in stages, reaching Chichibu in 1914. The line was electrified at 1,200 V DC on 15 March 1918. On 1 August 1922, the Chichibu Railway acquired the Hokubu Railway (北武鉄道) operating between Hanyū and Kumagaya. The line reached Mitsumineguchi in 1930.|$|R
5000|$|The {{section of}} the line between Ōyamada Station (大山田駅) (present-day Nishi-Kuwana Station) and [...] was opened on 5 April 1914 by the Hokusei Railway, with {{services}} operated using steam <b>haulage.</b> The <b>line</b> was extended to [...] on 8 July 1931 and electrified at 600 V DC. On 11 February 1944, the line became part of Mie Kotsu (三重交通), and in 1954, the line voltage was increased to 750 V DC.|$|R
5000|$|The Naradhan railway line is {{a railway}} line in {{south-western}} New South Wales, Australia. It branches from Ungarie on the Lake Cargelligo line and heads in a westerly direction, passing through Youngareen and Kikoira, to {{the small town of}} Naradhan. The line opened on 11 February 1929 [...] to open up the region for agriculture, and is currently used for seasonal grain <b>haulage.</b> The <b>line</b> saw passenger services until 1974.|$|R
50|$|It also {{incorporated}} subsidiaries Interail, {{which had}} been acquired in March 2002 and operated services in New South Wales, and logistics company CRT Group, for which QR National already provided <b>line</b> <b>haulage</b> and purchased outright in June 2005.|$|R
50|$|The coal {{railways}} {{had been}} planned {{in an era when}} level routes were required for horse <b>haulage,</b> and the <b>line</b> through Coatbridge was south to north, reaching Glasgow, {{in the case of the}} Garnkirk line, by a wide northward sweep.|$|R
50|$|Western goods trains were {{rescheduled to}} operate over this line {{in lieu of}} the Blue Mountains from 1993 when the now-defunct National Rail company {{commenced}} interstate freight <b>haulage.</b> The <b>line</b> opened between Parkes and Forbes in 1893, and Forbes and Stockinbingal in 1918. Passenger services were operated by CPH railmotors until their withdrawal between Stockinbingal and Forbes in October 1974. Services operated between Parkes and Forbes until 1983, consisting of a Mail train and a rail-motor service.|$|R
5000|$|The Yabuzuka Quarry {{opened a}} [...] gauge handcar line between Ota and Yabuzuka in 1911 to haul stone blocks. The line was {{acquired}} by Tobu in March 1913, rebuilt to [...] gauge and extended to Aioi on 19 March 1913, operating using steam <b>haulage.</b> The <b>line</b> was electrified at 1,500 V DC from 1 March 1928, and in March 1932 extended to Akagi. Freight services ceased in 1996, with the last service running on 25 September.|$|R
50|$|The Minato Railway (Minato Tetsudō) was {{established}} on 18 November 1907, {{and the line}} was opened from Katsuta to Nakaminato on 25 December 1913, using steam <b>haulage.</b> The entire <b>line</b> to Ajigaura was completed on 17 July 1928. From 1 August 1944, the line {{was taken over by}} Ibaraki Kōtsū (茨城交通), becoming the Ibaraki Kōtsū Minato Line.|$|R
50|$|Until the ADG class railcars entered {{service in}} 1953, {{services}} on the Fremantle line were operated by steam locomotives. Some peak-hour services {{continued to be}} steam hauled until {{the arrival of the}} ADK/ADB class diesel multiple units in 1968 resulted in the end of steam <b>haulage.</b> When the <b>line</b> was electrified in 1991, A-series electric multiple units took over.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, {{operation}} of the line {{was taken over by}} a charitable trust under a lease from Bradford City Council. The tramway was closed in 2010, to bring it up to modern safety standards. This involved fitting the two tramcars with new chassis, wheels and decks, and improving braking systems on both cars and <b>haulage</b> drum. The <b>line</b> reopened in 2011.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, Flying Tojo limited express {{services}} commenced, running between Ikebukuro and Nagatoro (Nagatoro) on the Chichibu Railway, initially using 5310 series EMUs with transverse seating, and taking approximately two hours. The name {{was inspired by}} the Flying Scotsman express train service running in Britain. This service continued until December 1967. Steam for freight <b>haulage</b> on the <b>line</b> was finally withdrawn in 1959.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{went into}} {{production}} in February 2009. The mine was opened in May 2009 by South Australian Premier Mike Rann. The development includes an open-pit mine, a conventional grinding and flotation processing plant, {{construction of a}} permanent village to accommodate the workforce and construction of a <b>haulage</b> road, power <b>line</b> and bore field. Studies for underground development are underway.|$|R
50|$|A more {{conventional}} tramway was opened on 26 September 1823. The 4 ft Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway ran from Princetown to Sutton Harbour and the Cattewater. Branches were opened to Cann Quarry in 1829 and to Plympton in 1834, {{followed by the}} Lee Moor Tramway in 1854. <b>Haulage</b> on these <b>lines</b> in Plymouth was always by horses and the Lee Moor line remained in use until 1960.|$|R
5000|$|A {{batch of}} A class engines, with differing {{external}} details was built at Wellington's Lion Foundry, by E.W. Mills Ltd in 1873, {{for use on}} the Foxton Section. These {{appear to be the}} first NZR locomotives actually built in the country. Like other so-called contractors engines they were quickly outmoded for <b>line</b> <b>haulage</b> and were sold to industrial operators. [...] "Opossum" [...] was sold in 1877 and served industrial and timber companies for eight decades. The other two were likewise sold by 1885.|$|R
5000|$|The Western Australian Minister for Transport, Simon O'Brien, {{created the}} Freight and Logistics Council of WA in 2009, {{composed}} of individuals involved in transport industries in Western Australia. The Minister commissioned Strategic design + Development Pty Ltd, {{under the guidance}} of the Strategic Grain Network Committee (also appointed by the Minister), to conduct a study into the rail network serving the wheatbelt. A report was delivered in December 2009. In the 2009 report, and the state government's response to it, the rail network has been identified as having [...] "tiers" [...] - the Tier 1 and Tier 2 grain <b>haulage</b> railway <b>lines</b> have been deemed to be essential to the operations of the grain freight network. The position taken by the government recommended the closing of the Tier 3 railway lines and developing the [...] "Brookton Strategy", which involves CBH Group investing in rapid grain loading facilities at Brookton and Merredin.|$|R
50|$|The railway {{line between}} East Greta Junction and Stanford Merthyr was owned and worked by the East Greta Coal Mining Co. When {{constructed}} the Aberdare Railway was jointly {{controlled by the}} Australian Agricultural Company and the Aberdare Collieries Ltd of New South Wales, who entered into {{an agreement with the}} East Greta Company for <b>haulage</b> over the <b>line.</b> In February 1906 the AA Co. purchased the Aberdare Collieries' share in the Aberdare Railway giving them 100% control of the Aberdare Railway, but the East Greta Coal Mining Co. continued to work trains over the line.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the full}} {{opening of the}} line in 1950, {{passenger}} and freight services on the line were hauled by JNR Class D50 2-8-2 steam locomotives, necessary to negotiate the steep gradients on the line of up 25 ‰. A couple of JNR Class 8620 steam locomotives were also used for shunting at Kamaishi Station. JNR Class C58 2-6-2 steam locomotives were also used on both passenger and freight services running {{to and from the}} Yamada Line. Six JNR Class D51 2-8-2 steam locomotives were subsequently transferred to the line, displacing some of the earlier D50s, but steam <b>haulage</b> on the <b>line</b> was entirely replaced by diesel haulage from March 1967.|$|R
50|$|The line {{closed in}} two stages - the {{northern}} section closed prematurely in December 1964 when {{a section of}} the line one mile east of Llanilar was damaged by floods from the adjacent River Ystwyth. The remaining southern section closed to passengers in February 1965, a part of a nationwide process of railway closures and system rationalisation (see Beeching Cuts). Goods traffic continued in the form of milk trains from Carmarthen to Pont Llanio (just south of Tregaron) and the Felin Fach creamery (on the Aberaeron branch line) using Class 35 Hymek haulage until 1970, and with Class 37 <b>haulage</b> until the <b>line</b> closure in 1973.|$|R
50|$|Class AM1 was {{allocated}} to the prototype AC electric multiple units, converted from fourth-rail DC electric stock in 1952 and used on the Lancaster/Morecambe/Heysham route. This route had been electrified by the Midland Railway at 6.6 kV, 25 Hz AC. These were withdrawn in 1952 and the service reverted to steam <b>haulage.</b> The <b>line</b> voltage was changed to 6.6Kv at 50Hz in 1955 and the AM1's were introduced. Thus was a test to see if power could {{be drawn from the}} National Grid rather than railway owned power stations. The AM1's were fitted with mercury arc rectifiers but one was later converted to a solid state rectifier as a test. The stock was maintained at Meols Cop works near Southport.The line was closed to passengers and the stock withdrawn in early 1966. Unlike classes AM2-AM11, which became TOPS Classes 302-311, class AM1 was withdrawn before it could take its place in the system as class 301. However, it was the success of these tests that contributed to the decision to choose 25 kV AC overhead electrification as standard in Great Britain outside the Southern Region.|$|R
50|$|Some {{peak hour}} and Saturday {{services}} were formed of one Class 37/4 locomotive and four Mk. 2F carriages. Two locomotives received special heritage repaints into 1960s BR Green livery (no. 37411) or 1980s BR Blue Large Logo livery (no. 37425) {{to mark the}} end of locomotive-hauled trains. Sadly two Class 37s (nos. 37425 and 37408) were involved in a runaway situation and collided at Rhymney Sidings on 30 July 2005. Number 37408 was withdrawn, and replaced by previously stored no. 37419. Number 37425 was repaired, but whilst it was out of traffic, Class 47 locomotives were hired from Riviera Trains as cover. Class 37-hauled trains finished on 10 December 2005, however in the new year Arriva received complaints from commuters about comfort and over-crowding, so reinstated a Monday to Friday diagram, operating a morning train into Cardiff, and an evening train back to Rhymney, usually using 37410. With the December 2006 timetable change this service reverted to DMU, and with Arriva Trains Wales said to be disposing of its loco hauled stock, it would appear as though the end of loco <b>haulage</b> on the <b>line</b> has finally come.|$|R
5000|$|After initial reservations, in 1845 most of {{the merchants}} in Vlotho {{supported}} a railway station in Vlotho on the Cologne-Minden Railway. For centuries, the Vlotho port on the Weser was a trading centre for the Ravensberger Land and for the Principality of Lippe and for freight traffic to and from Bremen and Thuringia. They feared economic disadvantages from its decline because of changes that had already occurred and the coming changes to the infrastructure (to roads and trails, {{as well as the}} increasing development of railways). Not long after, Vlotho supported the idea of a direct rail link from Minden via Vlotho to Paderborn. This would lead to Vlotho continuing to be a major gateway to northern Lippe, which up to that time had been served by cart <b>haulage.</b> The <b>line</b> that was eventually built was called the Löhne-Vienenburg line. During the construction of the Löhne-Hamelin line migrant workers from non-German speaking countries worked {{for the first time in}} the area; in Vlotho there were Poles. [...] Construction work in Vlotho began in 1872 with the demolition of twelve houses in lower Langen Straße. Many residents were afraid that they would lose light and air as a result of the high embankment. During the construction of the freight depot, a house was destroyed by a landslide in 1874. On 30 June 1875, the Löhne-Hamelin line was officially opened with its first passenger train. All Vlotho notables were invited as guests of honour. [...] The new line closed a gap between the Elze-Goslar line (opened in 1853) and the Löhne-Osnabrück line (opened in 1855) and was thus of importance for east-west traffic. Vlothor station at this time had an entrance building and a small goods shed. Interlockings were installed on the line in 1907. The line was duplicated in 1908-1911. The station building was extended in 1909 with the addition of an area of about 800 square metres. In 1934, there were alterations to an area that was already used for apartments for rail workers. In the same year toilet facilities were installed in the building; these were made accessible from the station forecourt by an external staircase in 1968.|$|R
