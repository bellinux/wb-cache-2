500|$|... "I {{jumped into}} bed {{with him and he}} climbed on top of me. As he climaxed, <b>he</b> <b>shuddered</b> so loudly I was afraid he would wake up Michael and Marlon, who were {{sleeping}} three feet away in the next bed. Or at least I thought they were sleeping. As I was slipping out of the room, I heard Michael say to Jermaine, 'Nice job. Now, can we please get some sleep?'" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shuddered</b> lightly now and again, as {{they stepped}} lurching down the hill. He set his jaws hard to {{suppress}} this shuddering. It {{was not in}} his limbs, or even {{on the surface of}} his body, for Helena did not notice it. Yet <b>he</b> <b>shuddered</b> almost in anguish internally.|$|E
60|$|A horrible thought {{passed through}} the Dutchman's mind, and <b>he</b> <b>shuddered.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Bid me drown him!" [...] whispered <b>he,</b> <b>shuddering</b> between {{rage and}} horrible disgust. [...] "You shall hear his death gurgle in another instant!" ...|$|R
6000|$|CANDIDA. What is it, Eugene--the {{scrubbing}} brush? (<b>He</b> <b>shudders.)</b> Well, there! never mind. (She {{sits down}} beside him.) Wouldn't {{you like to}} present me with a nice new one, with an ivory back inlaid with mother-of-pearl? ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} <b>he</b> was <b>shuddering</b> rapidly. A {{peculiar}} feeling, {{as if his}} belly were turned into nothingness, {{made him want to}} press his fists into his abdomen. <b>He</b> remained <b>shuddering</b> drunkenly, like a drunken man who is sick, incapable of thought or action.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shuddered</b> as {{he thought}} of Jack's {{feelings}} as he felt himself shooting over the precipice.|$|E

50|$|After their wedding, the boy's {{continuing}} complaints annoyed {{his wife}} to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As <b>he</b> awoke, <b>shuddering,</b> <b>he</b> exclaimed that while he had finally learned to <b>shudder,</b> <b>he</b> still {{did not know what}} true fear was.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take mine,' {{said his}} father; 'stand on your feet. There now--she'll lend you her arm: that's right, look at her.

5000|$|... “It was a horrid experience," [...] <b>he</b> <b>shudders.</b> [...] "The {{cold hit}} me upside my head. My uncle said to me, 'You're {{going to suffer}} here.' I thought, 'Whoa, what's this?' I had none of the comforts of parental {{guidance}} and cover. I was just a burden to these people. I felt lost.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shuddered.</b> She {{advanced}} and {{laid a hand}} on his bent shoulder. Under the light touch he appeared to sink.|$|E
60|$|He spoke very quietly, but <b>he</b> <b>shuddered</b> involuntarily, and Betty, {{unable to}} {{restrain}} her tears, retreated to her sister's side.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shuddered</b> violently as she spoke, {{and motioned}} {{to her with}} his hand not {{to go on with}} what she was saying.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> stopped, <b>shuddering.</b> When <b>he</b> proceeded, {{his voice}} faltered, {{and his head}} drooped low.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the message}} is completed, the exit {{statement}} is always [...] "Resume normal functions in three ... two ... one ...", or later [...] "transmission ending in three ... two ... one ...", after which <b>he</b> <b>shudders,</b> performs a dance-like movement, belches, or sneezes. Returning to normal he usually inquires [...] "So what did I miss?...", indicating that he doesn't know what he had said.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘What!’ <b>he</b> cried, <b>shuddering.</b> ‘I {{missed my}} way, and {{coming on the}} outside of this tower in the dark, fell down—a year ago?’ ...|$|R
60|$|I stepped {{nearer to}} him, {{intending}} {{to raise my}} voice in pity for his infirmity. <b>He</b> <b>shuddered,</b> and signed to me to keep back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Snider--" [...] He paused, {{tried to}} speak again, raised a hand, and pointed down-river. [...] "They--went--back," [...] and then <b>he</b> <b>shuddered</b> convulsively and died.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{old man was}} ghastly pale. <b>He</b> <b>shuddered</b> and tottered to his feet. Edmunds {{sprang to}} his. He stepped back a pace or two. Edmunds advanced.|$|E
60|$|MORELL (ashamed). You know, Candida, that I have {{a temper}} to {{struggle}} with. And <b>he</b> said (<b>shuddering)</b> that you despised {{me in your}} heart.|$|R
2500|$|Do {{you know}} what the Devil thinks when he sees men use {{violence}} to propagate the gospel? He sits with folded arms behind the fire of hell, and says with malignant looks and frightful grin: [...] "Ah, how wise these madmen are to play my game! Let them go on; I shall reap the benefit. I delight in it." [...] But when he sees the Word running and contending alone on the battle-field, then <b>he</b> <b>shudders</b> and shakes for fear.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} it as if he half {{thought it would be}} {{transformed}} under the power of his intense wish. Then he looked again at the floating fish and <b>shuddered.</b> Well might <b>he</b> <b>shudder,</b> for they were contemptible little fish, most of them, with unnaturally large heads, and great staring eyes, as if they had failed, even in death, to get rid of their surprise at being caught. With their mouths opened to the uttermost, they seemed to wish to shout, but couldn't.|$|R
60|$|Norman hesitated, but {{his cheeks}} blanched; <b>he</b> <b>shuddered,</b> {{shook his head}} without speaking, ran up after Harry, and waved her back when she would have followed.|$|E
60|$|Presently the {{bruised and}} bewildered boy {{was able to}} take note of his surroundings, and then <b>he</b> <b>shuddered</b> to think how {{narrowly}} he had escaped death.|$|E
60|$|From {{this thought}} <b>he</b> <b>shuddered</b> away, and listened devoutly to Eathorne's {{ideas on the}} {{advancement}} of the Sunday School, which were very clear and very bad.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Zane, old pioneer and frontiersman though <b>he</b> was, <b>shuddered</b> as <b>he</b> {{went to his}} room. His brother's dark look, and his deadly calmness, were significant.|$|R
6000|$|If Murray {{had slept}} late that morning--well, <b>he</b> <b>shudders</b> yet over that [...] "if." [...] But {{aforesaid}} Fate {{saw to it}} that he woke when the hour of destiny and the milk-can struck, and having awakened he found he could not go to sleep again. It suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen a sunrise on the pond. Doubtless it would be very lovely down there in those dewy meadows at such a primitive hour; he decided to get up and see what the world looked like in the young daylight.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shuddered.</b> <b>He</b> {{looked up}} vaguely, with a childish, puzzled moodiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} impossible, doctor; {{but it is}} true. I have seen her myself," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>shuddered.</b> [...] "She has been stabbed to the heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-night it is beautiful," [...] he answered, [...] "as {{our lives}} seem to be; yet I {{have seen it}} otherwise," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>shuddered</b> a little.|$|E
