Numerical methods decrease their convergence rates with successively higher orders of differentiation along with improved conditioning. In contrast, increasing order of integration increases the convergence rate {{at the expense of}} poorer conditioning. In the study presented, a two-dimensional Poisson equation with exponential dependency is solved. The solution of the point collocation problem becomes the initial estimate for an integrated volumetric minimization process. Global, rather than local integration, is used since {{there is no need to}} construct any meshes for integration as done in the “meshless ” finite element analogs. The root mean square (RMS) errors are compared. By pushing the shape parameter to very large values, using extended precision, the RMS errors show that spatial refinement benefits are relatively small compared to pushing shape parameters to increasing larger values. The improved Greedy Algorithm was used to optimize the set of data and evaluation centers for various shape parameters. Finally, <b>extended</b> <b>arithmetic</b> precision is used to push the range of the shape parameters...|$|E

Method: The proposal contains two phases, first the necessary information is collected and in second place projects are evaluated using 2 -tuple linguistic representation model. The experts are selected by analyzing their curricular synthesis. The evaluation criteria are defined using the technique Focus Group and weighted in the interval (0, 1) according to their importance. three domains are offered to express the preferences: numeric, interval-valued and linguistic. For aggregation <b>extended</b> <b>arithmetic</b> mean and weighted average extended are used, preventing the loss of information.

40|$|Most {{existing}} multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) {{assume the}} existence of Pareto-optimal solutions/Pareto-optimal objective vectors in a neighborhood of an obtained Pareto-optimal set (PS) /Pareto-optimal front (PF). Obviously, this assumption does not work well on the multiobjective problem (MOP) whose true PF and true PS are {{in the form of}} multiple segments-truly disconnected MOP (TYD-MOP). Moreover, these MOEAs commonly involve more than three control parameters; and some of them even involve nine control parameters. The stabilities of their performance against parameter settings are generally unknown. In this paper, we propose a MOEA, namely multiobjective density driven evolutionary algorithm (MODdEA), which can handle TYD-MOP. MODdEA stores all evaluated solutions by a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree. Benefiting from the BSP scheme, a fast solution density estimation by the archive is naturally obtained. MODdEA uses this estimated density together with the nondominated rank to probabilistically select mating individuals, which relaxes the neighborhood assumption on PF in a parameter-less manner. Moreover, two genetic operators, <b>extended</b> <b>arithmetic</b> crossover and diversified mutation, are proposed to enhance the explorative search ability of the algorithm. MODdEA is examined on two test problem sets. The first test set consists of six TYD-MOPs; the second test set consists of 17 benchmark MOPs which are commonly examined by the existing MOEAs. Comparing to 14 test MOEAs, MODdEA has superior performance on TYD-MOP and is competitive on MOP whose true PF and PS are one single connected segment. © 2011 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The other noncentrally distributed random variates can be obtained through simple transformations. Four algorithms are suggested here, two of which are moment approximations to the central chisquare distribution, the others being a normal approximation and an exact algorithm;The class of random multivariates under study here is the multinomial. A decomposition method of the multinomials into binomials in combination with an exact random median method is employed to yield a very efficient generator;The hypergeometric distribution can be considered as a binomial distribution in sampling without replacement after each Bernoulli trial. There is no closed form inverse transformation for this distribution. Two algorithms are devised here to increase the efficiency in generation.
