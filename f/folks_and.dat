5|$|Estimates {{identify}} {{anywhere from}} 230 to 282 different <b>folks</b> <b>and</b> linguistic groups in Cameroon. The Adamawa Plateau broadly bisects these into {{northern and southern}} divisions. The northern peoples are Sudanese groups, {{who live in the}} central highlands and the northern lowlands, and the Fulani, who are spread throughout northern Cameroon. A small number of Shuwa Arabs live near Lake Chad. Southern Cameroon is inhabited by speakers of Bantu and Semi-Bantu languages. Bantu-speaking groups inhabit the coastal and equatorial zones, while speakers of Semi-Bantu languages live in the Western grassfields. Some 5,000 Gyele and Baka Pygmy peoples roam the southeastern and coastal rainforests or live in small, roadside settlements. Nigerians make up the largest group of foreign nationals.|$|E
5|$|Released in the United States and Canada on October 6, 2000 and {{distributed}} by Universal Studios, the film earned back its initial budget of $55 million in only eleven days. It {{went on to}} become one of the highest-grossing films of 2000, earning over $160 million in North America and over $330 million worldwide. Meet the Parents was well received by film critics and viewers alike, winning several awards and earning additional nominations. Ben Stiller won two comedy awards for his performance and the film was chosen as the Favorite Comedy Motion Picture at the 2001 People's Choice Awards. The success of Meet the Parents inspired two film sequels, namely Meet the Fockers and Little Fockers released in 2004 and 2010 respectively. Meet the Parents also inspired a reality television show titled Meet My <b>Folks</b> <b>and</b> a situation comedy titled In-Laws, both of them debuting on NBC in 2002.|$|E

This alliance is strong within the prisons however is less effective outside them. The alliance between <b>Folks</b> <b>and</b> Crips is known as 8-ball.

25|$|Critics {{have focused}} on Li Bai's strong sense of the {{continuity}} of poetic tradition, his glorification of alcoholic beverages (and, indeed, frank celebration of drunkenness), his use of persona, the fantastic extremes {{of some of his}} imagery, his mastery of formal poetic rules– and his ability to combine all of these with a seemingly effortless virtuosity in order to produce inimitable poetry. Other themes in Li's poetry, noted especially in the 20th century, are sympathy for the common <b>folks</b> <b>and</b> antipathy towards needless wars (even when conducted by the emperor himself).|$|E
25|$|Oxenham was not {{the most}} {{prolific}} of these three, as she had 87 titles published during her lifetime (and a further two were published by her niece, who discovered the manuscripts among Oxenham's papers in the 1990s) whereas Brent-Dyer published 100 books of various kinds. Nearly forty of Oxenham's books comprise the main Abbey Series, with another thirty or so in several connecting series and the remaining twenty - some in small series of their own, and some isolated titles - having no connection with the Abbey books at all. During the 1920s to the 1950s she had several short stories, and some longer serialised ones, published in Annuals such as the Girl's Own Annual, British Girl's Annual, Little <b>Folks</b> <b>and</b> Hulton's Girls' Stories. Some of these stories were connected to the books - i.e. dealt with characters {{from one of her}} books or series - others became books, or sections of books, that were published a year or two later.|$|E

500|$|Show Boat [...] {{begins with}} the singing of that most reprehensible word – nigger – yet this is no coon song... {{immediately}} establishes race {{as one of the}} central themes of the play. This is a protest song, more ironic than angry perhaps, but a protest nonetheless. In the singers' hands, the word nigger has a sardonic tone... in the very opening, Hammerstein has established the gulf between the races, the privilege accorded the white <b>folks</b> <b>and</b> denied the black, and a flavor of the contempt built into the very language that whites used about African Americans. This is a very effective scene.... These are not caricature roles; they are wise, if uneducated, people capable of seeing and feeling more than some of the white folk around them.|$|E

[...] Instead of defining politics as a means for creating the ideal society, as he did in New Age Politics, he defines radical middle politics as [...] "idealism without illusions"– more creative and future-oriented than politics-as-usual, but willing to face [...] "the hard facts on the ground". [...] Rather than arguing that change will be brought about by a third force, he says most Americans are already radical middle– [...] "we're very practical <b>folks,</b> <b>and</b> we're very idealistic and visionary as well." ...|$|E

She had prominent roles in Show <b>Folks</b> <b>and</b> Ned McCobb's Daughter (both 1928), where reviewers observed that she made a [...] "good impression" [...] and was [...] "worth watching". The following year, Pathé elevated Lombard from a supporting player to a leading lady. Her success in Raoul Walsh's picture Me, Gangster (also 1928), opposite June Collyer and Don Terry on his film debut, finally eased the pressure her family had been putting on her to succeed. In Howard Higgin's High Voltage (1929), her first talking picture, she played a criminal {{in the custody of}} a deputy sheriff, both of whom are among bus passengers stranded in deep snow. [...] Her next film, the comedy Big News (1929), cast her opposite Robert Armstrong and was a critical and commercial success. Lombard was reunited with Armstrong for the crime drama The Racketeer, released in late 1929. The review in Film Daily wrote, [...] "Carol Lombard proves a real surprise, and does her best work to date.

500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a thrill to throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing {{when one considers that}} he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But my <b>folks</b> <b>and</b> I decided that I'd make up my mind about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E
