50|$|Three {{nutritional}} {{strategies are}} seen in dinoflagellates: phototrophy, mixotrophy, and <b>heterotrophy.</b> Phototrophs can be photoautotrophs or auxotrophs. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates are photosynthetically active, but are also heterotrophic. Facultative mixotrophs, in which autotrophy or <b>heterotrophy</b> is sufficient for nutrition, are classified as amphitrophic. If both forms are required, the organisms are mixotrophic sensu stricto. Some free-living dinoflagellates do not have chloroplasts, but host a phototrophic endosymbiont. A few dinoflagellates may use alien chloroplasts (cleptochloroplasts), obtained from food (kleptoplasty). Some dinoflagellates may feed on other organisms as predators or parasites.|$|E

V. brassicaformis has a circular plastid genome as an ancestral Myzozoan would have had, and is also capable of hunting (myzocytosis) as they were.

Polytomella is a free-living, flagellated, nonphotosynthetic green alga {{with a highly}} reduced, linear fragmented mitochondrial genome. Polytomella, as it exists today, bears evidence of once having a functional photosynthetic plastid which has over evolutionary time changed such that it would appear now to have no genome or gene expressing mechanisms remaining to it. Having transitioned completely to <b>heterotrophy,</b> Polytomella uses organic acids, alcohols and monosaccharides as its carbon source. Despite being an evolutionary descendent of the green algae, Polytomella is a colourless organism because it has lost its photosynthetic ability.|$|E
5000|$|Euglena {{gracilis}} is {{a species}} of single-celled Eukaryote algae in the genus Euglena. They have a secondary chloroplast and can feed by photosynthesis, <b>heterotrophy</b> or phagocytosis. They have a highly flexible cell surface, allowing them to change shape from thin cells up to 100 µm long to spheres of approximately 20 µm. They have two flagella, only one of which emerges from the flagellar pocket (reservoir) in the anterior of the cell, and can move by swimming, or by so-called [...] "euglenoid" [...] movement across surfaces. Euglena gracilis has been used extensively in the laboratory as a model organism, particularly for studying cell biology and biochemistry.|$|E
50|$|H. arenicola cannot divide without {{containing}} the endosymbiont. But, unlike a fully integrated organelle, the Nephroselmis alga does not divide {{along with the}} host cell. When the host cell divides, one of the daughter cells receives the Nephroselmis cell and the other daughter returns to a heterotrophic lifestyle. Hence, the mother protist gives rise to green-coloured and white-coloured daughter cells. The latter behaves like a predator until it ingests a Nephroselmis green alga. The alga then loses its flagella and cytoskeleton, while the Hatena, now a host, switches to photosynthetic nutrition, gains {{the ability to move}} towards light and loses its feeding apparatus. Thus, the protist exhibits an unusual life cycle of alternating autotrophy and <b>heterotrophy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Species of Paramecium {{range in}} size from [...] in length. Cells are {{typically}} ovoid, elongate, foot- or cigar-shaped. The body of the cell is enclosed by a stiff but elastic membrane (pellicle), uniformly covered with simple cilia, hairlike organelles which act like tiny oars to move the organism in one direction. Nearly all species have closely spaced spindle-shaped trichocysts embedded deeply in the cellular envelope (cortex) that surrounds the organism. Typically, an anal pore (cytoproct) is located on the ventral surface, in the posterior half of the cell. In all species, there is a deep oral groove running from the anterior of the cell to its midpoint. This is lined with inconspicuous cilia which beat continuously, drawing food inside the cell. Paramecia live mainly by <b>heterotrophy,</b> feeding on bacteria and other small organisms. A few species are mixotrophs, deriving some nutrients from endosymbiontic algae (chlorella) carried in the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E
50|$|Marine dinoflagellate species undergo {{three major}} trophic modes: autotrophy, mixotrophy and <b>heterotrophy.</b> Many species of {{dinoflagellates}} were previously {{assumed to be}} exclusively autotrophic; however, recent research has revealed that many dinoflagellates that {{were thought to be}} exclusively phototrophic are actually mixotrophic. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates can undergo both photosynthesis and phagocytosis as methods of feeding. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates with individual plastids that depend mostly on photosynthesis can prey on other cells as their secondary source of nutrients. On the other hand, mixotrophic dinoflagellates with individual plastids that depend mainly on phagocytosis are also photosynthetic due to chloroplasts 'stolen' from their prey (kleptochloroplasts) or because of algal endosymbionts. It was discovered that the mixotrophic dinoflagellates Gonyaulax polygramma and Scrippsiella spp. can engulf small-size prey using their apical horn while larger prey are engulfed via their sulcus, showing that dinoflagellates can have more than one mouth for feeding. Moreover, mixotrophic dinoflagellates belonging to the species Karlodinium armiger, can capture small prey by direct engulfment or can use an extendable peduncle to capture larger prey.|$|E

50|$|Psychrophiles use a {{wide variety}} of {{metabolic}} pathways, including photosynthesis, chemoautotrophy (also sometimes known as lithotrophy), and <b>heterotrophy,</b> and form robust, diverse communities. Most psychrophiles are bacteria or archaea, and psychrophily is present in widely diverse microbial lineages within those broad groups. Some groups of psychrophilic fungi live in oxygen-poor areas under alpine snowfields. A further group of eukaryotic cold-adapted organisms are snow algae, which can cause watermelon snow. Some multicellular eukaryotes can also be metabolically active at negative temperatures, such as some conifers that can still photosynthesize when it is several degrees under 0 °C (conifers are often more cold-resistant than broadleaf trees). Psychrophiles are interesting enzymes that are very useful models in the research of proteins. Psychrophiles are characterized by lipid cell membranes chemically resistant to the stiffening caused by extreme cold, and often create protein 'antifreezes' to keep their internal space liquid and protect their DNA even in temperatures below water's freezing point. A commonly accepted hypothesis for this cold adaptation is the activity-stability-flexibility relationship, suggesting that psychrophilic enzymes increase the flexibility of their structure to compensate for the 'freezing effect' of cold habitats.|$|E

Significant main and interactive effects of oxygen, <b>heterotrophy</b> and light on calcification rates were found (three-way factorial repeated measures ANOVA, p< 0. 05). Light and dark calcification rates of unfed corals were severely affected by hypoxia and hyperoxia, with optimal rates at 110 % saturation. Light calcification rates of fed corals exhibited a similar trend, with highest rates at 150 % saturation. In contrast, dark calcification rates of fed corals were close to zero under all oxygen saturations. We conclude that oxygen exerts a strong control over light and dark calcification rates of corals, and propose that in situ calcification rates are highly dynamic. Nevertheless, the inhibitory effect of <b>heterotrophy</b> on dark calcification appears to be oxygen-independent. We hypothesize that dark calcification is impaired during zooplankton feeding by a temporal decrease of the pH and aragonite saturation state of the calcifying medium, caused by increased respiration rates. This may invoke a transient reallocation of metabolic energy to soft tissue growth and organic matrix synthesis.

40|$|International audienceResults {{from the}} DUNE {{experiments}} {{reported in this}} issue have shown that nutrient input from dust deposition in large mesocosms deployed in the western Mediterranean induced a response of the microbial food web, with an increase of primary production rates (PP), bacterial respiration rates (BR), as well as autotrophic and heterotrophic biomasses.

In this study we used a simple microbial food web model, inspired from previous modelling studies, to explore how C, N and P stoichiometric mismatch between producers and consumers along the food chain can influence the dynamics and the trophic status of the ecosystem. Attention was paid to the mechanisms involved in the balance between net autotrophy vs. net <b>heterotrophy.</b> Although the model was kept simple, predicted changes in biomass and PP were qualitatively consistent with observations from DUNE experiments. Additionally, the model shed light on how ecological stoichiometric mismatch between producers and consumers can control food web dynamics and drive the system toward net <b>heterotrophy.</b> In the model, net <b>heterotrophy</b> was notably driven by the parameterisation of the production and excretion of extra DOC from phytoplankton under nutrient-limited conditions. This mechanism yielded to high C : P and C : N ratios of the DOM pool, and subsequent postabsorptive respiration of C by bacteria. The model also predicted that nutrient inputs from dust strengthened the net <b>heterotrophy</b> of the system; a pattern also observed during two of the three DUNE experiments (P and Q).

Molecular mechanisms by which <b>heterotrophy</b> sustains metabolism in stressed corals remain elusive. Here for the first time, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, we identified specific genes expressed in heterotrophically fed and unfed colonies of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata, maintained under normal and light-stress conditions. Physiological parameters and gene expression profiling demonstrated that fed corals better resisted stress than unfed ones by exhibiting less oxidative damage and protein degradation. Processes affected in light-stressed unfed corals (HLU), were related to energy and metabolite supply, carbohydrate biosynthesis, ion and nutrient transport, oxidative stress, Ca 2 þ homeostasis, metabolism and calcification (carbonic anhydrases, calcium-transporting ATPase, bone morphogenetic proteins). Two genes (cp 2 u 1 and cp 1 a 2), which belong to the cytochrome P 450 superfamily, were also upregu-lated 249 and 10 times, respectively, in HLU corals. In contrast, few of these processes were affected in light-stressed fed corals (HLF) because feeding supplied antioxidants and energetic molecules, which help repair oxidative damage.

While heterotrophic cells produced bicarbonate and CO 2 aq, mixotrophy cells produced bicarbonate alone as predominant metabolite. Experiments with singly (13) C-labelled acetate ((13) CH(3) -COOH or CH(3) -(13) COOH) supported that both the (13) C nuclei give rise to bicarbonate and CO 2 (aq). The observed metabolite(s) upon further incubation led to the production of starch and triacylglycerol (TAG) in mixotrophy, whereas in <b>heterotrophy</b> the TAG production was minimal with substantial accumulation of glycerol and starch. Prolonged incubation up to eight days, without the addition of fresh acetate, led to an increased TAG production at the expense of bicarbonate, akin to that of nitrogen-starvation. However, such TAG production was substantially high in mixotrophy as compared to that in <b>heterotrophy.</b> Addition of mitochondrial un-coupler blocked the formation of bicarbonate and CO 2 (aq) in heterotrophic cells, even though acetate uptake ensued. Addition of PSII-inhibitor to mixotrophic cells resulted in partial conversion of bicarbonate into CO 2 (aq), which were found to be in equilibrium. In an independent experiment, we have monitored assimilation of bicarbonate via photoautotrophy and found that the cells indeed produce starch and TAG at a much faster rate as compared to that in mixotrophy and <b>heterotrophy.</b> Further, we noticed that the accumulation of starch is relatively more as compared to TAG.
