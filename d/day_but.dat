30|$|In addition, {{all those}} {{substances}} are identified, which miss {{one of the}} criteria by up to 10 % or in other words fulfil one of the criteria to more than 90 % but less than 100 %. This means that those compounds which miss the vP criterion by up to 10 % are a sub-group of the substances which are P, i.e. half-life of degradation in fresh water > 54 <b>days</b> <b>but</b> ≤ 60 <b>days</b> or in sediment > 162 <b>days</b> <b>but</b> ≤ 180 <b>days</b> or in soil > 162 <b>days</b> <b>but</b> ≤ 180 <b>days.</b> Consequently, those compounds which miss the P criterion by up to 10 % are a sub-group of the substances which are ¬P, i.e. half-life of degradation in fresh water > 36 <b>days</b> <b>but</b> ≤ 40 <b>days</b> or in sediment > 108 <b>days</b> <b>but</b> ≤ 120 <b>days</b> or in soil > 108 <b>days</b> <b>but</b> ≤ 120 <b>days.</b> The same approach is applied for the bioaccumulation potential, i.e. those compounds which miss the vB criterion by up to 10 % are a sub-group of the substances which are B (BCF > 4, 500 L kg- 1 but ≤ 5, 000 L kg- 1), and those compounds which miss the B criterion by up to 10 % are a sub-group of the substances which are ¬B (BCF > 1, 800 L kg- 1 but ≤ 2, 000 L kg- 1).|$|R

5|$|England {{dominated}} the second Test, {{largely due to}} the bowling of Briggs. Batting first, England scored 292 runs, of which Abel contributed 120.
