The DCT coefficients of the displaced frame difference (DFD) for <b>inter-blocks</b> or the intensity for intra-blocks are partitioned into a base layer and one or more enhancement layers, thus, producing an embedded bitstream. Subsets of this bitstream can be transmitted with increasing video quality {{as measured by the}} SNR.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{describes}} the signaling and interlocking system and shows how the trains are controlled with signal devices. Four types of controlling the trains are described: verbal communication between two dispatchers of neighbour stations, the block system, automatic line block and the remote traffic control centre (tele-command centre) with a possibility of ETCS (European train control system) upgrade, which allows the interoperability of the rail network. This is followed by the explanation of how to determine the time when a certain rail line segment is occupied and show how to calculate the blocking time by using Code UIC 406. The empirical part discusses Ljubljana–Kranj route, which forms a part of the tenth corridor, and furthermore explains, how the location of the train braking on the track changes and {{takes a look at the}} capacity utilization in case of upgrading conventional railway signaling and <b>inter-blocking</b> system with the European train control system.

30|$|Another {{improvement}} to BM 3 D is, namely, BM 3 D shape adaptive {{principal component}} analysis (BM 3 D-SAPCA) [38], by combining {{the advantages of the}} SA-BM 3 D and the {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) methods. Note that this improved method changed DCT in SA-BM 3 D to PCA, by using eigenvalue decomposition of each image patch to get a PCA basis for selecting some eigenvectors with eigenvalues greater than a certain threshold (determined by noise level) as principal components. As a result, the whole 3 D transform is changed to a new kind of separable transform combinations, i.e., performing PCA on each image patch, and then performing one-dimensional orthogonal transform on the third dimension. BM 3 D-SAPCA achieved better denoising results than the classical BM 3 D and SA-BM 3 D, by preserving better image details and introducing less image artifacts. Besides, Chen et al. [39] proposed a bounded BM 3 D, which has a little bit improvement on BM 3 D only for relatively higher noise level. Zhong et al. [40] proposed modified BM 3 D algorithm for image denoising using non-local centralization prior; this method removed the 1 D transform <b>inter-blocks</b> and utilized a prior to improve the BM 3 D method; however, the denoised results are only partially better than BM 3 D method.|$|R
40|$|Effects of Bambara nut and cowpea {{planted with}} maize at {{different}} times on nutritive quality of maize forage were investigated. The study was {{laid out in a}} Completely Randomized Design and the treatments were combination of crop types (Bambara nut-maize (MB) and Cowpea-maize (MC) and planting times of legumes (2 wks before planting maize, 2 WBPM and 2 wks after planting maize, 2 WAPM), and sole maize (as control). An experimental field measuring 19 m � 11 m was divided into 3 replicates; each replicate was sub-divided into 5 plots of dimension 3 m 2 each, with 1 m and 2 m inter-plots and <b>inter-blocks</b> spacing respectively. Maize forage samples were harvested on each plot at 10 wks after planting, oven-dried, milled and analyzed to evaluate the chemical composition, mineral composition, in vitro gas production and post-incubation characteristics. Results revealed significant differences (P< 0. 05) among treatments with the highest (95. 00 %) and least DM (92. 12 %) values were recorded for MB 2 WBPM and MC 2 WAPM, respectively. CP values ranged from 10. 36 % in MB 2 WBPM to 15. 67 % in MC 2 WBPM but not significantly different from 14. 19 % recorded for sole maize. Ash ranged from 7. 00 % in MB 2 WAPM to 10. 00 % in sole maize. MC 2 WBPM and sole maize had the highest (50. 63 %) and least (38. 40 %) in ADF content (P< 0. 05). ADL value (7. 25 %) observed in MB 2 WBPM was the highest, compared to the least (5. 00 %) in sole maize. Sole maize recorded the least (40. 40 %) and highest (25. 91 %) cellulose and hemicellulose contents, respectively while MC 2 WAPM had the highest (50. 88 %) and lowest (15. 80 %) values for cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively. Ca content (4. 55 g/kg) of MB 2 WAPM was lower than the other treatments. P content ranged from 3. 54 g/kg in MB 2 WAPM to 12. 02 g/kg in MC 2 WAPM. Gas production rates only varied (P< 0. 05) at the 3 rd, 6 th, 24 th and 48 th hours of incubation. MB 2 WBPM yielded highest values of short chain fatty acids (0. 09 �mol) and metabolizable energy (3. 08 MJ/kg) while MB 2 WAPM recorded the lowest values (0. 01 �mol and 2. 57 MJ/kg) for the same parameters. MC 2 WAPM and MB 2 WAPM produced highest values of OMD (31. 60 %) and DMD (37. 50 %), respectively. In conclusion, sole maize had desirable CP, Ca, P with least fibre constituents. OMD and DMD of the sole maize were not significantly different from most of the legume mixtures. Better SCFA and ME also make MB 2 WBPM treatment desirable...|$|R

The units are interconnected to each other using dedicated <b>inter-block</b> communication links.

50|$|In {{a typical}} format, data is written to tape in blocks with <b>inter-block</b> gaps between them, and each block {{is written in}} a single {{operation}} with the tape running continuously during the write. However, since the rate at which data is written or read to the tape drive is not deterministic, a tape drive usually has to cope with a difference between the rate at which data goes on and off the tape and the rate at which data is supplied or demanded by its host.|$|E
50|$|Various {{methods have}} been used alone and in {{combination}} {{to cope with this}} difference. The tape drive can be stopped, backed up, and restarted (known as shoe-shining, because of increased wear of both medium and head). A large memory buffer can be used to queue the data. The host can assist this process by choosing appropriate block sizes to send to the tape drive. There is a complex tradeoff between block size, the size of the data buffer in the record/playback deck, the percentage of tape lost on <b>inter-block</b> gaps, and read/write throughput.|$|E
50|$|Quantization is {{performed}} by taking {{each of the}} 64 frequency values of the DCT block, dividing them by the frame-level quantizer, then dividing them by their corresponding values in the quantization matrix. Finally, the result is rounded down. This significantly reduces, or completely eliminates, the information in some frequency components of the picture. Typically, high frequency information is less visually important, and so high frequencies are much more strongly quantized (drastically reduced). MPEG-1 actually uses two separate quantization matrices, one for intra-blocks (I-blocks) and one for <b>inter-block</b> (P- and B- blocks) so quantization of different block types can be done independently, and so, more effectively.|$|E
50|$|The X-Pol {{theory is}} based on a {{hierarchy}} of three levels of approximations: (1) the construction of the total molecular wave function as a Hartree product of the antisymmetric wave functions of individual blocks, (2) the treatment of the <b>inter-block</b> Coulomb interactions, formally the two-electron four-center integrals, by the use of a classical multipole approximation of the external electrostatic potential, and (3) an approximate representation of the short-range exchange repulsion and long-range dispersion interactions. The X-Pol method is a general theoretical approach such that the individual subsystems can be treated by a single Slater determinant wave function method at the ab initio or semiempirical level, a multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) or configuration interaction (CI) method, a perturbation theory, and density functional theory.|$|E
50|$|Several {{algorithms}} {{have been}} proposed for selecting tag SNPs. The first approach {{was based on the}} measure of goodness of SNP sets and searched for SNP subsets that are small but attain high value of the defined measure. Examining every SNP subset to find good ones is computationally feasible only for small data sets. Another approach uses principal component analysis (PCA) to find subsets of SNPs capturing majority of the data variance. A sliding windows method is employed to repeatedly apply PCA to short chromosomal regions. This reduces the data produced and also does not require exponential search time. Yet it is not feasible to apply the PCA method to large chromosomal data sets as it is computationally complex. The most commonly used approach, block-based method, exploits the principle of linkage disequilibrium observed within haplotype blocks. Several algorithms have been devised to partition chromosomal regions into haplotype blocks which are based on haplotype diversity, LD, four-gamete test and information complexity and tag SNPs are selected from all SNPs that belong to that block. The main presumption in this algorithm is that the SNPs are biallelic. The main drawback is that the definition of blocks is not always straightforward. Even though there is a list of criteria for forming the haplotype blocks, there is no consensus on the same. Also, local correlations based selection of tag SNPs ignores <b>inter-block</b> correlations.|$|E

40|$|The {{graphics}} {{processing unit}} (GPU) has evolved from a ﬁxed-function processor with programmable stages to a programmable processor with many ﬁxed-function components that deliver massive parallelism. Consequently, GPUs increasingly {{take advantage of the}} programmable processing power for general-purpose, non-graphics tasks, i. e., general-purpose computation on {{graphics processing unit}}s (GPGPU). However, while the GPU can massively accelerate data parallel (or task parallel) applications, the lack of explicit support for <b>inter-block</b> communication on the GPU hampers its broader adoption as a general-purpose computing device. <b>Inter-block</b> communication on the GPU occurs via global memory and then requires a barrier synchronization across the blocks, i. e., <b>inter-block</b> GPU communication via barrier synchronization. Currently, such synchronization is only available via the CPU, which in turn, incurs signiﬁcant overhead. Thus, we seek to propose more efﬁcient methods for <b>inter-block</b> communication. To systematically address this problem, we ﬁrst present a performance model for the execution of kernels on GPUs. This performance model partitions the kernel’s execution time into three phases: (1) kernel launch to the GPU, (2) computation on the GPU, and (3) <b>inter-block</b> GPU communication via barrier synchronization. Using three well-known algorithms — FFT, dynamic programming, and bitonic sort — we show that the latter phase, i. e., <b>inter-block</b> GPU communication, can consume more than 50 % of the overall execution time. Therefore, we propose three new approaches to <b>inter-block</b> GPU communication via barrier synchronization, all of which run only on the GPU: GPU simple synchronization, GPU tree-based synchronization, and GPU lock-free synchronization. We then evaluate the efficacy of each of these approaches in isolation via a micro-benchmark as well as integrated with the three aforementioned algorithms. For the micro-benchmark, the experimental results show that our GPU lock-free synchronization performs 7. 8 times faster than CPU explicit synchronization and 3. 7 times faster than CPU implicit synchronization. When integrated with the FFT, dynamic programming, and bitonic sort algorithms, our GPU lock-free synchronization improves the performance by 8 %, 24 %, and 39 %, respectively, when compared to the more efﬁcient CPU implicit synchronization...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the estimation problem for a proper block design with recovery of <b>inter-block</b> information for which numerous procedures are available in the literature with very little known about their relative merits. A desirable property, termed here as goodness, of any such procedure is the natural requirement that it should not, under any circumstances, lead to loss of efficiency compared to the usual procedure without recovery of <b>inter-block</b> information. So far, this has been theoretically investigated only {{in the case of the}} Yates-Rao procedure and yielded fragmentary results. The purpose of the present paper is to supercede these results by providing the necessary and sufficient condition for goodness of the Yates-Rao procedure in the case of any proper block design excluding the rare cases where the application of the procedure without truncation of the estimated variance ratio can give rise to a negative weight for the <b>inter-block</b> estimator. 1...|$|E

The cooperative transmission is implemented in cycles of three time slots. During each slot, a user transmits either his data, or a weighted mixture of his data and the data that he received in previous slots of the same cycle. The weights are obtained in an optimum fashion, so that a user that faces deep fading on certain subcarriers can benefit from the other user&# 39;s channel, without taxing significantly the resources of that user. It is shown that the proposed scheme achieves the maximum available diversity for both users (full cooperation), or for the weak user (half cooperation) without {{increasing the number of}} antennas needed as compared to an energy-equivalent noncooperative OFDMA system that also uses <b>inter-block</b> precoding.

Interblock communication on the GPU occurs via global memory and then requires barrier synchronization across the blocks, i. e., <b>inter-block</b> GPU communication via barrier synchronization.

For the microbenchmark, the experimental results show that our GPU lockfree synchronization performs 8. 4 times faster than CPU explicit synchronization and 4. 0 times faster than CPU implicit synchronization. When integrated with the FFT, dynamic programming, and bitonic sort algorithms, our GPU lock-free synchronization further improves performance by 10 %, 26 %, and 40 %, respectively, and ultimately delivers an overall speed-up of 70 x, 13 x, and 24 x, respectively.
