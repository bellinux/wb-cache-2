50|$|<b>Jentink's</b> <b>duikers</b> live {{mainly in}} very thick rainforest, where they eat fruit, flowers, and leaves which have {{fallen from the}} canopy, as well as stems of seedlings, roots, and, to the {{annoyance}} of local farmers, palm nuts, mangos, and cocoa pods. They are nocturnal and shelter during the day in dense thickets, or buttress roots, apparently in pairs. <b>Jentink's</b> <b>duikers</b> are reported to be territorial animals, and when frightened, will run very quickly, but wear themselves out easily.|$|R

50|$|Taï National Park (Parc National de Taï) is a {{national}} park in Côte d'Ivoire containing {{one of the last}} areas of primary rainforest in West Africa. It was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1982 due to the breadth of its flora and fauna. Five mammal species of the Taï National Park are on the Red List of Threatened Species: pygmy hippopotamus, olive colobus monkeys, leopards, chimpanzees and <b>Jentink's</b> <b>duiker.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gladys Porter Zoo is a zoological and botanical park {{located in}} Brownsville, Texas. The zoo officially opened on September 3, 1971, and {{currently}} averages 375,000 visitors annually. Situated on 31 acre, the zoo houses about 400 animal species (including 47 endangered species) and over 250 tropical and neo-tropical species and subspecies.

5000|$|The {{scientific}} name of <b>Jentink's</b> <b>duiker</b> is Caphalophus jentinki. It is classified under the genus Cephalophus {{and the family}} Bovidae. It was first described by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas in 1892 in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. The generic name probably comes from {{the combination of the}} New Latin word cephal, meaning head, and the Greek word lophos, meaning crest. The word [...] "duiker" [...] comes from the Afrikaans word duik, or Dutch dūken - both mean [...] "diver".|$|R
50|$|A 2001 phylogenetic study divided Cephalophus {{into three}} {{distinct}} lineages: the giant duikers, east African red duikers and west African red duikers. Abbott's duiker (C. spadix), the bay <b>duiker</b> (C. dorsalis), <b>Jentink's</b> <b>duiker</b> (C. jentinki) and the yellow-backed duiker (C. silvicultor) {{were classified as}} the giant duikers. The east African red duikers include the black-fronted duiker (C. nigrifrons), Harvey's duiker (C. harveyi), red-flanked duiker (C. rufilatus), red forest duiker (C. natalensis), Ruwenzori duiker and white-bellied duiker (C. leucogaster). The third group, the west African red duikers, comprises the black duiker (C. niger), Ogilby's duiker, Peters's duiker (C. callipygus) and Weyns's duiker (C. weynsi). However, the status of two species, Aders' duiker and Zebra duiker, remained dubious.|$|R
50|$|Whereas Büttikofer’s first {{expedition}} {{was funded}} by Dr. Schlegel, his second was largely financed by himself, on an unpaid leave of absence, with costs to be recuperated by selling specimens to the Leiden museum and others. As a co-worker, he recruited a Swiss boyhood acquaintance and fellow avid hunter, Mr. Franz Xaver Stampfli (1847-1903)of Solothurn, Switzerland, {{who had come to}} visit him while intending to emigrate to the United States. Stampfli travelled to Liberia in 1884 while Büttikofer continued his recovery. During his stay in the general area of the Junk River, Stampfli discovered an antelope species entirely new to science, the <b>Jentink’s</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus jentinki), but had to return for convalescence in the spring of 1886.|$|R
5000|$|Duikers {{are very}} {{primitive}} antelope which diverged early in bovid history. The genus Cephalophus contains 16 African bovids {{of which the}} yellow-backed duiker is the largest. Cephalophus refers to the long crest of hair found between their horns. [...] The yellow-backed duiker is most {{closely related to the}} Abbot's <b>duiker</b> and the <b>Jentink's</b> <b>duiker.</b> These three form the large or [...] "giant" [...] duikers group. The yellow-backed duiker belongs to a group of morphologically, ecologically, and behaviorally convergent mammals which also includes some artiodactyls, rodents, and lagomorphs which exhibit [...] "microcursorial adaptive syndrome." [...] This means they have tropical to subtropical distribution along with small body size, swift, cursorial locomotion, browse on high energy food, have precocial young, and a [...] "facultatively monogamous social structure." ...|$|R
5000|$|Antelope have a {{wide variety}} of coverings, though most have a dense coat of short fur. In most species, the coat (pelage) is some {{variation}} of a brown colour (or several shades of brown), often with white or pale underbodies. Exceptions include the zebra-marked zebra duiker, the grey, black, and white <b>Jentink's</b> <b>duiker,</b> and the black lechwe. Most of the [...] "spiral-horned" [...] antelopes have pale, vertical stripes on their backs. Many desert and semidesert species are particularly pale, some almost silvery or whitish (e.g. Arabian oryx); the beisa and southern oryxes have gray and black pelages with vivid black-and-white faces. Common features of various gazelles are white rumps, which flash a warning to others when they run from danger, and dark stripes midbody (the latter feature is also shared by the springbok and beira). The springbok also has a pouch of white, brushlike hairs running along its back, which opens up when the animal senses danger, causing the dorsal hairs to stand on end.|$|R
50|$|Also found are two bats, Buettikofer's epauletted {{fruit bat}} (Epomops buettikoferi) and Aellen's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros marisae), Pel's flying {{squirrel}} (Anomalurus peli), giant pangolin (Manis gigantea), tree pangolin (Manis tricuspis) and long-tailed pangolin (Manis tetradactyla), Liberian mongoose (Liberiictus kuhni), African golden cat (Profelis aurata), leopard (Panthera pardus), African forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), which in 2001 numbered only about 100 {{individuals in the}} south of the park compared to some 1,800 in 1979, red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), giant forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni ivoriensis), dwarf or pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) numbered at around 500 in 1996 {{is one of the few}} viable populations remaining, water chevrotain (Hyemoschus aquaticus), bongo (Tragelaphus euryceros), African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus) and an exceptional variety of forest <b>duikers</b> including <b>Jentink's</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus jentinki), banded or zebra duiker (Cephalophus zebra), Maxwell's duiker (Cephalophus maxwelii), Ogilby's duiker (Cephalophus ogilbyi), black duiker (Cephalophus niger), bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis), yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus sylvicultor) and the royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus). Forest rodents include the rusty-bellied brush-furred rat (Lophuromys sikapusi), the Edward's swamp rat (Malacomys edwardsi) and the woodland dormouse (Graphiurus murinus). Also recorded in the park is Stochomys defua, which is characteristic of secondary forest.|$|R
5000|$|In 1875, {{he became}} {{curator at the}} Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (today Naturalis) in Leiden. In 1884 he {{followed}} Hermann Schlegel {{as director of the}} museum and as editor of the journal Notes from the Leyden Museum. In 1895 he was president of the 3rd International Congress of Zoology in Leiden and he was among the founding members of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature besides Philip Lutley Sclater, Raphaël Blanchard, Julius Victor Carus, and Charles Wardell Stiles. Jentink's main research field was the taxonomy of mammals, where he described several marsupial, bat, and rodent taxa. In 1886, he described the guenon species Cercopithecus signatus (sometimes known as Jentink's guenon) on the basis of one deceased specimen which was obtained by the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie from the Diergaarde Blijdorp in Rotterdam in 1877. [...] The original provenance of this species is still unknown but alternatively it might be possible that it is a hybrid between the greater spot-nosed monkey and the moustached guenon. Jentink published the Catalogue ostéologique des mammifères (1887), the Catalogue systématique des mammifères (1892) and Mammals Collected by the Members of the Humboldt Bay and the Merauke River Expeditions:Nova Guinea (1907). Oldfield Thomas named the <b>Jentink's</b> <b>duiker</b> (1892) and the Jentink's squirrel (1887) in honor of Fredericus Anna Jentink.|$|R
40|$|Duikers Cephalophus spp. are an {{important}} source of food and income throughout the forest regions of Central and West Africa, and current levels of hunting are probably unsustainable, at least near large settlements. The direct effects of hunting consist of two main aspects: overexploitation of target species, and incidental hunting of non-targeted or rare species because hunting is largely non-selective. There are many methodological and practical problems to a technical approach to overexploitation, and there are increasing calls for alternative measures such as zoning and enforcement of exclusive local resource rights. There is also increasing recognition of the need to ensure that hunting is more selective. This paper reviews current knowledge of duiker ecology and niche separation in order to assess likely indirect effects of these measures on different species. The main factor separating fundamental niches of sympatric species is body size, which limits dietary choice. Additional descriptive factors include anatomical features - particularly the jaw musculature and size of mouth and neck; activity patterns and habitat preferences within closed canopy forest. However, there is wide overlap of diets and broad tolerance of habitat disturbance by most species, and therefore niche overlap and interspecific competition may be high. In the Upper Guinean forest in West Africa, but not in Central Africa, differential use of closed canopy forest and secondary vegetation also appears to be {{an important}} factor in niche separation; three pairs of species seem to be separated primarily by this factor. Distributional variations in habitat use suggest that at least {{in the case of the}} yellow-backed duiker and the endangered <b>Jentink's</b> <b>duiker,</b> the separation is due to competition rather than to fundamental niche constraints. Selective hunting or zoning will thus have indirect effects on non-targeted species through changes in competitive dominance in different habitats...|$|R
