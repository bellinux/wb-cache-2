Her Dhangar father (sometimes named Yamu) is the chief of shepherds, who owns nine lakh sheep and goats, nine lakh lambs and numerous barren ones. Yamu is said to have prayed for a child and finds Banai in a box. A virgin ewe is said to have fed Banai her milk, as Yamu does not have a wife and does not know how to feed the infant.

The influence of <b>grazing</b> practices on dung beetle communities and services remains largely unknown. Our first study investigated dung beetle activity across different cattle <b>grazing</b> practices to determine how <b>grazing</b> might influence dung beetle abundance and diversity. Dung beetle populations were monitored throughout the <b>grazing</b> season on pastures that were <b>grazed</b> under various practices: non-grazed/hay, continuous <b>grazing,</b> low-stocking rotational <b>grazing,</b> and high-stocking (mob) rotational <b>grazing.</b> Results from this study showed significantly higher dung beetle diversity on pastures exposed to rotational <b>grazing</b> practices compared to continuous <b>grazing</b> or no <b>grazing.</b> In some cases, dung beetle abundance and species richness were significantly greater on pastures that were <b>grazed</b> through high-stocking rotational <b>grazing</b> compared to low-stocking rotational or continuous <b>grazing</b> treatments. Based on these data, rotational cattle <b>grazing</b> may favor the colonization of dung beetles on rangeland, regardless of stocking density. Our second study investigated whether dung beetles exhibit preferences for dung from cattle exposed to different <b>grazing</b> practices.

The percent weight remaining in the stubble of a <b>grazed</b> plant was estimated using a second-order polynomial equation relating cumulative percent plant height to cumulative percent plant weight. A modified bootstrap analysis was used due to the autocorrelated nature of these data. These equations were used to estimate the percent biomass <b>grazed</b> from individual plants.

The females form groups of five to 12 animals, with four generations of young in the group. Females fight for dominance over the herd. Sparring between males and females is common.
