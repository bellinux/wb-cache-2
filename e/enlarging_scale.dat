40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} obtained {{results of}} self compacting concretes with various compositions with focus on basic characteristics development. Firstly the fresh concrete properties are summed and self compactness classes are categorised and subsequently {{the values of}} compressive strength, static and dynamic modulus of elasticity of hardened concretes are compared. All the stated parameters were monitored during different ages of the concrete and therefore they provide a view of its development in time. With still <b>enlarging</b> <b>scale</b> of concrete types and development of their application {{it is necessary to}} monitor common parameters which due to the application of new concepts in raw material compositions and use of higher amounts of additives may notably differ compared to applied orthodox concrete parameters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — During {{the past}} few years much effort has been put into {{developing}} interoperable grid models suitable of defining a decentralized control setting. Such environments may define new rules and actions to internal Virtual Organisation (VO) members and therefore posing new challenges towards to an extended cooperation model of grids. Particularly, VO members ’ knowledge may be expressed in the form of intelligent agents thus providing a more autonomous solution of communicating members. Herein we present a mobile agent middleware for Grid interoperable infrastructures. Facing the <b>enlarging</b> <b>scale</b> of Grid, the proposed middleware aims to extend the knowledge of a specific neighbouring of Grid members (VO) in relation to the addresses and the physical resources of known and unknown nodes which may join the Grid VO. The internal data are structured in a rational sequence and stored within a public profile of each member called metadata snapshot profile. The middleware is designed by employing the Java Agent Development (JADE) framework in which mobile agents are travelling throughout the domain and by collecting and updating internal data they extend the size of the VO. The interoperable standard is achieved by using the Critical Friends Community (CFC) model, as the mean to fulfil the inter-cooperation model...|$|E

40|$|Through {{analyzing}} the economic profits of rural cooperative economic organizations, the following conclusions are obtained. The rural cooperative economic organizations {{can get the}} economic profits which are {{in accordance with the}} demands of market-oriented economy. The rural cooperative economic organizations can benefit from sharing the knight service provided by the government; reducing and avoiding various kinds of risks in operation; applying the agricultural technology and standardization production. Besides, the organizations can share the profits bought along by the standardization production of agricultural production and their members can enjoy the profits bought by socialized service system. In addition, the rural cooperative economic organizations can enjoy the profits produced by the agricultural management integration strategy. What’ more, they can increase profits by reducing the transaction costs; <b>enlarging</b> <b>scale</b> and enjoying the brand advantages. The analyses of the costs of the development of rural cooperative economic organizations mainly include the organizing costs, operation costs, restriction costs and cooperation costs. We think that the slow development of rural cooperative economic organizations is caused by their high operation cost and the impediment of external environment. In the end, the countermeasures on strengthening the research on the theory, promotion, education and training of rural economic cooperative organizations and intensifying the supports on the policies of rural economic cooperative organizations are put forward.

25|$|Naultinus {{species and}} indeed, New Zealand lizards in general, are very {{conservative}} in their evolutionary development of scales. Most have the standard gecko-type scales which {{are small and}} granular, giving the skin a dull, velvety appearance. The two exceptions to this rule are two South Island members of the genus; the rough gecko (N. rudis) and, to a lesser extent, the Marlborough green gecko (N. manukanus). The rough gecko has <b>enlarged</b> conical <b>scales</b> which are both significantly wider and which protrude much further from the body than ordinary <b>scales.</b> These <b>enlarged</b> <b>scales</b> are {{scattered all over the}} body except for the underside of the animal. The Marlborough green gecko also has <b>enlarged</b> <b>scales,</b> but they are confined to the dorsal, pelvic area, and sometimes even in rows {{along the side of the}} animal.
