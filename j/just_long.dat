5|$|The {{airfield}} {{served as}} an alternative destination for Imperial Airways when Croydon was fogbound. The runway was <b>just</b> <b>long</b> enough for this purpose. Using Penshurst as an alternate destination caused delays to the passengers as there were no Customs facilities. On 18 February 1932, both Croydon and Penshurst were fogbound, and Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXE Hengist diverted to Heston Aerodrome. As Customs facilities existed there, passengers {{were on their way}} in 10 minutes, as opposed to the three hour or longer delay when using Penshurst. The practice of having a Customs Officer attend Penshurst on a daily basis was instigated, but it was discontinued in February 1935. On 24 October 1932, a German and a French airliner diverted to Penshurst due to smog over London.|$|E
5|$|During the passage, Nelson {{captured}} the Spanish frigate Santa Sabina and placed Lieutenants Jonathan Culverhouse and Thomas Hardy {{in charge of}} the captured vessel, taking the Spanish captain on board Minerve. Santa Sabina {{was part of a larger}} Spanish force, and the following morning two Spanish ships-of-the-line and a frigate were sighted closing fast. Unable to outrun them, Nelson initially determined to fight but Culverhouse and Hardy raised the British colours and sailed northeast, drawing the Spanish ships after them until being captured, giving Nelson the opportunity to escape. Nelson went on to rendezvous with the British fleet at Elba, where he spent Christmas. He sailed for Gibraltar in late January, and after learning that the Spanish fleet had sailed from Cartagena, stopped <b>just</b> <b>long</b> enough to collect Hardy, Culverhouse, and the rest of the prize crew captured with Santa Sabina, before pressing on through the straits to join Sir John Jervis off Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps Szigeti's most {{fruitful}} musical partnership {{was with}} his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, {{was one of a}} pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work <b>just</b> <b>long</b> enough to fill both sides of a 78rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience. Szigeti came to his friend's aid by securing donations from the American Society of Composers and Publishers to pay for Bartók's medical treatment, and then, together with conductor and compatriot Fritz Reiner, persuaded Serge Koussevitzky to commission from Bartók what eventually became his much-beloved Concerto for Orchestra. The work's success brought Bartók some measure of financial security and provided him with a much-needed emotional boost.|$|E

On the strength of a formal defence commitment between the two countries, Kuwait appealed for help from Britain. A force was assembled (Operation Vantage) which included armour, artillery, commando, and infantry battalions, one being the 2nd Battalion, based in Cyprus. The battalion was not involved in any combat and remained <b>just</b> <b>long</b> enough for the Arab League to take over from them. All British forces had withdrawn by 19 October.|$|E

25|$|This {{version of}} Life took sides in {{politics}} and international affairs, and published fiery pro-American editorials. Mitchell and Gibson were incensed when Germany attacked Belgium; in 1914 they undertook a campaign to push the United States into the war. Mitchell's seven years studying at Paris art schools made him partial to the French; there was no unbiased coverage of the war. Gibson drew the Kaiser as a bloody madman, insulting Uncle Sam, sneering at crippled soldiers, and shooting Red Cross nurses. Mitchell lived <b>just</b> <b>long</b> enough to see Life crusade result in the U.S. declaration of war in 1917.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{this lack}} of large game, the Taíno people became very skilled fishermen. One {{technique}} was to hook a remora, {{also known as a}} suckerfish, to a line secured to a canoe and wait for the fish to attach itself to a larger fish or even a sea turtle. Once this happened, men would jump into the water and bring in their assisted catch. Another method used by the Taínos was to take shredded stems and roots of poisonous senna shrubs and throw them into nearby streams or rivers. Upon eating the bait, the fish were stunned <b>just</b> <b>long</b> enough to allow the fishermen to gather them in. This poison did not affect the edibility of the fish. Taíno youth, mostly young boys, also collected mussels and oysters in shallow waters and within the mangroves.|$|E
25|$|While Setnakhte's reign {{was still}} {{comparatively}} brief, it was <b>just</b> <b>long</b> {{enough for him}} to stabilize the political situation in Egypt and establish his son, Rameses III, as his successor to the throne of Egypt. The Bakenkhunsu stela reveals that it was Setnakhte who began the construction of a Temple of Amun-Re in Karnak which was eventually completed by his son, Ramesses III. Setnakhte also started work on a tomb, KV11, in the Valley of the Kings, but stopped it when the tombcarvers accidentally broke into the tomb of the Nineteenth Dynasty Pharaoh Amenmesse. Setnakhte then appropriated the tomb of Queen Twosret (KV14), his predecessor, for his own use. Setnakhte's origins are unknown, and he may have been a commoner, although many Egyptologists believe he was related to the previous dynasty, the Nineteenth, through his mother and may thus have been a grandson of Ramesses II. Setnakhte's son and successor, Ramesses III, is regarded as the last great king of the New Kingdom.|$|E
