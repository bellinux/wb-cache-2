40|$|This paper {{describes}} the main international {{trends in the}} demand for and supply and cost of hospital services in the last decades. In almost all countries, including Italy, {{there has been a}} substantial reduction in the total length of hospitalizations, a steady rise in the use of <b>day-hospitals</b> and a widespread reduction in the number and capacity of hospitals. These trends have been reinforced by reforms in payment systems and in particular by the use of case payments for reimbursing hospitals. By international standards, the Italian hospital system is characterized by relatively high fragmentation, a situation partly related to the weakness of nursing and residential care facilities in Italy, with an unbalanced "division of labour" between in-patient and out-patient care. This has consequences both for the unit costs of hospitalization and for the hospital component’s share of total health expenditure (in Italy above the OECD average). The higher cost of hospital services is also a reflection of the composition of hospital staff, which is strongly biased towards the medical component, especially in small hospitals. hospital services, health expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Applying {{the concept}} of healthcare-associated infections to {{hematology}} programs Infection remains {{a major cause of}} mor-bidity and mortality in hematology patients. 1 Most of the previous reports on infections in hematology patients focused on the type and severity of infections rather than on their relationship with healthcare. A few studies have addressed nosocomial infections in hematology. 2 - 4 Many of the infections seen during the course of hemato-logical diseases are related not to the hospi-tal environment, but rather to the effects of treatments. Moreover, healthcare for hema-tology patients has shifted in recent years from the hospital ward to <b>day-hospitals</b> and home-care programs. As a result, many treatment-related infections occur outside the hospital. Therefore, although prevention of cross-transmission is crucial, 5 describing infections in hematology patients from the broader perspective of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) 6 is likely to be more helpful than the narrower nosocomial-infection approach, limited to the hospital stay. There is a grwoing consensus that the HAI approach should be used to develop broader preventive programs than those aimed at preventing nosocomial infections. 6 - 8 As part of the quality-control program in our depart-ment, we investigated the incidence and causes of HAI over a 6 -month period and we evaluated the potential of the HAI rate as an indicator of quality of care. Thus, we looked beyond nosocomial infections to include all infections related to healthcare...|$|R

She returned to Israel in 1968 to establish the first pediatric neurology rehabilitation daycare center {{in the country at}} Bikur Holim Hospital. This center offered both inpatient and outpatient services, and included a rehabilitation kindergarten in which Amir and her team could evaluate interventions over the long-term. In 1979 Amir expanded the center into a full-service diagnostic, evaluation, and intervention day hospital. In its first six years, the <b>day-hospital</b> screened more than 1,000 children.

40|$|During {{the first}} few days after their {{admission}} to a <b>day-hospital,</b> 30 patients with schizophrenic or schizoaffective disorders, their clinical case managers, and the therapeutic team in the <b>day-hospital</b> globally assessed the beginning treatment on visual analog scales (VASs). We investigated whether these assessments predicted observer ratings (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS]) and self-ratings of psychopathology during treatment and at discharge. Positive assessments by patients and caregivers were correlated with lower BPRS scores later on in the course of treatment; only the patients' assessments were good predictors of self-rated outcome.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the short-term effectiveness of an adult <b>day-hospital</b> program that uses a novel approach to delivering nutritional interventions. Methods: Fifty-six adult eating disorder patients of the Sydney West Area Eating Disorders Day Treatment Program participated in the study. Participants completed standardised self-reported questionnaires designed to measure eating disorder symptoms, at the commencement of treatment and after 12 weeks. Results: Participation in <b>day-hospital</b> treatment was associated with increases in weight, reductions in number of binge-eating and purging episodes, and frequency of exercise sessions. Participants also experienced improvements in their eating attitudes, drive for thinness, bulimia, depression and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion: These findings add to the growing body of literature supporting the use of <b>day-hospital</b> programs in the treatment of eating disorders. A number of strategies are suggested for the effective delivery of nutritional interventions in <b>day-hospital</b> programs, such as methods that assist with integrating new information, having an experiential focus and the use of collaborative education processes. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Undernutrition {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} public health problems, affecting more than 900 million individuals around the World. It is responsible for the highest mortality rate in children and has long-lasting physiologic effects, including an increased susceptibility to fat accumulation mostly in the central region of the body, lower fat oxidation, lower resting and postprandial energy expenditure, insulin resistance in adulthood, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and a reduced capacity for manual work, among other impairments. Marked changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system have been described in undernourished experimental animals. Some of these effects seem to be epigenetic, passing on to the next generation. Undernutrition in children has been linked to poor mental development and school achievement as well as behavioural abnormalities. However, there is still a debate in the literature regarding whether some of these effects are permanent or reversible. Stunted children who had experienced catch-up growth had verbal vocabulary and quantitative test scores that did not differ from children who were not stunted. Children treated before 6 years of age in <b>day-hospitals</b> and who recovered in weight and height have normal body compositions, bone mineral densities and insulin production and sensitivity.

40|$|This article aims at {{discussing}} social vulnerability from {{an experiment}} {{carried out with}} users of the <b>Day-Hospital</b> Program. This program, proposed by Sistema Único de Saúde, is a strategy directed towards another social agency of madness, distinct from {{the model of the}} hospice culture, with health practices that may lead to social exclusion and stigma. This study has been structured from a weekly activity developed in a <b>Day-Hospital</b> of a public general hospital in Rio Grande do Sul, through participative observations. The group was constituted as a speech space in which users could talk about daily practices, sharing different ways of thinking and feeling the experience of psychic distress. Aiming at debating upon how the condition of social vulnerability has been produced in carriers of psychic distress, we have considered discursive practices of mental health public policies, from the Psychiatric Reform, as well as the notion of performativity in the production of mental health/disease. The forms these subjects think of and recognize both themselves and the world become visible through certain identity marks that constitute them as mentally ill. Even being a program situated in the field of the Psychiatric Reform, the <b>Day-Hospital</b> is still crossed by meanings from both the hospital-centered psychiatric discourse about madness and the medicamentous therapeutic practice, which have inscribed ways of subjects living mental health/disease with strict possibilities of subjectifying themselves out of this logic...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} the Comprehensive Appropriateness Scale for the Care of Obesity in Rehabilitation (CASCO-R) and to determine the cut-off score for indicating the most appropriate health care setting for patients with obesity. The CASCO-R scale was developed according to the available scientific literature and expertise of an expert panel working for a Consensus document endorsed by the Italian Society of Obesity (SIO) and the Italian Society for the Study of Eating Disorders (SISDCA). 16 Italian centres, specialized in the treatment of obesity, characterised by different settings of care (specialist outpatient service, <b>day-hospital</b> service, intensive inpatient rehabilitation), participated in the study. 449 obese subjects were enrolled in the study (30. 5 % males and 69. 5 % females) : 38. 3 % from outpatient services, 20. 7 % from <b>day-hospital</b> services and 40. 9 % from intensive inpatient rehabilitation units. After 2 -month of treatment, a workload summary sheet, including medical and nursing interventions, number of expert advices and diagnostic procedures, and adverse clinical events (ACEs) was fulfilled for each patient. Statistically significant correlation was found between the CASCO-R scale score, overall workload and ACEs. The CASCO-R scale demonstrated also an excellent performance in terms of internal validity and test-retest analysis. Three total score cut-off have been proposed: > 25 for inpatient intensive rehabilitation; 20 - 25 for <b>day-hospital</b> service; < 20 for outpatient treatment.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{purpose of}} this study was to review the {{literature}} on the effects of <b>day-hospital</b> rehabilitation (DHR) in stroke patients. In The Netherlands DHR concerns a multidisciplinary approach to decrease disability and handicap and to optimize quality of life in an outpatient setting. Data were collected by a computer-aided search of published randomized trials. Fifteen articles re-porting on seven randomized controlled trials were selected. Data extraction included a score for quality of the methods, based on four categories: “study population”, “interventions”, “effects ” and “data presentation and analysis”. To each criterion a weight was attached and the maximum score was set at 100 points. In judging the methodological quality of the selected studies, one study proved insufficient. Of the remaining studies the sum score varied from 34 to 67, with a mean of 50. Comparison of the results of the studies is complicated by different definitions of DHR, different natures of the control group and the study population, and the variety of measure-ment instruments applied. Often instruments were applied whose reliability and validity was not proven. As of now it is not possible to prove that DHR for stroke patients is effective. In future research a standardized definition of DHR, a uniform control group, an acceptable research methodology and adequate measurement instru-ments must be applied.

Materials and MethodsThis was a retrospective study of PtHIV followed in the Bobo Dioulasso university hospital since 2002. The study was based on clinical data recorded using ESOPE software and analysed using Excel and SAS. ResultsA total of 7320 patients have been treated at the centre since 2002; the active file of patients increased from 147 in 2002 to 3684 patients in 2012. Mean age was stable at 38. 4 years and the majority were female (71 %). The delay to initiation of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment after HIV diagnosis decreased from 12. 9 months in 2002 to 7. 2 months in 2012. The percentage of PtHIV lost to follow-up, untreated for HIV and deaths all decreased after 2005. Voluntary anonymous screening and/or an evocative clinical picture were {{the main reasons for}} HIV diagnosis, usually at a late stage (41. 1 % at WHO stage 3). Virological success increased due to a decrease in time to initiation of ARV treatment and an increase in percentage of patients treated (90. 5 % in 2012, mainly with 1 st line drugs). However, there was also a slight increase in the rate of therapeutic failures and the percentage of patients who progressed to 2 nd or 3 rd line-ARVs.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{treatment}} of malignant or benign colorectal pathologies that require more complex management are priorities in tertiary hospitals such as “Hospital das Clínicas ” University of São Paulo Medical Center (HCFMUSP). Therefore, benign, uncomplicated orifice conditions are relegated to second place. The {{number of patients}} with hemorrhoids, perianal fistulas, fissures, condylomas and pilonidal cysts who seek treatment at the HFMUSP is very great, resulting in over-crowding in the outpatient clinics and a long waiting list for recommended surgical treatment (at times over 18 months). The authors describe {{the experience of the}} HCFMUSP over an eight-day period with <b>day-hospital</b> surgery in which 140 patients underwent surgery. Data was prospectively taken on the patients undergoing surgery for benign orifice pathologies including age, sex, diagnosis, surgery performed, immediate and late postoperative complications, and follow-up. 140 patients operated on over eight days were studied. 68 were males (48. 75 %) with ages ranging from 25 to 62 (mean 35. 2 yrs.). Hemorrhoids was the most frequent condition encountered (82 hemorrhoidectomies, 58. 6 %), followed by perineal fistu-la (28 fistula repairs, 20. 0 %). The most common complication was headache secondary to rachianesthesia occurring in 9 patients (6. 4 %). One patient (0. 7 %) developed bleeding immediately PO that required reoperation. Mean follow-up was 104 days. Day-surgery characterized by quality care and low morbidity is feasible in tertiary public hospitals, permitting surgery for benign orifice pathologies on many patients within a short period of time.
