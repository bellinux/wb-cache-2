40|$|The {{growth of}} pharma {{industries}} has slowed {{in recent years}} because of various reasons such as patent <b>expiries,</b> generic competition, drying pipelines, and increasingly stringent regulatory guidelines. Many blockbuster drugs will loose their exclusivity in next 5 years. Therefore, the current economic situation plus the huge generic competition shifted the focus of pharmaceutical companies from the essential medicines to the new business model - niche busters, also called orphan drugs. Orphan drugs may help pharma companies to reduce the impact of revenue loss caused by patent <b>expiries</b> of blockbuster drugs. The new business model of orphan drugs could offer an integrated healthcare solution that enables pharma companies to develop newer areas of therapeutics, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and patient support. Incentives for drug development provided by governments, as well as support from the FDA and EU Commission in special protocols, are a further boost for the companies developing orphan drugs. Although there may still be challenges ahead for the pharmaceutical industry, orphan drugs seem to offer the key to recovery and stability within the market. In our study, we have compared the policies and orphan drug incentives worldwide alongwith the challenges faced by the pharmaceutical companies. Recent developments are seen in orphan drug approval, the various drugs in orphan drug pipeline, and the future prospectives for orphan drugs and diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{preference}} {{between public}} and private negotiations for a buyer who sequentially visits two suppliers is examined. It is shown that the buyer weakly prefers to conduct private negotiations in order to create strategic uncertainty about the trade history.

With complementary goods, strategic uncertainty is valuable to the extent that price coordination becomes a concern for suppliers, which {{is likely to be the}} case when suppliers possess relatively high bargaining powers; price offers have short expiries; and/or goods are weak complements. The effects of mandatory disclosure laws, extended return policies, and purchasing alliance formation on trade efficiency are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{document}} and analyze mortality and morbidity of infants {{admitted to the}} inborn and outborn neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of Cairo University Hospital in Egypt. Methods: Admission data, mode of delivery, gestational age, birth weight, diagnosis, period of stay and outcome (discharge or mortality) were retrospectively collected from January to December 2014 for infants admitted to either {{one of the two}} NICUs of Cairo University Hospital. Results: A total of 1725 babies were admitted, 600 (34. 8 %) were inborn and 1125 (65. 2 %) were outborn. The majority of inborns admitted (72. 5 %) were preterms, compared to a majority of full term admitted outborns (67. 7 %) (p <  0. 001). Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia represented the main cause of admission among outborns. Mortality was significantly higher among inborns (37. 2 %) than outborns (17. 2 %) (p <  0. 0001). Prematurity was {{the leading cause of death}} among inborns (78. 48 %) and was significantly higher than in outborns (57. 22 %) (p <  0. 001), but when compared to admission ratio, premature <b>expiries</b> (especially < 28  weeks of gestation) were high in both NICUs (83. 3 % for inborns and 93. 8 % for outborns) with no statistical difference. Early neonatal deaths (during the first week of life) represented the majority of inborns and outborns <b>expiries</b> (75. 34 % and 63. 92 % respectively). Other causes of death among inborns included septicemia, hypoxic encephalopathy, and congenital malformations whilst among outborns, prematurity and congenital malformations showed the highest case fatality (46. 6 % and 47. 2 % respectively). Conclusion: Prematurity is a significant cause of death in our NICUs.

40|$|The {{existence}} of convenience yield {{has become an}} axiom {{in the analysis of}} intertemporal price relations for commodities. However, the link between the macro level convenience yield concept and the micro-level sell/store decisions of stock holders lacks empirical evidence. The main objective of the study is to establish the drivers behind timing and volume of stock holders' actual commodity sales and to establish whether the decision-making process can be linked to convenience yield. Regression analysis of intertemporal price spreads, monthly dummies and stocks for Hungarian com are performed both to establish the relevance of the convenience yield concept, and to confirm its relationship to stocks. The GSADF (Generalized Sup-ADF) method is applied on consecutive <b>expiries</b> of corn futures, in order to validate convenience yield related assumptions of explosiveness. An alternative explanation of the convenience yield concept formulated in the spatial-temporal interpretation of storage is also tested on a large volume of actual Hungarian com logistics data. Finally, a choice model with hypothetical sales scenarios, filled by a large sample of Hungarian farmers is performed in order to validate whether a two-step Heckman model offers a good approximation of the actual decision-making process behind stock sales. Both convenience yield's existence and its inverse relation to stocks are demonstrated for Hungarian com. However, evidence does not support the hypothesis that nearby prices show greater tendencies for bubble formation than later <b>expiries.</b> Contrary to expectations, spatial¬temporal storage conclusions are validated on Hungarian corn, as delivery distance to central markets does increase through the season. Some variables proposed are found to be individually significant in driving stock sales, and the expectation that selling is best explained by a two-step Heckman model is also partly confirmed. Besides testing existing models on the data of a new geography, it is the additional step taken towards real decision-makers, where this study of commodity sales is expected to contribute both to convenience yield theory and to our current knowledge of how the physical grain markets work...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine a}} Markov tree (MT) model for option pricing {{in which the}} {{dynamics}} of the underlying asset are modeled by a non-IID process. We show that the discrete probability mass function of log returns generated by the tree is closely approximated by a continuous mixture of two normal distributions. Using this normal mixture distribution and risk-neutral pricing, we derive a closed-form expression for European call option prices. We also suggest a regression tree-based method for estimating three volatility parameters σ, σ+, and σ − required to apply the MT model. We apply the MT model to price call options on 89 non-dividend paying stocks from the S&P 500 index. For each stock symbol on a given day, we use the same parameters to price options across all strikes and <b>expiries.</b> Comparing against the Black-Scholes model, we find that the MT model’s prices are closer to market prices. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} regulation policies in two distinct settings. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} the existing theoretical literature on innovation and entrepreneurship. It summarizes some of the main findings of the effect of various means of protecting intellectual property on the innovation incentives and the level of entrepreneurship activity. A general observation is that much of the existing work compares the extremes of no protection and perfect protection and the resulting prediction is that perfect protection leads to higher innovation incentives. This is puzzling in light of the empirical evidence that shows the opposite trend. Chapter 2 explicitly takes into account the fact that patent protection is imperfect and likely to lie in between the two extremes. In addition, in more than 70 % of infringement cases in the U. S., infringement damages are calculated according to the so-called reasonable royalties rule that essentially awards a portion of the imitator's realized revenues to the innovator. I show that incorporating these two facts result in a non-monotonic relationship between the patent strength and R&D investment if one moves from zero protection to perfect protection in a continuous way. The intuition is that when protection is less than perfect, though not zero, equilibrium may involve both imitation and damages. Viewing damages as an alternative source of profits, the innovator may be less aggressive in pursuing R&D as patents become stronger. This result has important welfare implications. Besides the well-known effect of reducing welfare due to less competitive markets, stronger protection can further curtail welfare by decreasing R&D investment. Chapter 3, coauthored with Professor Huseyin Yildirim, studies situations, in which one buyer sequentially negotiates with multiple suppliers to acquire goods or services that are either complements or substitutes to each other. We find that the buyer weakly prefers private negotiations because it creates strategic uncertainty about the outcomes from earlier negotiations, leading to less aggressive pricing. For substitutes, this strategic uncertainty is more beneficial for short <b>expiries</b> because long ones allow purchasing decisions to be made after all negotiations are over, creating enough competition on their own and leading to Bertrand prices. In contrast to substitutes, for which suppliers are in direct competition, complements create incentives for suppliers to coordinate their prices to extract the additional surplus resulting from the complementarities of their goods. In this case, introducing uncertainty through privacy is more beneficial for the buyer as suppliers' bargaining powers increase vis-á-vis the buyer because it creates greater coordination concerns. This leads to a somewhat surprising result that the buyer could benefit from negotiating with more powerful suppliers. The model enables an evaluation of certain laws and regulations that govern bilateral negotiations. For instance, open record/open meetings laws, setting rules on public access of information, generate efficient outcomes, but in general are harmful to the buyer. Similarly, the FTC's cooling-off rule sets long <b>expiries</b> by giving the buyer three days to cancel a contract, which generates efficient outcomes when goods are substitutes because of suppliers' Bertrand pricing, but reduces efficiency when goods are complements since long <b>expiries</b> make coordination harder to sustain.

30|$|Extending {{the period}} of the market {{exclusivity}} and responding properly to the recent agglomeration of patent <b>expiries</b> are pivotal to the success of pharmaceutical companies. Declining R&D productivity, rising costs of commercialization, near-term patent expirations for many top-selling drugs are forcing companies to adopt new systems to introduce innovative products to market and to focus on strategies that increase the returns from the existing product portfolio. This systematic review explores various strategic and tactical management approaches by synthesizing the relevant literature and practical examples on patent expiration strategies. It further discusses how the mix of competition policies and strategic instruments can be used to maintain declining revenue streams from the blockbuster business model of the pharmaceutical industry. The review provides a comprehensive overview of the research on various strategies, offers both theoretical and practical guidelines for strategy transformation that companies can use to prolong the market exclusivity, and identifies knowledge gaps that needed to be addressed in order to improve efficiency in policy design.|$|R
