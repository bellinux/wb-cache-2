5|$|According to FN, the 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} has {{an effective}} range of 200m (219yd) {{and a maximum}} range of 1,800m (1,969yd) when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> P90, and an effective range of 50m (55yd) and a maximum range of 1,510m (1,651yd) when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, {{and it is a}} subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In testing done by Houston Police Department SWAT, the SS190 <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> P90 into bare {{ballistic}} gelatin exhibited penetration depths {{ranging from}} 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in). In testing in 1999 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the SS190 <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> P90 {{at a distance}} of 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in ballistic gelatin after passing through a Level II Kevlar vest.|$|E
5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar. In emergencies, the mortar could be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E
50|$|A close {{examination}} of the trial transcript and the most reasonable interpretation of the evidence is that Davis killed Grimm while <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Avalon Hotel; McElfresh {{was killed by a}} Wobbly <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> IWW hall, and that Cassagranda was killed while running west on Second Avenue by a revolver probably fired by Davis <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Avalon Hotel.|$|R

5|$|The SS196SR was {{introduced}} in 2005 {{and it is now}} discontinued in favor of the SS197SR cartridge. It featured a lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max bullet which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 500m/s (1,650ft/s) when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Five-seven. The polycarbonate tip used in the V-Max bullet acted as a wedge, enhancing expansion of the bullet. The SS196 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level II vest when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Five-seven. The SS196 could be identified by its red polymer tip.|$|E
5|$|When <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> FN P90, the 5.7×28mm SS190 can {{penetrate}} the NATO CRISAT vest or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest {{at a range}} of 200 m (219 yd).|$|E

5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground, but was not as effective when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|As the Telephone Building {{was being}} {{completed}} in 1925, {{a group of}} Methodist Episcopalians came to Pflueger, asking him to design a new skyscraper containing both a church and a hotel for them at 100 McAllister Street.

Miller and Pflueger sued for $81,600, alleging that Hobart's design was not significantly changed from Pflueger's original. Three months after the hotel and church opened in January 1930, Miller and Pflueger won $38,000 in court, equivalent to $ today.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the design}} intents of the SS190 variety of this {{cartridge}} was that it {{have the ability to}} penetrate Kevlar protective vests—such as the NATO CRISAT vest—that will stop conventional pistol bullets. <b>Fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> P90, the SS190 is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of 200m (219yd), or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest at the same range. However, sporting variants of the 5.7×28mm are classified by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as not armor-piercing.|$|E
5|$|Police {{also found}} that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club {{restaurant}} worker had been used near the resort that night.

The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.|$|E

His background in microbiology, virology, infectious diseases and prior experience of working with immunocompromised transplant patients helped him to conduct some of the earliest research into AIDS, independently of government agencies that were slow to react and often at his own expense, and in 1983 he was founding editor one of the first AIDS journals, AIDS Research (renamed AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses in 1986, after Sonnabend was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> journal).|$|E

5|$|The 2014–15 season {{opened with}} the Devils' roster {{suffering}} with injuries, and consequently the team accumulated losses.

The Devils finished the season as the sixth-worst team in the League, 20 points away from a playoff spot and with just one victory in the last 11 games.|$|E
