Their bodies had been crushed beyond recognition but he completed the gruesome task by correlating their identities to their positions (loci in Latin) at the table before his departure. He later drew on this experience to develop the 'memory theatre' or 'memory palace', a system for mnemonics widely used in oral societies until the Renaissance. According to Cicero, Themistocles wasn't much impressed with the poet's invention: [...] "I would rather a technique of forgetting, for <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> I would rather not remember and cannot forget what I would rather forget." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Fox's enemies said of him, {{and smiled}} at the {{plausible}} twist he had given the facts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Giulia, don't {{you love}} me?' My heart was {{beginning}} to sink, and <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had heard from Matteo. Oh, God! could it be true?...|$|R
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> old Zikali {{had said}} to me years before to the effect that Saduko was living with a ghost which would kill him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, dearest Ghita; I have no {{patience}} when <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> a trifle, after all, threatens to tear us asunder. Thou pretendest to love me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, Allen," [...] {{said his}} mother, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> {{we used to}} say about old Mr. Barnes, I cannot find it in my heart to play the same game!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] he replied; [...] "such persons never marry. They only prevent {{other people}} from marrying anybody. Therefore {{it is that}} <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> sort of a boatman I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next day," [...] she uttered distinctly, [...] "I didn't think. <b>I</b> <b>remembered.</b> That was enough. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{should never}} have forgotten. Never. And Captain Anthony arrived at the cottage in the evening." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{moment the}} words had passed my lips, I {{came to my}} senses again; <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> fatal words they might prove to be, if they reached the Minister's ears.|$|R
60|$|And <b>I,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen}} in the blue parlour, was silent--for I could not lie. So she flung my hand away with a bitter laugh, and picked lightly from the table anear a small dagger with a jewelled handle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{uncle was}} a very {{distinguished}} man," [...] he said. [...] "I was only at college then, but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> a fuss there was in all the papers when he resigned his seat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> passed at {{the time}} you speak of, I {{expressed}} a strong opinion on this subject, and said that, with my knowledge or consent, you never should do what you threaten now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> you mean," [...] said Phineas. [...] "I {{think you}} {{declared}} {{that you would}} quarrel with any man who might presume to address Miss Effingham. Is it that to which you allude?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so. Talking {{about it}} reminds me that I was puzzled by a smell I thought I ought to know when I brought Clarke out of the tepee. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> {{it was not long}} since and the thing's significant. It was gasoline." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have been}} with him, I see,' says the reverend gent, with a shrug: then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> you had told me of the broken seal of your letter, and have not the {{slightest}} doubt that Brough opened and read every word of it.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> will <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> you say and {{not make}} my yarning too common.|$|R
6000|$|OLIVER. Ah, {{but they}} enjoyed it--they enjoyed it immensely. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> grand old {{sporting}} weeks they were. It {{was like a}} fox-hunt, so lively and gay--bands and tea-parties and excitement everywhere, pit-ponies loose, men all over the country-side--- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} minister, {{with a certain}} dejection, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> I have seen of men, when I reflect what human nature is, how can I believe that the kingdom of God will ever come upon the earth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's one," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "has never {{believed}} it, and that's her ladyship. I've heard strange talk {{from the people}} who've come under your masterful ways. You're a harder man than the Everard Dominey <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>What</b> if you should be an impostor?" ...|$|E
60|$|Patt laughed, {{and that}} so merrily as {{to cause the}} tones of her sweet voice to fill me with delight, as <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> {{she had been in}} {{childhood}} and girlhood five years before, and she shook her bright tresses off her cheeks ere she would answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{told me that}} if I {{heard you}} were engaged I was not to believe it," [...] Caspar went on. [...] "I heard it twenty days ago from yourself, but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> you had said. I thought there might be some mistake, and that's partly why I came." ...|$|R

6000|$|When I {{consider}} how munificently the colleges of Cambridge and [...] Oxford are endowed, {{and with what}} pomp religion and learning are [...] there surrounded; ... when <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> was the faith of Edward [...] III. and of Henry VI., of Margaret of Anjou and Margaret of [...] Richmond, of William of Wykeham and William of Waynefleet, of [...] Archbishop Chichele and Cardinal Wolsey; when <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> we [...] have taken from the Roman catholics, King's College, New College, [...] Christ Church, my own Trinity; and when I look at the miserable [...] Dotheboys' Hall which we have given them in exchange, I feel, I [...] must own, less proud than I could wish of being a protestant and a [...] Cambridge man.--MACAULAY.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I remember,' {{said the}} gentleman, {{striking}} {{his nose with}} the knuckle of his forefinger as a chastening for his forgetfulness. 'Demmit, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> you come for. Step this way, Nickleby; my dear, will you follow me? Ha! ha! They all follow me, Nickleby; always did, demmit, always.' ...|$|E
60|$|Steerforth evaded the {{question}} for a little while; looking in scorn and anger on his opponent, and remaining silent. I could not help thinking even in that interval, <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>what</b> a noble fellow he was in appearance, and how homely and plain Mr. Mell looked opposed to him.|$|E
6000|$|STEVE. 'Of course I blame myself now; but I {{assure you}} {{honestly}} I {{had no idea}} of it until to-night. I had thought you were only my friend. It dazed me; but as I ransacked my mind many little things came back to me. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hadn't noticed at the time--' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> Mrs Fyne {{had told}} me before of the view she had years ago of de Barral {{clinging}} to the child {{at the side of}} his wife's grave and later on of these two walking hand in hand the observed of all eyes by the sea. Pictures from Dickens--pregnant with pathos.|$|R
5000|$|... "Oh yes, I {{had lots}} of talks with Berger about the war. You see, I might say that I knew Victor Berger before I was born, since he knew my mother and father. But <b>I</b> don't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> he said on those talks; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{distinctly}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said, but his views did not impress me at all. I was far more interested in my views anyhow than I was in his." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "George! If {{people were}} {{to hear you}} talk like that--of course I KNOW you; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> a wild crazy boy you were; I know you don't mean a word you say--but if people that didn't {{understand}} you were to hear you talking, they'd think you were a regular socialist!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{a certain}} way. Not that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> the fast-going lady was like; {{but there was}} {{something}} about this woman that put me in mind of the other. Vigo was her name; now I recollect it,--a Miss Vigo. It's nine or ten years ago now, and I was little more than a boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{of course}} it is all unanswerable, and as I ride along through the evening shadows I sneer at that Great Fetish which Comte called the world. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> another pessimist of sentiency has uttered: [...] "Transient are all. They, being born, must die, and, being dead, are glad to be at rest." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> Silver {{had said}} about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my {{position}} that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.|$|R
60|$|While in {{the office}} I heard {{footsteps}} in the hall, and looking through the partly closed door had seen Gus enter his father's private office, closing the door after him. I was {{on the point of}} following, when <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> had passed between us, and so waited until some member of the firm might appear.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> started, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> the Vicomtesse had said. But Monsieur de St. Gre did {{not appear}} to see my perturbation.|$|R
