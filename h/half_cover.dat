'Elfride,' he said, with a {{superficial}} archness {{which did not}} <b>half</b> <b>cover</b> an undercurrent of reproach, 'do you know, I think you might have told me voluntarily about that past--of kisses and betrothing--without giving me so much uneasiness and trouble.

60|$|Indeed, so lamentable a {{proposition}} as this {{of building a}} bridge across the river {{had never before been}} mooted by the public. Men conversant with such matters gave it as their opinion that no amount of tolls that could reasonably be expected would pay one per cent on the money which it was proposed to expend; that sum, however, they stated, would not more than <b>half</b> <b>cover</b> the full cost of the bridge. Traffic would be prohibited by the heavy charges which would be necessary, and the probability would be that the ferry would still continue to be the ordinary mode of crossing the river.|$|E

The bit of coarse canvas that covers her head, the hair falling about her cheeks, the rags that only <b>half</b> <b>cover</b> her, the poor short skirt that goes no more than half-way down her legs, the naked feet covered with mud--all these things do not wound me; 'tis the image of a {{condition}} that I respect, 'tis the sign and summary of a state that is inevitable, that is woful, and that I pity with all my heart. But my gorge rises, and in spite of the scented air that follows her, I turn my eyes from the courtesan, whose fine lace head-gear and torn cuffs, white stockings and worn-out shoes, show me the misery of the day in company with the opulence of last night. Such would my house have been, if the imperious scarlet had not forced all into harmony with itself. I had two engravings that were not without merit, Poussin's Manna in the Wilderness, and the same painter's Esther before Ahasuerus; the one is driven out in shame by some old man of Rubens's, the Fall of the Manna is scattered to the winds by a Storm of Vernet's. The old straw chair is banished to the ante-room by a luxurious thing of morocco. Homer, Virgil, Horace, Cicero, have been taken from their shelf and shut up in a case of grand marqueterie work, an asylum worthier of them than of me. The wooden table still held its ground, protected by a vast pile of pamphlets and papers heaped pell-mell upon it; they seemed as if they would long protect it from its doom. Yet one day that too was mastered by fate, and in spite of my idleness pamphlets and papers went to arrange themselves in the shelves of a costly bureau.... It was thus that the edifying retreat of the philosopher became transformed into the scandalous cabinet of the farmer-general. Thus I too am insulting the national misery.|$|E

Reduced to a 3 piece outfit, all members took up vocal duties with Ken reluctantly assuming lead vocals and named themselves Relish in 1995.

50|$|The exam {{grade is}} {{weighted}} evenly between the multiple-choice and free-response sections. The DBQ is weighted at 25 percent while the FRQ/LEQ is weighted at 15 percent. The Short Answer is weighted 20 percent. Approximately {{half of the}} multiple-choice questions cover the period from 1450 to the French Revolution and Napoleonic era, and <b>half</b> <b>cover</b> the period from the French Revolution and Napoleonic era to the present, evenly divided between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. About one-third of the questions focus on cultural and intellectual themes, one-third on political and diplomatic themes, and one-third on social and economic themes. Many questions draw on knowledge {{of more than one}} chronological period or theme. Although this is the general trend based on past AP Exams, it is not mandated that the exam follow this format. In recent years and present, the multiple choice portion is Stimulus Based, meaning the students are given an excerpt of a speech or writing, photograph, or painting, to analyze and answer questions.|$|E
5000|$|There was {{a tension}} {{among the members}} and {{officers}} of the London County Council on whether the council's function was to enhance London as a world-class city, building monuments that befitted its role as the leading city in the world's greatest empire, or the utilitarian function of providing homes and services and buildings for the poor. The architect department had to provide a balance. The Housing of the Working Classes Branch had achieved some notable firsts: it had produced the Boundary Estate of architect-designed tenement blocks radiating from Arnold Circus—where previous tenements for charities such as the Peabody Trust followed a set plan {{no matter where they}} were located. All the blocks survive (except one) and all are now listed buildings as is the street plan and the central park. They also produced Totterdown Fields estate—as the first and model cottage garden estate- and it was Riley who signed off the plans. There was considerable criticism that London County Council architect were doing work that should rightfully be done by the private sector. A RIBA enquiry was set up in 1915 and Riley suggested that the profession was 'overloaded by a sub-stratum of incompetent private members who could not obtain employment'. He continued, 'The routine through which an official must press his work is of such a character that feeble results ... cannot ensue. If outsiders had to encounter the same searching criticism and a tithe of the obstruction, their fees would only about <b>half</b> <b>cover</b> their requirements' ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{exploratory}} and descriptive {{analysis of the}} characteristics of inter-disciplinary sustainability studies (ISSs). The paper explores the academic and disciplinary nature of inter-disciplinary inquiry and studies themes, imperatives and methodologies, together with institutional characteristics. Our analysis of 70 articles published between 2003 and 2008 suggests that the publication of ISSs is growing and that this effort is largely based upon attempts to integrate aspects of different disciplines. These studies mostly relate to resource management studies and typically adopt qualitative, case study or mixed methodologies. The articles reviewed have a practical orientation, with nearly two-thirds of studies explicitly addressing policy-making issues, and over <b>half</b> <b>cover</b> the orientations, mechanisms and institutions towards people's participation in decision-making. The research effort is typically made in Europe and North America, and by scholars working in inter-disciplinary teams. The implications of these findings for research in, and the practice of, sustainability studies are discussed in conclusion. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
