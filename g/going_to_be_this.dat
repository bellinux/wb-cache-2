500|$|Being {{a remake}} of an iconic film, and the starcast involved, Don {{was one of the}} most {{anticipated}} films of the year. The first look poster was released in late April 2006, which according to the media hinted at the kind of adaptation the film was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> was followed by another poster in late July 2006, which also revealed the release date of the film. Following the poster reveals, the theatrical trailer was released in mid-September. Bollywood Hungama deemed it promising, writing that the [...] "trendy accessories, sleek gadgets, lavish settings, expensive wardrobe and deadly action scenes build the framework of the new Don." [...] To promote the film, the filmmakers teamed up with Hungama Digital Media Entertainment to launch a Mobile game based on the film. It was the first Multiplayer online game launched for any Bollywood film. The filmmakers also launched popcorn holders of Don before the release film. An 80-page comic book was published and copies were given for free in multiplexes along with the tickets of the film.|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey {{stated that}} he {{composed}} the frame with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio {{to cope with the}} varying heights of the main characters, explaining that [...] "shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [...] knew the final battle sequence was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important." [...] The film was McGarvey's first venture shooting with a digital camera, the Arri Alexa. The Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras were used for some shots, and high-speed shots were captured on 35 mm film with the Arriflex 435. About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, [...] "Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{producer}} Don Hahn, Beaumont's Belle is an [...] "incredibly passive" [...] character, {{the personality}} of whom he likened to those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, as well as American actress and animal rights activist Doris Day, describing them as women who are [...] "capable, but filling a role that women might fill in the 1950s and 1960s.” The filmmakers painstakingly reworked Belle into a more three-dimensional character by providing her with goals and aspirations beyond romance and marriage, while expanding her passive role into that of a more inquisitive heroine. Determined to have Belle resemble [...] "an unusual Disney heroine," [...] Woolverton deliberately molded her into an independent character {{who is not a}} princess, enjoys books and has little interest in marriage, and worked closely with Ashman to create a proactive heroine [...] "who was a thinker and a reader and she wasn’t about what she looked like and she wasn’t a victim." [...] Although Belle being well-read is mentioned in the original fairy tale, it is hardly important to its plot. Thus, Belle's passion for reading was vastly expanded upon, borrowing from both the Little Woman character Jo March and Woolverton's own love of reading to further demonstrate the character's intelligence and open mind. Both Woolverton and O'Hara encouraged the filmmakers to emphasize the intelligent and book-loving aspects of Belle's personality. However, at times the animators struggled to fulfill Woolverton's vision. Originally, Belle was depicted constantly crying throughout her imprisonment; Woolverton resented this, arguing that the character was {{much more likely to be}} either searching for an escape or simply [...] "be intrigued that she was living in an enchanted castle" [...] than crying. [...] "Once everybody realized she wasn’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> typical Disney female, they would go to the extreme ... She became bitchy"; the screenwriter argued that Belle would be [...] "too smart" [...] to act this way. A few years older than The Little Mermaids Ariel, Belles' love of reading makes the character more worldly and mature than her predecessor. Belle is believed by Henn to be [...] "probably" [...] the oldest of Disney's princesses, at 20 years of age.|$|E

2500|$|A {{possible}} {{resolution to}} the paradox is to assume that quantum theory is incomplete, {{and the result of}} measurements depends on predetermined [...] "hidden variables". [...] The state of the particles being measured contains some hidden variables, whose values effectively determine, right from the moment of separation, what the outcomes of the spin measurements are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> would mean that each particle carries all the required information with it, and nothing needs to be transmitted from one particle to the other at the time of measurement. Einstein and others (see the previous section) originally believed [...] this was the only way out of the paradox, and the accepted quantum mechanical description (with a random measurement outcome) must be incomplete. (In fact similar paradoxes can arise even without entanglement: the position of a single particle is spread out over space, and two widely separated detectors attempting to detect the particle in two different places must instantaneously attain appropriate correlation, so that they do not both detect the particle.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The antagonists Grendel and Grendel's {{mother are}} portrayed by Crispin Glover and Angelina Jolie, respectively.

Zemeckis had found Glover tiresome on set, {{because of his}} {{lack of understanding of}} shooting a film, but realized this would not be a problem as on a motion capture film he could choose his angles later. Glover's dialogue was entirely in Old English. Jolie had wanted to work with Zemeckis, and had read the poem years before but could not remember it well until she read the script and was able to recall basic themes. The actress recounted her first impression of her character's appearance by saying [...] "...I was told I {{was going to be a}} lizard.

6000|$|The {{test case}} of toleration {{at the moment}} of the Oxford {{election}} of 1847 was the admission of the Jews to sit in parliament, and in the last month of 1847 Mr. Gladstone astonished his father, as well as a great host of his political supporters, by voting with the government in favour of the removal of Jewish disabilities. No ordinary degree of moral courage was needed for such a step by the member for such a constituency. 'It is a painful decision to come to,' he writes in his diary (Dec. 16), 'but the only substantive doubt it raises is about remaining in parliament, and it is truly and only the church which holds me there, though she may seem to some to draw me from it.' Pusey wrote to him in rather violent indignation, for Mr. Gladstone was the only man of that school who learned, or was able to learn, what the modern state is or is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> was the third phase, so Gladstone argued, of an irresistible movement. The tory party had fought first for an anglican parliament, second they fought for a protestant parliament, and now they were fighting for a Christian parliament. Parliament had ceased to be anglican and it had ceased to be protestant, and the considerations that supported these two earlier operations thenceforth condemned the exclusion from full civil rights of those who were not Christians. To his father he explained (December 17, 1847): 'After much consideration, prolonged indeed I may say {{for the last two years}} and a half, I made up my mind to support Lord John Russell's bill for the admission of the Jews. I spoke to this effect last night. It is with reluctance that I give the vote, but I am convinced that after the civil privileges we have given them already (including the magistracy and the franchise), and after the admission we have already conceded to unitarians who refuse the whole of the most vital doctrines of the Gospel, we cannot compatibly with entire justice and fairness refuse to admit them.' ...|$|E
