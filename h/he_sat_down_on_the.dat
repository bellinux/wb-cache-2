2500|$|David Bowie, {{a fan of}} the band, then {{offered them}} a song he had just written. As Hunter {{recalled}} in a 2004 DVD interview, [...] "He offered us [...] "Suffragette City", which I didn't think was good enough. And then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, Regent Street it was, in a publisher's office, and plays 'All The Young Dudes' on an acoustic guitar." [...] It reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and revived the band, who were appreciative of Bowie's rescue. Guitarist Ralphs relates that Bowie taught Mott studio tricks, but one of the best-known sounds during the period was a 'hand-clap-in-the-toilet' routine that relied more on Hunter's vision than it did on Bowie's clearly more experienced studio abilities. Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson also significantly contributed to Mott's sound, a fact noticed by Hunter, who would later collaborate with Ronson a great deal.|$|E
2500|$|On October 15, 2008, Wallenda {{performed}} on a live broadcast of Today. The {{plan was to}} walk and then bicycle off {{the roof of the}} Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the [...] cable with a [...] balancing pole. Halfway through, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wire and called the Today show hosts. [...] "Where are you?" [...] he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show's hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped and waved to the crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. [...] "I actually slipped," [...] he said later. [...] "I lost focus there for a moment" [...] because of some unexpected tape on the wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a snowdrift; Ian {{kicked off}} his snowshoes {{and leaned against}} the bank.|$|R
60|$|Again <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{what seemed}} to be a bed of moss, and began to meditate.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> an ottoman {{opposite}} to her, {{and turned over}} some newspapers with a restless rustling.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Keller {{was deeply}} affected. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> window-seat by Madame Fontaine.|$|E
60|$|Coming {{back in a}} {{few minutes}} with a jug, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stern-gratings.|$|E
60|$|Recovering from this, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deck at his father's feet, {{and wept}} silently.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{something}} like a rope!" [...] he exclaimed appreciatively; and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> it, anxious to try it. Then immediately he rose.|$|R
60|$|Percy's gallant soul {{abandoned}} the struggle. With a feeble oath, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a box containing croquet implements, and gave {{himself up to}} thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dink dot boetry vos make me tizzy already," [...] {{came from}} Hans, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a nearby chair, his face growing {{suddenly}} pale.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of a}} couch. She seated {{herself at}} the further end of it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of a}} {{satinwood}} chair, upholstered with silver-coloured stuff, {{close to}} where he was standing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach and, {{after making}} a few disparaging remarks about coral as a weapon, lapsed into silence.|$|E
5000|$|On Christmas Day, 1954, {{alone in}} his room, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his bed and began to write in his journal. He {{described}} his feelings as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a tressel which {{answered}} {{the purpose of}} a chair, and placing the lantern beside him, proceeded in the most friendly tone: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a log {{and took}} out an old corncob pipe. When it was filled and lighted he leaned back contentedly against a {{friendly}} stump.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa as he {{said the}} words, cherishing the plump peachey cheek that lay {{uppermost}} on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} mattress, and for all reply went on {{laughing}} in the same frightful and improbable tone.|$|E
60|$|When {{he got to}} {{the brook}} there was nothing in sight, so <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank to watch, and again fell fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Old Sam {{walked over}} to the door and shut it; then <b>’e</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bed and spoke low so that Ginger could hardly ’ear ’im.|$|R
60|$|The skipper {{returned}} to the bed, which creaked as if taxed to its utmost, when <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> it, and drew Susan close to his side.|$|R
60|$|Immediately after, there {{walked into}} the parlour a bowed, mean-looking, dirty little old man, who, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a chair, paid some {{doubtful}} compliments to Peggy.|$|R
6000|$|... "After game, probably," [...] {{observed}} the leader, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stump of a fallen tree {{and began to}} make notes in his journal.|$|E
60|$|I {{was touched}} by his words and consented. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table in the dining-room, and held up the glass of sherry to his eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, old scout," [...] greeted Blair, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{bed beside}} Lane. [...] "I need {{you more than}} any one--but it kills me to see you." ...|$|E
60|$|And at last, {{sick and}} wretched, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a seat upon the deserted parade under the stars, {{close to the}} soughing of the {{invisible}} sea below....|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a {{chair with}} 'is hat cocked over one eye, and they all sat staring at 'im as though they didn't know wot to say next.|$|R
60|$|Hare unbuckled his cartridge-belt, {{which held}} his Colt, {{and hung it}} over the pommel of his saddle; then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> one of the stone seats near the camp-fire.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> raised seat {{beneath the}} marker, trim and tired, furtively {{studying}} those two young faces. When {{the game was}} over Mont came up to him.|$|E
60|$|He {{approached}} the summer-house. Unconscious {{that it was}} tenanted, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step. Tartar, now his customary companion, had followed him, and he couched across his feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it's fine," [...] replied Slone, rather awkwardly, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> porch step. What could Holley {{want with}} him? This old rider was above curiosity or gossip.|$|E
60|$|The visitor now {{commenced}} to laugh. He {{stood on}} one leg as he laughed harder, then stood on the other leg. Finally <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a log of driftwood.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a chair {{near the}} door, and having {{glanced at the}} young man {{standing}} leaning with his hand upon the couch, spoke with his eyes averted towards the ground.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a vault and lit his pipe. But {{before he}} had smoked two minutes, it was out again. I had not seen him {{in a state of}} {{perturbation}} before.|$|R
