40|$|BACKGROUND: Some of {{patients}} with an intact <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> develop acute cholecystitis or have <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stone formation after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Endoscopic sphincterotomy may affect <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> motility. AIMS: To prospectively evaluate longterm effect of endoscopic sphincterotomy on <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> motility. PATIENTS: Thirty two patients with an intact <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> (15 with and 17 without <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones) who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis. METHODS: <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> function was examined before and at from seven days to five years after sphincterotomy. <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume, at fasting and after caerulein administration, was determined by ultrasonography. RESULTS: After endoscopic sphincterotomy, the enlarged orifice remained patent during a five year follow up period. One patient with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones subsequently developed acute cholecystitis, the remaining being asymptomatic. In the patients before sphincterotomy, particularly in those with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones, the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> showed larger fasting volume and lower caerulein stimulated maximum contraction than normal controls. Throughout five years after sphincterotomy, fasting volume of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> decreased and its maximum contraction increased, regardless of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> stones; {{significantly different from the}} values before sphincterotomy (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic sphincterotomy decreases fasting volume of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> and increases its contraction ability for a long period.

40|$|Background—Nitric oxide {{is a major}} {{neurotransmitter}} in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) pathways. NANC inhibitory innervation {{has been}} shown in human <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> muscle in vitro; the role of nitric oxide in human <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying however is undefined.  Aims—To study the effect of glyceryl trinitrate, a nitric oxide donor, on <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying in healthy subjects using a randomised, double blind, crossover, placebo controlled design.  Methods—Ultrasonographic <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume was measured in the fasting state in eight healthy volunteers after randomised administration of either glyceryl trinitrate 1200 µg buccal spray or placebo spray. On two further occasions, after randomised administration of either glyceryl trinitrate 1200 µg buccal spray or placebo spray, <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volumes were also measured after a liquid test meal.  Results—Glyceryl trinitrate significantly increased fasting <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume to a mean of 114 % (SEM 5 %) of pretreatment volume (p= 0. 039).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{present study}} {{reviewed}} {{the occurrence of}} <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> carcinoma in patients who underwent a cholecystectomy for gallstone disease. METHODS: A retrospective study of demographical and clinical information for patients who underwent a cholecystectomy and operative cholangiogram for gallstones predominantly in three major hospitals located in the northern area of Melbourne was carried out. RESULTS: <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> carcinomas were observed in 14 patients (3. 2 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 8 - 5. 3 %) consisting of 11 women and three men of median age 78. 5 years (interquartile range: 77 - 81) {{from a series of}} 439 patients with a male-to-female ratio of 1 - 2. The {{results of the present study}} show that primary carcinoma of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> in this descriptive retrospective cohort was always associated with single or multiple cholesterol gallstones that were impacting on the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> wall. Cholesterol 'solitaire' gallstones were ovoid in shape with diameters > 3 cm along their longest axis, whereas multiple cholesterol gallstones varied in size and number from two or three large stones (1 - 2 cm), to numerous smaller stones (variable size to 0. 5 cm). No patient with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> carcinoma had either brown or black pigment gallstones. CONCLUSION: It is postulated that <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> carcinoma may be intimately associated with large or numerous cholesterol gallstones that in the first instance may interfere with the mechanical functioning of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder.</b> The size as well as the number of gallstones present in the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> may contribute significantly to the promotion of a gallstone filling defect of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> that may cause chronic mechanical damage to the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> mucosa.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: An {{impaired}} contractility {{has been}} suggested as {{a contributor to the}} increased incidence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis, but the few studies on <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying in cirrhotics offered contradictory results. Ingestion of a meal triggers the physiological pathway of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying; therefore, it was decided to analyse postprandial kinetics by investigating simultaneously the rates of gastric and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying of a mixed meal in patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: Gastric and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying were measured using ultrasound techniques after a solid-liquid meal (14 g fat, 425 kcal) in 24 patients with liver cirrhosis and in 12 controls. None of the subjects had <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> disease. Sequential changes in cross sectional area of the gastric antrum and in <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume were represented as a monoexponential process after the test meal. Cirrhotic patients were analysed according to the severity of disease (Child classes). The presence of portal gastropathy was assessed by endoscopy. Differences between groups were assessed using the two tailed Student's t test for unpaired observations and the correlations by linear regression (Pearson's coefficient). RESULTS: It was found that gastric emptying after the solid-liquid meal was delayed in cirrhotic patients compared with controls. <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying was significantly diminished in cirrhotic patients: the area under curve was greater in Child A (p = 0. 01), Child B (p = 0. 04), and Child C (p = 0. 014) cirrhotics compared with controls. No correlation was found between the variables of gastric and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying. <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> refilling began earlier in cirrhotics than in controls, before completion of gastric emptying.

Herein we intend to report a case of carcinoma <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> with breast metastasis and a short review of the literature. MethodsThis report describes an interesting and unusual case of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> carcinoma presenting with breast metastasis. Case reportA 38 -year lady presented with complaints of right abdominal pain. Bilateral breast examination showed 2 × 2 cm palpable lump in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed circumferential thickening of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> with the loss of fat plane with the adjacent liver parenchyma. Biopsy from the breast lump was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma compatible with primary in the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder.</b> Whole body PET-CT showed <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> mass with abdominal and pelvic nodes with metastasis to liver, left breast, C 7 vertebral body and left supra-clavicular node. She was diagnosed to have disseminated carcinoma <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> with liver, breast and supraclavicular nodal metastasis. She received palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin and radiotherapy to C 7 vertebra.

As this complex is the main macromolecular constituent of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile and contains all the bilirubin present, and about 80 % of the cholesterol, it must be involved in stabilising the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile and thus be related to gallstone formation. The concentration of the complex was found to be lower, the more inflammatory signs were present in the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder.</b> The properties of the complex, such as stability, resistance to extraction procedures, precipitation and staining properties, were studied. Finally, the occurrence of the bili-lipoprotein was studied in 360 bile samples, 64 from <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile, all obtained by puncture of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> during surgery, and 296 samples of fistula bile and samples obtained by puncture of the hepatic duct during surgery. The lipoprotein complex, always abundantly present in <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile if no inflammation of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> exists, was absent in 2 / 3 of the fistula bile samples. In fistula bile it is never found in concentrations as great as in <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile. Artificial concentration of fistula bile that contains an appreciable amount of the complex seldom gave a product that was equal to or closely resembling <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile. These and other facts suggest production of lipoprotein within the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder,</b> and in minor quantities under certain conditions by the walls of the bile passages...|$|R
40|$|Background—Endoscopic sphincterotomy {{has been}} shown to inhibit stone {{formation}} in the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> of experimental animals.  Aims—To investigate the alterations in bile composition and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> motility after endoscopic sphincterotomy.  Patients—A study was performed of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile composition and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> motility in patients with gallstone disease ((n = 20; age 40 - 60 years, median age 55 years: seven men), with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> calculi (n = 12) and with diseased <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> (chronic inflammation) without <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> calculi (n = 8)), who had received endoscopic sphincterotomy for common bile duct stones. Age and sex matched disease controls comprised 20 patients with gallstone disease but without stones and an intact sphincter of Oddi (with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> calculi (n = 10) and diseased <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> without <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> calculi (n = 10)).  Methods—Gall bladder motility was assessed by ultrasound. Duodenal bile collected by nasoduodenal tube after stimulation of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> by intravenous ceruletid infusion was analysed for cholesterol, phospholipid, and bile acid concentrations, cholesterol saturation index, and nucleation time.  Results—There was a significant reduction in mean (SEM) fasting volume (12. 5 (1. 7) ml v 26. 4 (2. 5) ml; p< 0. 001) and mean (SEM) residual volume (4. 34 (0. 9) ml v 14. 7 (0. 98) ml; p< 0. 001), and increase in mean (SEM) ejection fraction (65. 7 (4. 2) % v 43. 6 (5. 52) %; p< 0. 001) and mean (SEM) rate constant of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> emptying (− 0. 031 /min v − 0. 020 /min; p< 0. 01) in patients who had been subjected to endoscopic sphincterotomy. Median nucleation time was significantly longer (17 days v 6 days; p< 0. 006) in treated patients. There was a reduction in total mean (SEM) lipid concentrations (6. 73 (0. 32) g/dl v 7. 72 (0. 84) g/dl; p< 0. 05), cholesterol (5. 6 (1. 5) mmol/l v 10. 3 (2. 23) mmol/l; p< 0. 001) and CSI (0. 72 (0. 15) v 1. 32 (0. 31); p< 0. 001). There was no significant change in mean (SEM) phospholipid (25. 6 (3. 5) mmol/l v 23. 4 (6. 28) mmol/l) and bile acid (93. 7 (7. 31) mmol/l v 105. 07 (16. 6) mmol/l) concentrations.  Conclusions—After endoscopic sphincterotomy there was enhanced contractility of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder,</b> accompanied by a prolongation of nucleation time and reduction in cholesterol saturation index. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> {{duplication}} is {{an unusual}} biliary anomaly with a reported incidence of 1 : 4000 in the autopsy studies of humans. Lack of awareness, non-specific symptoms and signs and inadequacy of imaging methods are possible reasons for the reported problem of overlooking of the additional <b>gall</b> <b>bladders</b> {{before and during the}} surgery. We present a 22 -year-old male who presented to us with a history of acute cholecystitis 3 months back with ultrasonography documented cholelithiasis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which was carried out as an elective procedure, revealed a double <b>gall</b> <b>bladder.</b> An accurate, preferably pre-operative diagnosis, identification and removal of all <b>gall</b> <b>bladders</b> during the laparoscopy are mandatory to prevent inadvertent damage to the biliary ductal system, possible overlooking of the second <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> and hence post-operative cholecystitis...|$|R

Laura Daly, a woman from Missouri, suffered from an inherited disorder in which the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> was not properly attached; the resultant complications led to multiple erroneous diagnoses of AN. Upon performance of a CCK test, standard imaging techniques are done with the patient lying prone, in this instance it was done with the patient in an upright position. The <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> was shown to be in an abnormal position having flipped over the liver. The gallbladder was removed and the patient has since recovered.

40|$|Repeated daily {{injections}} of the somatostatin analogue, octreotide (SMS 201 - 995, Sandostatin) are an effective treatment for acromegaly, but lead to gall stone formation in about 50 % of cases during longterm treatment. This is {{probably because of}} impaired <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> contraction. This study examined whether the timing of intermittent injections in relation to meals, or alternatively, continuous 24 hour subcutaneous octreotide infusion (CSOI) might avert adverse effects on <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> contraction. In six patients with active acromegaly, <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume, plasma cholecystokinin (CCK), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were measured in the fasting state and after consumption of a fatty meal. Measurements were made on five separate days: (a) without treatment, (b) 45 minutes after 100 micrograms octreotide given subcutaneously, (c) four hours after 100 micrograms octreotide given subcutaneously, (d) eight hours after 100 micrograms octreotide given subcutaneously, and (e) during CSOI of 300 micrograms/ 24 h for two weeks. Without treatment, postprandial <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> contraction was 86. 2 (2. 1 %). Fasting <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> volume increased after octreotide injection and was almost doubled during CSOI. Octreotide injections impaired postprandial <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> contraction as well as CCK and PP release {{for at least four}} hours. Eight hours after injection and during CSOI, postprandial <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> contraction was partly restored (43. 4 % and 50. 8 % respectively). Postprandial CCK release was normal at eight hours after injection but very low during CSOI. PP release was suppressed by each mode of octreotide treatment. This study indicates that octreotide injections impair postprandial <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> contraction for at least four hours. Eight hours after injection and during CSOI, <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> contraction is partly restored...|$|R
40|$|Hypersection of <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> mucus is {{associated}} with gall stone formation in animal models. Aspirin inhibits both mucus synthesis and secretion, prevents gall stone formation in animals and reduces gall stone recurrence in man after dissolution therapy. Mucus biosynthesis in human <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> mucosal explants is inhibited by aspirin in vitro. We have studied the effects of aspirin in vivo. Fifty five patients with functioning <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> and stones have been randomised, 27 to group 1 (aspirin EC 300 mg once daily for seven days before cholecystectomy) and 28 to group 2 (controls). <b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile composition was analysed and mucus synthesis rates measured using 3 H-glucosamine incorporation into mucosal explants cultured for 24 hours. Patient age, sex, and <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> histology were similar in both groups. There were no differences in stone composition, <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile calcium concentration, cholesterol saturation and cholesterol nucleation time. The mean 3 H-glucosamine incorporation in aspirin treated patients was 1347 fmol/g wet weight as compared with 2008 fmol/g wet weight in controls (95 % confidence interval 222 - 1100, p< 0. 005, unpaired t test). This reduction in biosynthesis was associated with <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile mucus concentrations of 7. 6 mg/ml in patients and 7. 1 mg/ml in controls (ns). Treatment with aspirin led to {{a significant reduction in}} mucus biosynthesis by the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> mucosa.

40|$|<b>Gall</b> <b>bladder</b> bile is more acid that hepatic bile {{and this}} has been {{attributed}} to bicarbonate absorption by the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> epithelium. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate in vitro the acid base changes that occur across the human <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> mucosa. Fresh <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> tissue was obtained at cholecystectomy and placed in an Ussing Chamber and perfused with Ringer-Krebs glucose bicarbonate solution. The viability of the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> was assessed by measuring the potential differences across the epithelium and by the morphology of the epithelial cells at the end of the experiments. Aliquots from the solutions were taken at two, 45 and 70 minutes and pCO 2, hydrogen ion and bicarbonate concentrations were measured. In the mucosal side of the chamber a consistent and significant decrease was observed from two minutes to 70 minutes in bicarbonate concentration while pCO 2 and hydrogen ion concentrations significantly increased. The degree of inflammation correlated well with the ability for acidification, the more inflamed the tissue the less its ability to acidify. When the <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> was exposed to amiloride or sodium free solution acidification was abolished in the mucosal side. When tissue metabolism was irreversibly inhibited by exposure to formaldehyde, hydrogen ion concentration and pCO 2 were significantly decreased in the mucosal side of the chamber compared with the viable <b>gall</b> <b>bladder.</b> The human <b>gall</b> <b>bladder</b> is capable of secreting acid and this may be an important mechanism for preventing calcium precipitation and gall stone formation...|$|R
