40|$|Lipid-containing {{artificial}} tears are {{a type of}} {{artificial tears}} that use lipid components in order to restore the lipid layer of the tear film. One of these components is lecithin which can be applied in spray solutions containing lecithin liposomes. In this work the behavior of three of these commercial tears based on lecithin, Innoxa, Opticalm and Optrex, are studied using the Langmuir technique. The obtained isotherms are presented, discussed and compared. This technique seems useful {{in order to see}} the film behavior of the lipid components of these tears and determine some important parameters such as fluidity and extension at the air-water interface, and allows us to discern differences between these commercial tears. Innoxa and Optrex tears are more similar to each other than to Opticalm tears.

The evaluation of the fruity, bitter and pungent attributes was insufficient for describing the RDOs, so {{it was necessary to}} complete the oil descriptions with descriptive attributes (analogical describers) estimated by the tasters. Mono, poly and total <b>insaturations</b> index and odd/even fatty acids ratios (imparity index), defined from fatty acid compositions, were used for RDO descriptions.

Principal Component Analysis, using 34 parameters, has ensured to differentiate the six RDOs. The Aix-en-Provence and Vallée des Baux de Provence RDOs are not completely differentiated because the two RDOs have two principal varieties in common: Salonenque and Aglandau.

First, original di- and trifunctional cyclobutene precursors with azido, alkyne and/or chain transfer agent were successfully obtained and fully characterized. Azido- and alkyne-functionalized cyclobutenes were then conjugated with modified PEO bearing azido or alkyne groups, resulting in cyclobutene-based PEOs in quantitative conversions as ascertained by NMR spectroscopy and MALDI−TOF mass spectrometry.

However, the accumulation, composition, and mobilization of lipids during formation and germination of these spores are largely unknown. In this study, lipid storage and fatty acid composition during basidiosporogenesis were analyzed in fresh basidiocarps using bright-field microscopy and gas chromatography. Abundant lipid bodies {{are found in the}} hyphae, basidia, and basidiospores of fungal basidiocarps. This evidences a considerable C transport in the basidiocarp to meet the C demand during basidiospore formation. Fatty acid composition analysis revealed the presence of 24 compounds with chains of 9 to 18 C atoms, either saturated or insaturated, with one or two <b>insaturations.</b> The fatty acid composition and content varied according to the developmental stage of the peridioles.

We have now studied the effect of 1 on the fatty acid, sphingolipid and ganglioside content {{in a line of}} carcinomic human alveolar epithelial cells (A 549) using UPLC-MS. Oleic acid and NB-DNJ were used as positive controls for inhibition of fatty acid and ganglioside synthesis, respectively. Compound 1 (10 μM) was more efficient than oleic acid in reducing fatty acid levels of A 549 cells, producing a decrease in the range of 40 – 15 %, depending on the acyl chain length and the number of <b>insaturations.</b> In addition, glycoside 1 caused a reduction on ganglioside content of A 549 tumor cell line and accumulation of lactosylceramide, the common metabolic precursor for ganglioside biosynthesis. Alteration of ganglioside metabolism was also observed with two galactosylated derivatives of 1, which caused a more pronounced increase in lactosylceramide levels. Compound 1 at higher concentrations (above 30 μM) produced drastic alterations in glycosphingolipid metabolism, leading to cell metabolic profiles very different from those obtained at 10 μM.

40|$|Oxidative stress play a {{major role}} in the genesis and the {{evolution}} of vascular pathologies. Recent data suggest that redox mechanisms are involved in the signaling network of vascular cells and the physiology of the vascular wall. Experimental cell models allow to analyse the biological effect of pro-oxidants, and the regulation exerted by antioxidants and cytoprotective agents. 				Fatty acids play a complex role in atherosclerosis, since they exhibit both anti and proatherogenic properties, as function of their concentration and <b>insaturation</b> level. Beside their role in cell metabolism and mitochondrial b-oxidation, fatty acids activate various signaling pathways, and could modulate intracellular oxidative stress via an uncoupling effect on mitochondria. We report here that fatty acids protect against mitochondrial oxidative stress by activating cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. This effect is independent of the chain length and unsaturation level. EGF receptor is activated by fatty acids and involved in their protective effect against mitochondrial oxidative stress and GPX activation, and similar protective results are observed with EGF. Oleic acid and EGF protect DNA against the formation of 8 oxodG lesions occurring subsequently to oxidative stress.

In the present essay I argue that, although mathematics can be seen, in a first approach, as a language, it goes beyond this concept. I conjecture that mathematics presents two extreme features, denoted here by irreducibility and <b>insaturation,</b> representing delimiters for self-referentiality. These features are then related to physical laws by realizing that nature is a self-referential system obeying bounds similar to those respected by mathematics. Self-referential systems can only be autonomous entities by a kind of metabolism that provides and sustains such an autonomy. A rational mind, able of consciousness, is a manifestation of the self-referentiality of the Universe. Hence mathematics is here proposed to go beyond language by actually representing the most fundamental existence condition for self-referentiality. This idea is synthesized {{in the form of a}} principle, namely, that mathematics is the ultimate tactics of self-referential systems to mimic themselves.

40|$|The lipid {{metabolism}} in sperm cells is important both {{as one of}} the main sources for energy production and for cell structure. The double leaflets of the membrane should be considered not simply as a passive lipid film, but as a very specialized structure. The complete maturation of the sperm cell membrane is attained after testicular lipid biosynthetic processes and after passage through the epididymis. A special composition of membrane phospholipids, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and the different composition of sperm and immature germ cell membrane are described and discussed. Testis germ cells as well as epididymal maturing spermatozoa are endowed with enzymatic and non-enzymatic scavenger systems to prevent lipoperoxidative damage. Catalase, superoxide dismutase and GSH-dependent oxidoreductases are present in variable amounts in the different developmental stages. Phospholipid hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) activity and alpha tochopherol of epididymal spermatozoa are considered in detail. Their distribution and roles in caput and cauda epididymal sperm cells are discussed. Seminal plasma also has a highly specialized scavenger system that defends the sperm membrane against lipoperoxidation and the degree of PUFA <b>insaturation</b> acts to achieve the same goal. Systemic predisposition and a number of pathologies can lead to an anti-oxidant/pro-oxidant disequilibrium.

40|$|Our aim was {{to study}} the {{influence}} of weight loss on the fatty acid (FA) composition of liver and erythrocyte phospholipids and oxidative stress status in obese, non-alcoholic, fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Seven obese NAFLD patients who underwent subtotal gastrectomy with a gastro-jejunal anastomosis in roux and Y were studied immediately and 3 months after surgery. Seven non-obese patients who underwent anti-reflux surgery constituted the control group. Serum F 2 -isoprostane levels were measured by GS/NICI-MS/MS and FA composition was determined by GC. At the time of surgery, controls and obese patients exhibited a hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) pattern that correlated with that of erythrocytes. Three months after surgery, NAFLD patients lost 21 % of initial body weight; serum F 2 -isoprostane levels decreased by 76 %; total PUFA, long-chain PUFA (LCPUFA), n- 3 PUFA, and n- 3 LCPUFA increased by 22, 29, 81, and 93 %, respectively; n- 6 /n- 3 LCPUFA ratio decreased by 51 %; docosahexaenoic acid/docosapentaenoic acid ratio increased by 19 -fold; and the n- 3 product/precursor ratio (20 : 5 + 22 : 5 + 22 : 6) / 18 : 3 increased by 164 % (p< 0. 05). It is concluded that weight loss improves the n- 3 LCPUFA status of obese patients in association with significant amelioration in the biomarkers of oxidative stress, membrane FA <b>insaturation,</b> and n- 3 LCPUFA biosynthesis capacity, thus representing a central therapeutic issue in the improvement of obesity-related metabolic alterations involved in the mechanism of hepatic steatosi...|$|E

However, {{the amount of}} lipid in RBCs {{is higher than the}} lipids of the cell membrane, and includes triacylglycerols, which are no membrane components. We assumed that the extra lipids originated from lipoproteins attached to the cell surface, and we intended to analyse whether the size and composition of this lipid pool were affected by sex or diet. Experimental design. Adult male and female Wistar rats were fed control or cafeteria diets. Packed blood cells and plasma lipids were extracted and analysed for fatty acids by methylation and GC-MS, taking care of not extracting membrane lipids. Results. The absence of ω 3 -PUFA in RBC extracts (but not in plasma) suggest that the lipids extracted were essentially those in the postulated lipid surface pool and not those in cell membrane. In cells’ extracts, there was a marked depletion of PUFA (and, in general, of <b>insaturation).</b> Fatty acid patterns were similar for all groups studied, with limited effects of sex and no effects of diet in RBC (but not in plasma) fatty acids. Presence of trans fatty acids was small but higher in RBC lipids, and could not be justified by dietary sources. Conclusions. The presence of a small layer of lipid on the RBC surface may limit oxidative damage to the cell outer structures, and help explain its role in the transport of lipophilic compounds.

The three strains of bacteria, TA, TB, KB was analyzed by using the degradability test by using two parameters of 2, 6 -dichlorophenol indophenols (2, 6 - DCPIP) Indicator (qualitatively analysis) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (quantitatively analysis). The 2, 6 - dichlorophenol indophenol is widely used in colorimetric processes. Its property is the color change from blue to transparent when subjected to chemical reduction. The indicator, when oxidized is blue and when reduced is transparent. The color change occurs due to a structural change in the molecule, in which the double bond between nitrogen and carbon passes to a simple bond.

Over 20 alkamides were identified in Echinacea species, differing {{one from the other}} by the <b>insaturation</b> degree of the aliphatic chains. E. purpurea roots were found richer in alkamide content than aerial parts [2]. Recent studies suggested that alkamides are involved in the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activity of the plant, due to their high bioavailability [3]. The role of bacterial endophytes in immunomodulatory activity of E. purpurea was recently evidenced, suggesting that it could originate from its endophytic communities [4]. In order to investigate the interaction between E. purpurea and its endophytic bacterial community and the role of microbiota on the secondary metabolite production, axenic in vitro E. purpurea plants were infected with a pool of bacterial strains isolated from the aerial compartment [5]. Roots and leaves of axenic and endophyte-infected plants were extracted with n-hexane, then the methanol soluble part of these extracts was subjected to a phytochemical study. In particular, the alkamide content was analysed by HPLC coupled to a photo diode array (PDA) /UV detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). A total of 15 different alkamides were identified comparing their HPLC elution orders, ESI-MS/MS, and PDA/UV spectra with data reported in the literature [6]. Root and leaf extracts displayed different alkamide profiles, with leaf extract showing more alkamide constituents. On the other hand, the alkamide chemical profiles were similar in control and infected plants for both root and leaf extracts.

40|$|International audienceSome {{mammalian}} cells show striking {{differences in}} the acyl chain composition of their membrane phospholipids. In most cases, the majority of phospholipids bear one saturated and one monounsaturated acyl chains at positions 1 and 2 or the glycerol, respectively. However, some cells and notably neurons contain large amounts of phospholipids with a polyunsaturated fatty acyl chain, generally at position 2. The aim of this project is to compare {{the impact of the}} phospholipid polyunsaturation vs monounsaturation on the mechanical and functional properties of the plasma membrane. For this, Immortalized Retinal Pigmental Epithelial Cells (RPE 1) were cultured with various BSA-fatty acid complexes. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry show that these cells incorporate most fatty acids in their phospholipids, preferentially in phosphatidylcholine. Notably, docosahexaenic acid (C 22 : 6) levels in phospholipids increase from trace amounts to 5 - 10 mol % after a few hours. We then compared the plasma membrane elastic properties during incubation with C 18 : 1 or C 22 : 6. The cells were cultured on L-shaped fibronectin micropatterns and a membrane tubule was pulled from the cell hypothenus using optical tweezers. C 22 : 6 caused a gradual 2 -fold decrease within an hour of both the pulling force (F) and the tube radius (R) whereas C 18 : 1 caused only modest changes. From these measurements, we conclude that the bending modulus (which depends on the FxR product) strongly decreases with phospholipid polyunsaturation, whereas the tension of the plasma membrane (which depends on the F/R ratio) is mostly unaffected. These results are in good agreement with studies performed on model phospholipid membranes (Biophys J 79, 328 - 39). We currently investigate how phospholipid <b>insaturation</b> affects the ability of specialized protein machineries involved in transport vesicle formation in RPE 1 cells, focusing on the impact of C 22 : 6 compared to C 18 : 1 on the rates of transferrin and EGF endocytosis...|$|E
40|$|Com a finalidade de esclarecer os efeitos da adição de óleo vegetal e mineral aos acaricidas foi conduzido um ensaio de campo em 1994 no município de Viradouro, SP, utilizando-se de Assist, Triona e Natur'l Óleo, na dosagem de 500 mL por 100 litros de água, adicionados aos acaricidas: {{pyridaben}} nas formulações 200 CE e 750 PM, nas dosagens de 75 mL e 20 g; propargite 720 CE a 100 mL; óxido de fenbutatina 500 SC a 80 mL e cyhexatin 500 PM a 50 g. O delineamento estatístico adotado foi o de blocos casualizados. As aplicações foram feitas com pulverizador tipo pistola. Após a preparação da calda, foi determinado o pH. Empregou-se máquina de varredura e microscópio estereoscópico para as avaliações da população acarina. A adição de Natur'l Óleo pode afetar negativamente a eficiência do pyridaben 200 CE e 750 PM e cyhexatin 500 PM, no controle do ácaro-da-leprose. Triona e Assist não afetaram as eficiências dos acaricidas testados. Pelo índice de iodo, mediu-se o grau de insaturação das misturas dos acaricidas com Natur'l Óleo, concluindo-se que houve incorporação das moléculas dos acaricidas pelas ligações insaturadas do óleo; porém, isto não explica o diferente comportamento dos produtos no controle do ácaro da leprose dos citros. Aiming {{to study}} the influence of adition of oil to acaricides, a field experiment was conducted in 1994, at Viradouro, SP, using Assist, Triona and Natur'l Óleo, in dosages of 500 mL per 100 liters of water, added to the acaricides: pyridaben (formulations 200 EC and 750 WP) at 75 mL and 20 g; propargite 720 EC at 100 mL; fenbutatine oxide 500 SC at 80 mL; and cyhexatin 500 WP at 50 g. The experimental design used was randomized blocks. The applications were carried out by a gun sprayer. After {{the preparation of the}} solution, the pH was determined. The brushing machine and the steroscopic microscope were used to estimate the mite populations. The addition of Natur'l Óleo can affect negatively the efficiency of acaricides in the control of the citrus leprosis mite, as occured with pyridaben 200 EC and 750 WP and cyhexatin 500 WP. Triona and Assist did not affect the efficiency of the acaricides tested. The <b>insaturation</b> level of the acaricide mistures with Natur'l Óleo was measured using the iodine index method indicating that there was incorporation of the acaricide molecules by the insaturated links of the oil; however, this doesn't explain the different behavior of the products in the control of the citrus leprosis mite...|$|E
