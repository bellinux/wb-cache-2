CRESTA zones regard the distribution of <b>insured</b> <b>values</b> within a region or country for easier assessment of risks.

40|$|Windstorms {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{damaging}} natural hazards in Western and Central Europe. A recent example was the windstorm series in winter 2013 / 2014, which affected primarily Great Britain. This indicates the importance of the estimation of potential losses linked to extreme windstorms as well as their return periods for present and future climate conditions. In particular, the occurrence of groups of windstorms (clustering) is of high interest, as they cause the top year losses. The present thesis consists of three studies. The first study quantifies the intensity of individual storms by potential losses estimated with empirical models. One model considers only impacts due to wind speeds (MI), while another also includes population density information as proxy for <b>insured</b> <b>values</b> within an area (LI). The models are applied to reanalysis data and general circulation model (GCM) data for recent (20 C: 1960 - 2000) and future climate conditions for three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate scenarios (B 1, A 1 B, A 2 : 2060 - 2100).

40|$|Liquidity shocks are a core {{risk of the}} {{business}} model of commercial banks, which is founded on a liquidity mismatch between the banks' liabilities and assets. A substantial part of the banks' funding comes from short-term retail and wholesale funding, whilst {{a substantial part of}} the assets are long-term and illiquid loans. This {{is the source of the}} banks' profits, but also of their claim to fulfil an important social role. Having argued that leaving the solution to this problem to the banks alone is unsafe, this article turns to examine three regulatory strategies for reducing the incidence of liquidity shocks or making banks more resilient to them. They are: regulating the level of banks' liquidity reserves, <b>insuring</b> the <b>value</b> of the banks' long-term assets and guaranteeing the discharge of the banks' short-term liabilities. The criteria of assessment are the least impact on the banks' social role of transforming short-term deposits into long-term loans, coupled with the least incentive for banks to take excessive risk, the least subsidy to banking and the least cost to the public purse. It is suggested that <b>insuring</b> the <b>value</b> of the banks' long-term assets emerges as the most attractive strategy...|$|R
6000|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, {{could the}} company's actuary know that the man's house would last until he had paid in more than its <b>insured</b> <b>value</b> in premiums--more, that is to say, than the company {{would have to pay}} back? He could not, but from his {{statistics}} he could know how many houses in ten thousand of that kind burned in their first year, how many in their second, their third, and so on. That was all that he needed to know, the house-owners knowing nothing about it. He fixed his rates according to the facts, and the occasional loss of a bet in an individual instance did not affect the certainty of a general winning. Like other professional gamblers, the company expected to lose sometimes, yet knew {{that in the long run}} it must win; which meant that in any special case it would probably win. With a thousand gambling games open to him in which the chances were equal, the infatuated dupe chose to [...] "sit into" [...] one where they were against him! Deceived by the cappers' fairy tales, dazed by the complex and incomprehensible [...] "calculations" [...] put forth for his undoing, and having ever in the ear of his imagination the crackle and roar of the impoverishing flames, he grasped at the hope of beating--in an unwelcome way, it is true--"the man that kept the table." [...] He must have known for a certainty that if the company could afford to insure him he could not afford to let it. He must have known that the whole body of the insured paid to the insurers more than the insurers paid to them; otherwise the business could not have been conducted. This they cheerfully admitted; indeed, they proudly affirmed it. In fact, insurance companies were the only professional gamblers that had the incredible hardihood to parade their enormous winnings as an inducement to play against their game. These winnings ("assets," [...] they called them) proved their ability, they said, to pay when they lost; and that was indubitably true. What they did not prove, unfortunately, was the will to pay, which from the imperfect court records of the period that have come down to us, appears frequently to have been lacking. Gakler relates that in the instance of the city of San Francisco (somewhat doubtfully identified by Macronus as the modern fishing-village of Gharoo) the disinclination of the insurance companies to pay their bets had the most momentous consequences.|$|E

John Moore, the managing director of Marstrand's, stated that he had expected Orsborne to take Girl Pat fishing in an area of the North Sea where another Marstrand vessel was fishing successfully. When Moore was cross-examined, the defence's [...] "serious allegations" [...] were revealed. It was put to Moore that he had instructed George Orsborne not to go fishing, but {{to get rid of the}} vessel so that the company could claim its insurance value, of which Orsborne would be rewarded with a share. The defence alleged that the company was in poor financial shape, and that its ships were heavily mortgaged. Moore denied that he had made any such suggestion to Orsborne. The company, he insisted, was financially sound, the mortgages on its vessels were relatively low, and he had never discussed <b>insured</b> <b>values</b> with Orsborne. The defence further alleged that when taken out Girl Pat had been in an unseaworthy condition, inadequately provisioned and unfit for a normal fishing voyage. This suggestion was also denied by Moore.|$|R
40|$|In the {{reinsurance}} industry different probabilistic {{models are}} currently used for seismic risk analysis. A credible loss {{estimation of the}} <b>insured</b> <b>values</b> depends on seismic hazard analysis and on the vulnerability functions of the given structures. Besides attenuation and local soil amplification, the earthquake occurrence model (often represented by the Gutenberg and Richter relation) {{is a key element}} in the analysis. However, earthquake catalogues are usually incomplete, the time of observation is too short and the data themselves contain errors. Therefore, a and b values can only be estimated with uncertainties. The knowledge of their variation provides a valuable input for earthquake risk analysis, because they allow the probability distribution of expected losses (expressed by Average Annual Loss (AAL)) to be modelled. The variations of a and b have a direct effect on the estimated exceeding probability and consequently on the calculated loss level. This effect is best illustrated by exceeding probability versus loss level and AAL versus magnitude graphs. The sensitivity of average annual losses due to different a to b ratios and magnitudes is obvious. The estimation of the variation of a and b and the quantification of the sensitivity of calculated losses are fundamental for optimal earthquake risk management. Ignoring these uncertainties means that risk management decisions neglect possible variations of the earthquake loss estimations...|$|R

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} in order to estimate insurance-related losses caused by coastal flooding in France. The deterministic part of the model aims at identifying the potentially flood-impacted sectors and the subsequent insured losses {{a few days after}} the occurrence of a storm surge event on any part of the French coast. This deterministic component is a combination of three models: a hazard model, a vulnerability model, and a damage model. The first model uses the PREVIMER system to estimate the water level resulting from the simultaneous occurrence of a high tide and a surge caused by a meteorological event along the coast. A storage-cell flood model propagates these water levels over the land and thus determines the probable inundated areas. The vulnerability model, for its part, is derived from the insurance schedules and claims database, combining information such as risk type, class of business, and <b>insured</b> <b>values.</b> The outcome of the vulnerability and hazard models are then combined with the damage model to estimate the event damage and potential insured losses. This system shows satisfactory results in the estimation of the magnitude of the known losses related to the flood caused by the Xynthia storm. However, it also appears very sensitive to the water height estimated during the flood period, conditioned by the junction between seawater levels and coastal topography, the accuracy for which is still limited by the amount of information in the system...|$|R

40|$|Characteristics of {{the risk}} {{landscape}} have not changed radically. The major insurance hazards are still earthquake, windstorm, and flood. However, recent experiences suggest a change in profile from a few major losses to more frequent, less severe impacts, {{at least in terms}} of insurance costs. <b>Insured</b> <b>values</b> at risk are increasingly located in hazard-prone areas, and modern business practices mean that impact can be more economically severe as company operations become increasingly interdependent. At the same time, business interruption, as a class of insurance, has not been one of the insurance industry’s strengths, although increasing dependence on technology and networks heightens risk exposure. Nevertheless, in the midst of this, our perspective {{of the risk}} landscape is changing. The willingness and ability of companies to retain more of their own risk is increasing; and holders of risk are increasingly seeing less reason to differentiate between insurable risks, financial risks, and operational risks. Instead, they are looking to harmonise their treatment of risk: ‘Risk is risk’. Thus, corporations are combining insurance risks into multi-line or integrated programs. Similarly, insurance companies are increasingly taking a balance sheet view of their risks, managing underwriting and investment exposures in tandem rather than separately. As financial and underwriting risks come closer together, capital markets are more willing to underwrite risk directly. At the same time, capital has become mobile to the point of being global and over plentiful, as low interest rates show. This availability of capital has changed the nature of insurance, precipitating merger and acquisition activity. Hence, the main challenges to the insurance industry are determined by this combination of risk and capital...|$|R
