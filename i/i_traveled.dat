5|$|When Vardanes II of Parthia {{rebelled against}} his father Vologeses I in 55AD, Vologeses withdrew his forces from Armenia. Rome quickly {{attempted}} {{to fill the}} political vacuum left behind. In the Roman–Parthian War of 58–63AD, the commander Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo achieved some military successes against the Parthians while installing Tigranes VI of Armenia as a Roman client. However, Corbulo's successor Lucius Caesennius Paetus was soundly defeated by Parthian forces and fled Armenia. Following a peace treaty, Tiridates <b>I</b> <b>traveled</b> to Naples and Rome in 63 AD. At both sites the Roman emperor Nero (r.54–68AD) ceremoniously crowned him king of Armenia by placing the royal diadem on his head.|$|E

500|$|With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto {{wanted to}} take the idea of a game [...] "world" [...] even further, giving players a [...] "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer." [...] He drew his {{inspiration}} from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, and through the Zelda titles he always tries to impart to players some of the sense of exploration and limitless wonder he felt. [...] "When I was a child," [...] he said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When <b>I</b> <b>traveled</b> around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] The memory of being lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family's home in Sonobe was recreated in Zeldas labyrinth dungeons.|$|E

2500|$|I reached some plains so vast, that I did {{not find}} their limit {{anywhere}} I went, although <b>I</b> <b>traveled</b> over them for more than 300 leagues ... with no more land marks than {{if we had been}} swallowed up by the sea ... there was not a stone, nor bit of rising ground, nor a tree, nor a shrub, nor anything to go by.|$|E
2500|$|His next band, The Royal Pythons ("a gang {{that turned}} into a musical group"), was not a success either. Said DeVille: [...] "I {{decided to go to}} San Francisco; there was nothing really {{happening}} in New York. Flower power was dead. All the day-glo paint was peeling off the walls. People were shooting speed. I mean, it was real Night of the Living Dead. So I bought a truck and headed out west. <b>I</b> <b>traveled</b> all around the country for a couple of years, looking for musicians who had heart, instead of playing 20-minute guitar solos, which is pure ego." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2015 interview, Sundfør {{stated that}} {{she was working on}} the album, calling it [...] "very cosmic" [...] and added {{that a lot of the}} {{inspiration}} for it came from reading the book A Universe from Nothing. The album was mainly inspired by a journey Sundfør made, [...] "travelling across continents to contrary environments and politically contrasting worlds from North Korea to the Amazon jungle." [...] She stated: [...] " [...] made me focus on something other than myself; it made me curious and hungry for new impressions and new motives for my photography. It's hard to pinpoint exactly how it affected my music, but all experiences are potentially inspiring for creativity. I didn't travel to write; <b>I</b> <b>traveled</b> to take pictures, which to me is an important part of the album. that emptiness is the place where things start to grow. Most of the universe is empty. So, I'm not afraid of that anymore." [...] She said the album is about how [...] "we are living in a time of great changes. Everything is moving so rapidly, sometimes violently, sometimes dauntingly. I think a lot of people experience anxiety these days. I wanted to address these emotions on the album." [...] She also cited American poet Robert Bly's 1980 anthology News of the Universe as one of the album's inspirations.|$|E

2500|$|As Nintendo {{released}} its first home video game console, the Family Computer (rereleased in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System), Miyamoto made {{two of the}} most momentous titles for the console and in the history of video games as a whole: Super Mario Bros. (a sequel to Mario Bros.) and The Legend of Zelda (an entirely original title). In both games, Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores, unlike many games of the time. Super Mario Bros. largely took a linear approach, with the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. By contrast, Miyamoto employed nonlinear gameplay in The Legend of Zelda, forcing the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles. The world was expansive and seemingly endless, offering [...] "an array of choice and depth never seen before in a video game." [...] With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto sought to make an in-game world that players would identify with, a [...] "miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer." [...] He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves; each Zelda title embodies this sense of exploration. [...] "When I was a child," [...] Miyamoto said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When <b>I</b> <b>traveled</b> around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this." [...] He recreated his memories of becoming lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family home in Zeldas labyrinthine dungeons. In February 1986, Nintendo released the game as the launch title for the Nintendo Entertainment System's new Disk System peripheral.|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} looking into this matter. Last year <b>I</b> <b>traveled</b> twenty {{thousand}} miles, almost entirely by rail; the year before, <b>I</b> <b>traveled</b> over twenty-five thousand miles, half by sea and half by rail; and the year before that <b>I</b> <b>traveled</b> {{in the neighborhood of}} ten thousand miles, exclusively by rail. I suppose if I put in all the little odd journeys here and there, I may say I have traveled sixty thousand miles during the three years I have mentioned. AND NEVER AN ACCIDENT.|$|E
