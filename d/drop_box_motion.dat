25|$|The Sowden worsted coating loom: {{as in all}} {{mechanical}} devices, {{there is}} drive to improve efficiency, and this loom has several patent innovations. For example, the 28 shaft negative square dobby is similar in construction to Hattersley's Keighley dobby. However, to allow the shuttle more time {{to pass through the}} shed the dobby has special curved slots that allow the shafts to dwell or remain open for longer. In addition, the pattern chain or lags controlling the shafts can be set to control all 28 shafts, or set to operate the first sixteen shafts to weave the cloth and the remaining twelve shafts to produce a name list or selvedge. The word selvedge is derived from self-edge, the edge of the cloth where the weft is turned back as it returns through the shed. The selvedge would often have a brand name or the country of origin woven into it. On {{the left side of the}} loom is the patent four-shuttle <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> <b>motion</b> incorporating a foot pedal. This is part of an escape mechanism in case the shuttle becomes trapped.|$|E
50|$|Drop bucket or <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> is a {{container}} {{located in a}} slot machine's base where excess coins are diverted from the hopper. Typically, a drop bucket is used for low denomination slot machines and a <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> is used for high denomination slot machines. A <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> contains a hinged lid {{with one or more}} locks whereas a drop bucket does not contain a lid. The contents of drop buckets and <b>drop</b> <b>boxes</b> are collected and counted by the casino on a scheduled basis.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to review the {{procedure}} of <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> system viewed from its implementation system and measure the level of delivery effectiveness of yearly SPT for the taxpayers before and after using <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> system in KPP Pratama, South Malang by counting the effectiveness ratio; it is by comparing between the realization of delivering yearly SPT for the taxpayers with the delivery target of yearly SPT for the taxpayers. This study uses secondary data; it is about delivery manner and management of yearly SPT for the taxpayers by using <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> system, the number of listed taxpayers, the number of delivering yearly SPT and the target and the realization of delivering yearly SPT before (2008) and after (2009) by using <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> system. Steps conducted in obtaining the data are all by using documentation. Analysis technique conducted in this study is by calculating the effectiveness ratio of delivering yearly SPT before and and after using <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> system. From the result of the study it can be concluded that <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> system implemented in the Tax Office (KPP) Pratama, South Malang there is weaknesses and constrains on its implementation system faced by tax official in conducting delivery system of yearly SPT for the taxpayers by using <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> system. In the analysis of effectiveness level on delivery system of yearly SPT before using <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> system, it can be said that it is less effective because there are weaknesses, yet it is effective in its implementation. To analyze the level of effectiveness in delivering yearly SPT after using <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> system then, it can be said as effective for individual taxpayers and less effective for body, yet less effective in its implementation...|$|R

40|$|Sharing and {{inappropriate}} discarding of syringes {{and drug use}} equipment can lead to transmission of bloodborne pathogens and decreased sense of community safety. To reduce these risks, interventions such as syringe <b>drop</b> <b>boxes,</b> are implemented. However, little consideration {{has been made of}} the social and spatial networks of the injection drug use (IDU) populations in the placement of these <b>drop</b> <b>boxes.</b> A sample of IDU was obtained through respondent driven sampling in Winnipeg, Canada in 2009. Characteristics of the sample and distribution of these characteristics through the social network were assessed. A spatial network was constructed which focused on the connections between IDU and specific geographic locations. Measures of centrality were calculated using Pajek and the geographic network was mapped using ArcGIS. Analysis of the social network revealed variation among network components in demographic and drug use characteristics. Spatial analysis revealed geographic clustering, quantified through network centrality measures. There was congruence between locations of high degree and current <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> placement in Winnipeg. This research illustrates the benefit of combining IDU social network and spatial data to inform evidence-based municipal policies and programs...|$|R

Butters, {{who has been}} {{following}} them, offers to guide the remaining party members to the store in a thinly veiled attempt to get the tape back. Soon all the boys wind up at the Two Towers, and with the 6th graders in hot pursuit they desperately try to return the tape to the <b>drop</b> <b>box.</b> When Butters refuses {{to let go of}} it, Kyle throws him and the tape into the <b>drop</b> <b>box.</b> Angered at losing their movie, the 6th graders, now acting as Ringwraiths, threaten to beat the boys up, but flee when the parents arrive. The parents then go into a long discussion with the astonished boys about sex, touching on such subjects as 69ing and double penetration. The boys, who never actually watched the movie that their parents are so graphically describing, are speechless. The episode ends with a view of Butters, clutching his [...] "precious" [...] among a pile of other returned tapes in the <b>drop</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

Dropbox was arguably the first cloud storage service that promoted mass adoption thanks to a referral program and an intuitive interface. Dropbox cemented its place on our mobile devices with a range of capable apps, and developers have figured out ways to use it for all kinds of purposes: server backups, Google Docs sync and browser add-ons, to name just three. But with Dropbox, there’s one challenge: privacy. In this paper we discuss the overview of various encryption algorithms or programs for <b>drop</b> <b>box</b> encryption...|$|R
