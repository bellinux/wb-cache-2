25|$|In one of {{the more}} {{peculiar}} battles of the war, a hundred year old fortification, manned by recruits and pensioners and armed with 40- to 50-year-old weaponry of German and Austro-Hungarian manufacture had destroyed a ship so new, its crew was still finishing training. Oscarsborg had <b>fulfilled</b> <b>its</b> <b>mission</b> and denied an invader the way to the capital. Even though it and the country ultimately were captured and occupied, the effects of delaying the German advance were immediate and considerable. On board Blücher were troops specially designated to capture the King, the Norwegian cabinet, the Storting (Norwegian Parliament) and the national gold reserve; the delay made it possible for all these to escape from Oslo. Later on 9 April, the Storting was able to convene at Elverum and give the cabinet a wide authorization to govern until a Storting could again assemble. Thus, the Norwegian government was able to continue the defence of Norway until it had evacuated to exile in the United Kingdom on 7 June, with the Norwegian Army laying down their arms on 10 June.|$|E
500|$|The regiment, reunited on the Volos road, {{retreated to}} the Thermopylae Line. On 21 April it was ordered to patrol Euboea but its {{vehicles}} were too badly damaged to do so. The regiment, less A Squadron, was instructed instead to screen Kriekouki under Lieutenant Colonel Clifton, to cover the retreat of the 4th NZ Brigade; A Squadron was detached to screen {{the withdrawal of the}} 1st Armoured Brigade at Chalkis. By the evening of 25 April, Div Cav had <b>fulfilled</b> <b>its</b> <b>mission</b> and retreated beyond the village of Mazi. In the evening, Div Cav was ordered to guard the Corinth Canal bridge; A Squadron retreated with the 1st Armoured Brigade to Malakasa. A and B Squadrons retreated to Rafina Beach, embarking on the supply ship [...] One hundred and fifty men from the regiment were left behind and were taken out by [...] on the night of 27 April. CSquadron, caught in the German paratroop attack on Corinth, was forced to abandon its vehicles. It marched to Nafplion for embarkation but the ship they were scheduled to board was full and the squadron instead set off for Crete in caïques.|$|E

The unhealthy nature of the site; {{the quantity and quality of}} the children's food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils' wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.|$|E

60|$|Of {{the greatness}} of this man, to my mind, {{there can be no}} doubt. When the point of time whereon we stand and play our {{separate}} parts has receded, and those who follow us look back into the grey mist which veils the past; when that mist has hidden the glitter of the decorations and deadened the echoes of the high-sounding titles of to-day; when our political tumults, our town-bred excitements, and many of the very names that are household words to us, are forgotten, or discoverable only in the pages of history; when, perhaps, the Salvation Army itself has <b>fulfilled</b> <b>its</b> <b>mission</b> and gone its road, I am certain that the figure of William Booth will abide clearly visible in those shadows, and that the influences of his work will remain, if not still felt, at least remembered and honoured. He {{will be one of the}} few, of the very few enduring figures of our day; and even if our civilization should be destined to undergo eclipse for a period, as seems possible, when the light returns, by it he will still be seen.|$|E
6000|$|Fortunately for her, the {{children}} were sleepy, and were rather in a mazy state when lifted out and set on their legs in the wainscoted hall, and she sent them at once with nurse to the cheerful room that Humfrey's little visitors had saved from becoming disused. Miss Wells's fond vigilance was a little oppressive, but she gently freed herself from it, and opened the study door. She had begged that as little change as possible might be made; and there stood, as she had last seen them, the large leathern chair, the little table, the big Bible, and in it the little faded marker she had herself constructed for his twenty-first birthday, when her powers of making presents had not equalled her will. Yet what costly gift could have <b>fulfilled</b> <b>its</b> <b>mission</b> like that one? She opened the heavy book at the place. It was at the first lesson for {{the last day of}} his life, the end of the prophet Hosea, and the first words her eyes fell upon were the glorious prophecy--'I will redeem them from death, I will ransom them from the power of the grave.' Her heart beat high, and she stood half musing, half reading: 'They that dwell under His shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine.' How gentle and refreshing the cadence! A longing rose up in her to apply those latter words more closely, by placing them on his tablet; she did not think they would shock his humility, a consideration which had withheld her from choosing other passages of which she always thought in connection with him. Another verse, and she read: 'Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?' ...|$|E

As an infantrysupport tank, designed to support infantry in breakthrough operations, the T-28 generally was successful for an early 1930s design.|$|E
