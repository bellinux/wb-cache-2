5|$|The dam was {{expected}} to provide 10% of China's power. However, <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> has increased more quickly than previously projected. Even fully operational, on average, it supports only about 1.7% of <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> in China {{in the year of}} 2011, when the Chinese <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> reached 4692.8 TWh.|$|E
5|$|Demand for {{electricity}} grows with great rapidity {{as a nation}} modernises and its economy develops. The United States showed a 12% increase in demand during each year {{of the first three}} decades of the twentieth century, a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of India or China. Historically, the growth rate for <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> has outstripped that for other forms of energy.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lanka's <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> is {{currently}} met by nine thermal power stations, fifteen large hydroelectric power stations, and fifteen wind farms, {{with a smaller}} share from small hydro facilities and other renewables such as solar. Most hydroelectric and thermal/fossil fuel–based power stations {{in the country are}} owned and/or operated by the government via the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), while the renewable energy sector consists mostly of privately run plants operating on a power purchase agreement with the CEB.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles, {{all of which have}} an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone. The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile, most of the land being farmed. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and marine energy resources are of growing importance, and the island generates more than its total yearly <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> using renewables. The local people are known as Orcadians and have a distinctive dialect of Scots and a rich inheritance of folklore. There is an abundance of marine and avian wildlife.|$|E
5|$|The Energy Savings Trust has {{estimated}} that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the UK's <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> by 2050 although {{only a fraction of}} this would come from renewable sources. The current Scottish output is negligible. In May 2006 the then Communities Minister Malcolm Chisholm launched a Planning Advice Note aimed at promoting micro-renewables. Small-scale 'wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical storage heaters directly, have proven to be successful in remoter rural areas; as have various other local schemes such as air source heat pumps.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} demand projections, the Ministry of Energy and Mines {{estimates}} that <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> will increase between 5.6% and 7.4% per year between 2007-2015. It {{is expected that}} per capita <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> will reach 1,632 kWh in 2030.|$|E
25|$|In its 2005 , the OPA {{estimated}} that <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> will {{grow at a}} rate of 0.9% annually between 2006 and 2025, rising to approximately 170 TWh per year by 2025. This OPA estimate is nearly double the actual rate of <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> growth between 1990 and 2003 of 0.5% per year. In fact, the rate of growth in <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> in Ontario has been in decline since 1950. This was a result of the structural changes in the Ontario economy over this period, particularly the decline of heavy manufacturing and increased growth in the service and knowledge sectors.|$|E
25|$|Wind-generated {{electricity}} met nearly 4% {{of global}} <b>electricity</b> <b>demand</b> in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed.

50|$|The {{electricity}} {{needs in}} remote locations are usually small and highly variable. Large {{nuclear power plants}} are generally rather inflexible in their power generation capabilities.

40|$|Energy {{analysis}} and forecasting {{have always been}} the essential part of an efficient energy system planning and operation. This thesis presents the mathematical methods based on regression {{analysis and}} energy profiling for energy modelling and forecasting. Two applications of energy were analyzed such as energy heating <b>demands</b> and <b>electricity</b> <b>demands.</b> The methods are applied for the Energieversorgung Offenbach AG (EVO) in Gravenbruch and Offenbach at Germany, using 1995 and 2003 date. The models of energy heating demands were developed based on simple linear and multiple regression methods. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) are compared between two models. Two approaches to determine the typical energy profile are proposed. The two approaches use similar outdoor temperature for energy heating demand profiles and for <b>electricity</b> <b>demands</b> using similar <b>electricity</b> profile. The proposed approaches were able to determine the typical profiles of different type of day...|$|R
