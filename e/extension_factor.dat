For {{getting the}} {{parametric}} equation of random polygon, by the basic <b>extension</b> <b>factor</b> {{to stretch the}} round, there generates polygon of meeting the required conditions. Such algorithm overcomes the disadvantage in the generation of polygon from round under control of a single parameter and the complication of mathematical background. Firstly, a detailed introduction {{is given to the}} basic <b>extension</b> <b>factor</b> and the selection of relevant coefficient, and then the errors of such algorithm are analyzed. And the experimental result shows that the mathematical background of such method is relatively easy, the parameters are easy to control and constitute, and the generation of arbitrary polygon is available with high precision. Such the parametric equation of random polygon and method can be used in relevant fields such as geometric modeling, CAD/CAM, and computer graphics...|$|E

Two alternative differential receiver architectures are presented, a receiver based on a FX correlator (Fourier transformation before correlation) and based on an XF correlator (correlation before Fourier transformation). To reduce the complexity and hence the power consumption of both the ADC and the first digital processing stage single- or two bit quantization is used. The receiver based on the XF correlator is more suited to exploit such coarse quantization. Two basic effects are visible if coarse quantization is used. First, the BER performance is reduced due {{to the introduction of}} quantization errors. Second, beyond certain SNR levels, the BER performance does not increase due to the correlation between quantization errors. Furthermore, oversampling increases BER performance considerably. For single bit quantization with oversampling, acceptable BERs (< 10 − 3) {{can be achieved}} for a limited SNR range for symbol <b>extension</b> <b>factors</b> of 32 and 64. In case of two bit quantization without oversampling, the results are comparable with single bit quantization with two times oversampling.

[...] 1 pageWe {{present a}} new {{interpretation}} of {{the configuration of the}} geological domains and the processes of rifting forming the Tyrrhenian basin based on newly acquired geophysical data. The basin is not presently extending, but its crustal structure preserves information of the temporal evolution of rifting processes. We present P-wave velocity (Vp) models and seismic reflection images of data collected in a two-ship seismic experiment with Spanish R/V Sarmiento de Gamboa and the Italian R/V Urania carried out in spring 2010. We present five several-hundred-km-long wide-angle seismic (WAS) profiles crossing the entire basin at different transects and five Multichannel Seismic Reflection (MCS) profiles coincident with WAS profiles. The 5 transects provide the tectonic structure, the geometry of sedimentary deposits, and the Vp distribution of the crust and upper mantle. This information allows to interpret mechanisms of deformation, define the petrological nature and distribution of the geological domains, infer the importance and potential role of magmatism in the rifting process, and constrain the location of break up and the region of mantle exhumation. The basin has opened from north to south with different <b>extension</b> <b>factors.</b> The northern region stopped opening after a relatively low <b>extension</b> <b>factors,</b> but towards the south extension increased up to full crustal separation that produced first abundant magmatism and subsequently mantle exhumation in another region.

[...] 1 pageWe {{present a}} new {{interpretation}} {{of the creation of}} the geological domains and the processes forming the Tyrrhenian basin by rifting of Cratonic Variscan lithosphere. The basin is not presently extending, but its crustal structure preserves information of the temporal evolution of rifting processes. Our work is based on the tectonic structure and stratigraphy of over 3000 km of calibrated multichannel seismic data and full coverage multibeam bathymetry of the basin. From these data circa 2000 km are new and about 1000 are vintage data. The seismic data are used to understand the formation of the domains (continental, backarc magmatism, exhumed mantle) defined with our recently published, under review, or submitted 5 acrossthe-basin wide-angle reflection and refraction transects. The 5 transects provide the Vp distribution of the crustand upper mantle. This information has allowed defining the petrological nature and distribution of the geological domains, and to infer the importance of magmatism in the rifting process, to constrain the location of break up and the expanse of the region of mantle exhumation. The seismic reflection images have been interpreted to map in time and space the evolution of the deformation across the basin. We analyzed the tectonic structure and mapped the calibrated stratigraphy across the basin to understand the temporal evolution and styles of faulting processes. The stratigraphy provides also constraints on the rates at which the different processes of extension, magmatism, break up and mantle exhumation have occurred.
