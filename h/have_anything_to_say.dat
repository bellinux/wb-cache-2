5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does not <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he {{say anything about the}} following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have {{to be careful not to}} get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E
500|$|A 2002 live review quoted an {{overwhelmed}} Richards as {{telling his}} audience [...] "I don't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> tonight, there's {{too many of}} you". Another 2002 live review, however, stated that [...] "the band seemed both at ease and happy to be back" [...] when playing one of their first post-Strange Bird concerts. dB magazines Steven Hocking, {{in a review of}} the band's 2004 Drones & Vapid Ditties live DVD, said the band are [...] "either unable or unwilling to engage the large audience", and that they were [...] "just not very visually engaging" [...] live, when compared to the sound of their albums. Performances post-Moo, You Bloody Choir have earned more positive remarks, however, as Richards has focused on improving his stage presence. David Fricke of Rolling Stone lauded an Augie March concert he saw in New York, which assisted the band in making inroads in the United States.|$|E
60|$|I was cautioned in {{the usual}} manner and asked if I <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{evidence}} being concluded, Marcus {{was asked}} if he <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in defence.|$|R

500|$|Robbie Daw of Idolator, {{gave the}} song a mixed review, criticizing the singer's [...] "unnecessary Rihanna-esque vocal delivery" [...] while {{adding that it}} [...] "isn't the strongest lead single we've heard from an album." [...] Jessica Sager of Pop Crush rated it 0.5 out of 5 stars, {{comparing}} Furtado's vocals to the ones of a [...] "child wailing through a cardboard tube." [...] She also wrote that [...] "Sager {{also noted that the}} singer [...] "wants to depart from Loose as well, but she doesn’t <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> beyond getting dressed and having a guy ignore her" [...] and concluded that [...] "the song is more irritating than catchy, and the beat isn’t strong enough to make many people dance." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the song [...] "It’s a meaningless little ditty that is all about the military beat and bragging rights. It doesn’t have enough of a hook to work its way up the radio charts, but will likely do very well in the clubs.|$|E
2500|$|Both as a rower {{and as a}} rowing coach, Courtney {{was known}} for his {{distinctive}} stroke. This style of rowing would become known as the Courtney Stroke. The most evident trait of the stroke is the positioning of the back. The back is always kept in a very straight position. Courtney is quoted as saying, [...] "No kink in the back if I <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it." [...] He kept the back straight to allow the lungs to work without difficulty with no strain on the abdominal muscles. His idea was influenced by watching famous professional rower Harry Coulter in 1870 at Buffalo, New York.|$|E
2500|$|Tony Kubek {{initially}} {{had trouble}} {{adjusting to the}} world of broadcasting. Although he had a lot to say, he was gangling, he tended to stutter, and he talked too fast. Gowdy soon suggested to Kubek that he should work in the off-season to improve his delivery. Kubek bought a tape recorder and took to reading poetry aloud for 20 minutes a day. In 1968, Kubek wowed as a World Series field reporter. Pee Wee Reese, who was soon fired by NBC (and replaced by Kubek as the top analyst) said of Kubek [...] "He wormed his way around, but I wasn't bitter. I just think if you don't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> you should shut your mouth." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} {{question}} whether the prisoner <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> wherefore judgment should not be passed upon him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Farebrother {{has just}} sent up a message <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that he wants}} to speak to me. He is below. I thought you might like to know he was there, if you <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As an ambassador," [...] Wingrave said coldly, [...] "you are not {{acceptable}} to me. It {{is a matter}} which I could only discuss with Lady Ruth herself. If Lady Ruth <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me, I will hear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to you!" [...] he repeated, and {{his whole}} tone seemed {{vibrating}} with hardly subdued passion. [...] "If I <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to you! Is this your greeting?" ...|$|E
60|$|No {{woman is}} a genius. Women are a {{decorative}} sex. They never <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> but they say it charmingly.|$|E
6000|$|He laughed shrewdly. “Not {{as long as}} our old hunters <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it. I’m {{dividing}} {{amongst them}} a dollar a skin for all the skins shot by our new hunters. At least half of their enthusiasm to-day was due to that. Oh, no, there won’t be any escaping if they <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it. And now you’d better get for’ard to your hospital duties. There must be a full ward waiting for you.” ...|$|E
60|$|Bartley had by {{this time}} {{made up his mind}} that, if Witherby <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him, he should say it unaided.|$|R
6000|$|... [Undecided.] There's {{no denying}} that she was hysterical. If he'd only treated me like a gentleman, I shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Naturally," [...] Bellamy answered. [...] "If Mademoiselle really <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you, I will, if I am permitted, {{return for}} a moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About Bell?" [...] said Mrs Dale, {{as though}} much {{surprised}} that he should <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to her respecting her eldest daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, mistress," [...] {{says the}} lawyer, tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece. [...] "If you <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> say it, say it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have heard}} Miss Murdstone,' said Mr. Spenlow, turning to me. 'I beg to ask, Mr. Copperfield, if you <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in reply?' ...|$|E
60|$|Wrayson bowed {{but said}} nothing. If Madame de Melbain <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him, he {{preferred}} to afford her the opportunity of an attentive silence.|$|R
60|$|Then Mr. Carson {{turned to}} Hendrika, {{who stood in}} sullen silence, her eyes fixed upon the ground, and {{asked her if she}} <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "What do you say, Samway?" [...] asked Boldwood, {{somewhat}} sharply. [...] "If you <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> speak out; if not, get {{up another}} dance." ...|$|E
6000|$|The marquis {{glared at}} him {{and then turned to}} his mother. [...] "Can Mr. Newman {{possibly}} <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that is worth our listening to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's like {{lying in}} a well,' said Mrs Sparkler, {{changing}} her position fretfully. 'Dear me, Edmund, if you <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> why don't you say it?' ...|$|E
50|$|Additional {{books that}} <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the interrelationship, that {{pronounce}} that romance {{is the basis}} of the ballad, include Katharine Mary Briggs's folk-tale dictionary of 1971, and others.|$|R
60|$|They {{were lost}} on Squeers, however, whose gaze was {{fastened}} on the luckless Smike, as he inquired, according to custom in such cases, whether he <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for himself.|$|R
60|$|Herrick {{took up his}} parable, {{lying on}} his face and {{speaking}} slowly and scarce above his breath, not like a man who <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but like one talking against time.|$|R

6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} the people of the lugger <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in the matter," [...] {{answered}} Ithuel, in the most unmoved manner. [...] "If they had, I knew nothing on't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it seems}} mair {{reasonable}} to me now, that you, Bailie, or anybody that <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> against me, should prove my guilt, and no to be bidding me prove my innocence." ...|$|R
