Prospective non-randomized assessor-blind comparative trial. This study included 80 patients undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy of large uterine myomas (≥ 8 cm). Forty patients were treated {{with a combination of}} oral letrozole (2. 5 mg/day) and norethindrone acetate (2. 5 mg/day) continuously in the three months prior to surgery (group A) and 40 patients received no treatment before surgery (group B). The total operative time (mean±SD, range) was significantly lower in group A (121. 5 ± 19. 9 min; 89 - 181 min) than in group B (134. 4 ± 16. 8 min; 111 - 185 min; p< 0. 001). The time required to close the <b>hysterotomies</b> (mean±SD, range) was lower in group A (27. 1 ± 5. 1 min; 16 - 39 min) than in group B (37. 1 ± 9. 6 min; 17 - 57 min; p< 0. 001). The intraoperative blood loss (mean±SD, range) was lower in group A (271. 0 ± 125. 6 ml; 95 - 625 ml) than in group B (460. 4 ± 205. 7 ml; 180 - 1115 ml; p< 0. 001). No major complication occurred in any case. The cleavage plane was better defined in group B compared with group A (p< 0. 001). The quality of the myometrial scar, defined by ultrasound evaluation, was similar in the two study groups both at one-week (p= 0. 356) and at 3 -month follow-up (p= 0. 201). The total operative time, the time required to close the <b>hysterotomies</b> and the intraoperative blood loss significantly decrease after preoperative treatment with letrozole.

40|$|Aims: to {{evaluate}} the Expression of NSE and AFI before and after relieving ureteral obstruction in fatal lamb’s lungs with unilateral hydronephrosis. Study Design and Subjects: Forty-five pregnant lambs were randomly divided into 3 groups. Eighteen lambs were in the hydronephrotic model group. The second group included 9 lambs in which ureteral obstruction was relieved 3 weeks after the initial operation. Eighteen lambs were {{in the control group}} which was just performed open <b>hysterotomies.</b> Outcome measures: The amniotic fluid index (AFI) and the expression of neuronspecific enolase (NSE) in the lungs were tested. Results: In the hydronephrotic model group, the AFI was less and the expression of NSE was greater than the control group. The AFI and expression of NSE were similar to the control group after relieving the ureteral obstruction. Conclusions: The AFI and expression of NSE return to normal after after relieving the ureteral obstruction, which meant that relieving ureteral obstruction is perhaps beneficial to lung development...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hysterotomy</b> {{abortion}} {{is a form}} of abortion in which the uterus is opened through an abdominal incision and the fetus is removed, similar to a caesarean section, but requiring a smaller incision. As major abdominal surgery, <b>hysterotomy</b> is performed under general anaesthesia, and is only used in rare situations where less invasive procedures have failed or are medically inadvisable (such {{as in the case of}} placenta accreta).|$|E
50|$|This {{method has}} the {{greatest}} risk of complications {{out of all the}} abortion procedures. Health officials in the United States warned practitioners against performing <b>hysterotomy</b> abortion in an outpatient setting after it led to the deaths of two women in New York during 1971.

50|$|A {{resuscitative}} <b>hysterotomy,</b> {{also referred}} to as a perimortem Caesarean section (PMCS) or perimortem Caesarean delivery (PMCD), is a <b>hysterotomy</b> performed to resuscitate a woman in middle to late pregnancy who has entered cardiac arrest. Combined with a laparotomy, the procedure results in a Caesarean section that removes the fetus, thereby abolishing the aortocaval compression caused by the pregnant uterus. This improves the mother's chances of return of spontaneous circulation, and may potentially also deliver a viable neonate. The procedure may be performed by obstetricians, emergency physicians or surgeons depending on the situation.|$|E

50|$|During {{pregnancy}} when a {{woman is}} lying on her back, the uterus may compress the inferior vena cava and thus decrease venous return. It is therefore recommended that the uterus be pushed to the woman's left; {{if this is not}} effective, either roll the woman 30° or healthcare professionals should consider emergency resuscitative <b>hysterotomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The American Heart Association first added {{resuscitative}} <b>hysterotomy</b> to its recommended {{guidelines for}} cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiac care in 1992, based on limited case report evidence. Many case reports {{have since been}} published reporting that, in maternal cardiac arrest, evacuation of the uterus {{is often associated with}} abrupt return of spontaneous circulation or other improvement in the mother's condition.|$|E
50|$|A {{resuscitative}} <b>hysterotomy,</b> {{also known}} as a peri-mortem caesarean delivery, is an emergency caesarean delivery carried out where maternal cardiac arrest has occurred, to assist in resuscitation of the mother by removing the aortocaval compression generated by the gravid uterus.

50|$|Other than a scalpel, no {{specialised}} surgical {{equipment is}} needed for a resuscitative <b>hysterotomy.</b> The American Heart Association recommends that healthcare facilities that {{may be required to}} treat a case of maternal cardiac arrest should keep in stock an emergency equipment tray for the purpose, including a scalpel with a No. 10 blade, a Balfour retractor, surgical sponges, Kelly and Russian forceps, a needle driver, sutures and suture scissors - but the procedure should commence regardless of whether the tray is available.|$|E
50|$|Open fetal {{surgery is}} similar in many respects to a normal cesarean section {{performed}} under general anesthesia, except that the fetus remains dependent on the placenta and is returned to the uterus. A <b>hysterotomy</b> is performed on the pregnant woman, and once the uterus is open and the fetus is exposed, the fetal surgery begins. Typically, this surgery consists of an interim procedure intended to allow the fetus to remain in utero until it has matured enough to survive delivery and neonatal surgical procedures.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{decision}} to operate has been made, the procedure should be performed immediately at the site where cardiac arrest has taken place and standard basic and advanced life support resuscitation methods should continue throughout. These should include manual displacement of the uterus towards the patient's left side, to reduce aortocaval compression. If the arrest occurs in a healthcare facility that has staff on site {{who are capable of}} performing a resuscitative <b>hysterotomy</b> (such as at a hospital), the patient should not be moved to an operating theatre as this will delay the procedure. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests may need to be transported to a healthcare facility first if qualified staff are not immediately available.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1956, she and {{her lover}} Sheila (a pseudonym) moved into an {{apartment}} with Ginsberg and Orlovsky. At the time Cowen had {{a job as a}} typist. She was fired and was removed from the office by the police. She later told her close friend Leo Skir that one of the officers hit her in the stomach. When informed she had been arrested, her father said, [...] "This will kill your mother." [...] She then moved to San Francisco, attracted by its growing Beat scene. While in San Francisco, Cowen became pregnant and underwent a <b>hysterotomy</b> during a late-stage abortion. She returned to New York, and after another trip to California, she relocated to live in Manhattan.|$|E
50|$|Where {{cardiac arrest}} {{occurs in a}} {{pregnant}} woman, irrespective of {{the condition of the}} fetus, the procedure should be performed immediately if basic and advanced life support attempts are proving unsuccessful at achieving return of spontaneous circulation, and the woman's uterus is deemed capable of causing aortocaval compression. The threshold for this is passed when the uterus is so large that the fundus may be palpated {{at the level of the}} woman's umbilicus; for a singleton pregnancy, this occurs at around 20 weeks of gestational age (but may be earlier in multiple pregnancy). Although <b>hysterotomy</b> is crucial for resuscitation of the mother in such situations, if the gestational age is less than approximately 24 to 25 weeks the procedure will necessarily lead to sacrifice of the fetus (or fetuses), as this is estimated to be the lower limit for fetal viability. If the fetus is over 24 weeks' gestation, Caesarean delivery also offers the best chance of rescue for the neonate.|$|E
5000|$|Abortion rates also vary {{depending}} on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 26% of abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 9.7% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6.2% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4.1% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1.4% at more than 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by [...] "curettage" [...] (suction-aspiration, dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation), 7.7% by [...] "medical" [...] means (mifepristone), 0.4% by [...] "intrauterine instillation" [...] (saline or prostaglandin), and 1.0% by [...] "other" [...] (including <b>hysterotomy</b> and hysterectomy). According to the CDC, due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{systematic}} review aims {{to analyze the}} case reports, case series, or clinical studies describing the women with cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (CSEP), and thus, to determine the efficacy and safety of different primary treatment modalities {{in the management of}} CSEP. A thorough search of electronic databases showed that 274 articles on CSEP were published between January 1978 and April 2014. Systemic methotrexate, uterine artery embolization, dilatation and curettage (D&C), <b>hysterotomy,</b> and hysteroscopy were the most frequently adopted first-line approaches. The success rates of systemic methotrexate, uterine artery embolization, hysteroscopy, D&C, and <b>hysterotomy</b> were 8. 7 %, 18. 3 %, 39. 1 %, 61. 6 %, and 92. 1 %, respectively. The hysterectomy rates were 3. 6 %, 1. 1 %, 0. 0 %, 7. 3 %, and 1. 7 % in CSEP cases that were treated by systemic methotrexate, uterine artery embolization, hysteroscopy, D&C, and <b>hysterotomy,</b> respectively. The ability to achieve a subsequent term pregnancy is related to successful systemic methotrexate treatment (p =  0. 001) or <b>hysterotomy</b> (p =  0. 009). Future term pregnancy was significantly more frequent in the <b>hysterotomy</b> group (p =  0. 001). Hysteroscopy and laparoscopic <b>hysterotomy</b> are safe and efficient surgical procedures that can be adopted as primary treatment modalities for CSEP. Uterine artery embolization should be reserved for cases with significant bleeding and/or a high suspicion index for arteriovenous malformation. Systemic methotrexate and D&C are not recommended as first-line approaches for CSEP, as these procedures are associated with high complication and hysterectomy rates...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that differences in the matrix arrangement of the lower uterine segment (above and below {{the reflection of the}} bladder flap) translate to differences in biomechanical or structural properties of the uterine wall. METHODS: We enrolled prospectively 40 women at term randomized to a bladder flap (n� 21) versus no bladder flap (n� 19) at the time of a cesarean delivery for dystocia. Tensile properties of tissue biopsies from the upper and lower edges of the <b>hysterotomy</b> incision were quantitated using a stretching regimen designed to mimic labor. Parameters such as slope, yield point, and break point were analyzed in relationship to biochemical (total collagen, sulfated glycosaminoglycans, pyridinoline-deoxypyridinoline) and histological (collagen birefringence) properties of the tissue. RESULTS: The lower edge of the <b>hysterotomy</b> had a higher collagen content than the upper, independently of whether the <b>hysterotomy</b> site was above or below the reflection of the bladder (P<. 001 for edge level, P�. 8 for bladder flap).

40|$|Open fetal surgery predictably {{results in}} {{postoperative}} uterine contractions and often in premature labor, but its intraoperative {{effects on the}} uterus are not known. In 10 pregnant ewes (108 to 115 days' gestation), uterine artery flow, uterine venous oxygen saturation, arterial saturation, and uterine electromyography were recorded simultaneously (control). Six ewes underwent a stapled <b>hysterotomy,</b> and four underwent placement of three endoscopic surgery cannulas and amnioinfusion. Uterine contractions were present 52 % of the time (range, 34 % to 72 %), {{and there was no}} significant difference between control, <b>hysterotomy,</b> and endoscopic access. Uterine artery blood flow and uteroplacental oxygen delivery at rest decreased (to 73 % of control) after <b>hysterotomy</b> (P <. 05), but not after endoscopy. Fetal + uteroplacental oxygen consumption did not differ significantly between the groups. In conclusion, (1) uteroplacental oxygen delivery after <b>hysterotomy</b> alone decreased to levels critical for adequate fetal oxygenation; (2) endoscopy did not alter uteroplacental oxygen delivery; and (3) during open fetal surgery, further oxygen demand/delivery mismatch is likely, by traction on uterine and umbilical vessels and fetal stress. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Thank {{you very}} much for your {{interest}} in our case. 1 Baxi introduced a different approach to the management of the prominent uterine varices during cesarean section. This approach was exactly opposite to what we had performed in our case. Transverse <b>hysterotomy</b> in uterine corpus and hemostatic clamp of uterine varices are both options for this rare complication during pregnancy. Obstetricians need to be familiar with the pros and cons in both approaches. <b>Hysterotomy</b> in uterine corpus gives a faster approach to delivery, although there may be an increased risk of uterine rupture in future pregnancies. A hemostatic clamp of uterine varix requires meticulous surgical skills and may take longer but is doable with low transverse <b>hysterotomy.</b> Circumstances surrounding cesarean section are key in choosing the appropriate approach (eg, an emergent situation, a surgeon 9 ̆ 2 s level of comfort, and number and locations of uterine varices).
