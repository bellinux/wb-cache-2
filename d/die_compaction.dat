50|$|Pressureless {{sintering}} {{is another}} method for processing and densifying UHTCs. Pressureless sintering involves heating powdered materials in a mold {{in order to}} promote atomic diffusion and create a solid material. Compacts are prepared by uniaxial <b>die</b> <b>compaction,</b> and then the compacts are fired at chosen temperatures in a controlled atmosphere. Exaggerated grain growth that hinders densification occurs during sintering due to the low-intrinsic sinterability and the strong covalent bonds of Ti, Zr, and Hf diborides. Full densification of ZrB2 by pressureless sintering is very difficult to obtain; Chamberlain et al. have only been able to obtain ~98% densification by heating at 2150 °C for 9 h (Figure 3). Efforts to control grain size and improve densification have focused on adding third phases to the UHTCs, some examples of these phases include the addition of boron and iridium. Addition of Ir in particular has shown an increase in the toughness of HfB2/20vol.% SiC by 25%. Sintered density has also been shown to increase with the addition of Fe (up to 10% w/w) and Ni (up to 50% w/w) to achieve densifications of up to 88% at 1600 °C. More advances in pressureless sintering must be made before it can be considered a viable method for UHTC processing.|$|E

To calibrate the constitutive model (e. g. a Drucker-Prager Cap model) a series of experiments were carried out including closed <b>die</b> <b>compaction,</b> uniaxial and diametrical compression tests. A newly developed apparatus consisting of a die instrumented with radial stress sensors was used to determine constitutive parameters as well as friction properties between the powder and die wall.

Green uniaxial press compacts in the different compaction load of 15 Ton and 20 Ton were sintered at the temperatures of 580 °C and 600 °C. The heating rate of the sintering process was 5 °C/min and the sintering time varied between at 4 hour and 5 hour. Hardness and density of the nano-composites were investigated.

40|$|In {{the powder}} {{metallurgy}} method of composite material production {{it has been}} noted that the size ratio, between the constituent powders used in Aluminium-Silicon Carbide non-continuously reinforced metal matrix composites (MMCs), has a bearing on the final mechanical strength of the material. The exact mechanism is not understood. This work concentrates on how the difference in size ratios between the powders affects the packing fraction when the powders are poured into a <b>die,</b> before <b>compaction,</b> and how this {{is related to the}} final mechanical strength of the material. The packing of binary powders was firstly treated mathematically. An analytical model to predict the packing fraction of the powder was then tested to ensure its accuracy when used with metal powders of this type. The model was found to predict the packing fraction of the powders used to manufacture these materials within a range of 8 %. Powder mixtures of various size ratios were then used to prepare material samples and the changes in packing fraction compared to the changes in the mechanical properties of the material. Comparison of the changes of mechanical properties of the materials as size ratio is changed, with the way that packing fraction changes with packing fractions shows that they alter in a similar manner. It is concluded that the change in powder size ratio leads to a change in the packing fraction of the powders before compaction, which leads to a change in the mechanical strength. However it is shown that other factors such as powder size and sintering times and temperatures also have an important part to play. It is also shown that the powders of differing sizes must be present in sufficient quantities to achieve high packing fractions.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{pharmaceutical}} tabletting involves {{the application of}} stress onto the powdered drug ingredients contained within a rigid <b>die.</b> This <b>compaction</b> process will cause the powder to densify and form a tablet, which is then ejected from the die cavity. In reality, the tablet will incur some elastic strains during the compaction process and the tablet dimensional changes resulted due to the elastic relaxation of the tablet in the subsequent processing stages undermine the final tablet mechanical integrity. The ejection stage, where the tablet is extruded from the die, has not been studied extensively and is an important stage where any tabletting defects are immediately visible. It is then {{the purpose of this}} Thesis to experimentally elucidate the behaviour of the tablet elastic relaxation and its influence on the tablet mechanical integrity during the ejection, the final stage of the compaction process. The Thesis starts with highlighting the existence of the tablet elastic relaxation during the ejection stage that has been successfully studied on-line by the novel use of accurate laser sensors to record the tablet dimensional changes, with particular emphasis on the interrelationship of the tablet elastic relaxation with the observed ejection force and the tabletting defects of the Paracetamol tablet. The use of a lubricated die has also been shown to reduce the tablet elastic relaxation and the tabletting defects of the Paracetamol tablets. In terms of the time-dependent nature of the elastic relaxation, subtle time-dependent elastic relaxation behaviour has been observed and eludicated for the chosen time-dependent Starch material. A brief, but detailed and comprehensive material comparison consisting Aspirin, microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) and Paracetamol is presented in terms of the elastic relaxation during the ejection stage. The observed tablet elastic relaxation is then interrelated with the tablet strength, which is determined by an indirect tensile test (Brazilian) and a direct tensile test. Finally, the presence of a localized elastic relaxation occurring at the interface of an Avicel bilayered tablet has been shown to undermine the strength of the bilayered tablet, where the extent of the interface weaknesses is clearly dependent upon the behaviour of the localized elastic relaxation. In conclusion, the Thesis has successfully demonstrated and elucidated the tablet elastic relaxation behaviour during the ejection stage and the consequences on the final tablet mechanical integrity.

40|$|Common ceramic {{component}} manufacturing typically {{involves the}} processing of the raw materials in powder form. Granulated powder is formed into a green body of the desired size and shape by consolidation, often by simply pressing nominally dry powder. Ceramic powders are commonly pressed in steel dies or rubber bags {{with the aim of}} producing a near-net-shape green body for subsequent sintering. Density gradients in these compacts, introduced during the pressing operation, are often severe enough to cause distortions {{in the shape of the}} part during sintering due to nonuniform shrinkage. In such cases, green machining or diamond grinding operations may be needed to obtain the desired final shape and size part. In severe cases, nonuniform shrinkage may even cause fracture in the parts during sintering. Likewise, density gradients can result in green bodies that break during ejection from the die or that are too fragile to be handled during subsequent processing. Empirical relationships currently exist to describe powder compaction but provide little understanding of how to control <b>die</b> design or <b>compaction</b> parameters to minimize density gradients thereby forcing the designer to use expensive and time consuming trial and error procedures. For this reason, interest has grown in developing computational tools to address this problem (Aydin et al., 1996 and Coube, 1998). The goal of the present work was to develop a general continuum-based finite element model for ceramic powder compaction that can be used to aid and guide the design and pressing of ceramic powders.

The research can be divided into low pressure and high pressure compaction, friction and residual stress measurement. The main topic of this thesis is the determination of the compaction and the yield response of particulate materials. The compaction behaviour of different materials was characterized and models such as Cam-Clay and Drucker-Prager were calibrated. The yield response of closed die and isostatically compacted powders with irregular and spherically shaped particles were compared for two materials: steel and copper. It was found that the yield surface of the compacts made of spherical particles can be modelled by the Fleck micromechanical model if the densification level is low. The irregular shaped materials at higher densities could be modelled by the Cam-Clay model. A full anisotropic constitutive model based on Hill's anisotropic yield expression was developed. The model was calibrated for a Distaloy AE which contained 0. 5 % C-UF 4 and 0. 6 % kenolube P 11. Residual stresses in a typical industrial green component were determined using neutron diffraction. Experimental validation of residual stresses predicted by different compaction models is required to help identify the most appropriate model for a given material.
