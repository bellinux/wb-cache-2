5|$|On October 11, 1945 Justice LeBel issued {{his report}} that {{essentially}} exonerated Drew and Blackwell. Due to Jolliffe presenting only circumstantial evidence that linked <b>Drew</b> <b>to</b> Dempster, Murray and Sanderson, the Commissioner found the information unconvincing, even though LeBel believed Dempster's interaction with Sanderson and Murray was inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{departed}} {{the club}} on in January 2008 {{by mutual consent}} after a bad start to the 2007–08 season, and Kevin Keegan was reappointed as Newcastle manager. Mort stepped down as chairman in June {{and was replaced by}} Derek Llambias, a long-term associate of Ashley. Newcastle finished the 2007–08 season in twelfth place, but as the season <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close, Keegan publicly criticised the board, claiming they were not providing the team enough financial support.|$|E
5|$|As the Norse era <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a {{close the}} Norse-speaking princes were {{gradually}} replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris, the MacDonalds of the Uists and MacNeil of Barra. This transition {{did little to}} relieve the islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, based on Islay, were in theory these chiefs' feudal superiors and managed to exert some control.|$|E

5|$|As the war <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a {{close and}} Nazi Germany faced defeat, Magda Goebbels and the Goebbels {{children}} joined him in Berlin. They moved into the underground Vorbunker, part of Hitler's underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April. In accordance with Hitler's will, Goebbels succeeded him as Chancellor of Germany; he served one day in this post. The following day, Goebbels and his wife committed suicide, after poisoning their six children with cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{campaign}} faltered as {{the race}} <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close. Two {{weeks prior to}} the election, Brown was injured in a fall at Leitchfield; {{as a result of}} the injury, he was confined to his home and unable to deliver campaign speeches, despite several attempts to allow him to speak from a chair or wheelchair. The final vote count gave Republican William S. Taylor a small plurality with 193,714 votes to Goebel's 191,331; Brown garnered only 12,140 votes.|$|E
5|$|Fans {{and writers}} regard the treble haul as manager Alex Ferguson's finest hour, {{although}} he dismissed that assertion in later years. Tens {{of thousands of}} fans lined the streets of Manchester to welcome the team as the season <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close. In recognition of his achievements Ferguson was awarded a knighthood, and handed the Freedom of the City of Glasgow in November 1999.|$|E

5|$|Four {{days later}} Arsenal {{defeated}} Manchester United {{to complete their}} third double in the club's history. Arsenal paraded both trophies on an open-top bus once the season <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close; Dixon at Islington Town Hall addressed the crowd and personally thanked his staff, teammates and the club supporters. Chelsea's season ended with defeat to Aston Villa in the league. They moved down a place to sixth {{as a result of}} Leeds United's win against Middlesbrough.|$|E
5|$|Grove {{began his}} career with the Dallas Steers of the Texas League {{at the start of the}} 1938 season. He played with the Steers until {{management}} began to replace young players with veterans due to the team's struggling form and moved Grove to the Longview Cannibals. As his first minor league season <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close, Grove planned on returning to Proviso High School to complete his education. At the end of the season, the St. Paul Saints purchased Grove's contract to replenish their pitching staff.|$|E
5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E

50|$|Instead {{of normal}} curling scoring rules, the Elite 10 uses a match play {{system in which}} scoring is based on ends won, rather than rocks scored. An end is won by {{stealing}} or scoring two with the hammer, similar to skins curling. Unlike skins, however, there are no carry-overs. In {{the event of a}} tie, a <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> the button competition is held to determine the winner. In the standings, wins are worth three points, <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> the button wins are worth two points, and <b>draw</b> <b>to</b> the button losses are worth one point.|$|R
5|$|Merritt {{brought the}} score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close, {{there were several}} missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to {{capitalise}} on the opportunities, continuing to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1944, No. 351 Squadron {{carried out}} a {{successful}} rocket attack against Axis coastal defences on the Island of Lošinj, launching from Vis. This {{was followed by a}} period of scouting and reconnaissance over several Yugoslav regions, hitting targets of opportunity, sometimes escorted and supported by the Spitfires of No. 352 Squadron. No. 351 Squadron ranged widely, interdicting rail and road routes in eastern and western Bosnia and throughout Dalmatia, and attacking Axis maritime traffic off the Adriatic coast and islands. As the year <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close, operations became severely hampered by the worsening weather.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{rates in}} Germany {{increased}} {{as the war}} <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close, particularly {{in areas where the}} Red Army was advancing. More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead), Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead) and Berlin, where at least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.|$|E

5|$|The first {{remodeling}} {{work on the}} Ellwood Mansion {{took place}} as the 19th century <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close. The changes, commissioned by Isaac Ellwood, were meant to reflect more popular architectural styles including the Georgian and Colonial Revival. Many of the building's original Gothic features were replaced with more Classical elements. On the home's exterior, some of these changes {{can be observed in}} the addition of the portico and porte-cochere. Inside the home, the dining room was enlarged with the addition of the semicircular bay on the mansion's north facade.|$|E

Del Col credits editors Matt Idelson and Matt Humphreys with helping him shape {{the direction of the}} series.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign that}} the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E

5|$|As the war <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having {{believed}} {{the federal government}} had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E
5|$|Brought {{up during}} times of inter-war strife in Germany, Trautmann joined the Luftwaffe early in the Second World War, serving as a paratrooper. He fought on the Eastern Front for three years, earning five medals, {{including}} an Iron Cross. Later in the war, he {{was transferred to the}} Western Front, where he was captured by the British as the war <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close. One of only 90 of his original 1,000-man regiment to survive the war, he was transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire. Trautmann refused an offer of repatriation, and following his release in 1948, settled in Lancashire, combining farm work with playing goalkeeper for a local football team, St Helens Town.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{received}} treatment midway {{throughout the}} second half after he ran into a photographer chasing an over-hit pass. Leeds had an attack soon after, but after Storrie received the ball from Bremner, his pass went behind the Liverpool goal. Liverpool had more chances, but St. John slipped at the back post when a Callaghan cross was diverted towards him. Then Thompson saw a shot saved by Sprake. Leeds reacted to the increased pressure, by moving Bremner to centre-forward and Giles reverting to midfield. Johanneson switched positions with Storrie, moving from the right to the left. Liverpool continued to press for a winner as the half <b>drew</b> <b>to</b> a close, but Thompson and Strong saw shots saved by Sprake. Neither team managed to score before full-time and the match went to extra time, {{the first time this}} happened since the 1947 final.|$|E
