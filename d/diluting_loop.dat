40|$|Loop {{models have}} been widely studied in physics and mathematics, in {{problems}} ranging from polymers to topological quantum computation to Schramm-Loewner evolution. I present new loop models which have critical points described by conformal field theories. Examples include both fully-packed and <b>dilute</b> <b>loop</b> models with critical points described by the superconformal minimal models and the SU(2) _ 2 WZW models. The <b>dilute</b> <b>loop</b> models are generalized to include SU(2) _k models as well. Comment: 20 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} massless {{flow from the}} {{critical}} point (<b>dilute</b> <b>loops)</b> to the low-temperature phase (dense loops) of the O(n) loop gas model when the model is coupled to 2 D gravity. The flow is generated by the gravitationally dressed thermal operator Φ 1, 3 coupled to the renormalized loop tension λ ∼ T − Tc. We find that the susceptibility {{as a function of}} the thermal coupling λ and the cosmological constant µ satisfies a simple transcendental equation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{relationship}} between integrability and the discrete holomorphicity of a class of complex lattice observables {{in the context of}} the Potts dense loop model and the O(n) <b>dilute</b> <b>loop</b> model. It is shown that the conditions for integrability, namely, the inversion and Yang-Baxter relations, can be derived from the condition of holomorphicity of the observables. Furthermore, the Z-invariance of the models is shown to result in the invariance of the observables on the boundary of a sublattice under reshuffling of the rhombuses of its planar rhombic embedding.

40|$|We define multi-colour generalizations of braid-monoid algebras {{and present}} {{explicit}} matrix representations which {{are related to}} two-dimensional exactly solvable lattice models of statistical mechanics. In particular, we show that the two-colour braid-monoid algebra describes the Yang-Baxter algebra of the critical dilute A–D–E models which were recently introduced by Warnaar, Nienhuis, and Seaton {{as well as by}} Roche. These and other solvable models related to dense and <b>dilute</b> <b>loop</b> models are discussed in detail and it is shown that the solvability is a direct consequence of the algebraic structure. It is conjectured that the Yang-Baxterization of general multi-colour braid-monoid algebras will lead to the construction of further solvable lattice models. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} dilute O(n) {{model on}} the kagome lattice is investigated analytically and numerically. We employ {{a number of}} exact equivalences which, in a few steps, link the critical O(n) spin model on the kagome lattice to the exactly solvable critical q-state Potts model on the honeycomb lattice with q=(n+ 1) ^ 2. The intermediate steps involve the random-cluster model on the honeycomb lattice, and a fully packed loop model with loop weight n'=√(q) and a <b>dilute</b> <b>loop</b> model with loop weight n, both on the kagome lattice. This mapping enables the determination of a branch of critical points of the dilute O(n) model, {{as well as some}} of its critical properties. For n= 0, this model reproduces the known universal properties of the θ point describing the collapse of a polymer. For n≠ 0 it displays a line of multicritical points, with the same universal properties as a branch of critical behavior that was found earlier in a dilute O(n) model on the square lattice. These findings are supported by a finite-size-scaling analysis in combination with transfer-matrix calculations. Comment: 19 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Nienhuis' {{truncated}} O(n) model {{gives rise}} to a model of self-avoiding loops on the hexagonal lattice, each loop having a fugacity of n. We study such loops subjected to a particular kind of staggered field w, which for n -> infinity has the geometrical effect of breaking the three-phase coexistence, linked to the three-colourability of the lattice faces. We show that at T = 0, for w > 1 the model flows to the ferromagnetic Potts model with q=n^ 2 states, with an associated fragmentation of the target space of the Coulomb gas. For T> 0, there is a competition between T and w which {{gives rise to}} multicritical versions of the dense and <b>dilute</b> <b>loop</b> universality classes. Via an exact mapping, and numerical results, we establish that the latter two critical branches coincide with those found earlier in the O(n) model on the triangular lattice. Using transfer matrix studies, we have found the renormalisation group flows in the full phase diagram in the (T,w) plane, with fixed n. Superposing three copies of such hexagonal-lattice loop models with staggered fields produces a variety of one or three-species fully-packed loop models on the triangular lattice with certain geometrical constraints, possessing integer central charges 0 <= c <= 6. In particular we show that Benjamini and Schramm's RGB loops have fractal dimension D_f = 3 / 2. Comment: 40 pages, 17 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{systematic}} method to extract conformal loop models for rational conformal field theories (CFT). Method {{is based on}} defining an ADE model for boundary primary operators by using the fusion matrices of these operators as adjacency matrices. These loop models respect the conformal boundary conditions. We discuss the loop models that can be extracted by this method for minimal CFTs {{and then we will}} give <b>dilute</b> O(n) <b>loop</b> models on the square lattice as examples for these loop models. We give also some proposals for WZW SU(2) models. Comment: 23 Pages, major changes! title change...|$|R
40|$|The Temperley-Lieb algebra (β) can {{be defined}} as the set of {{rectangular}} diagrams with n points on each of their vertical sides, with all points joined pairwise by non-intersecting strings. The multiplication is then the concatenation of diagrams. The dilute Temperley-Lieb algebra n(β) has a similar diagrammatic definition where, now, points on the sides may remain free of strings. Like n, the dilute n depends on a parameter β∈ C, often given as β=q+q^- 1 for some q∈ C^×. In statistical physics, the algebra plays {{a central role in the}} study of <b>dilute</b> <b>loop</b> models. The paper is devoted to the construction of its principal indecomposable modules. Basic definitions and properties are first given: the dimension of n, its break up into even and odd subalgebras and its filtration through n+ 1 ideals. The standard modules n,k are then introduced and their behaviour under restriction and induction is described. A bilinear form, the Gram product, is used to identify their (unique) maximal submodule n,k which is then shown to be irreducible or trivial. It is then noted that n is a cellular algebra. This fact allows for the identification of complete sets of non-isomorphic irreducible modules and projective indecomposable ones. The structure of n as a left module over itself is then given for all values of the parameter q, that is, for both q generic and a root of unity.

40|$|This is {{the second}} part of our study of the ground state {{eigenvector}} of the transfer matrix of the <b>dilute</b> Temperley-Lieb <b>loop</b> model with the loop weight $n= 1 $ on a semi infinite strip of width $L$. We focus here on the computation of the normalization (otherwise called the sum rule) $Z_L$ of the ground state eigenvector, which is also the partition function of the critical site percolation model. The normalization $Z_L$ is a symmetric polynomial in the inhomogeneities of the lattice $z_ 1, [...] ,z_L$. This polynomial satisfies several recurrence relations which we solve independently in terms of Jacobi-Trudi like determinants. Thus we provide a few determinantal expressions for the normalization $Z_L$. Comment: 21 pages, 17 figure...|$|R
40|$|Work of {{the last}} few years has shown that the key {{algebraic}} features of Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories (LCFTs) are already present in some finite lattice systems (such as the XXZ spin- 1 / 2 chain) before the continuum limit is taken. This has provided a very convenient way to analyze the structure of indecomposable Virasoro modules and to obtain fusion rules for a variety of models such as (boundary) percolation etc. LCFTs allow for additional quantum numbers describing the fine structure of the indecomposable modules, and generalizing the `b-number' introduced initially by Gurarie for the c= 0 case. The determination of these indecomposability parameters has given rise to a lot of algebraic work, but their physical meaning has remained somewhat elusive. In a recent paper, a way to measure b for boundary percolation and polymers was proposed. We generalize this work here by devising a general strategy to compute matrix elements of Virasoro generators from the numerical analysis of lattice models and their continuum limit. The method is applied to XXZ spin- 1 / 2 and spin- 1 chains with open (free) boundary conditions. They are related to gl(n+m|m) and osp(n+ 2 m| 2 m) -invariant superspin chains and to nonlinear sigma models with supercoset target spaces. These models can also be formulated in terms of dense and <b>dilute</b> <b>loop</b> gas. We check the method in many cases where the results were already known analytically. Furthermore, we also confront our findings with a construction generalizing Gurarie's, where logarithms emerge naturally in operator product expansions to compensate for apparently divergent terms. This argument actually allows us to compute indecomposability parameters in any logarithmic theory. A central result of our study is the construction of a Kac table for the indecomposability parameters of the logarithmic minimal models LM(1,p) and LM(p,p+ 1).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{anisotropic}} boundary {{conditions for the}} <b>dilute</b> O(n) <b>loop</b> model with the methods of 2 D quantum gravity. We solve the problem exactly on a dynamical lattice using the correspondence with a large $N$ matrix model. We formulate the disk two-point functions with ordinary and anisotropic boundary conditions as loop correlators in the matrix model. We derive the loop equations for these correlators and find their explicit solution in the scaling limit. Our solution reproduces the boundary phase diagram and the boundary critical exponents obtained recently by Dubail, Jacobsen and Saleur, except for the cusp at the isotropic special transition point. Moreover, our solution describes the bulk and the boundary deformations away from the anisotropic special transitions. In particular it shows how the anisotropic special boundary conditions are deformed by the bulk thermal flow towards the dense phase. Comment: 37 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe study a {{model of}} <b>dilute</b> {{oriented}} <b>loops</b> on the square lattice, where each loop is compatible with a fixed, alternating orientation of the lattice edges. This implies that loop strands {{are not allowed to}} go straight at vertices, and results in an enhancement of the usual O(n) symmetry to U(n). The corresponding transfer matrix acts on a number of representations (standard modules) that grows exponentially with the system size. We derive their dimension and those of the centralizer by both combinatorial and algebraic techniques. A mapping onto a field theory permits us to identify the conformal field theory governing the critical range, n≤ 1. We establish the phase diagram and the critical exponents of low-energy excitations. For generic n, there is a critical line in the universality class of the dilute O(2 n) model, terminating in an SU(n+ 1) point.

40|$|A set {{of fixed}} {{boundary}} weights {{for both the}} critical dense and dilute AL face models is constructed from the known boundary weights of the related loop model. The surface operator content and the conformal partition functions then follow from the results obtained via the Bethe equations. 1 Introduction The remarkable interplay between critical systems and the symmetries of conformal and modular invariance has been well illustrated by direct calculations on exactly solved models [1 [...] 3]. One well known family of such are the critical A-D-E models which are built from the Dynkin diagrams of the simply laced A-D-E Lie algebras [4]. These models can all be mapped onto an underlying loop model [4, 5]. Another family of critical models, the dilute A-D-E lattice models [6 [...] 8], can be mapped onto the <b>dilute</b> O(n) <b>loop</b> model [9, 10]. The bulk operator content and the modular invariant partition functions of these models are now well understood (see, e. g., [11]). However, the situation is not so [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In most Yang-Mills models {{the vacuum}} where {{magnetic}} monopoles condense coincides with that where center vortices percolate, {{thus it is}} not clear which of these two properties is most directly involved in producing confinement. It is pointed out that there is a class of 3 D gauge models, which can be though of as duals of Q-state Potts models with Q < 1, where the magnetic monopole condensation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for percolation of center vortices. A set of numerical tests at Q = 1 10 shows that there is a vacuum in which the magnetic monopole condensate does not yield confinement, in the sense that large Wilson loops obey a perimeter law. In such a vacuum the center vortices form a <b>dilute</b> gas of <b>loops.</b> At stronger coupling there is also a truly confining vacuum where both confining mechanisms are present...|$|R
40|$|Standard urea kinetic {{modeling}} (UKM) equations {{make the}} assumption that the blood entering the vascular access has the same composition as the blood leaving the systemic tissue compartment. While this assumption correctly describes the situation for a central venous access (Fig. 1 A), such as a right atrial dialysis catheter, it is not adequate for the common peripheral access [1, 2]. The composition of the blood entering the access (cart) during hemodialysis (HD) is different from the composition of the blood leaving the systemic tissue compartment (cven) (Fig. 1 B). The manner in which the access and systemic circuits are connected has important, previously unrecognized consequences on the kinetic computation of urea distribution volume for blood-concentration-based UKM, and also affects the computation of access recirculation (AR). During HD, clearance of solute from the access <b>loop</b> <b>dilutes</b> the solute concentration of the blood entering the access. We have defined the ‘long-loop’ dilution effect on blood entering the access as ‘cardiopulmonary recirculation’; (CPR), because it is analogous to the ‘short-loop’; dilution effect which may take place through the vascular access (‘;access recirculation’;) [1]. It is the aim of this work to derive an analytical expression for CPR and to present a correction for the resulting reduction in HD efficiency in UKM equations...|$|R
