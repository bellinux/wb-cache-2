40|$|SUMMARY The gait {{of normal}} {{subjects}} was examined electromyographically and the pattern was altered during preferential blockade of large nerve fibres to alternating activity in flexor and extensor muscles. The EMG activity was disrupted more in flexor than extensor muscles by preferential ischaemic blockade. Normal gait {{was associated with}} flexor contraction only when the foot was lifted and placed on the ground, whereas during ischaemic blockade flexor contraction continued during the interval between foot lifting and foot placement. The 'freezing ' or 'blocking ' gait in Parkinson's disease {{was found to be}} associated with co-activation of flexor and extensor muscles and this phenomenon occurred only in patients with features of flexion dystonia in the electromyographic recordings of their tonic stretch reflexes. Eight of nine patients with evidence of flexion dystonia showed a deterioration in their response to L-dopa therapy over a two year period, whereas four patients without flexion dystonia maintained their clinical improvement. The term dystonia implies a disorder of the <b>extra-pyramidal</b> <b>system</b> in which the limbs become fixed in an abnormal posture as the result of synchronous activity in the antagonistic muscles operating at a joint. Denny-Brown (1962, 1968) has described three fundamental patterns of dystonic postural fixation-namely, hemiplegic dystonia, flexion dystonia (as seen in Parkinson's disease), and torsion dystonia (as in dystonia musculorum deformans). Recently, Yanagisawa and Goto (1971) have analysed dystonia muscu-lorum deformans electromyographically and found that 'tonic non-reciprocal involuntary in-nervation appeared in both agonists and an-tagonists at rest', and that this coactivation 'was intensified by assumption of any active posture'. In an electromyographic analysis of rigidity in Parkinsonism Andrews, Burke, and Lance (1973) noted that the static and dynamic tonic stretch reflexes of hamstrings and quadriceps muscles became maximal while the knee was still in a slightly flexed position in some patients.

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} of middle-aged and elderly people, {{in which there is}} degeneration of the <b>extra-pyramidal</b> motor <b>system.</b> In some patients, the disease is associated with a range of visual signs and symptoms, including defects in visual acuity, colour vision, the blink reflex, pupil reactivity, saccadic and smooth pursuit movements and visual evoked potentials. In addition, there may be psychophysical changes, disturbances of complex visual functions such as visuospatial orientation and facial recognition, and chronic visual hallucinations. Some of the treatments associated with PD may have adverse ocular reactions. If visual problems are present, they can have an important effect on overall motor function, and quality of life of patients can be improved by accurate diagnosis and correction of such defects. Moreover, visual testing is useful in separating PD from other movement disorders with visual symptoms, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Although not central to PD, visual signs and symptoms can be an important though obscure aspect of the disease and should not be overlooked...|$|R
40|$|Neuroleptics {{are major}} tranquilizers that reduce {{psychotic}} symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. All old, first generation neuroleptics, such as Haldol and Prolixin, work by blocking the dopamine system. New or second generation antipsychotics (SGAâ€™s), such as Risperdal and olanzapine, work by altering multiple transmitter systems, including serotonin and dopamine, while some neuroleptics also affect cholinergic and adrenergic systems (See Section 2, Tables 2 - 1 and 2 - 2). This mixture of neuro-chemical effects explains {{the range of}} side effects seen with each drug in patients. Medication toxicity is often dose-dependent and clinicians should use the minimum dose required to achieve therapeutic goals (See Section 2, Tables 2 - 3 and 2 - 4). There are five major types of side effects with antipsychotic medications in the elderly: (1) motor side effects, (2) autonomic changes, (3) psychiatric complications, (4) medical complications, and (5) falls. The prescribing physician should {{be familiar with the}} side effects and the nursing staff should monitor residents for these changes. 1. MOTOR SIDE EFFECTS Extra-pyramidal side effects (EPS) refer to dysfunction of the <b>extra-pyramidal</b> motor <b>system</b> that is affected by neuroleptics (See Table 3 - 1). Motor system abnormalities are common complications with old antipsychotics, as up to half of elders develop tardive dyskinesia after three years of continuous use. Newer medications produce far less EPS...|$|R
