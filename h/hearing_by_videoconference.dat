40|$|Today {{the use of}} {{telecommunication}} {{techniques are}} becoming more and more important in criminal case cooperation. In recent decades there had been a great shift of perspectives in the field of telecommunication. Modern telecommunication possibilities like video- and telephone conference calls are already in use in the questioning of the witness and the hearing of the expert. The Hungarian Criminal Procedure Law introduced the use of closed cicuit telecommunications network. Besides conducting processes swiftly and supporting witness and victim protection, this institution can have a significant role in fulfilling international Legal Aid requests as well. The Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union regulates <b>hearing</b> <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> and telephone conference. The Hungarian criminal procedure legislation is fully consistent with the provisions of the Convention of the European Union. telecommunication, criminal procedure law, witness and victim protection, interrogation...|$|E

40|$|Background Healthcare {{providers}} are continuously challenged to find innovative, cost-effective alternatives and {{to scale up}} existent services to meet the growing demand upon mental health care delivery. Due to continuous advances in technologies, telepsychiatry has become an effective tool for psychiatric care. In 2012, the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of S&# 227;o Paulo Medical School started a randomized clinical trial of home-based telepsychiatric outpatient care via videoconferencing. Objective The objective {{of this article is}} to describe the design, methodology and implementation of a pilot project, which aimed to verify the applicability and efficiency of psychiatric attendance via Internet-based videoconferencing in a resource-constrained environment. Methods The project consisted of a 12 months follow-up study with a randomized clinical trial, which compared various quality indicators between home-based telepsychiatric aftercare via videoconferencing and face-to-face aftercare. Results The final sample comprised 107 outpatients (53 in the telepsychiatry group and 54 in the control group). Among 1, 227 realized consultations, 489 were held <b>by</b> <b>videoconferencing.</b> Satisfaction with the aftercare <b>by</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> and the medication delivery was high among patients. Attending psychiatrists were satisfied with the assistance <b>by</b> <b>videoconferencing.</b> Discussion The experiences during this pilot project have overall been very positive and psychiatric outpatient care <b>by</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> seems viable to treat patients even in a resource-constrained environment...|$|R

Through a combination of ethnographic observation and sequential analysis, we show how the production of such an expected institutional speech act in courtroom hearings may have been made irrelevant at the sequential slot in which one might have expected its performance. What such a speech act does in a given activity-embedded sequential setting depends on and reveals the particular interplay of technology, talk- and gesture-in-interaction, and activity that is relevant to the ongoing production of a proper beginning for a court hearing conducted at a distance...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a pilot study}} of the feasibility of videoconferencing {{as a mode of}} neuropsychological assessment in young people (14 – 30 years) from a rural area of New South Wales experiencing early psychosis. All participants (n = 11) completed assessments both face-to-face and <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> at a bandwidth of 384 kbit/s. Assessments included confirmation of diagnosis, quality of life and neurocognitive functioning. There was a strong correlation between modes of assessment for most instruments. Bland-Altman plots indicated that in general the mean difference between face-to-face and videoconference modes of assessment was close to zero with significant bias only evident for general cognitive functioning (WTAR), where videoconferencing produced higher ratings than face-to-face assessments. Feedback from the participants indicated strong acceptability of assessment <b>by</b> <b>videoconferencing,</b> thus supporting further investigation of use of this mode of assessment for clinical and research purposes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Telemedicine {{consists}} {{in the use}} of telecommunication technologies to provide healthcare services overcoming geographic, temporal, social, and cultural barriers. Today telemedicine is a developed field, which includes about 50 different subspecialties: neuropsychology is one of them. Its main application {{consists in}} the early diagnosis of cognitive disorders of adult onset,and particularly in the assessment of individuals potentially affected by degenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). These individuals would benefit significantly by an assessment by telemedicine. This study was aimed to assess the feasibility by telemedicine of two widely used neuropsychological test: the MMSE and the ADAS_COG test. While for the first some data are available in the literature, no study has investigated, to our knowledge, the ADAS_COG administration <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> in subjects with AD. We aimed thus to compare the results obtained by the “face to face” condition to those obtained <b>by</b> <b>videoconference.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ADAS_Cog and the MMSE test were administered to 28 subjects (8 M) in two conditions: the face-to-face condition and the video-conference modality. Subjects were all participating to the randomized, double blind, placebo controlled ASCOMALVA study. The administration was done at the enrollment of the patients in the study, baseline, and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Subjects were randomized in two groups. Group A subjects were submitted to the ADAS_Cog and the MMSE test by the face-to-face modality first; two weeks later the same tests were administered via telemedicine <b>by</b> <b>videoconferencing.</b> Group B were submitted vice-versa to the videoconference modality first, and then to the face to face. A two-tailed Student "t" test was done to evaluate {{the differences between the two}} modality. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in MMSE scores and ADAS_Cog scores (p<. 05) administered by telehealth versus face to face modality. In patient with moderate AD the administration via telemedicine gives worse results on average than the face to face mode CONCLUSIONS: The most employed tool to assess and measure the cognitive functions in subjects potentially affected by degenerative dementia are the MMSE and the ADAS_Cog. Both are required in the clinical trials to assess the severity of the damage and the effectiveness of new drugs. Their employ <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> should be very useful. We found that both the MMSE and the ADAS Cog test may be applied in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease, and that the scores obtained <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> are related to those obtained by the face to face condition. Videoconference may be very useful to reach patients with cognitive damages, to assess their stability or progression, to measure the efficacy of therapies...|$|R
40|$|Videoconferencing {{technology}} offers an enticing opportunity for distance education providers {{to optimize the}} sharing of human resources by connecting geographically distributed teachers and students through real-time, two-way video. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the experiences of eight teachers and their rural secondary students in courses that are delivered synchronously <b>by</b> <b>videoconference.</b> The study specifically examined teacher presence across a screen, the navigation of challenges and affordances of the medium, and the unique teaching skills and roles required. This collective case study research used a mixed methods approach to follow these three lines of inquiry in order to provide a comprehensive picture of the experience of teaching <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> in rural Alberta. The following key findings were reported: there are obstacles to developing presence implicit in the context such as insufficient time, isolation, scheduling and logistics, unreliable technology, and limited personal connection. Teachers’ confidence and experience, the use of immediacy behaviours, and understanding student learning presence can mitigate some of those obstacles. Furthermore, by leveraging supporting communication tools, intentionally building presence and prioritizing the programming within the district the affordances of the context were maximized. Teachers who felt unprepared and untrained for the various unique skills required to teach successfully <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> suggested that the development of standards, professional collaboration, and action research would better support their roles. These findings confirm many of the issues raised in a largely undeveloped body of literature and also contribute new perspectives on technological integration, teacher presence, and video conferencing for distance education. Implications for best practice, teacher training and further research are provided...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} a systematic {{review of literature}} relating to videoconferencing in therapeutic interventions for chronic conditions. Two hundred articles were reviewed in detail, 35 of which were relevant to the study. Of these, eight were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the remainder were service evaluations, pilot studies and case studies. Two major themes emerged, relating specifically to videoconferencing: clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. There were 14 studies which measured clinical outcomes of interventions for chronic conditions delivered <b>by</b> <b>videoconferencing.</b> A range of evidence, including four RCTs of high quality, indicates that interventions {{for a variety of}} conditions, including psychological and physical, delivered <b>by</b> <b>videoconferencing</b> produce similar outcomes to treatment delivered in-person. Evidence suggests that levels of patient satisfaction with telerehabilitation are high and that the formation of a good therapeutic alliance is possible.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the acceptability of}} multi-site videoconferencing {{as a method of}} providing group education to older people in their homes. There were 9 groups comprising 52 participants (mean age 73 years) with an average of four chronic conditions. Tablet computers or PCs were installed in participant’s homes and connected to the Internet by the National Broadband Network (high-speed broad band network) or by the 4 G wireless network. A health literacy and self-management programme was delivered <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> for 5 weeks. Participants were able to view and interact with all group members and the facilitator on their devices. During the study, 44 group videoconferences were conducted. Evaluation included 16 semi-structured interviews, 3 focus groups and a journal detailing project implementation. The participants reported enjoying home-based group education <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> and found the technology easy to use. Using home-based groups via videoconference was acceptable for providing group education, and considered particularly valuable for people living alone and/or with limited mobility.

40|$|Abstract Background Today the {{availability}} of specialists is limited for psychiatric patients in rural areas, especially during psychiatric emergencies. To overcome this challenge, the University Hospital of North Norway has implemented a new decentralised on-call system in psychiatric emergencies, by which psychiatrists are accessible <b>by</b> <b>videoconference</b> 24 / 7. In September 2011, the new on-call system was established in clinical practice for patients and health staff at three regional psychiatric centres in Northern Norway. Although {{a wide variety of}} therapies have been successfully delivered <b>by</b> <b>videoconference,</b> there is limited research on the use of videoconferenced consultations with patients in psychiatric emergencies. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the use of videoconference in psychiatric emergencies based on the implementation of this first Norwegian tele-psychiatric service in emergency care. Methods/design The research project is an exploratory case study of a new videoconference service in operation. By applying in-depth interviews with patients, specialists and local health-care staff, we will identify factors that facilitate and hinder use of videoconferencing in psychiatric emergencies, and explore how videoconferenced consultations matter for patients, professional practice and cooperation between levels in psychiatric care. By using an on-going project as the site of research, the case is especially well-suited for generating reliable and valid empirical data. Discussion Results from the study will be of importance for understanding of how videoconferencing may support proper treatment and high-quality health care services in rural areas for patients in psychiatric emergencies. </p...|$|R
