In 2008 a more precise number of Mup genes in a range of species was determined by analyzing the DNA sequence of whole genomes.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the genes}} {{responsible}} for the regulation of inner ear formation and its morphogenesis {{are members of the}} homeobox <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> such as Pax, Msx and Otx homeobox genes. The development of inner ear structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5/Dlx6, Otx1/Otx2 and Pax2, which in turn are controlled by the master gene Shh. Shh is secreted by the notochord.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{has been}} established by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for each known human gene {{in the form of}} an approved gene name and symbol (short-form abbreviation), which can be accessed through a database maintained by HGNC. Symbols are chosen to be unique, and each gene has only one symbol (although approved symbols sometimes change). Symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members of a <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> and with homologs in other species, particularly the mouse due to its role as a common model organism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>families,</b> {{part of a}} {{hierarchy}} of information storage in a genome, play {{a large role in}} the evolution and diversity of multicellular organisms. <b>Gene</b> <b>families</b> are large units of information and genetic variability. Over evolutionary time, <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> have expanded and contracted with new <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> being formed and some <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> being lost. In several evolutionary lineages, genes are gained and lost at relatively same rates. Adaptive expansion of <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> occurs when natural selection would favour additional gene copies. This is the case when an environmental stressor acts on a species. Gene amplification is more common in bacteria and is a reversible process. Adaptive contraction of <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> commonly results from accumulation of loss of function mutations. A nonsense mutation which prematurely halts gene transcription becomes fixed in the population, leading to the loss of genes. This process occurs when changes in the environment render a gene redundant.|$|R
50|$|One {{level of}} genome {{organization}} is the grouping of genes into several <b>gene</b> <b>families.</b> <b>Gene</b> <b>families</b> are groups of related genes that {{share a common}} ancestor. Members of <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> may be paralogs or orthologs. Gene paralogs are genes with similar sequences from within the same species while gene orthologs are genes with similar sequences in different species. <b>Gene</b> <b>families</b> are highly variable in size, sequence diversity, and arrangement. Depending on the diversity and functions of the <b>genes</b> within the <b>family,</b> families can be classified as a multigene families or superfamilies.|$|R
40|$|Dangerous ” <b>gene</b> <b>families,</b> {{defined as}} prone to {{dominant}} (gain-of-function) mutations, have been greatly expanded {{in the course}} of vertebrate evolution by contrast to <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> more prone to recessive (loss-of-function) muta-tions. While the maintenance of “essential ” genes is ensured by their lethal double null mutations, the expan-sion of “dangerous ” <b>gene</b> <b>families,</b> implicated in cancer and other severe genetic diseases in human, remains puz-zling. Could gene susceptibility to dominant deleterious mutations be somehow responsible for this striking evo-lutionary expansion of “dangerous ” <b>gene</b> <b>families?</b> Results We proposed such an evolutionary model suggesting that this counterintuitive expansion of “dangerous ” <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> is in fact a consequence of their susceptibility t...|$|R
5|$|Most {{other mammals}} studied, {{including}} the pig, cow, cat, dog, bushbaby, macaque, chimpanzee and orangutan, {{have a single}} Mup gene. Some, however, have an expanded number: horses have three Mup genes and gray mouse lemurs have at least two. Insects, fish, amphibia, birds and marsupials appear to have disrupted synteny at the chromosomal position of the Mup gene cluster, suggesting the <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> may be specific to placental mammals. Humans are the only placental mammals found {{not to have any}} active Mup genes; instead they have a single Mup pseudogene containing a mutation that causes missplicing, rendering it dysfunctional.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} source of new genes in {{eukaryotic}} lineages is gene duplication, which creates copy number variation {{of an existing}} gene in the genome. The resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a <b>gene</b> <b>family.</b> Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent {{a major source of}} evolutionary biodiversity. Sometimes, gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene, or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{there had}} been {{discussion}} connecting copy number variations to gene families. Gene families are defined {{as a set of}} related genes that serve similar functions but have minor temporal or spatial differences and these genes likely derived from one ancestral gene. The main reason copy number variations are connected to gene families {{is that there is a}} possibility that genes in a family may have derived from one ancestral gene which got duplicated into different copies. Mutations accumulate through time in the genes and with natural selection acting on the genes, some mutations lead to environmental advantages allowing those genes to be inherited and eventually clear gene families are separated out. An example of a <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> that may have been created due to copy number variations is the globin <b>gene</b> <b>family.</b> The globin <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> is an elaborate network of genes consisting of alpha and beta globin genes including genes that are expressed in both embryos and adults as well as pseudogenes. These globin genes in the globin family are all well conserved and only differ by a small portion of the gene, indicating that they were derived from a common ancestral gene, perhaps due to duplication of the initial globin gene.|$|E

40|$|A phylogenetic {{approach}} {{was used to}} reconstruct the pattern of an apparent loss of 2106 ancestral <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> in four animal genomes (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, human and fugu). Substantially higher rates of loss of ancestral <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> {{were found in the}} invertebrates than in the vertebrates. These results indicate that the differential loss of ancestral <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> can be a significant factor in the evolutionary diversification of organisms...|$|R

The two <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> were localized in only one chromosome pair, on the short arm of pair 19, in an entirely CMA(3) -positive region. Among the Anguilliformes, C. conger is the only species that shows {{the presence of the}} two <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> in the same chromosomal region...|$|R
25|$|The {{rejection}} of the reference topology {{is an indication that}} the evolutionary history for that <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> is inconsistent with the reference tree. When these inconsistencies cannot be explained using a small number of non-horizontal events, such as gene loss and duplication, an HGT event is inferred.|$|E
25|$|TAL effectors can induce {{susceptibility}} {{genes that}} {{are members of}} the NODULIN3 (N3) <b>gene</b> <b>family.</b> These genes are essential {{for the development of the}} disease. In rice two genes,Os-8N3 and Os-11N3, are induced by TAL effectors. Os-8N3 is induced by PthXo1 and Os-11N3 is induced by PthXo3 and AvrXa7.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Hood {{was among}} the first to study, at the gene level, the MHC (major {{histocompatibility}} complex) <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> and the T-cell receptor gene families as well as being among first to demonstrate that alternative RNA splicing was a fundamental mechanism for generating alternative forms of antibodies. He showed that RNA splicing is the mechanism for generating the membrane bound and the secreted forms of antibodies.|$|E
40|$|Publicly {{available}} protein sequences {{represent only}} a small fraction of the full catalog of genes encoded by the genomes of different plants, such as green algae, mosses, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. By contrast, an enormous amount of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) exists for a wide variety of plant species, representing a substantial part of all transcribed plant genes. Integrating protein and EST sequences in comparative and evolutionary analyses is not straightforward because of the heterogeneous nature of both types of sequence data. By combining information from publicly available EST and protein sequences for 32 different plant species, we identified more than 250, 000 plant proteins organized in more than 12, 000 <b>gene</b> <b>families.</b> Approximately 60 % of the proteins are absent from current sequence databases but provide important new information about plant <b>gene</b> <b>families.</b> Analysis of the distribution of <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> over different plant species through phylogenetic profiling reveals interesting insights into plant gene evolution, and identifies species- and lineage-specific <b>gene</b> <b>families,</b> orphan <b>genes,</b> and conserved core genes across the green plant lineage. We counted a similar number of approximately 9, 500 <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> in monocotyledonous and eudicotyledonous plants and found strong evidence for the existence of at least 33, 700 genes in rice (Oryza sativa). Interestingly, the larger number of genes in rice compared to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) can partially be explained by a larger amount of species-specific single-copy genes and species-specific <b>gene</b> <b>families.</b> In addition, a majority of large <b>gene</b> <b>families,</b> typically containing more than 50 genes, are bigger in rice than Arabidopsis, whereas the opposite seems true for small <b>gene</b> <b>families...</b>|$|R
40|$|Proteins {{involved}} in a pathway are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion, and coevolving <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> tend to undergo complementary gains and losses. Accordingly, gene copy numbers (i. e., repertoire size) tend to show parallel changes during the evolution of coevolving <b>gene</b> <b>families.</b> To test and verify this hypothesis, here we describe positive correlations among the repertoire sizes of six <b>gene</b> <b>families,</b> that is, trypsin-like serine protease, odorant-binding protein, odorant receptor, gustatory receptor, cytochrome P 450, and glutathione S-transferase after excluding the possibility of phylogenetic constraint and random drift. The observed correlations are indicative of parallel changes in the repertoire sizes of the six <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> that are due to similar demands for the quantity of these different genes in different lineages of Drosophila. In conclusion, we propose that the correlated evolution among these six <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> in Drosophila is a signature of a parallel response to ecological adaptation...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{sequencing}} of several gymnosperm genomes has greatly facilitated studying {{the evolution of}} their <b>genes</b> and <b>gene</b> <b>families.</b> In this study, we examine the evidence for expression-mediated selection {{in the first two}} fully sequenced representatives of the gymnosperm plant clade (Picea abies and Picea glauca). We use genome-wide estimates of gene expression (> 50, 000 expressed genes) to study the relationship between gene expression, codon bias, rates of sequence divergence, protein length, and gene duplication. We found that gene expression is correlated with rates of sequence divergence and codon bias, suggesting that natural selection is acting on Picea protein-coding genes for translational efficiency. Gene expression, rates of sequence divergence, and codon bias are correlated with the size of <b>gene</b> <b>families,</b> with large multicopy <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> having, on average, a lower expression level and breadth, lower codon bias, and higher rates of sequence divergence than single-copy <b>gene</b> <b>families.</b> Tissue-specific patterns of gene expression were more common in large <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> with large <b>gene</b> expression divergence than in single-copy families. Recent family expansions combined with large gene expression variation in paralogs and increased rates of sequence evolution suggest that some Picea <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> are rapidly evolving to cope with biotic and abiotic stress. Our study highlights the importance of gene expression and natural selection in shaping the evolution of protein-coding genes in Picea species, and sets the ground for further studies investigating the evolution of individual <b>gene</b> <b>families</b> in gymnosperms...|$|R

25|$|The MHC <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> {{is divided}} into three subgroups: class I, class II, and class III. Class I MHC {{molecules}} have β2 subunits so can only be recognised by CD8 co-receptors. Class II MHC molecules have β1 and β2 subunits and can be recognised by CD4 co-receptors. In this way MHC molecules chaperone which type of lymphocytes may bind to the given antigen with high affinity, since different lymphocytes express different T-Cell Receptor (TCR) co-receptors.|$|E

25|$|Whereas a <b>gene</b> <b>family</b> (several tightly linked genes {{performing}} {{similar or}} identical functions) arises by duplication {{of a single}} original gene, this is usually {{not the case with}} supergenes. In a supergene some of the constituent genes have quite distinct functions, so they must have come together under selection. This process might involve suppression of crossing-over, translocation of chromosome fragments and possibly occasional cistron duplication.
