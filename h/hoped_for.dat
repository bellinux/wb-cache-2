5|$|In 1771, {{using the}} {{combined}} 1761 and 1769 transit data, the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande calculated the astronomical unit {{to have a}} value of 153 million kilometers (±1 million km). The precision was less than had been <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> because of the black drop effect, but still a considerable improvement on Horrocks's calculations.|$|E
5|$|Many planned {{elements}} were never filmed, due to production time constraints. Moore had <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> an extended battle {{scene in which}} Data would be electrocuted, and Wesley Crusher blown up in an explosion. Production of the episode ended on December 19.|$|E

5|$|When Gauguin {{agreed to}} visit Arles in 1888, Van Gogh <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> friendship, and the {{realisation}} of {{his idea of}} an artists' collective. While waiting, in August he painted Sunflowers. When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, {{as well as the}} study The Poet Against a Starry Sky.|$|E
5|$|After {{being hurt}} {{in a fall}} in his bathtub after {{slipping}} on a bar of soap, Miller was expected to withdraw and the Republican leadership <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> a deal as late as May 15, the day Miller was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use to announce his withdrawal.

5|$|After {{being open}} for {{little more than}} a year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a {{reputation}} as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly abandoned his desire to teach to focus more on writing his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. The play did not earn him the money he had <b>hoped</b> <b>for,</b> though, until Garrick produced it in 1749.|$|E
5|$|As {{the show}} progressed through tryouts, Hammerstein {{repeatedly}} revised it, obscuring Suzy's profession {{and the nature}} of Fauna's house. Pipe Dream met with poor reviews, and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale. It had no national tour or London production, and has rarely been presented since. No movie version of the show was made; the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (which licenses their works) once <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> a film version featuring the Muppets with Fauna played by Miss Piggy.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{was armed}} with two 100-pounder smoothbore, muzzle-loading Somerset cannon and two rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns. The breech-loading guns {{were of a}} new design from Armstrong and much was <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> them. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an {{armoured}} target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration, and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the guns from service shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Abdul Hamid II {{was overthrown}} during the Young Turk Revolution, which {{launched}} the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Armenians gained more {{seats in the}} 1908 parliament, but the reforms fell short of the greater autonomy that the ARF had <b>hoped</b> <b>for.</b> The Adana massacre in 1909 also created antipathy between Armenians and Turks, and the ARF cut relations with the Young Turks in 1912.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st century BCE and {{the first}} half of that century, it was the Mediterranean port of the Nabateans, whose caravans arrived there from Petra or from Elath on the Red Sea. In 96 BCE, the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus besieged the city for a year. The inhabitants, who had <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> help from the Nabatean king Aretas II, were killed and their city {{destroyed}} by Jannaeus when Aretas did not come to their aid.|$|E

He suffered an adverse reaction to his first treatment, but continued the program after a period of rest.|$|E

5|$|Jackson was speculated as a {{potential}} candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004, but declined to run and instead became one of Barack Obama's early supporters. He endorsed Howard Dean for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, joining Al Gore in saying Dean was the most likely candidate in the primary to beat Bush. The endorsement was a bitter blow to the hopes of candidate Al Sharpton, who had <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> endorsements from both Jackson and his father.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1983, about 10,000 demonstrators {{turned out}} for protest at the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant (well short of the 21,000 <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> by protest organizers). No arrests were made. On August 10, 1987 (the 42nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki), 320 demonstrators were arrested after they tried to force a one-day {{shutdown}} of the plant. A similar protest with a turnout of about 3,500 was staged on August 6, 1989 (the anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{empirical}} study {{to study the}} effects of religious duties, communicating with parents; leisure, media planning, city planning, socio-economic and education on different factors influencing the future of youth. The proposed study of this paper designs a questionnaire and distributes it among 400 people aged 18 to 29 and the results are investigated using Pearson correlation ratios. The results of our investigation indicate that there are some positive and meaningful relationship between religious duties and their <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> future (r= 44 %), a positive and meaningful relationship between leisure and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> future (31 %). In addition, there is a relatively positive and somewhat meaningful relationship between city planning and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> future (15 %) and finally, a small but positive relationship between media planning and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> the future (6 %).

5|$|Operation Slapstick did {{not provide}} the {{diversion}} General Eisenhower had <b>hoped</b> <b>for.</b> The decision by Heidrich not to oppose the landings was made without reference to Kesselring's headquarters. Heidrich had expected to be confronted by an overwhelming Allied force and had withdrawn his units north, although he endeavoured to delay the Allied advance where possible by ambushes and roadblocks. The German division went on to frustrate the Allied attempt to advance on Rome during the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944.|$|E

Through the remaining hours of darkness, only 153 men were able to cross– less than ¼ of the <b>hoped</b> <b>for</b> reinforcement.|$|E
