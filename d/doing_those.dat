'Come Dancing' was an attempt to get back to roots, about my sisters' memories of dancing in the '50s." [...] The song is a nostalgic look back at childhood memories of its writer: the Kinks' frontman Ray Davies, remembering his older sister going on dates to the local Palais dance hall where big bands would play.|$|E

He noted that there was [...] "conflict" [...] due to his and Matheos' different musical tastes, [...] "but it's not a personality conflict. It's a musical conflict where we want different things to happen and have to work it musically." [...] Moore considered this conflict to be [...] "pretty much {{the only thing that}} makes OSI relatively original. If it was just one way or the other, like the singer-songwriter stuff, electronic music or progressive metal, there's a lot of people <b>doing</b> <b>those</b> things already." ...|$|E

While Homer is looking for his weights in the attic, Bart stumbles upon several old paintings of Ringo Starr that Marge made as a student in high school, {{when she had a}} crush on Starr. Marge tells Lisa that she was scolded by her art teacher for <b>doing</b> <b>those</b> paintings; she also recalls sending a painting to Starr for an [...] "honest opinion", but she never got a response. Lisa suggests that Marge take a painting class at Springfield Community College, which she does. She makes a painting of Homer on the couch in his underwear, which her professor, Lombardo, praises. The painting wins the college art show, thus gaining her fame and the headlines of the newspapers.|$|E

500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started <b>doing</b> <b>those</b> blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story for}} [...] "Release" [...] was {{developed}} by John Shiban and David Amann; the teleplay was written by Amann. Kim Manners helmed the directing of the episode. [...] "Release" [...] was originally going to be written by Shiban alone, but he later turned the script over to Amann because he was needed elsewhere at the time. Shiban had been desiring {{to write a story}} like [...] "Release" [...] for a while. The character of Hayes was crafted as an ambitious character, inspired by the works of Arthur Conan Doyle: he was written to be either a [...] "brilliant guy who's solving crimes with his amazing intuition", comparable to Sherlock Holmes, or [...] "a guy who's actually <b>doing</b> <b>those</b> crimes and playing a game", like Professor Moriarty. Shiban and Amman came up with a story wherein Scully encounters a [...] "genius" [...] from her classes at the FBI Academy at Quantico. Later on, they extrapolated on the story, allowing the [...] "genius" [...] crime solver to help John Doggett {{find out what happened to}} his son, Luke Doggett.|$|E
500|$|On {{his arrival}} in the United States, Woo went through several scripts before {{deciding}} on Hard Target. Describing the scripts he received, Woo stated that [...] "Some of them were good—some of them were very good—but the rest were simply martial-arts movies and I told producers that I {{had no interest in}} <b>doing</b> <b>those</b> kinds of films anymore. I'd done a lot of them already." [...] One of the scripts offered to Woo at this period was for Face/Off, which he turned down at the time, turned off by the science fiction aspect of the story. The script for Hard Target was written by Chuck Pfarrer. Director Andrew Davis was interested in the script, but ultimately turned it down. Woo read Pfarrer's script for Hard Target appreciating that it was a [...] "simple but powerful story, with a lot of feeling underneath. For a good action film you need a solid structure. Chuck gave me that". Woo also stated that the story is [...] "less John Woo" [...] but the visual aspect would be [...] "very John Woo". Pfarrer wrote the script originally basing it on the film The Naked Prey. After the script did not turn out Pfarrer worked on a script influenced by the film Aliens that became the basis for his comic Virus. The final attempt was a script based on the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game. Pfarrer had the story take place in New Orleans to give an explanation of Jean-Claude Van Damme's accent.|$|E

500|$|When Carey {{worked with}} Walden on [...] "I Don't Wanna Cry", {{they worked on}} several other songs. Together, they decided to [...] "slow down the tempo" [...] and create a [...] "crying type of ballad," [...] one which {{according}} to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres. After they completed the song, Lawrence noted {{how much of a}} perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct [...] "one line" [...] that troubled her. As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, [...] "Someday" [...] became Wake's favorite from the start, [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it {{if you want to do}} it.' It was great, I'm glad she called me." [...] During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio. As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody. In [...] "All in Your Mind", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing staccatos up to F7. According to the artist, her voice [...] "split" [...] while <b>doing</b> <b>those</b> ornaments. While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for <b>doing</b> <b>those</b> episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{their own}} initiative, Arthur Carford, who had gained {{employment}} as an orderly at the Medical Examination Centre, where potential conscripts fitness was reviewed, {{and three other}} members from Sheffield attempted to steal cards to exempt the bearer from military service for medical reasons. The four were arrested and charged at Sheffield Magistrates Court with [...] "stealing, receiving, conspiring to steal and conspiring to receive these cards, to which later was added a fifth charge of <b>doing</b> <b>those</b> acts [...] "with intent to assist the enemy". Realising the seriousness of these charges (especially the fifth charge which carried a charge of 20 years imprisonment), one of the defendants, Fred Jackson, defended himself arguing that {{by virtue of the}} political ideals it was impossible for Trotskyists to do anything deliberately to assist Nazi Germany, leading to no guilty verdicts on the fifth charge. He was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment, with Carford receiving 18 months, however, given the irresponsibility of their initial action they were barred from holding office within the WIL for a year and reduced to supporter status respectively. Of the other two defendants, Ward received 6 months and Beet was acquitted, but as both had given statements to the police that could have implicated the WIL they were expelled.|$|E
