5|$|Gimbal: The <b>gimbal</b> {{is known}} as the 'Cardan' {{suspension}} after Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), yet it was known long before him. The British scientist Joseph Needham writes that the earliest confirmed use of gimbals in Europe is the 9th century recipe book Little Key of Painting and Belgian chemist and historian of science Mappae clavicula, which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a rolling motion. Needham and BGeorge Sarton both write that an Arabic translation—dated to roughly the era of Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833)—of an ancient Greek work now lost (i.e. Pneumatica) by 3rd-century BC Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280– c. 220 BC) contains a description of gimbals used to support an inkpot that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic interpolation and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts {{that for the most part}} the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the <b>gimbal.</b> Around 180 AD, the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) — who also created a rotary fan and zoetrope lamp—invented a 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. This incense burner had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the burner in the middle remained constantly level. This is the first clear reference in China of the <b>gimbal,</b> although there is a hint in the writing of Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). The <b>gimbal</b> incense burner is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of <b>gimbal</b> incense burners from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) still exist. In the Liang Dynasty (502–557) there is mention of gimbals used in hinges for doors and windows, while an unnamed artisan presented a warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) in 692 which employed gimbals to keep it constantly balanced.|$|E
5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could <b>gimbal</b> either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and yaw control. The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could <b>gimbal</b> along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed plane, in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $4.4 million in cash, was filmed on a soundstage. A second plane, designed to have frosted windows, was attached to a <b>gimbal,</b> about five feet off the ground. To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin, the art department built a set with real trees and a painted backdrop. To depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane, puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen, while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica of the actor. A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home, where Hank and his wife Sarah (Fonda) reside. The first set was the main floor an exterior entrance way, and the second was created for the upstairs bedrooms. Principal photography concluded on March 13, 1998, after 55 days of filming.|$|E
25|$|After antiquity, <b>gimbals</b> {{remained}} {{widely known}} in the Near East. In the Latin West, reference to the device appeared again in the 9th century recipe book called the Little Key of Painting Mappae clavicula. The French inventor Villard de Honnecourt depicts a set of <b>gimbals</b> in his famous sketchbook (see right). In the early modern period, dry compasses were suspended in <b>gimbals.</b>|$|R

5|$|Animators created digital {{versions}} of the battle suits, at times with the soldiers inside them. On the set a 3D scanner booth digitized the actors, while hand scanners captured the textures of the practical suits. Imageworks received pieces of the suits for reference. The company's library of reflection data on various materials helped enhance the armor's shading. SPI's crew created the base at Heathrow by merging the set at Leavesden with digitally altered footage from the airport; the film's drop ships, barracks and mess halls, replaced the existing aircraft. Framestore created the digital Paris and recreated it with photomodeling from three days of visits. Given {{that the city is}} a no-fly zone, Framestore's artists obtained their aerial images by climbing an 80-meter crane parked in the Louvre courtyard. The quadcopter dropships were based on the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that can tilt its rotors to fly as either planes or helicopters, while having a design closer to the Quad TiltRotor. Aside from the crashed ship on the beachhead and a <b>gimbal</b> set to depict the plane used by Cage's squad, the film used digital models for most ships. The computer-generated dropships had some of Imageworks' heaviest detail given the proximity of the actors to the aircraft in the camp scenes; the effects artists wanted to make sure the ships broke apart in a realistic way during the crashes.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a <b>gimbal</b> equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyroscope}} is a wheel {{mounted in}} two or three gimbals, which are a pivoted supports that allow the rotation of the wheel about a single axis. A set of three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost <b>gimbal</b> to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. In the case of a gyroscope with two gimbals, the outer <b>gimbal,</b> which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support. This outer <b>gimbal</b> possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none. The inner <b>gimbal</b> is mounted in the gyroscope frame (outer <b>gimbal)</b> so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame (outer <b>gimbal).</b> This inner <b>gimbal</b> has two degrees of rotational freedom.|$|E

25|$|In {{inertial}} navigation systems, <b>gimbal</b> lock may occur when vehicle rotation causes {{two of the}} three <b>gimbal</b> rings to align with their pivot axes in a single plane. When this occurs, it is no longer possible to maintain the sensing platform's orientation.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of limited <b>gimbal</b> movement such as Skylab's is that singularities are {{less of a}} problem. If Skylab's inner gimbals {{had been able to}} reach 90 degrees or more away from zero, then the 'North and South poles' could have become singularities; the <b>gimbal</b> stops prevented this.|$|E
25|$|Three single-degree-of-freedom {{gyroscopes}} {{have their}} input axes aligned along an orthogonal inertial coordinate system. Three signal generators, {{fixed to the}} output axis of each gyro, generated electrical signals proportional to the torque disturbances. The signals were transmitted through the servo electronics which terminated in the <b>gimbal</b> pivot servotorque motors. The servoloops maintained the inner <b>gimbal</b> rotationally fixed in inertial space. That is, while the vehicle rolled, pitched, and yawed, the inner <b>gimbal</b> remained in the same attitude to which it was set just before launch. Though it was being translated during the launch and orbit process, it was rotationally fixed.|$|E

25|$|In August 2015, {{selected}} units began receiving upgrades {{to their}} Raven sensors. The Raven <b>Gimbal</b> is a rotating camera with a 360-degree <b>gimbal,</b> which replaces the fixed camera that required maneuvering the entire aircraft to look. The new camera {{can also be}} switched between day and night settings without landing and swapping sensors. In August 2017 Belgium bought 32 Raven-drones, Luxembourg: 16.|$|E
25|$|In {{portable}} photography equipment, single-axis <b>gimbal</b> {{heads are}} used {{in order to allow}} a balanced movement for camera and lenses. This proves useful in wildlife photography as well as in any other case where very long and heavy telephoto lenses are adopted: a <b>gimbal</b> head rotates a lens around its center of gravity, thus allowing for easy and smooth manipulation while tracking moving subjects.|$|E
50|$|Some systems {{place the}} linear accelerometers on a <b>gimballed</b> {{gyrostabilized}} platform. The <b>gimbals</b> are {{a set of}} three rings, each {{with a pair of}} bearings initially at right angles. They let the platform twist about any rotational axis (or, rather, they let the platform keep the same orientation while the vehicle rotates around it). There are two gyroscopes (usually) on the platform.|$|R

25|$|<b>Gimbals</b> {{are also}} used to mount {{everything}} from small camera lenses to large photographic telescopes.|$|R
25|$|More modern CMGs such as {{the four}} units {{installed}} on the ISS in 2000 have unlimited <b>gimbal</b> travel and therefore no 'blind areas'. Thus {{they do not have}} to be mounted facing along mutually perpendicular directions; the four units on the ISS all face the same way. The control program need not concern itself with <b>gimbal</b> stops, but on the other hand it must pay more attention to avoiding singularities.|$|E
25|$|Very large <b>gimbal</b> mounts in {{the form}} 2 or 3 axis altitude-altitude mounts are used in {{satellite}} photography for tracking purposes.|$|E
25|$|Singularities {{are closely}} related to the {{phenomena}} of <b>gimbal</b> lock, which has a similar root cause of axes becoming lined up.|$|E
50|$|These {{missiles}} are also much more agile, some by employing thrust vectoring (typically <b>gimballed</b> thrust).|$|R
25|$|Handheld 3-axis <b>gimbals</b> {{are used}} in {{stabilization}} systems designed to give the camera operator the independence of handheld shooting without camera vibration or shake. Powered by three brushless motors, the <b>gimbals</b> {{have the ability to}} keep the camera level on all axes as the camera operator moves the camera. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) responds to movement and utilizes its three separate motors to stabilize the camera.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two basic}} classes of IRUs/IMUs are [...] "gimballed" [...] and [...] "strapdown". The older, larger <b>gimballed</b> systems have become less {{prevalent}} {{over the years}} as the performance of newer, smaller strapdown systems has improved greatly via the use of solid-state sensors and advanced real-time computer algorithms. <b>Gimballed</b> systems are still used in some high-precision applications where strapdown performance may not be as good.|$|R
25|$|The CMG {{control program}} was {{responsible}} for {{making sure that the}} gimbals never hit the stops, by redistributing angular momentum between the three rotors to bring large <b>gimbal</b> angles closer to zero. Since the total angular momentum to be stored had only three degrees of freedom, while the control program could change six independent variables (the three pairs of <b>gimbal</b> angles), the program had sufficient freedom of action to do this while still obeying other constraints such as avoiding anti-parallel alignments.|$|E
25|$|Two {{vertical}} alignment pendulums sent signals before launch to ground support equipment, which generated {{signals to the}} platform gyro torque generators to level the inner <b>gimbal.</b> The {{vertical alignment}} system levelled the platform to an accuracy of ±2.5 arc seconds.|$|E
25|$|Light taut wire, LTW or LWTW. The oldest {{position}} {{reference system}} used for DP {{is still very}} accurate in relatively shallow water. A clumpweight is lowered to the seabed. By measuring the amount of wire paid out and {{the angle of the}} wire by a <b>gimbal</b> head, the relative position can be calculated. Care should be taken not to let the wire angle become too large to avoid dragging. For deeper water the system is less favourable, as current will curve the wire. There are however systems that counteract this with a <b>gimbal</b> head on the clumpweight. Horizontal LTW’s are also used when operating close to a structure. Objects falling on the wire are a risk here.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{practice}} {{is to avoid}} the use of <b>gimbals</b> entirely. In the context of inertial navigation systems, {{that can be done}} by mounting the inertial sensors directly to the body of the vehicle (this is called a strapdown system) and integrating sensed rotation and acceleration digitally using quaternion methods to derive vehicle orientation and velocity. Another way to replace <b>gimbals</b> is to use fluid bearings or a flotation chamber.|$|R
