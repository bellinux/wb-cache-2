40|$|Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) has a civil {{statutory}} scheme that broadly allows 2 ̆ 2 any person 2 ̆ 2 to recover damages {{if he has}} been injured in his business or property by reason of a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s violation of section 1962 the Act. While the statute was aimed at organized crime, {{it has been used}} far more against legitimate businesses. Courts continuously wrestle with the broad language of the statute. The author discusses two questions regarding the interpretation of Civil RICO that remain unanswered: whether the same entity can be the 2 ̆ 2 culpable person 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 enterprise 2 ̆ 2 under Section 1962 (a); and if so, whether that entity can be held liable under respondeat superior for misconduct of employees or agents. By examining the history and development of RICO as compared to the CEA, which imposes strict liability against <b>Future</b> <b>Commissions</b> <b>Merchants</b> (FCMs) for their agents activities, the author concludes that unless congress dictates otherwise, respondeat superior should apply to FCMs in civil RICO cases...|$|R

The CBA collection vastly increased the library’s holdings of periodicals and primary state materials, and filled large gaps in 19 th and 20 th century monographic holdings. The acquisition of this material has helped make the Kresge Law Library a true research facility. [URL]...|$|R

50|$|The {{initial margin}} {{requirement}} {{is the amount}} of collateral required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value of collateral after haircuts dips below the maintenance margin requirement, the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial margin requirement. On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, <b>futures</b> <b>commission</b> <b>merchants</b> may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%-25%.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} few years after the {{introduction}} of commodity markets, new exchanges opened with wild abandon, and speculative volume ballooned. Soon a directive titled The Notice of Firmly Curbing the Blind Development of the Futures Market was launched. In October 1994, the State Council rectified over 50 futures exchanges down to 15 futures exchanges, delisted 20 futures contracts (leaving 35), began issuing licenses to <b>futures</b> <b>commission</b> <b>merchants</b> for the first time while lopping their number by over 70%, restricted trading on foreign futures exchanges, introduced new rules and regulations, and shifted the control of the exchanges from local governments to regulatory authorities. DCE's market share then ranked No. 9 in China with Dry kelp as a pilot product. DCE traded soybeans and corn back then. [...] Continued abuse in the market brought forth the Second Rectification in 1998, most of the surviving 15 futures exchanges were restructured, and subsequently closed. Three national level future exchanges emerged: Shanghai Metal Exchange, Dalian Commodity Exchange, Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. The number of futures contracts was cut back further to 12 from 35, and more brokers were closed, leaving just 175 standing from the early 1990s peak of 1,000. Margins were standardized and regulations further toughened. Trading on foreign futures exchanges was further restricted to a small number of large, global entities. Soybeans, soy meal and beer barley were traded at DCE.|$|E
