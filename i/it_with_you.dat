He made his stage debut at age 13, in a school production of George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, and appearances in West Windsor-Plainsboro High School productions of Meet Me in St. Louis and You Can't Take <b>It</b> <b>with</b> <b>You</b> followed. At the Hun School he took acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus, and after high school graduation he studied acting at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, eventually dropping out after he was cast in Dead Poets Society (1989).

25|$|A {{long list}} of actors were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Potter (originally named Herbert Potter): Edward Arnold, Charles Bickford, Edgar Buchanan, Louis Calhern, Victor Jory, Raymond Massey, Vincent Price and even Thomas Mitchell. However, Lionel Barrymore, who eventually won the role, was a famous Ebenezer Scrooge in radio dramatizations of A Christmas Carol at the time and was a natural choice for the role. Barrymore had also worked with Capra on his 1938 Best Picture Oscar winner, You Can't Take <b>It</b> <b>with</b> <b>You.</b>|$|E
25|$|H.B. Warner, who {{was cast}} as the {{drugstore}} owner Mr. Gower, actually studied medicine before going into acting. He was also in some of Capra's other films, including Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Lost Horizon, You Can't Take <b>It</b> <b>with</b> <b>You,</b> and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. In the silent era, he had {{played the role of}} Jesus Christ in Cecil B. DeMille's The King of Kings (1927). The name Gower came from Capra's employer Columbia Pictures, which had been located on Gower Street for many years. Also on Gower Street was a drugstore that was a favorite for the studio's employees.|$|E

25|$|The {{package was}} aimed at {{attracting}} viewers to NBC stations in the half-hour preceding prime time (8:00p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone, 7:00p.m. elsewhere), and was conceived {{as a result of}} the FCC's loosening of the Prime Time Access Rule, legislation passed in 1971 that required networks to turn over the 7:30p.m. (Eastern) time slot to local stations to program local or syndicated content; and the relaxation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which had prevented networks from producing content from their own syndication units to fill the void. The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy! and Hollywood Squares. Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made and You Can't Take <b>It</b> <b>With</b> <b>You</b> were cancelled at the end of the 1987–88 season, with She's the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. Out of This World ran for three additional seasons, airing mainly on weekends, and was the most successful of the five series.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Marriott had several guest {{performances}} on television shows including The Defenders, Route 66, and The Patty Duke Show. In 1963 he {{was cast in}} a primary role in Robert Thom's Bicycle Ride to Nevada, which opened the season at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in September, prior to premiering on Broadway at the Cort Theatre on September 24. The play was not well received by the critics, and closed after a single performance. His next project was {{a prominent role in}} The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, which opened on November 11, 1963 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, after a week of previews. While this Broadway premiere was not a commercial success, the Bertolt Brecht play is considered a classical theater satire. Marriott's film contribution in 1963 fared better, as he played the role of Hurst in the critically acclaimed, The Cool World. During the decade he would continue to perform in regional theater, such as You Can't Take <b>It</b> <b>with</b> <b>You</b> in 1966 at the Corning Summer Theatre. The following year he appeared in Eugene O'Neill's More Stately Mansions, which opened at the Broadhurst Theatre on Halloween (October 31) 1967, and ran for 142 performances. The play starred Ingrid Bergman, Colleen Dewhurst, and Arthur Hill. After Mansions closed on March 2, 1968, Marriott appeared in the very next production at the Broadhurst, as Roger in the Gore Vidal political comedy, Weekend, which opened on March 13. The play was not well received and closed after only 21 performances.|$|E

[...] Carr observes that Mahler could conceivably have lived to see [...] "his day"; his near-contemporary Richard Strauss survived until 1949, while Sibelius, just five years younger than Mahler, lived until 1957.|$|E

500|$|McCracken starred with Eddie Dowling, {{a veteran}} Broadway actor, {{in the play}} Angel in the Pawnshop, in a 1950 tour and on Broadway in 1951. She played a young woman seeking to escape her {{marriage}} from a homicidal thief, in a pawnshop owned by Dowling's character. While in the pawnshop, she puts on old clothing and fantasizes that she is living in happier times. Although she engaged in some choreographed dancing during the play, it was a straight dramatic role. While the play was being prepared for Broadway, in October 1950, she appeared on television in the premiere of the Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, playing Essie in You Can't Take <b>It</b> <b>with</b> <b>You.</b> At that time, McCracken gave an interview disparaging what she described as the [...] "over-commercialization" [...] of television, which might have hurt her career in the new medium. Reviews for Angel in the Pawnshop were negative, and she received mixed reviews for her performance.|$|E
500|$|Tipping the Velvet was {{critically}} acclaimed upon its release and Waters' writing style highly praised. Harriet Malinowitz {{wrote that the}} story is an [...] "utterly captivating, high octane narrative" [...] and Mel Steel of The Independent wrote, [...] "Could this be a new genre? The bawdy lesbian picaresque novel? Whatever it is, take <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> It's gorgeous." [...] Kirkus Reviews also praised it, writing [...] "Waters' debut offers terrific entertainment: swiftly paced, crammed with colorful depictions of 1890s London and vividly sketched Dickensian supporting characters", comparing the depiction of Nancy's parents to the fishing community in David Copperfield, and adding that it [...] "pulsat with highly charged (and explicitly presented) erotic heat". John Perry in The San Francisco Chronicle stated that it [...] "has the qualities of an extravagantly upholstered armchair. Tricked out in gaudy fabric and yards of fringe, it offers a sensual experience that leaves the reader marveling at the author's craftsmanship, idiosyncrasy and sheer effort." [...] Perry did acknowledge, however, that modern optimism was probably the impetus driving Waters' vision of a lesbian past.|$|E
500|$|During the 1990s, Reubens kept a low profile, {{dedicating}} {{himself to}} writing and collecting {{a variety of}} things, [...] "everything from fake food, to lamps", although he did do some dubbing and took small parts in films such as 1992's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Tim Burton's Batman Returns (Reubens portrayed the Penguin's father) and 1996's Matilda and Dunston Checks In. In 1993, he voiced for a character in another one of Burton's productions, The Nightmare Before Christmas. (Reubens would later voice Lock for the video game [...] in 2004.) During the mid-1990s, Reubens played a recurring role on the TV series Murphy Brown. The role earned him positive reviews and his first and only non-Pee-wee Emmy nomination, for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. He appeared six times on the show between 1995 and 1997. Afterward, Reubens began working on an NBC pilot entitled Meet the Muckles, a show that {{would be based on}} You Can't Take <b>It</b> <b>with</b> <b>You.</b> The project got stuck in development hell, and was later dropped when Reubens' ideas grew too elaborate and expensive, although Philip Rosenthal blamed NBC's negative response on Reubens being on a [...] "blacklist".|$|E

On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden.

[...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E
500|$|Similarly to {{the editing}} process of their {{previous}} DVD Disasterpieces, Crahan watched and analysed all of the footage recorded for the DVD. However in contrast to Disasterpeices this DVD was intended to show a previously unseen side to the band. During an interview in 2006 guitarist Mick Thomson explained that with the DVD the band intended to [...] "bring something new", he also went on to add [...] " [...] more backstage stuff, getting to see more inside stuff {{as opposed to just}} a concert performance." [...] Crahan explained how he wanted to allow the viewer in on more of their time instead of just their performance, recalling a moment when the band were in Australia. He included the footage in the film, explaining; [...] "So I go down to Australia and I go ‘Jesus, there’s bats in the air.’ I’m going to film it and share <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> because it’s part of our lives together. But most bands and people don’t want to share that side of it and I think that’s wrong." [...] Throughout the movie whenever the band members appear unmasked, their faces are blurred, whereas on the second disc, during the interviews, they are completely revealed. When questioned on the subject during an interview on The Sauce in 2007, Crahan explained that when the band perform, the masks are always a part of their show and footage of them unmasked is blurred to represent this. Further adding; [...] "We chose to blur it because, it's really an intrusion. [...] That's our safe place and I kind of broke the veil a little bit by grabbing a camera and trying to show everybody those kinds of things that go on." ...|$|E

[...] She also tweeted {{a picture of her}} on set, wearing ripped tights, a Burberry Prorsum studded leather jacket and matching fingerless leather gloves. The making-of was chronicled on the special Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale, which aired on MTV on April 3, 2011, at 21:00 EST (02:00 UTC). In the special, Spears is seen watching the playback, as she later explained, [...] " [...] just to make sure it's right and that the costume looks right and the dancers are together and we all look in unison. It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing." [...] Spears said that she did not feel the need to top herself, saying that [...] "I've made so many videos that I'm at the point that I genuinely want to enjoy myself, and I have such a good team of people with me.
