The analysis to the issue is crucial to be investigated due to earnings is considered as a principal information that becomes an attention <b>for</b> <b>the</b> users of accounting information in taking the investment decision, credit decision, etc. The differences from previous researches are: First, on the previous researches consider the information contents of earning, timeliness of earnings announcement, and the earnings quality, whereas on the other researches the three variables were not analysed together. Second, the previous researches haven’t put retained earnings and net cash flow as control variables, because {{they are supposed to}} have effect to the causal relation.

25|$|Large {{public service}} rate increases, added to weak {{regulatory}} frameworks and constant renegotiation of concession contracts, brought outsized profits to the privatized companies. Between 1993 and 2000, the 200 largest companies in Argentina accumulated US$28.4 billion in profits, 56.8% {{of which were}} earned by privatized companies, and 26.3% by firms that had ties to those companies. Prices and wages were virtually frozen in Argentina from 1995 to 2001; but utility fees rose {{in line with the}} U.S. inflation rate, constituting an additional source of <b>earnings</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> newly privatized companies. The linking of public services fees charged in Argentina to the U.S. inflation rate enabled privatized companies to pocket US$9 billion by 2000. Additionally, privatized firms sent 70% of their earnings abroad while failing to pay the annual concession fees or to make all the investments stipulated by the contracts. The companies also imported large quantities of inputs and goods produced by associated firms, contracting heavy trade debts in dollars while violating a law that required them to prioritize Argentine products when making purchases.|$|E

Having spent most of his <b>earnings</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> party he found himself in a deep financial crisis. His movie career brought another star of DMK, M. G.

The party won a landslide victory in the 1967 general elections, but soon after the elections the animosity between SSR and Karunanidhi deepened. SSR complained of threats to his life and eventually left DMK to join AIADMK along with his old friend MGR. His aspirations as a political stalwart and as a film superstar were overshadowed by M. G.

25|$|This was the fiscally sound, {{but still}} burdened, Reading Railroad whose {{presidency}} Gowen assumed in 1869. Instead of gleaning insight from the railroad's successful struggle to bring its overhead under control, {{he turned the}} enterprise in the following decade into a mysteriously accounted borrowing machine. In 1874, a former Gowen friend turned enemy by Gowen's organization of the anthracite industry, accused Gowen in print of dishonest and misleading financial representations in the Reading's annual report and its prospectuses. Though Gowen was able to easily slough off such accusation at that time, it was renewed more powerfully in 1876 by Charles E. Smith—Gowen's direct predecessor as president, who had recommended the young man for the position in his absence. Even following Gowen's election to the post in his own right, Smith had remained on the corporation's Board of Managers. After hearing from Gowen of a US$7 million floating debt {{that had never been}} discussed in any board meetings, Smith inspected the unpublished books of the subsidiary Coal & Iron Co., which issued no annual report of its own. He found that the parent corporation's floating debt was being transferred to the subsidiary before the parent's fiscal year end in November, to avoid appearing in year-end statements; only to be shifted back to the parent prior to the subsidiary's own fiscal year end in December, thus effectively masking the joint enterprise's precarious condition overall. Smith raised the issue to the Reading's principal source of funds, the McCalmont Brothers investment banking firm in London, seeking Gowen's ouster, but was rebuffed. Though Gowen remained as president, and Smith resigned from the board, the incident forced Gowen's 1876 annual report to approximate frankness. It indicated the corporation's funded debt as US$65 million, resulting in US$5.5 million annually in carrying charges, compared to just over US$3 million in <b>earnings</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> railroad and a US$600,000 loss for the Coal & Iron Co.|$|E

500|$|The piece-rate {{approach}} to wages {{had been introduced}} in the first Five-Year Plan in 1928 and had changed very little since then. In practice the piece-rate system led to many inefficiencies in Soviet industry. One issue was the vast bureaucracy that was involved in administering wage payments. Each Soviet ministry or government department would set its own rates and wage scales for work in the factories or enterprises {{for which they were}} responsible. Within one ministry there could be great variation in pay rates for jobs requiring largely identical responsibilities and skills, based on what the factory was producing, the location of the factory and other factors that Moscow considered important. Basing payments on these central directives often led to long and costly processes in the calculation of wages. Historian Donald Filtzer wrote of one 1930s machinist who in one month completed 1,424 individual pieces of work. Amongst these had been 484 differing tasks, all of which had been assigned a basic individual payment rate of between 3 and 50 kopeks each (1 ruble was equal to 100 kopeks). To calculate this worker's wage, his employer had to process 2,885 documents which had required some 8,500 signatures on [...] of paper, costing the factory 309 rubles, a fifth of what they would pay the worker, whose total <b>earnings</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> labour amounted to 1,389 rubles.|$|E
