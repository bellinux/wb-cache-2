5|$|Aquatic <b>invertebrates</b> {{have been}} {{recognized}} {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic <b>invertebrates</b> preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). <b>Invertebrates</b> discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E
5|$|Like other newts, Triturus {{species are}} {{carnivorous}} and feed mainly on <b>invertebrates.</b> During the land phase, prey include earthworms and other annelids, different insects, woodlice, and snails and slugs. During the breeding season, they prey on various aquatic <b>invertebrates,</b> and also tadpoles of other amphibians {{such as the}} common frog or common toad, and smaller newts. Larvae, depending on their size, eat small <b>invertebrates</b> and tadpoles, and also smaller larvae of their own species.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 100 years, {{riparian}} vegetation communities throughout the Southwest United States have been extensively invaded by Tamara spp. (saltcedar). Saltcedar derives its common name from its physiological adaptation to excrete salts. The production of Tamarix detritus with associated secondary chemicals {{may affect the}} quality of aquatic <b>invertebrate</b> food and habitat resources. An alteration in food and habitat quality may affect the composition and structure of aquatic <b>invertebrate</b> assemblages. A series of experiments was conducted contrasting aquatic <b>invertebrate</b> assemblage densities, colonization rates, and growth rates associated with Tamarix versus native vegetation, Populus fremontii (cottonwood) and Salix exigua (willow), to determine if aquatic <b>invertebrate</b> assemblages have been altered by the invasion of Tamarix. Results of <b>invertebrate</b> growth rates over 13 weeks indicate that Tamarix is minimally different in food quality to cottonwood and willow.

5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other <b>invertebrates,</b> frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates.

In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5000|$|Amphibians {{found in}} the {{northern}} sector of the Jarrah Forest include the rare white-bellied frog (Geocrinia alba), yellow-bellied frog (Geocrinia vitellina) and sunset frog (Spicospina flammocaerulea). [...] Endemic frogs inhabit the southern sector of the Jarrah Forest such as the small western froglet (Crinia subinsignifera) and the western marsh frog (Heleioporus barycragus). Diverse <b>invertebrate</b> fauna populations are also present within the Jarrah Forest.

40|$|Capsule Vegetation {{structure}} and <b>invertebrate</b> abundance interact to influence both foraging sites and nestling provisioning rate; when <b>invertebrate</b> availability is low, adults may take greater risks to provide food for their young. Aims To investigate nesting and foraging ecology in a declining farmland bird whose fledging success {{is influenced by}} the availability of <b>invertebrate</b> prey suitable for feeding to offspring, and where perceived predation risk during foraging can be mediated by vegetation structure. Methods Provisioning rates of adult Yellowhammers feeding nestlings were measured at nests on arable farmland. Foraging sites were compared with control sites of both the same and different microhabitats; provisioning rate was related to habitat features of foraging-sites. Results Foraging sites had low vegetation density, probably enhancing detection of predators, or high <b>invertebrate</b> abundance at high vegetation density. Parental provisioning rate decreased with increasing vegetation cover at foraging sites with high <b>invertebrate</b> abundance; conversely, where <b>invertebrate</b> abundance was low, provisioning rate increased with increasing vegetation cover. Conclusions Vegetation structure at foraging sites suggests that a trade-off between predator detection and prey availability influences foraging site selection in Yellowhammers. Associations between parental provisioning rate and vegetation variables suggest that where <b>invertebrate</b> abundance is high birds increase time spent scanning for predators at higher vegetation densities; however, when prey are scarce, adults may take more risks to provide food for their young...|$|R
