These ulcers originate beneath the bony prominences of the pelvis and progress outward {{as a consequence of}} prolonged pressure. <b>Interface</b> <b>pressure</b> is used clinically to predict and prevent pressure ulcers. However, the relation between <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> and the development of pressure ulcers is not clear.

40|$|Abstract - In this study, we {{investigated}} and compared the dynamic <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution of hands-off and hands-on transtibial prosthetic systems {{by means of}} pressure mapping. Of the 48 established unilateral amputees recruited, half (n = 24) had been wearing pressure-cast prostheses (IceCast Compact) {{and the other half}} (n = 24) had been wearing hand-cast sockets of the patellar tendon bearing design. We measured the dynamic pressure profile of more than 90 % of the area within each prosthetic socket by means of four Tekscan F-Scan socket transducer arrays. We compared the <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> between socket concepts. We found that the distribution of dynamic pressure at the limb-socket interface was similar for the two intervention (socket prescription) groups. However, a significant difference was found in the magnitude of the <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> between the two socket concepts; the interface pressures recorded in the hands-off sockets were higher than those seen in the hands-on concept.

40|$|Patient {{positioning}} is {{an important}} step in spinal surgeries. Many surgical frames allow for lumbar lordosis modulation due to lower limb displacement, however, they do not include a feature which can modulate thoracic kyphosis. A sternum vertical displacer (SVD) prototype has been developed which can increase a subject’s thoracic kyphosis relative to the neutral prone position on a surgical frame. The kyphosis increase is obtained by lifting the subject’s torso off the thoracic cushions with a dedicated sternum cushion that can be displaced vertically. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of SVD utilization on the sagittal curves of the spine. Experimental testing was performed on six healthy volunteers. Lateral radiographs were taken in the neutral and sternum raised positions and then analyzed in order to compare the values of sagittal curves. The displacement of volunteers and surgical frame components between positions was recorded using an optoelectronic device. Finally, <b>interface</b> <b>pressures</b> between the volunteers and surgical frame cushions were recorded using a force sensing array. Average results show that passing from the neutral to sternum raised positions caused an increase of 53 % in thoracic kyphosis and 24 % in lumbar lordosis; both statistically significant. Sensors showed that the sternum was raised a total of 8  cm and that <b>interface</b> <b>pressures</b> were considerably higher in the raised position. The SVD provides a novel way of increasing a patient’s thoracic kyphosis intra-operatively which can be used to improve access to posterior vertebral elements and improve sagittal balance.

40|$|Aims: To explore {{correlations}} between peak pressure and pressure gradient at 1. 5 cm and 2. 5 cm, and selected {{risk factors for}} pressure injury including Waterlow risk assessment score and body mass index. Background: Accurately predicting pressure injury formation remains elusive. Exploring pressure gradients through pressure mapping systems may increase understanding of suspected deep pressure injury development. Methods: A nested prospective correlational exploratory study recruited 120 medical and surgical patients with convenience sampling. Patients were positioned supine with a 30 -degree head elevation, on a computer-linked pressure sensor mapping mat. Mean peak <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> and pressure gradients were calculated. Results: Large correlation coefficients were identified between peak <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> and pressure gradients at distances of 1. 5 cm and 2. 5 cm, indicating that the area {{at the base of}} the 2 ̆ 7 cone-like 2 ̆ 7 pressure damaged area remained essentially constant, rather than increasing with peak <b>interface</b> <b>pressure.</b> Conclusions: Pressure is experienced in a 2 ̆ 7 V 2 ̆ 7 shape rather than a 2 ̆ 7 U 2 ̆ 7 shape. Additionally, the area subjected to the highest pressure gradient is restricted in size and the impact of pressure reduces with distance from the point of peak <b>interface</b> <b>pressure.</b> The results suggest that with increasing peak <b>interface</b> <b>pressure,</b> the surrounding area becomes subject to higher gradients and shearing forces.

Maximal interface stresses during stance phase {{for each of}} 13 transducer sites were deter-mined, then means for all steps calculated. Maximal pressure and resultant shear stress during stance phase were shown at anterior distal or mid-limb sites and the maxima occurred dur-ing the first 50 % of stance phase. Anterior medial and lateral proximal sites showed their greatest pressure during the second 50 %. At lateral mid-limb and popliteal fossa sites, resultant shear stress directions suggest that soft tissue was displaced toward the socket brim during weight-bearing.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Under {{physiological}} loads, debonded cemented femoral stems {{have been}} shown to move within their cement mantle and generate a fluid pump that may facilitate peri-prosthetic osteolysis by pressurizing fluid and circulating wear debris. The long-term physiological loading of rough and polished tapered stems in vitro has shown differences in performance, with greater <b>interface</b> <b>pressures</b> generated by the rough stems. In this study we investigated the individual effects of stem surface finish, degree of mantle wear, and mode of loading on the stem pump mechanism. METHOD: Rough and polished stems were loaded under different regimes in artificially worn cement mantles that permitted either 2 or 5 degrees of rotational stem movement, and the <b>interface</b> <b>pressures</b> were compared. RESULTS: The pressures generated by the rough and polished stems were similar in either type of mantle. The pattern of pressure generation in the 2 -degree mantles was similar to the pressures generated by rough stems after long-term loading, but the high posterior wall pressures fell and the tip pressures increased in the 5 -degree mantles. The torsional loads were principal drivers of pressure generation in all areas of the interface other than the implant tip, where axial loading predominated. INTERPRETATION: Femoral stems with rotational instability under cyclic torsional loads generate elevated <b>interface</b> fluid <b>pressures</b> and flows independently of stem surface finish. The rough surface finish is only important in creating this instability in tapered stems...|$|R

In contrast to the traditional approach of evaluating fabric properties, this study proposes a practical and systematic approach in which the effects of the design attributes of restraint garments can be evaluated based on their unique functions of mobility control, safety and practical use of restraint in medical/healthcare settings. The design and performance of traditional restraint vests are assessed and compared against two new prototypes of restraint garments m terms of the amplitude of arm movement, garment <b>interface</b> <b>pressures</b> and displacements of 3 D motion coordinates by using the Novel Pliance X pressure and motion capturing system.

The broad aim of this thesis was to study the effect of backpack loading configurations on postural stability, physiological variables, perceived exertion, and <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> and compare them to an unloaded condition. The specific aims of this thesis were to: 1) systematically review the literature and identify relevant deficits in knowledge; 2) assess the test-retest reliability and criterion validity of a force plate which has unknown psychometric properties; 3) {{examine the effect of}} carrying a 20 % of body weight loaded backpack and load placement in a backpack (high vs. low load placement) on postural stability, physiological variables and backpack-shoulder interface pressure; 4) assess the effect of hip belt use on postural stability; and 5) investigate the effect of shoulder strap width on backpack-shoulder <b>interface</b> <b>pressure.</b> These aims were investigated using force plates, a metabolic cart, pressure sensors, and questionnaires. Our results indicated that carrying loaded backpacks decreased postural stability, increased physiological variables and perceived exertion as compared to an unloaded condition. While a hip belt did not enhance postural stability, participants reported a perception of increased stability and less exertion. Load placement did not influence postural stability, physiological variables, perceived stability or exertion; however, participants reported lower levels of local perceived exertion at the shoulders and the upper back regions when the load was placed low in the backpack. Conversely, low load placement resulted in higher shoulder <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> as compared to high load placement.

A quasi-dynamic {{finite element model}} was built based on the actual geometry of residual limb, internal bones and socket liner. To simulate the friction/slip boundary conditions between the skin and liner, automated surface-to-surface contact was used. Besides variable external loads and material inertia, the coupling between the large rigid displacement of knee joint and small elastic deformation of residual limb and prosthetic components were also considered. Results. <b>Interface</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution {{was found to have}} the same profile during walking. The high pressures fall over popliteal depression, middle patella tendon, lateral tibia and medial tibia regions. <b>Interface</b> <b>pressure</b> predicted by static or quasi-dynamic analysis had the similar double-peaked waveform shape in stance phase.

The Pharaoh mattress caused a mean restriction of 59 % (SD: 15) flexion-extension, 77 % (SD: 14) lateral bending, and 93 % (SD: 3) rotation, compared with the unrestricted situation. No significant differences in restriction of cervical movement were found between headblocks strapped to a spineboard and the Pharaoh mattress. The mean peak pressures on the Pharaoh mattress were significantly lower than on the spineboard.

40|$|Evidence based {{practice}} {{is important in}} the provision of the best possible care and the enhancement of quality of life for the lower limb amputee. However, there is a limited amount of evidence available about what constitutes a good socket fit. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate and to compare the dynamic <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution of a 'hands on' and 'hands off' type of socket design and relate this to patient feedback and activity level. Evidence gained will contribute to socket prescription and design for trans-tibial amputees. METHOD Subjects: Established (at least 1 year) unilateral trans-tibial amputees (n= 50) were divided in two equal subject groups. Group 1 was fitted with a PTB style socket and group 2 was fitted with a pressure cast style socket. Groups were well matched in terms of age, gender, pathology and BMI. Apparatus: A Tekscan pressure measurement system was used to record the stump/socket <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution of the patients own prosthesis. A Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) was used as a qualitative measure for evaluating the prosthesis and health-related quality of life. An ActivPAL activity monitor was attached to the prosthesis for one week to provided quantitative information on the use of the prosthetic limb. Data Analysis: 3 way repeated measure ANOVA used to indicate variations in <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> within socket and between groups throughout stance phase. Independent sample tests used to determine if differences exist between groups for PEQ and activity monitor results. RESULTS Stump/socket <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution is similar between groups. Pressure levels were higher in pressure cast sockets. Similar responses were seen between groups when answering PEQ questions. Subjects responded with high satisfaction in all PEQ categories. Subjects walked an average of 8200 steps per day; there were no significant differences between groups. PEQ responses did not correlate with daily activity. DISCUSSION <b>Interface</b> <b>pressure</b> within the prosthetic socket can be used to evaluate socket fit. Previous studies comparing the two casting concepts have shown that significant differences exist in the distribution and magnitude of <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> (Convery and Buis, 1998, Goh et al., 2004). The differences in magnitude and distribution of <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> were not observed in this study. Both groups reported a high satisfaction in all areas of quality of life, and the activity of the subject was not influenced by the type of socket worn. The prostheses used in this investigation differed from most previous research studies investigating <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> as subjects own prostheses were instrumented. These had been delivered by their prosthetist and worn in daily activities for at least six months prior to this study. Over this time adjustments to walking patterns and physiological changes to the residual limb and additional stump socks worn may all have contributed in reducing initial differences seen in <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> between casting concepts. CONCLUSION Two different casting philosophies are used to produce the majority of trans-tibial sockets. Based on these principles and previous experimental evidence, a significant difference in loading pattern and pressure was expected within the prosthetic socket. These differences were not seen in the socket in the long term after delivery of the prosthesis. Adaptation over time may have reduced any initial differences between the two designs...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{a thermal}} {{buttocks}} manikin 1 was explored {{as a tool to}} standardize the evaluation of seat comfort. Thermal manikin buttocks were developed and calibrated thermally and anatomically to simulate the sensible heat transfer of a seated person and used to evaluate <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution. In essence, the pressure maps of manikin buttocks with and without heating were compared to those of a seated person. The results of average pressure demonstrated that the thermal manikins have a better response in <b>interface</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement than manikins without heatin...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Under {{physiological}} loads, debonded cemented femoral stems {{have been shown}} to move within their cement mantle and generate a fluid pump that may facilitate peri-prosthetic osteolysis by pressurizing fluid and circulating wear debris. The long-term physiological loading of rough and polished tapered stems in vitro has shown differences in performance, with greater <b>interface</b> <b>pressures</b> generated by the rough stems. In this study we investigated the individual effects of stem surface finish, degree of mantle wear, and mode of loading on the stem pump mechanism...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High {{pressures}} around implants {{can cause}} bone lysis and loosening. We investigated how pressures are generated around cemented femoral stems. METHOD: We compared the pressures generated by rough and polished tapered stems at their cement interfaces, in an in vitro model, {{before and after}} 1 million load cycles. RESULTS: At {{the start of the}} study, the loading of both polished and rough stems generated <b>interface</b> <b>pressures</b> that were not statistically significantly different. After 1 million load cycles, the rough stems generated greater <b>interface</b> <b>pressures</b> than at the start (p = 0. 03), with maximum pressure wave amplitudes of 450, 000 Pa or 3, 375 mm Hg. The pressures generated by polished stems were similar before and after 1 million load cycles, and were lower than the pressures generated by the rough stems (p = 0. 01). Stem loading caused micromotion between the stem and cement. Polished stems migrated distally in the cement but retained rotational and axial stability. The rough stems also migrated distally and wore the cement mantle, leading to increased rotational instability. INTERPRETATION: The change in the rotational micromotion of the rough stem {{is likely to be the}} principal cause of the increased stem pump output and to be a key factor in the longevity of cemented femoral implants...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} a {{research}} project that has utilised, for the first time, a Hydro-casting (HC) technique to create a prosthetic socket for a person with trans-femoral amputation. Outcome measurements of the HC socket were compared with a socket and prosthesis produced by conventional ischial containment (IC) technique. Comparisons were based on differences in a) stump-socket <b>interface</b> <b>pressures</b> during gait, b) whole body gait kinetics and kinematics c) femoral movement within the stump tissues relative to the socket during gait. These observations provided {{a snapshot of the}} biomechanical environment of the stump and socket interface and assess the feasibility of using these outcome measurements to highlight differences between the two socket designs. This study demonstrated that it is feasible to use the HC approach to produce a prosthesis that is acceptable to both user and clinician. Results showed similarities between <b>interface</b> <b>pressures,</b> kinetic and kinematic data for both socket designs. The use of ultrasound to detect femoral motion identified that the conventional design paradigm, claiming to stabilise the motion of the femur, may not actually achieve this goal. Additional research is required with larger population of people with a trans-femoral amputation to assess the long term impact of this novel approach...|$|R
