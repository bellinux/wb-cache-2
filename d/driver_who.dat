5|$|Drivers had two hours, split {{over two}} days, Friday and Saturday, to {{register}} the fastest possible time. The <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> could register the fastest time would start on pole position, giving them a headstart of eight metres over the second-fastest <b>driver,</b> <b>who</b> started {{on the opposite side}} of the track. Third place would start eight metres behind the second-fastest driver and on the side of the track where the first placed car is. This practice continues until twenty-sixth place, and the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth placed cars are not allowed to race.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the {{shooting death of}} the ambulance <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad. Abu Rahma's footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son, then begins again—from the same position, with the white minibus behind which Abu Rhama was standing visible in the shot—with other people being loaded into an ambulance.|$|E
5|$|Farid is a taxi <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> is {{initially}} abrasive toward Amir, but later befriends him.

5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the <b>driver</b> (<b>who</b> survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E

Another six points adrift, third placed Sébastien Buemi (e.dams Renault) was the only <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> scored two victories {{over the course of}} the season, but less consistent outings prevented him from placing higher up in the standings. In the teams' championship, e.dams Renault on 160 points had a 45-point lead over Audi Sport ABT.|$|E
5|$|Forty-four {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three raced because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure.

30|$|Statistically {{significant}} differences {{have been found}} about the perception between the <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> use a cell phone while driving {{and the ones who}} do not. The results indicate that the <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> do not use a cell phone are much more inclined to agree that cell phone use while driving could impair the driving safety than the <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> use. However, the former group is more likely to underestimate the effect of cell phone use on the PRT than the later group. For the hands-free and handheld issue, the <b>drivers</b> <b>who</b> use a cell phone are more inclined to agree that the hands-free device is much safer.|$|R

5|$|On 12 January 1996, {{investigators}} {{announced that}} they would perform DNA testing on the drivers of all vehicles similar to the Mercedes.

On 19 February, West Mercia Police confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping them with their inquiries. The following day, authorities announced that the suspect was English and had been arrested in Poole, Dorset in a joint operation between West Mercia and Dorset Police. He was subsequently identified as Stuart Morgan, a 36-year-old self-employed lorry <b>driver,</b> <b>who</b> on 21 February was remanded following an appearance at Redditch magistrates.|$|E

5|$|On July 11, {{a passing}} {{motorist}} spotted the fugitives by Interstate 80 and called police. The men fled when authorities {{arrived at the}} scene shortly after, but Bostic was tackled by a state trooper shortly after 6 p.m., while Ellis managed to escape. At 8 a.m. the next morning, Ellis was cornered near I-80 by two police dogs. Both men were extradited to New York from Pennsylvania on July 12. Police brought Timoshenko's handcuffs and used them to apprehend Ellis during his arrest. Police did not release {{the name of the}} <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> assisted the suspects.|$|E
5|$|Other {{inquiries}} obtained similar {{testimony from}} witnesses, including the taxi <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> now {{stated that the}} activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated {{that there was a}} short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview.|$|E
5|$|Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> saw {{part of the}} {{incident}} were the only surviving witnesses.

5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui, brought even more mainstream success {{to the band}} through repeated airplay on MTV. The video debuted in September 1993. It was shot with low quality photographic equipment, which, like several other early Pumpkins videos, was an intentional stylistic decision. Corgan said that {{the plot of the}} video was inspired by a memory he had of an ice cream truck <b>driver</b> <b>who,</b> upon quitting his job, gave out his remaining stock of ice cream to the neighborhood children. This image was then melded with Sednaoui's own sensibilities inspired by the film Zabriskie Point. The video is available on The Smashing Pumpkins – Greatest Hits Video Collection (1991–2000) DVD, released in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented four {{witnesses to}} the court. Robert Chobert, a cab <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White, a prostitute, testified that Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, testified that from two car lengths away, he saw a man, matching Abu-Jamal's description, run {{across the street from}} a parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the shooting, testified to seeing Faulkner pull over Cook's car. As Abu-Jamal started to cross the street toward them, Magilton turned away and lost sight of what happened next.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cars}} {{waited for the}} restart, work on the cars was allowed and Hamilton's front wing was changed, while Rio Haryanto ended his race. As the race resumed behind the safety car, both Ferrari drivers were running on the super-soft tyre compound, with both Mercedes now {{equipped}} with mediums, which were set to last {{for the rest of}} the race. The running order at the restart was: Vettel, Rosberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Hamilton, Massa, Grosjean, Bottas. Grosjean in ninth was the only <b>driver</b> <b>who</b> had not made a pit stop before the red flag was shown, which allowed him to save one pit stop and change his tyres during the break.|$|E
