5|$|Waste to <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> are {{strictly}} monitored, {{and the plant}} has achieved various ISO external certificates. The plant is seen {{to be at the}} forefront of sustainable energy production and waste disposal. The plant not only reduces the amount of waste sent to landfill, but displaces the burning of depleting fossil fuels, and makes significant contributions to meeting the North East region's waste recovery and recycling targets.|$|E
5|$|Paris is {{provided}} in electricity through a 'periphery' grid fed by multiple sources., around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France comes from cogeneration <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> located near the outer limits of the region; other energy sources include the Nogent nuclear power plant (35%), trash incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh). A quarter of Paris's district heating is {{to come from a}} plant in Saint-Ouen, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and 140,000 tonnes of wood pellets from USA per year.|$|E
5|$|Fluor {{has been}} working on the cleanup and {{shutdown}} of atomic <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s. In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste. By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project. After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries. In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.|$|E

25|$|The cost of {{hydroelectricity}} {{is relatively}} low, {{making it a}} competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. With a dam and reservoir {{it is also a}} flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than fossil fuel powered <b>energy</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
25|$|Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code allows {{an income}} tax credit of 2.3 cents/kilowatt-hour (as {{adjusted}} for inflation for 2013) {{for the production of}} electricity from utility-scale wind turbines, geothermal, solar, hydropower, biomass and marine and hydrokinetic renewable <b>energy</b> <b>plants.</b> This incentive, the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). In late 2015 a large majority in Congress voted to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. Analysts expect $35 billon of investment for each type.|$|E

25|$|The cost of {{hydroelectricity}} {{is relatively}} low, {{making it a}} competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. However, damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered <b>energy</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under the Presidency of Carlos Flores, decrees No. 85-98 and 267-98 were {{approved}} in 1998 by the Honduras Congress {{with the aim}} of promoting the development of renewable energy-generating plants. The new legislation includes tax breaks to developers and a secure buyer arrangement for energy at prices equivalent to the system’s short-term marginal cost. ENEE, which is the default buyer, must pay a premium (10 percent of the same short-run marginal cost) for the electricity generated when the installed capacity is below 50 MW. This framework has facilitated the negotiation of about 30 public-private partnerships with ENEE for small renewable <b>energy</b> <b>plants.</b> In addition, Decree No. 85-98 also establishes tax exemptions in favor of developers: import and sales taxes on equipment, and a five-year income tax holiday.|$|E

Dynegy had signed a sale-leaseback {{agreement}} in 2001 with Public Services Enterprise Group for the Roseton and Danskammer facilities. Fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction {{would be used to}} pay bondholders (up to $571 million), while the remaining 50 percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors. The unsecured creditors would get $200 million in cash. Unsecured creditors also would receive 99 percent of Dynegy's new stock, with the company retaining the rest (with warrants to purchase 13.5 percent of the stock after five years). Dynegy also agreed to pay holders of $206 million in subordinated capital income securities just $55 million in principal and $16 million in interest to settle their claims. The bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between Dynegy Holdings and Dynegy, Inc.|$|E

[...] North of Boyle, it curves east to pass through the hamlet of Grassland and becomes divided west of Atmore where it again turns north, this time through heavy boreal forest and muskeg, particularly beyond Wandering River. [...] Traffic levels significantly increase as Highway63 bends through Fort McMurray, crossing the Athabasca River before connecting the city to the Syncrude and Suncor <b>Energy</b> <b>plants</b> further north.
