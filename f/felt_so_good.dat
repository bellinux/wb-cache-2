5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E

Pain never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> <b>good.</b> Boy, you're my {{favourite}} scar," [...] whilst critics noted that {{it was full of}} attitude from the beginning, comparing it to songs by Barbadian singer Rihanna. The song {{is built around}} a sample of the piano riff from the Tears for Fears song [...] "Head Over Heels", which is joined by hip hop beats; Lewis Corner from Digital Spy said [...] "it's not the kind of Ryan Tedder collaboration we've come to expect from LeLe." [...] "When it Hurts" [...] is a piano-led ballad that also features some elements of electronic guitar. The album's title song [...] "Glassheart" [...] is also a production done by Tedder. Critics noted that [...] "Glassheart" [...] was a distinctive change in sound for Lewis, with its production featuring elements of dance, grime and dubstep. Critics noted that after several ballads, the up-tempo [...] "Glassheart" [...] was a [...] "welcome change of pace." ...|$|E

[...] "I get off on working with creative energy", Aguilera said. [...] "That's when I'm most at home and feel happiest. And all these people brought about new sides of me. It was a big collaboration-fest, and it <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> and rewarding in the end, because I was just so happy with the work and the new territories that I ventured out to." [...] Aguilera also remarked that her son inspired her to experiment in ways [...] "that maybe I've been afraid {{to do in the}} past, to allow myself to go to a place of 'less singing,' [...] " [...] she says.

[...] "I'd spent so long behind the scenes writing for other people and featuring on other people's records so it just <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> to get the acknowledgement for me as an artist in my own right." [...] She spoke on the relief she had once she had signed a record deal with Virgin Records in 2010 as she spoke it was a [...] "long journey to get signed" [...] as she said [...] "once you get established as a songwriter it's quite hard to get people to recognise you as an artist in your own right. It felt like a long battle to get people to see me and believe in my music. Lots of Record labels didn't want to sign me. So it was great to prove people wrong in that sense." ...|$|E

When she gave me one cold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop from the stone porch--it was a very frosty day--I <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> miserable and self-reproachful that I clung to her and told her it was my fault, I knew, that she could say good-bye so easily! ...|$|R

500|$|Simpson {{started working}} on the album in mid-July 2000. While {{compiling}} songs for Sweet Kisses, she had expressed inconvenience when a track's lyrics were too suggestive or delivered a message she {{did not agree with}} and thus asked for its modification. However, for Irresistible, she decided to let Tommy Mottola, the CEO of Columbia, take control of the whole project. He enlisted many established composers and producers for the album, hand-picked each song for the track list, and rejected those he <b>felt</b> were not <b>so</b> <b>good.</b> Although she had previously announced that she would write a few songs for her second album, Simpson does not share songwriting credits on any of the tracks. On being asked why, she said that she was very shy when it came to songwriting and felt that it requires a lot of [...] "bravery" [...] to write songs. She also expressed that she could not find the right words for the songs and hence did not write for the record. According to Simpson, the album did not have a definite concept or theme; Mottola selected songs which they felt were good enough for Simpson and compiled them into an album.|$|R

60|$|Joanna was not {{altogether}} {{satisfied with the}} sailor. She liked his attentions, and she coveted the dignity of matrimony; {{but she had never}} been deeply in love with Jolliffe. For one thing, she was ambitious, and socially his position was hardly <b>so</b> <b>good</b> as her own, and there was always the chance of an attractive woman mating considerably above her. It had long been in her mind that she would not strongly object to give him back again to Emily if her friend <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> very badly about him. To this end she had written a letter of renunciation to Shadrach, which letter she carried in her hand, intending to send it if personal observation of Emily convinced her that her friend was suffering.|$|R
5000|$|The lyrics on {{this album}} are poetic and further {{showcase}} Dax Riggs's dark sense of humor. [...] "Paegan Love Song", according to Dax, makes references to when the band was visiting a beach in Florida, where some people offered the band a deliriant called Angel's Trumpets. Dax said the trip lasted for days, and the lines [...] "dying <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> goddamn <b>good</b> today" [...] refer to the band members waking up delirious on these flowers. [...] "Eating dead flowers bleeding in a strange daze" [...] among other lines in the song reference the experience of waking {{up on the beach}} with this seemingly strange intoxicated state. On the Double Live Bootleg! DVD (2002) the band introduces the song by saying, [...] "Rock 'N' Roll makes the world go 'round, drinking fucking beer and smoking pot! This is Paegan Love Song." [...] "Graveflower" [...] has a guitar solo that heavily employs a drone. [...] "13 Fingers" [...] and [...] "New Corpse" [...] experiment with black metal musicianship. Sammy Duet co-wrote the lyrics for [...] "Diäb Soulé" [...] and [...] "New Corpse". [...] "Diäb Soulé" [...] is Cajun French for the [...] "drunken devil." [...] The liner notes present Sammy Duet as Sammy [...] "Pierre" [...] Duet, which is a nickname Dax gave him because a historical witch was named Sammy Pierre Duet. The poem/hidden track [...] "Ode of the Paegan" [...] is sometimes cited or referred to as [...] "The Beautiful Downgrade" [...] and appear as such in Dax's poetry books. The hidden track along with the track [...] "Old Skin" [...] make up the two spoken word poems on the album. While in Mexico, the band took a reverse negative photo of the head of a decapitated animal and originally intended on using that as the album cover. They later decided on Kevorkian's artwork. The initial artwork can be found on various sites on the internet.|$|R

Mr. Coyote kept after him, yelping and howling, until he was sure that Mr. Lynx was so frightened that he wouldn't dare come back. Then Mr. Coyote returned to the dinner Mr. Lynx had left, and ate and ate until he couldn't hold another mouthful.

The rain <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> and cool that they stood still and took it without playing any more, and talked quietly.

60|$|I <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> <b>good,</b> that somehow, somewhere, in me arose an insatiable greed to feel better. I was {{so happy}} that I wanted to pitch my {{happiness}} even higher. And I knew the way. Ten thousand contacts with John Barleycorn had taught me. Several times I wandered {{out of the kitchen}} to the cocktail bottle, and each time I left it diminished by one man's size cocktail. The result was splendid. I wasn't jingled, I wasn't lighted up; but I was warmed, I glowed, my happiness was pyramided. Munificent as life was to me, I added to that munificence. It was a great hour--one of my greatest. But I paid for it, long afterwards, as you will see. One does not forget such experiences, and, in human stupidity, cannot be brought to realise that there is no immutable law which decrees that same things shall produce same results. For they don't, else would the thousandth pipe of opium be provocative of similar delights to the first, else would one cocktail, instead of several, produce an equivalent glow after a year of cocktails.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{found myself}} {{perched on a}} cloud, with a million other people, I never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> in my life. Says I, [...] "Now this is {{according}} to the promises; I've been having my doubts, but now I am in heaven, sure enough." [...] I gave my palm branch a wave or two, for luck, and then I tautened up my harp-strings and struck in. Well, Peters, you can't imagine anything like the row we made. It was grand to listen to, and made a body thrill all over, but there was considerable many tunes going on at once, {{and that was a}} drawback to the harmony, you understand; {{and then there was a}} lot of Injun tribes, and they kept up such another war-whooping that they kind of took the tuck out of the music. By and by I quit performing, and judged I'd take a rest. There was quite a nice mild old gentleman sitting next me, and I noticed he didn't take a hand; I encouraged him, but he said he was naturally bashful, and was afraid to try before so many people. By and by the old gentleman said he never could seem to enjoy music somehow. The fact was, I was beginning to feel the same way; but I didn't say anything. Him and I had a considerable long silence, then, but of course it warn't noticeable in that place. After about sixteen or seventeen hours, during which I played and sung a little, now and then-- always the same tune, because I didn't know any other--I laid down my harp and begun to fan myself with my palm branch. Then we both got to sighing pretty regular. Finally, says he-- ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had five}} miles of fairly level road through open forest along the rim, {{and then we}} struck such a rocky jumble of {{downhill}} grade that the bundles fell off the wagon. They had to be tied on. When {{we came to a}} long slow slant uphill, a road of loose rocks, we made about one mile an hour. This slow travel worked havoc upon my mind. I wanted to hurry. I {{wanted to get out of}} the wilds. That awful rumor about influenza occupied my mind and struck cold fear into my heart. What of my family? No making the best of this! Slowly we toiled on. Sunset overtook us at a rocky ledge which had to be surmounted. With lassos on saddle horses in front of the two teams, all pulling hard, we overcame that obstacle. But at the next little hill, which we encountered about twilight, one of the team horses balked. Urging him, whipping him, served no purpose; and it had bad effect upon the other horses. Darkness was upon us with the camp-site Edd knew of still miles to the fore. No grass, no water for the horses! But we had to camp there. All hands set to work. It really was fun--it should have been fine for me--but my gloomy obsession to hurry obscured my mind. I marveled at old Doyle, over seventy, after that long, hard day, quickly and efficiently cooking a good hot supper. Romer had enjoyed the day. He said he was tired, but would like to stay up beside the mighty camp-fire Nielsen built. I had neither energy or spirit to oppose him. The night was dark and cold and windy; the fire <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that I almost went asleep beside it. We had no time to put up tents. I made our bed, crawled into it, stretched out with infinite relief; and the last thing I was aware of was Romer snuggling in beside me.|$|E
