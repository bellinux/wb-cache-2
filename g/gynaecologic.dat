50|$|IORT {{was found}} to be useful and {{feasible}} in the multidisciplinary management of many solid tumors but further studies are needed to determine the benefit more precisely. Single-institution experiences have suggested a role of IORT e.g. in brain tumors and cerebral metastases, locally advanced and recurrent rectal cancer, skin cancer, retroperitoneal sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and selected <b>gynaecologic</b> and genitourinary malignancies. For local recurrences, irradiation with IORT is besides brachytherapy the only radiotherapeutic option if repeated EBRT is no longer possible. Generally, the normal tissue tolerance does not allow a second full-dose course of EBRT, even after years.|$|E

50|$|Circa 1960 Edwards {{started to}} study human fertilisation, and he {{continued}} his work at Cambridge, {{laying the groundwork for}} his later success. In 1968 he was able to achieve fertilisation of a human egg in the laboratory and started to collaborate with Patrick Steptoe, a <b>gynaecologic</b> surgeon from Oldham. Edwards developed human culture media to allow the fertilisation and early embryo culture, while Steptoe used laparoscopy to recover ovocytes from patients with tubal infertility. Their attempts met significant hostility and opposition, including a refusal of the Medical Research Council to fund their research and a number of lawsuits. Additional historical information on this controversial era in the development of IVF has been published. Roger Gosden was one of his first graduate students.|$|E
50|$|Lake Amara (Lacul Amara) is a {{saltwater}} fluvial liman lake {{located on}} the Slobozia - Buzău road near Amara in Ialomița County, Romania.The lake has a surface area of 132 ha, a water volume of , a length of 4 km and a width between 200 m and 800 m while the maximum depth reaches 3 m. The lake is situated in a depression having no links to the Ialomița River. Because {{of the lack of}} a year-round constant fresh water supply and because of the evaporation process triggered by the dry climate, the concentration of salts in the lake is quite high. The hypertonic water is rich in sulphate salts, bicarbonate, chlorides, iodides, bromides and magnesium salts which {{led to the formation of}} a therapeutic mud used to treat different illnesses. The general mineral concentration of the water is around 9.8g/l. The sapropelic mud contains around 40% organic and 41% mineral substances. The mud is recommended to people with affections of the locomotory system, with <b>gynaecologic</b> affections (especially sterility) and dermatosis patients of all kinds. The mud is not recommended to people with cardiovascular diseases, Graves' disease, asthma or infectious diseases.|$|E
