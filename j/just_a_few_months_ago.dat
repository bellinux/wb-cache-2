After listening to your policy pronouncements during the campaign, many Americans decided, generously, that you weren't ready yet for high political office. Others thought you just weren't very smart. But this statement last week really does clear up the question for me. You are speaking like a demagogue in the worst tradition of those who knowingly distort and deceive, for their own political purposes. You want to stoke people's worst fears and then, hopefully, they will look to someone like you to be their leader. You're not stupid after all. You know that neither President Obama, nor anyone else in this health-care debate, would deny health care for your parents or child, and that none of the ideas being debated would suggest that. But people are confused and concerned, so you see your chance to prey upon their misunderstandings. Politics for people like you is really all about you, your fame and power, and your taste of it during the last election has revealed what kind of politician you truly are. Please don't invoke your 'Christian faith' anymore and embarrass the people of God even further. May your efforts to scare Americans during this important debate fail. May your political future also fail, and may your star fall as fast as it rose <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> -- because we now know who you really are." ...|$|E

Mehrotra's remains had been found a few months earlier less than two miles away from Harting. In March 2015, it was reported that the Independent Police Complaints Commission would investigate allegations of negligence and corruption in relation to Mehrotra's murder. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg subsequently said that allegations that the police helped [...] "cover up" [...] the death of Vishal Mehrotra {{at the hands of a}} paedophile ring were [...] "grotesque" [...] and called for an investigation to be launched into the claims, saying that [...] "We are in the early stages of a reckoning with our past of things happening on a scale and of a gravity which <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> would have seemed unimaginable and almost too horrific to contemplate.

40|$|Abstract. CP {{violation}} in {{the neutral}} kaon system {{is known to}} be dominated by the mixing of K 0 and K 0. Direct CP violation in the 2 pion decays of neutral kaons has been a controversial subject over the last decade. A strong experimental effort has been devoted to the precise measurement of the direct CP violation parameter ℜe (ε ′ /ε). After 10 years of detector development, data collection and analysis, the NA 48 experiment at CERN and the KTeV experiment at Fermilab have now established direct CP violation as a fact. Both KTeV and NA 48 use the same experimental principle, measuring the double ratio of long lived and short lived neutral kaons to two charged and two neutral pions. However, their experimental and analysis techniques differ in important ways, and I will extensively discuss the two approaches. I will also present the latest results on ℜe(ε ′ /ε) from both experiments, which were announced <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|We study {{learning}} with a three-year panel dataset representing four million monthly credit card statements. We focus on fees, since some observers claim that fees {{are not fully}} understood when consumers first open an account. In our data, new accounts generate effective monthly fee payments of $ 16 per month. Fee payments are negatively correlated at both low and high frequencies. Through negative feedback — i. e. payingafee—consumerslearntoavoidtriggering fees in the future. These learning dynamics imply that monthly fee payments fall by 75 % during {{the first four years}} of account life (controlling for account fixed effects). However, we find that consumers ’ hard-earned knowledge does not persist. We estimate that knowledge depreciates approximately 15 % per month. Fee payments generate maximal learning when the fee payment was made last month. As negative feedback recedes into the distant past, consumers fail to notice it and their behavior tends to backslide. Like rational agents, consumers learn, but like myopic agents, consumers respond to recent events more than events that occurred <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on a}} single Russian proverb от сумы да тюрьмы не зарекайся (its {{equivalent}} in English: no fence against a flail). Its literal meaning is ‘No one is insured from prison and impoverishment’. This proverb is {{deeply rooted in the}} Russian history, and it belongs to the paremiological minimum of Russian language. The use of this proverb has rapidly increased recently. One can easily understand the reason for this fact since one of the richest men in the world, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was sentenced to a number of years in prison and was released <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago.</b> It is not surprising that approximately half of Russian entrepreneurs have come into collision with justice. The analysis of the history and modern use of the proverb has been done with the help of Russian National Corpus, examples come from 19 th- and 20 th-century texts. Our analysis has shown that this proverb still preserves a very tight relationship with the history of language and society. The dynamics of the development of its new meaning is very fast. It turns out that in case of synchronic paremiology both the base of linguistic data as well as the theoretical and methodological base of research are changing. Old meanings (paremiological minimum/optimum, norm) and methods of psycholinguistic experiments demand constant correction. ...|$|E
40|$|On {{the bright}} side, the euro area economy seems finally {{to be on}} the path of a {{recovery}} at the time of writing in early 2015; and, after much hesitation, the European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a programme of sovereign bonds purchases to undertake quantitative easing (QE) which has been less divisive than what could have been expected <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago.</b> Although the programme is designed so as to decentralize the bulk of credit risk at the level of national central banks, markets have reacted positively to the announcement and, with the exception of Greece, we have seen further compression of spreads. On the dark side, however, the problem of debt overhang is likely to weigh on the euro area economies for the years to come since a low growth, low inflation environment is likely to persist even under the brightest scenario. In this context, and without a realistic prospect of further fiscal integration amongst the members of the European Union (EU), there is a risk that the European Central Bank will be overburdened by excessive responsibilities. To avoid this path, a new grand bargain between monetary policy authorities, governments and euro area institutions has to be achieved. To understand the dilemma that the ECB is likely to face if such a bargain is not achieved, it is useful to look back and analyse monetary policy in the euro area since the 2008 crisi...|$|E
