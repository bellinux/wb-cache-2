5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 issue of Playboy, modeling in pajamas raised so that the bottoms of <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> showed. This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> with her hands. Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|E

5|$|The anachronistic wetsuits on the Edwardian ship were {{actually}} heavy-duty overalls {{that had been}} painted black. Janet Fielding struggled with the low cut ball-gown she wore during filming as it threatened to expose <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> {{on a number of}} occasions. The ball gown worn by Baron was made especially for the serial and was the most expensive costume on display. The newspaper found by the Doctor in Part One was a reprint of The Times from September 1901, while the food and drink served during the party scenes was all real.|$|E

5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time, but {{not seen in}} other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of {{her hair in a}} bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto <b>her</b> <b>breasts.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bahuchara Mata is {{a patron}} goddess of the Hirja. In popular {{iconography}} she is often shown riding a rooster {{and carrying a}} sword, trident and a book.

5|$|The video's {{first scene}} {{is set in}} a desert at night. Rihanna, wearing a {{garrison}} cap, sunglasses, and a stylized white top, stands in front of an army.

5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist.

Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below <b>her</b> <b>breasts.</b> The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
