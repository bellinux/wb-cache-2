5000|$|A knitted <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch</b> {{creates a}} firm fabric [...] "similar to a woven in {{appearance}} and elasticity". A heavyweight fabric {{can be made}} with variations of the <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch,</b> such as the herringbone twist stitch, which can be worked in either one or two colours; both versions are suitable for experienced knitters.|$|E
50|$|Another {{widely used}} technique, <b>Herringbone</b> <b>stitch,</b> {{was used in}} Afghanistan to {{embroider}} bridegroom's smocks with raised bands of red, green or white stitchery on a white background.|$|E
5000|$|Ahir is type done by peasants of Ahir {{community}} with designs {{of animals and}} birds done with chain stitch with hooked needles, <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch</b> and fixed with small mirrors known as 'abhla', practiced by women during the lean season ...|$|E
50|$|A {{versatile}} {{and easy to}} work stitch, backstitch is ideal for following both smooth and complicated outlines and as a foundation row for more complex embroidery <b>stitches</b> such as <b>herringbone</b> ladder filling <b>stitch.</b> Although superficially similar to Holbein stitch, commonly used in blackwork embroidery, backstitch differs {{in the way it}} is worked, requiring a single journey only to complete a line of stitching.|$|R
50|$|Blanket stitch, {{buttonhole}} stitch, and eyelet stitch all had {{the original}} function of strengthening the edges of textiles subject to daily wear and tear, but were adapted for decorative purposes. In North Africa and the Middle East, eyelet stitch is made using a spoked wheel pattern of stitches, or in the Algerian form without an enclosing circle. In Turkmenistan, hook and tulip motifs could be worked in buttonhole stitch. In Afghanistan, men's shirts could be embroidered with <b>herringbone</b> and buttonhole <b>stitches</b> in white silk on white cotton, in elaborate arabesques.|$|R
50|$|A <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch</b> is a {{needlework}} stitch used in embroidery, knitting and crochet. It is {{so named}} as it resembles the bones {{extending from the}} spine of a herring fish. In knitting, it is a stitch that creates a fabric pattern closely resembling a herringbone pattern, or herringbone cloth.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch</b> {{is used as}} one of the {{symbolic}} motifs in the traditional knitted Aran jumper, or [...] "fisherman's sweater"; specifically, the tradition as it exists in the Channel Islands of Guernsey, Jersey and Filey. The herringbone pattern represents the [...] "fisherman's catch and thus for success in one's career".|$|E
50|$|Kashmiri {{embroidery}} {{is known}} for the skilled execution of a single stitch, which is often called the Kashmiri stitch and which may comprise the chain stitch, the satin stitch, the slanted darn stitch, the stem stitch, and the <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch.</b> Sometimes, the doori (knot) stitches are used {{but not more than}} one or two at a time.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} of Kutch work, this geometric embroidery {{starts with a}} foundation framework of <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch</b> or Cretan stitch, and then this framework is completely filled with interlacing. It is said that this technique originated in far away land of Armenia and {{found its way to}} Gujarat by travelling Nomads. Sindhi stitch or Maltese cross stitch is also similar but the innovation of the Kutchi women have taken it beyond the traditional designs...Kutch work ...|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{and most}} basic stitch found in kanthas is the running stitch. The predominant {{form of this}} stitch is called the phor or kantha stitch. The other forms of stitches used are the Chatai or pattern darning, Kaitya or bending stitch, weave running stitch, darning stitch, Jessore stitch (a variation of darning stitch), threaded running stitch, Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia (Holbein) stitches. The stitches used in modern-day kantha are the Kasmiri stitch and the arrowhead stitch. Stitches like the <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch,</b> satin stitch, backstitch and cross-stitch are occasionally used.|$|E
40|$|This paper gives a {{generalization}} of the Cartan decomposition for the non-symmetric space SL(2 n+ 1, C) /Sp(n, C). Our method uses the <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch</b> introduced by T. Kobayashi [6], {{and as a}} corollary, we prove that SU(2 n+ 1) acts on the spherical variety SL(2 n+ 1, C) /Sp(n, C) in a strongly visible fashion with slice of real dimension 2 n...|$|E
40|$|Sunbonnet of tan {{and blue}} braided straw. The hat has a wired brim and a grayish-white silk lining. It is trimmed in tan silk ribbon, and the bavolet, or back panel which shades the neck, is {{composed}} of brown, brick red, tan and blue striped cotton fabric. The ties are of brown silk taffeta and are attached to lower edge of brim with a <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch.</b> The TFC thanks Rebecca Jumper Matheson for her research on this object...|$|E
40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{developments}} on visible actions on complex manifolds, we raise a question {{whether or not}} the multiplication of three subgroups L, G ′ and H surjects a Lie group G in the setting that G/H carries a complex structure and contains G ′/G ′ ∩ H as a totally real submanifold. Particularly important cases are when G/L and G/H are generalized flag varieties, and we classify pairs of Levi subgroups (L, H) such that LG ′ H = G, or equivalently, the real generalized flag variety G ′/H ∩ G ′ meets every L-orbit on the complex generalized flag variety G/H in the setting that (G, G ′) = (U(n), O(n)). For such pairs (L, H), we introduce a <b>herringbone</b> <b>stitch</b> method to find a generalized Cartan decomposition for the double coset space L/H, for which there has been no general theory in the non-symmetric case. Our geometric results provides a unified proof of various multiplicity-free theorems in representation theory of general linear groups...|$|E
