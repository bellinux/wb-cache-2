5|$|The upper molars {{have two}} {{longitudinal}} rows of cusps, not three {{as in the}} black and brown rats. The first and second upper molars are oval in form and the <b>flexi</b> do not extend to the midline of the molars. The anterocone, the front cusp of the upper first molar, is not divided in two by an indentation at its front (anteromedian flexus), but does display a hollow in the middle, the anteromedian fossette, which divides it into separate cuspules at the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molar. A crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the labial cuspule, but in older animals, the cusps and the crest are united into a single structure by wear. In the third upper molar, the cusps at the back are reduced and scarcely distinguishable. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar usually has another small labial root.|$|E

Methods: In my thesis I have observed maximal muscular power while clutching a hand on a dominant upper limb. Ten probands (women) have taken part in my experiment, their age span was 24 - 29 years. For measuring of muscular power a manual dynamometer Grip D T. K. K. 5401 has been used. The muscular power has been measured under three conditions - without an aid and with an aid - with the epicondilar brace (Snížek Ortoprotetika) and with a stable tape (Strappal).

In 1973 The Flowers released <b>flexis</b> with producing company Melodiya; overall seven million copies were sold. After becoming a major hit in the USSR, in 1974 the band went on its first professional tour; but in 1975 the band dissolved as a result of a conflict with the Philharmonic Society, and it was liquidated by a decree of the Ministry of Culture of the USSR, its name was banned. It was only in 1977 that the band was resurrected under the new name The Stas Namin Group, in 1978 it went on tour still being banned by all central mass media outlets. In 1980, during the years of the Olympic Thaw, the band managed to release a solo album with Melodiya - Hymn to the Sun - and participate in a TV show, after that they were banned once again. The period of bans and persecution that lasted to 1986 ended with Perestroika when the life of the band got much easier: with their returned name The Flowers went on tour, performed abroad in the Western countries and completed a world tour in four years. In 1990 the band ceased its activities and, as a matter of fact, did not exist for the next almost ten years.|$|R
40|$|Plant root {{growth is}} one of the most {{important}} factor in determining the plant health and increased crop production. Factors like root length, root hairs and number of secondary roots are crucial for the intake and availability of unreachable nutrients in soil. Plant roots are inhabited by large number of microbes called root microbiome. Utilizing beneficial root microorganism to promote plant growth can have lasting effect on plants ability to resist unfavorable environmental stresses and achieve optimized growth. In this study known plant growth promoting rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria as well as newly isolated bacteria from tomato specie Solanum pimpinellifolium are tested on Arabidopsis thaliana, Gemini tomato plant and mutant pin 2, wei 8 /wei 2, tir 1 and aux 1 - 7 which are mutants defective in polar auxin transport and auxin signaling. The plant seedlings were grown on agar solidified 1 / 50 X Gamborg’s B 5 nutrient medium and also on 1 X Murashige and Skoog nutrient medium. The bacterial culture was inoculated to vertical agar plates under two different conditions: sucrose supplemented nutrient medium and without sucrose medium. Roots of hydroponically growing Solanum pimpinellifolium tomato plants were utilized to isolate the root endophytes. 16 S gene sequencing analysis revealed the identity of bacterial species. Three bacterial isolates recovered from the S. pimpinellifolium roots are Micrococcus yunnanensis, Cohnella spp. and Bacillus <b>flexis.</b> Newly isolated bacterial strains Micrococcus yunnanensis and Cohnella spp. were inoculated to the Gemini tomato plants in a pot experiment to check if they have any beneficial growth promoting traits. During the course of this project we were able to find that bacterial strain 9 and 15 (Pseudomonas spp. & Agrobacterium spp.) received from Gennao Roberto Abbamondi, Hasselt University, Belgium are able to stimulate root hair development in Col- 0 and also in mutants pin 2, wei 8 /wei 2, tir 1 and aux 1 - 7. Among newly isolated strains M. yunnanensis is able to stimulate the primary root length to some extent, number of lateral roots and shoot weight in WT Col- 0 in plants growing in 1 X MS medium supplemented with sucrose. M. yunnanensis is also shown to have some effect on shoot length and shoot weight of Gemini tomato plants.

5000|$|After Gerold's {{death in}} 799 in {{battle with the}} Avars, his name lived on. Bavaria, newly brought into the Frankish Kingdom under Charlemagne, would {{continue}} {{to serve as the}} eastern bulwark of the Franks. It would also see an increased importance within the Frankish Kingdom, being given over to Louis the Pious as his part of the kingdom, after Charlemagne divided it among his heirs. Gerold, while in power, was able to wield traditional Bavarian Law as well as new Frankish customs, allowing the land he presided over to change from an unruly and rebellious duchy into an integrated and functioning cog in the machine of the Frankish kingdom. Gerold was also seen by medieval authors as a champion of the faith, being likened to a Christian martyr, fighting for the peace of the church, in Walafrid Strabo's Visio Wettini, where it says [...] "Since he had such zeal for the Lord, he attacked the heathens to defend the Christian people, and suffered the loss of his life; as such he deserved to gleam with eternal trophies, seizing hold of the great gifts of everlasting life". This {{can be seen as a}} start of the tradition of fighting to extend the bounds of Christendom by fighting heathen groups such as the Avars; conquering new lands to spread the Christian religion. Gerold also gave much of his own lands to the Church. This was a considerable portion, given that Gerold was descended from some of the richest Allemanian aristocrats at the time. This is again referenced in the Visio Wettini, whereby Gerold is said to have stated that: [...] "The Lord denies me an heir, but He will remain as my survivor. What he gave me, he will receive back; I commend it to blessed Mary." [...] This may be reference to an altar he dedicated to St. Mary at Reichenau, upon which is written: [...] "Hanc quique devote convenitis ad aulam, Poplitibusque <b>flexis</b> propiatis ad aram, Cernite conspicuum sacris aedibus altar, Geroltus quod condidit lamina ninenti, Virgineo qoud condecent alvo pudoris, Subque voto Mariae intulit in aulam. Hic agni cruor caroque propinatur ex ara, Cuius tactu huius sacrantur lamina axis. Huc quicumque cum prece penetrates ad aram, Dicite, rogo: 'Alme miserer Gerolto', Titulo qui tali ornovit virginis templum, Aetherio fruatur sede felix in aevum!" [...] This translates to: 'You, who have come devotedly to this hall, approach the altar on bent knees, and look at this wondrous altar in this sacred place, altar which Gerold built, with gleaming giltwork that becomes the virginal womb of chastity. As an offering to Mary he brought it into the hall. Here the blood and flesh of the lamb Christ is set out, By whose touch the giltwork of the table? is sanctified. Whoever ventures with a prayer to this altar, Say, I beg, [...] "Kindly God, take pity on Gerold, Who decorated the temple of the Virgin with such a glorious thing, And may he happily enjoy a heavenly seat forever!'" ...|$|R

2500|$|There {{is also a}} {{computerised}} racing game {{is known}} as Trackside, where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours. Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless {{of how many people}} are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses, but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext, but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow <b>Flexi</b> Trifecta and <b>Flexi</b> First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 bet, they will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, <b>Flexi</b> bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing <b>Flexi</b> Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also [...] "mystery" [...] bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet.

Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but I do remember we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it.

2500|$|The {{popularity}} of Euro disco and Italo disco—referred to as progressive in Detroit—and new romantic synthpop in the Detroit high school party scene from which techno emerged has prompted {{a number of}} commentators to try to redefine the origins of techno by incorporating musical precursors to the Detroit sound {{as part of a}} wider historical survey of the genre's development. The search for a mythical [...] "first techno record" [...] leads such commentators to consider music from long before the 1988 naming of the genre.
