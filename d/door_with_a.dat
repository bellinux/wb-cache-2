5|$|Before {{pre-production}} began, songwriters Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber {{were commissioned}} {{to integrate the}} film's soundtrack. In April, Leiber and Stoller were called for a meeting in New York City to show {{the progress of the}} repertoire. The writers, who had not produced any material, toured the city and were confronted in a hotel room by Jean Aberbach, who locked them into their hotel room by blocking the hotel room <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sofa until they wrote the material. Presley recorded the soundtrack at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, with an additional session at the MGM Soundstage on May 9. During post-production, the songs were dubbed into the films scenes, in which Presley mimed the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Arha's {{routine is}} {{disrupted}} by her {{discovery of a}} man (Ged, the protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by slamming the door on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt to open the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spell. Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating {{what to do with}} him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.|$|E

5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall.

Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E

On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E

25|$|The arches used in Portuguese Romanesque {{buildings}} {{follow the}} basic European model and are nearly always semicircular, for openings such as doors and windows, for vaults and for arcades. Wide doorways are usually surmounted by a semi-circular arch, except where a <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lintel is set {{into a large}} arched recess and surmounted by a semi-circular lunette with decorative carving. These doors sometimes have a carved central jamb.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the earlier}} rear {{entrance}} buses had narrow doors, which slowed down boarding/alighting. As a result, these were widened during overhaul. By early 1922, two Edinburgh type buses were in service with a centre door layout, i.e. between the axles. Featuring a wide <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> central hand rail, and signage directing passengers to board {{on the right of}} it and alight on the left, early indications were that this not only speeded up boarding/alighting, it increased the space available for standees.|$|E

The Volunteers answered the call on their first play, a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tony Brown, but the Volunteers also failed the two, sending the game into a fifth extra period.|$|E

25|$|In {{the small}} town of Aiguaviva, with less than 800 inhabitants, the National Police used tear gas and batons against the voters.

25|$|At {{the age of}} 27, Macleod {{was already}} {{considered}} somewhat {{too old to be}} a platoon commander. Once fit for duty again, he served as a staff captain with the 46th Division in Wye, under the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG), Captain Dawtry. In 1941 a drunk Macleod almost killed Dawtry, as the latter had retired to bed rather than play stud poker with him. He shot at his door until his revolver ran out of bullets, and then passed out after smashing down the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy piece of furniture. He demanded an apology the next morning for his refusal to play, although the two men remained friends thereafter. Dawtry later became Chief Clerk of Westminster Council.|$|E
