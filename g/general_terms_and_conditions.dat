40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{and complexity of}} construction projects often result in conflicts and unavoidable claims. Commonly, claims are submitted by the contractor for additional payment or time extensions triggered by the additional works beyond <b>general</b> <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> contract <b>conditions.</b> Unsuitable claims may lead to disputes {{so there is a}} need for claims management to avoid potential disputes. Claims can not be avoided in any construction project, but a properly executed management approach is expected to reduce the impact of claim that leads to disputes. Evaluation to problems in the six stages of claims management was conducted through questionnaires distribution to project owner and analyzing using significance index approach. The problems that often arise in each phase are elaborated in a form of Likert question. The results of field data collection are processed to obtain the most significant problems arisen in each claim management phase. The results indicate that from the six phases of claims management, the problems that often arise are related to four aspects, namely the availability of standard in claims management, the availability of competent human resources handling claims, the limitation of communication ability, and the limited ability to document the implementation of the project.  Keywords:claims management, owner, contruction project, significance inde...|$|R

We treat both cases simultaneously by investigating a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations coupled by <b>general</b> reaction <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> boundary <b>conditions.</b> We derive a weak formulation of the generalized equations and prove two theorems about its unique solvability provided that the reaction terms consist of Lipschitz continuous and monotone operators. In the proofs, we adapt different techniques (Galerkin approximation, Banach's Fixed Point Theorem) to the multi-dimensional model equation. By applying the general theorems to the problems associated with the phosphorus model we obtain results about existence and uniqueness of their solutions.

However, the courts have denied that bank customers have property rights. The same position has generally spread in banking practice globally, and Parliament has not yet taken the opportunity to ensure banks offer accounts where customer money is protected as property. Because insolvent banks do not, governments have found it necessary to publicly guarantee depositors' savings. This follows the model, started in the Great Depression, the US set up the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to prevent bank runs. In 2017, the UK guaranteed deposits up to £85,000, mirroring an EU wide minimum guarantee of €100,000. Moreover, because of the knock-on consequences of any bank failure, because bank debts are locked into a network of international finance, government has found it practically necessary to prevent banks going insolvent. Under the Banking Act 2009 if a bank is going into insolvency, the government may (and usually will if [...] "the stability of the financial systems" [...] is at stake) pursue one of three [...] "stabilisation options". The Bank of England will either try to ensure the failed bank is sold onto another private sector purchaser, set up a subsidiary company to run the failing bank's assets (a [...] "bridge-bank"), or for the UK Treasury to directly take shares in [...] "temporary public ownership". This will wipe out the shareholders, but will keep creditors' claims in tact. One method to prevent bank insolvencies, following the [...] "Basel III" [...] programme of the international banker group, has been to require banks hold more money in reserve based on how risky their lending is. EU wide rules in the Capital Requirements Regulation 2013 achieve this in some detail, for instance requiring proportionally less in reserves if sound government debt is held, but more if mortgage-backed securities are held.|$|E

40|$|The <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> {{of trade}} in the Norwegian grocery market are claimed to differ {{substantially}} between the market participants at retail level. Also, the cost of goods sold constitutes the most {{significant part of the}} total costs of the firms. Consequently, the <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade that a market participant is able to obtain are considered to have significant impact on its competitiveness. Building on the statements of Ica that their <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> are substantially worse than those of its competitors and that without improvements they would have to withdraw from the market, this paper aims at understanding how <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade influence competitiveness at retail level in the Norwegian grocery market. Coop’s recent acquisition of Ica increases the relevance of the research. The research question is answered using a theoretical basis of vertical restraints and buyer power applied on a case study of the Norwegian grocery market with regards to <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade used in the market. The main findings of the paper are that differences in <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade to a certain extent make it difficult for market participants to compete. However, the paper concludes that there are also other factors that affect competitiveness. The conclusions are drawn based on a margin analysis conducted for all four market participants. The analysis shows that Ica has worsened its <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade over the investigated time period, which have made it harder for them to compete.
