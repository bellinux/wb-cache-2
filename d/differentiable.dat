5|$|In particular, δ is an {{infinitely}} <b>differentiable</b> distribution.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a <b>differentiable</b> function from C to C is certainly <b>differentiable</b> as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|The cotangent {{bundle of}} a <b>differentiable</b> {{manifold}} consists, at every {{point of the}} manifold, of the dual of the tangent space, the cotangent space. Sections of that bundle are known as differential one-forms.|$|E
5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are <b>differentiable</b> almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E
5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve <b>differentiable</b> functions.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{topology}} is {{the field}} dealing with <b>differentiable</b> functions on <b>differentiable</b> manifolds. It {{is closely related}} to differential geometry and together they make up the geometric theory of <b>differentiable</b> manifolds.|$|E
25|$|In the {{category}} of <b>differentiable</b> manifolds, fiber bundles arise naturally as submersions of one manifold to another. Not every (<b>differentiable)</b> submersion ƒ:M→N from a <b>differentiable</b> manifold M to another <b>differentiable</b> manifold N {{gives rise to a}} <b>differentiable</b> fiber bundle. For one thing, the map must be surjective, and (M,N,ƒ) is called a fibered manifold. However, this necessary condition is not quite sufficient, and {{there are a variety of}} sufficient conditions in common use.|$|E
25|$|For most {{applications}} {{a special}} kind of topological manifold, namely a <b>differentiable</b> manifold, is used. If the local charts on a manifold are compatible in a certain sense, one can define directions, tangent spaces, and <b>differentiable</b> functions on that manifold. In particular it is possible to use calculus on a <b>differentiable</b> manifold. Each point of an n-dimensional <b>differentiable</b> manifold has a tangent space. This is an n-dimensional Euclidean space consisting of the tangent vectors of the curves through the point.|$|E
25|$|Viewed using calculus, {{the circle}} {{transition}} function T {{is simply a}} function between open intervals, which gives a meaning to the statement that T is <b>differentiable.</b> The transition map T, and all the others, are <b>differentiable</b> on (0, 1); therefore, with this atlas the circle is a <b>differentiable</b> manifold. It is also smooth and analytic because the transition functions have these properties as well.|$|E
25|$|Any {{covering}} {{space of}} a <b>differentiable</b> manifold may be equipped with a (natural) <b>differentiable</b> structure that turns p (the covering map in question) into a local diffeomorphism – a map with constant rank n.|$|E
25|$|Tangent and cotangent bundles: The map which sends every <b>differentiable</b> {{manifold}} to its tangent bundle {{and every}} smooth map to its derivative is a covariant functor from {{the category of}} <b>differentiable</b> manifolds to the category of vector bundles.|$|E
25|$|A Riemannian {{manifold}} is a <b>differentiable</b> manifold {{on which}} the tangent spaces are equipped with inner products in a <b>differentiable</b> fashion. The inner product structure is given {{in the form of}} a symmetric 2-tensor called the Riemannian metric. This metric can be used to interconvert vectors and covectors, and to define a rank 4 Riemann curvature tensor. On a Riemannian manifold one has notions of length, volume, and angle. Any <b>differentiable</b> manifold can be given a Riemannian structure.|$|E
25|$|A similar, {{but more}} technical, {{approach}} to defining <b>differentiable</b> manifolds can be formulated using {{the notion of}} a ringed space. This approach is strongly influenced by the theory of schemes in algebraic geometry, but uses local rings of the germs of <b>differentiable</b> functions. It is especially popular in the context of complex manifolds.|$|E
25|$|Its {{density is}} {{infinitely}} <b>differentiable,</b> indeed supersmooth of order 2.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} {{classes of}} <b>differentiable</b> manifolds are smooth and analytic manifolds. For smooth manifolds the transition maps are smooth, that is infinitely <b>differentiable.</b> Analytic manifolds are smooth manifolds {{with the additional}} condition that the transition maps are analytic (they can be expressed as power series). The sphere can be given analytic structure, as can most familiar curves and surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} f is infinitely {{many times}} <b>differentiable,</b> but not analytic.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a diffeomorphism is an {{isomorphism}} in {{the category}} of smooth manifolds. It is an invertible function that maps one <b>differentiable</b> manifold to another, such that both the function and its inverse are smooth. These are the defining symmetry transformations of General Relativity since the theory is formulated only in terms of a <b>differentiable</b> manifold.|$|E
25|$|In topology, {{differential}} geometry, and algebraic geometry, several structures defined on a {{topological space}} (e.g., a <b>differentiable</b> manifold) can be naturally localised or restricted to open subsets of the space: typical examples include continuous real or complex-valued functions, n times <b>differentiable</b> (real or complex-valued) functions, bounded real-valued functions, vector fields, and sections of any vector bundle on the space.|$|E
25|$|The {{universal}} {{cover of}} a connected Lie group is a Lie group. For example, the group R is the universal cover of the circle group S1. In fact any covering of a <b>differentiable</b> manifold is also a <b>differentiable</b> manifold, but by specifying universal cover, one guarantees a group structure (compatible with its other structures).|$|E
25|$|Taylor's theorem generalizes to {{functions}} f : C → C {{which are}} complex <b>differentiable</b> {{in an open}} subset U⊂C of the complex plane. However, its usefulness is dwarfed by other general theorems in complex analysis. Namely, stronger versions of related results can be deduced for complex <b>differentiable</b> functions f:U→C using Cauchy's integral formula as follows.|$|E
25|$|The Whitehead torsion is {{important}} in applying surgery theory to non-simply connected manifolds of dimension>4: for simply-connected manifolds, the Whitehead group vanishes, and thus homotopy equivalences and simple homotopy equivalences are the same. The applications are to <b>differentiable</b> manifolds, PL manifolds and topological manifolds. The proofs were first obtained in the early 1960s by Stephen Smale, for <b>differentiable</b> manifolds. The development of handlebody theory allowed much the same proofs in the <b>differentiable</b> and PL categories. The proofs are much harder in the topological category, requiring the theory of Kirby and Siebenmann. The restriction to manifolds of dimension >4 are due to {{the application of the}} Whitney trick for removing double points.|$|E
25|$|The graph of a <b>differentiable</b> {{function}} is homeomorphic to {{the domain of}} the function.|$|E
25|$|Adapted and {{continuously}} <b>differentiable</b> {{processes are}} finite variation processes, and hence are semimartingales.|$|E
25|$|So {{convergence}} is not quadratic, {{even though}} the function is infinitely <b>differentiable</b> everywhere.|$|E
25|$|It is to {{be noted}} that a topological {{manifold}} looks locally like a Euclidean space in a rather weak manner: while for each individual chart {{it is possible to}} distinguish <b>differentiable</b> functions or measure distances and angles, merely by virtue of being a topological manifold a space does not have any particular and consistent choice of such concepts. In order to discuss such properties for a manifold, one needs to specify further structure and consider <b>differentiable</b> manifolds and Riemannian manifolds discussed below. In particular, the same underlying topological manifold can have several mutually incompatible classes of <b>differentiable</b> functions and an infinite number of ways to specify distances and angles.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, all locally {{integrable}} functions {{satisfying the}} (volume) mean-value property are both infinitely <b>differentiable</b> and harmonic.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} topological manifolds, i.e., locally Euclidean spaces, which possess no <b>differentiable</b> {{structures}} at all.|$|E
25|$|One {{special case}} of the product rule is the {{constant}} multiple rule, which states: if c is a number and f(x) is a <b>differentiable</b> function, then cf(x) is also <b>differentiable,</b> and its derivative is (cf(x) = c(x). This follows from the product rule since the derivative of any constant is zero. This, combined with the sum rule for derivatives, shows that differentiation is linear.|$|E
25|$|The complex {{absolute}} value function is continuous everywhere but complex <b>differentiable</b> nowhere because it violates the Cauchy–Riemann equations.|$|E
25|$|A <b>differentiable</b> {{parametrization}} of a {{curve is}} an homeomorphism between {{the domain of}} the parametrization and the curve.|$|E
25|$|This result {{shows that}} the index theorem {{is not merely a}} <b>differentiable</b> statement, but rather a topological statement.|$|E
25|$|Minimizing (2) can be rewritten as a {{constrained}} {{optimization problem}} with a <b>differentiable</b> objective function in the following way.|$|E
25|$|For {{connected}} <b>differentiable</b> manifolds, {{the dimension}} {{is also the}} dimension of the tangent vector space at any point.|$|E
25|$|With this definition, every {{distribution}} is infinitely <b>differentiable,</b> and the derivative {{in the direction}} xk is a linear operator on D′(U).|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{holomorphic}} {{function is}} a complex-valued function {{of one or}} more complex variables that is complex <b>differentiable</b> in a neighborhood of every point in its domain. The existence of a complex derivative in a neighborhood is a very strong condition, for it implies that any holomorphic function is actually infinitely <b>differentiable</b> and equal to its own Taylor series (analytic). Holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis.|$|E
25|$|If the {{derivative}} exists everywhere, {{the function}} is <b>differentiable.</b> One can take higher derivatives as well, by iterating this process.|$|E
