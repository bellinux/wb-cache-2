40|$|Objectives: We {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} an easy-to-implement shopper marketing nutrition intervention in a pilot and two additional studies to increase produce demand without decreasing store profitability or increasing shopper budgets. Methods: We created grocery cart placards that detailed the number of produce items purchased (i. e., descriptive norm) at particular stores (i. e., provincial norm). The effect of these placards on produce spending was assessed across 971, 706 individual person grocery store transactions aggregated by day. The pilot study designated a baseline period (in both control and <b>intervention</b> <b>store)</b> followed by installation of grocery cart placards (in the <b>intervention</b> <b>store)</b> for two weeks. The pilot {{study was conducted in}} Texas in 2012. In two additional stores, we designated baseline periods followed by 28  days of the same grocery cart placard intervention as in the pilot. Additional interventions were conducted in New Mexico in 2013. Results: The pilot study resulted in a significant difference between average produce spending per day per person across treatment periods (i. e., intervention versus same time period in control) (16 %) and the difference between average produce spending per day per person across stores in the control periods (4 %); Furthermore, the same intervention in two additional stores resulted in significant produce spending increases of 12. 4 % and 7. 5 % per day per person respectively. In all stores, total spending did not change. Conclusions: Descriptive and provincial social norm messages (i. e., on grocery cart placards) may be an overlooked tool to increase produce demand without decreasing store profitability and increasing shopper budgets...|$|E
40|$|Background: In the US, 42. 5 % of Hispanics are obese, {{which is}} higher than the {{national}} prevalence rate of 34. 9 %. Diet is a modifiable risk factor for obesity that should be targeted to reduce and prevent disparities within the US Hispanic population. The retail food environment is an important context to study because the greatest contributor to energy intake are from foods and beverages purchased in stores. 	Methods: Aim 1 used NHANES data to examine fruit and vegetable (FV) intake by food store type among Hispanics. Differences between customers of various food store type categories were assessed and analyses were performed to estimate associations between intake and food store type categories. Aim 2 used baseline data from El Valor de Nuestra Salud to examine associations between in-store characteristics of product, placement and promotion and FV purchasing among Hispanic customers. Aim 3 used intervention data from El Valor to evaluate group by time differences in product, placement and promotion and group differences in FV purchasing post-intervention. 	Results: Aim 1 demonstrated that Hispanics who only purchased FVs from convenience stores were younger and more likely to be born in the US. Results also demonstrated that those who primarily purchased from supermarkets/grocery stores reported higher intakes of FVs than those who only purchased from convenience stores (p<. 001, p=. 005). Aim 2 indicated that availability of fresh FVs was associated with FV purchasing (p=. 01). However, when adjusting for placement, availability of fresh FVs was non-significant. Greater shelf space dedicated to FVs (p=. 01) and fewer fresh FV displays (p=. 01) was associated with FV purchasing. Analyses also revealed that men reported lower FV purchasing compared to women (p=. 02). Aim 3 revealed that El Valor was successful in increasing the promotion of FVs among intervention stores (p<. 001) and that <b>intervention</b> <b>store</b> customers reported higher FV purchasing than control store customers (p=. 04). 	Conclusions: The dissertation findings have important implications for practice, policy and research. The results can inform public health interventions to target in-store characteristics to encourage FV purchasing. It is important to understand and build upon the lessons learned to design, implement, and disseminate successful evidence-based programs...|$|E

40|$|YesSupermarkets, with vast {{product ranges}} and {{relatively}} low prices, are an established solution to problems of availability of healthy foodstuffs {{in areas of}} limited retail access. However, where they may indeed raise consumption of desirable goods they also open up new opportunities to buy less healthful items for less, a situation which potentially undermines their ability to improve diet. Using under-reported diary data from the Seacroft Intervention Study in the United Kingdom takes this paper beyond the extant fruit and vegetable focus, giving it scope to explore the full effect of supermarkets. Quantile regressions show existing behaviours are reinforced, and <b>intervention</b> <b>stores</b> may do little to improve diet. Switching to Tesco Seacroft is shown to increase the portions of unhealthy food consumed by almost 1 portion per day for the least healthy.

30|$|Agricultural {{policies}} play an import {{role within}} the dairy industry. The EU dairy industry, for example, {{is subject to}} the CAP. In the past, the CAP focused on maintaining adequate and stable prices for particular dairy commodities, such as butter and SMP. In turn, it was expected that the enhanced returns from these commodities would be transmitted to the farm gate price for milk. This aim was mainly achieved by purchasing to <b>intervention</b> <b>stores,</b> setting production quotas, export refunds, import tariffs and subsidized consumption. These measures resulted in isolating EU dairy commodity prices from lower and more volatile World prices. However, more recent changes to the CAP, and in particular the Luxembourg 2003 agreement, resulted in a greater market orientation with a lower level of price support (intervention buying, 9 import tariffs and export refunds) for EU dairy commodities. To compensate for the resultant losses, the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) was introduced to provide income support at farm level. In addition, the supply quota, introduced in 1984, expired in 2015. This aim of bringing EU dairy prices more in line with World prices was observed in O’Connor and Keane (2011) who reported a convergence of volatility between EU and World dairy commodity prices. A more comprehensive discussion of the CAP policy changes can be found in Keane and O’ Connor (2015).|$|R

A longitudinal study examines the organization's implementation of a customer service intervention which utilized new service standards and customer feedback mechanisms. Moreover, the chain provided a natural experiment, since the forty-six stores in this chain represented three levels of facility design ranging from the traditional supermarket to the extended "store of the future" format. A theoretical model relating the customer service <b>intervention,</b> variations in <b>store</b> design, and customer satisfaction to sales performance was developed. Using both operational performance data from each of the stores and 1, 537 responses from customer satisfaction surveys, a LISREL model was used to test the predictive fit of the model. The results indicate that both the store design and the customer service intervention had a significant, positive impact on customer satisfaction which, in turn, significantly affected sales performance (sales per labor hour). In addition, the customer service intervention had a direct effect on sales performance, although there was no support for a direct relationship between store design and sales performance. This research provides a theoretical basis in helping management understand how to leverage customer service for improved sales performance. service quality, customer satisfaction, customer service intervention, service standards, facility design service productivity...|$|R

40|$|Consumption {{of fruit}} and {{vegetables}} is important for health, but is often lower than recommended and tends to be socio-economically patterned with lower consumption in more deprived groups. In 2008, the English Department of Health introduced the Change 4 Life convenience store programme. This aimed to increase retail access to {{fresh fruit and vegetables}} in deprived, urban areas by providing existing convenience stores with a range of support and branded point-of-sale materials and equipment. We undertook a mixed-methods study of the Change 4 Life convenience store programme in the North East of England around two years after initial implementation. Store mapping (n = 87; 100 % stores) and systematic in-store observations (n = 74; 85 % stores) provided information on intervention fidelity; the variety, purchase price and quality of fresh fruit and vegetables on sale; and purchase price compared to a major supermarket. Ten qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of retailers and other professionals explored experiences of the intervention and provided further insight on quantitative results. <b>Intervention</b> <b>stores</b> were primarily located in socio-economically disadvantaged areas. Fidelity, in terms of presence of branded materials and equipment, was low and much was not being used as intended. Fresh fruit and vegetables on sale were of high quality and had a purchase price around 10 % more than comparable products at a major supermarket. Interviewees were supportive of the health improvement aim of the intervention. Retailers were appreciative of part-funding for chill cabinets and free point-of-sale materials. The intervention suffered from: poor initial and on-going communication between the intervention delivery team and retailers; poor availability of replacement point-of-sale materials; and failure to cement intended links with health workers and community organisations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Behavioral {{interventions}} {{show potential}} for promoting increased {{fruit and vegetable}} consumption in the general population. However, {{little is known about}} their effectiveness or cost-effectiveness among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, who are less likely to consume adequate fruit and vegetables. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects and costs of a behavior change intervention for increasing fruit and vegetable purchasing and consumption among socioeconomically disadvantaged women. DESIGN: ShopSmart 4 Health was a randomized controlled trial involving a 3 -mo retrospective baseline data collection phase [time (T) 0], a 6 -mo intervention (T 1 -T 2), and a 6 -mo no-intervention follow-up (T 3). Socioeconomically disadvantaged women who were primary household shoppers in Melbourne, Australia, were randomly assigned to either a behavior change intervention arm (n = 124) or a control arm (n = 124). Supermarket transaction (sales) data and surveys measured the main outcomes: fruit and vegetable purchases and self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption. RESULTS: An analysis of supermarket transaction data showed no significant intervention effects on vegetable or fruit purchasing at T 2 or T 3. Participants in the behavior change intervention arm reported consumption of significantly more vegetables during the intervention (T 2) than did controls, with smaller intervention effects sustained at 6 mo postintervention (T 3). Relative to controls, vegetable consumption increased by ∼ 0. 5 serving · participant(- 1)  · d(- 1) from baseline to T 2 and remained 0. 28 servings/d higher than baseline at T 3 among those who received the intervention.

40|$|Introduction: Population health {{interventions}} {{in the retail}} food environment, such as corner <b>store</b> <b>interventions,</b> aim to influence the kind of cues consumers receive {{so that they are}} more often directed toward healthier options. Research that addresses financial aspects of retail interventions, particularly using outcome measures such as store sales that are central to retail decision making, is limited. This study explored store sales over time and across product categories during a healthy corner <b>store</b> <b>intervention</b> in a lowincome neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario. Methods: Sales data (from August 2014 to April 2015) were aggregated by product category and by day. We used Microsoft Excel pivot tables to summarize and visually present sales data. We conducted t-tests to examine differences in product category sales by "peak" versus "nonpeak" sales days. Results: Overall store sales peaked on the days {{at the end of each}} month, aligned with the issuing of social assistance payments. Revenue spikes on peak sales days were driven predominantly by transit pass sales. On peak sales days, mean sales of nonnutritious snacks and cigarettes were marginally higher than on other days of the month. Finally, creative strategies to increase sales of fresh vegetables and fruits seemed to substantially increase revenue from these product categories. Conclusion: Store sales data is an important store-level metric of food environment intervention success. Furthermore, data-driven decision making by retailers can be important for tailoring interventions. Future interventions and research should consider partnerships and additional success metrics for retail food environment {{interventions in}} diverse Canadian contexts...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionIncreasingly {{high rates}} of obesity have {{heightened}} interest among researchers and practitioners in identifying evidence-based interventions to increase access to healthful foods and beverages. Because most food purchasing decisions are made in food stores, such settings are optimal for interventions aimed at influencing these decisions. The objective of this review was to synthesize the evidence on supermarket and grocery <b>store</b> <b>interventions</b> to promote healthful food choices. MethodsWe searched PubMed through July 2012 to identify original research articles evaluating supermarket and grocery <b>store</b> <b>interventions</b> that promoted healthful food choices. We categorized each intervention by type of intervention strategy and extracted and summarized data on each intervention. We developed a scoring system for evaluating each intervention and assigned points for study design, effectiveness, reach, and availability of evidence. We averaged points for each intervention category and compared {{the strength of the}} evidence for each category. ResultsWe identified 58 articles and characterized 33 interventions. We found 7 strategies used alone or in combination. The most frequently used strategy was the combination of point-of-purchase and promotion and advertising (15 interventions); evidence for this category was scored as sufficient. On average, of 3 points possible, the intervention categories scored 2. 6 for study design, 1. 1 for effectiveness, 0. 3 for reach, and 2 for availability of evidence. Three categories showed sufficient evidence; 4 showed insufficient evidence; none showed strong evidence.

40|$|Purpose: A novel {{method for}} the {{integration}} of cardiac CT in X-ray fluoroscopy procedures, enabling better decision making in the planning and guidance of cardiovascular interventional therapies. Methods and Materials: Our method offers the possibility of determining the C-arm incidence with the least foreshortening for a selected segment of the coronary vessels, segmented in a pre-operative cardiac CT dataset. In order to assist in stent length selection, {{the length of a}} vascular lesion can be measured in 3 D along the centerline of the curved vessel. During the <b>intervention</b> the <b>stored</b> C-arm incidence can be recalled, and the C-arm can be automatically steered to the appropriate angles. Furthermore our method allows rendering of a curved MPR and a 3 D volume of the coronary arteries, both following in real-time the direction of the viewing incidence of the C-arm. Based on this automatically registered reference image of the CT data, it is possible to steer the C-arm, without using additional contrast medium or X-ray radiation. Results: The proposed method has been applied in the treatment of 20 patients. The 3 D visualization of the coronary arteries, segmented in the CT dataset, augment the sense of orientation and enhance navigation, especially when no contrast medium is visible in the fluoroscopy images. Conclusion: The integration of cardiac CT data helps in improving planning and guidance of cardiovascular interventional therapies. The optimal system angles from true 3 D datasets enable better stent length selection and in addition can lead to a reduction in the use of contrast medium...|$|R

Several interventions have been carried out in retail grocery/supermarket settings {{as part of an effort}} to understand and influence consumption of healthful foods. The review’s key outcome variable is sale/purchase of healthy foods as a result of the interventions. This systematic review sheds light on the effectiveness of food <b>store</b> <b>interventions</b> intended to promote the consumption of healthy foods and the methodological quality of studies reporting them. Methods Systematic literature search spanning from 2003 to 2015 (inclusive both years), and confined to papers in the English language was conducted. Studies fulfilling search criteria were identified and critically appraised. Studies included in this review report health interventions at physical food stores including supermarkets and corner stores, and with outcome variable of adopting healthier food purchasing/consumption behavior. The methodological quality of all included articles has been determined using a validated 16 -item quality assessment tool (QATSDD). Results The literature search identified 1580 publications, of which 42 met the inclusion criteria. Most interventions used a combination of information (e. g. awareness raising through food labeling, promotions, campaigns, etc.) and increasing availability of healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables. Few used price interventions. The average quality score for all papers is 65. 0 %, or an overall medium methodological quality. Apart from few studies, most studies reported that <b>store</b> <b>interventions</b> were effective in promoting purchase of healthy foods. Conclusion Given the diverse study settings and despite the challenges of methodological quality for some papers, we find efficacy of in-store healthy food interventions in terms of increased purchase of healthy foods. Researchers need to take risk of bias and methodological quality into account when designing future studies that should guide policy makers. Interventions which combine price, information and easy access to and availability of healthy foods with interactive and engaging nutrition information, if carefully designed can help customers of food stores to buy and consume more healthy foods...|$|R
40|$|Railway bridges {{are long}} life assets that {{deteriorate}} with age, usage, environmental conditions and poor maintenance practices. A whole of life approach has demonstrated {{to be an}} effective and efficient management regime for these assets. However, failure to do so increases risk and bridges become increasingly costly to maintain at the required standards. Unfortunately, there have been limited studies into the development and application of whole of life bridge maintenance cost modelling to assist railway companies. Additionally, recent trends in railway deregulation and budget constraints within the operating companies have created further challenges to this problem. As a result, many railway companies have been reducing maintenance budgets over recent decades and focusing on short term economic rationalisation. However, despite these challenges, there remains an expectation by infrastructure owners and the wider community that bridges will operate above acceptable safety levels. Considering the above challenges and requirements, this study predominantly aims to reduce uncertainty and increase the accuracy of maintenance cost estimation for effective life cycle management. Analysis of maintenance intervention costs is included by employing subsystem and element information from the bridge asset register, condition reports, and an application of a maintenance intervention decision model using data from the respective databases. Consequently, a whole of life cost model is developed in this study. The model is built with the capability of generating multiple maintenance strategies for providing cost effective options and enhances the quality of whole of life bridge management decision process. Additionally, the model reduces the subjective inputs from the railway operator, bridge user and bridge maintainers. The maintenance <b>intervention</b> database <b>stores</b> maintenance actions applicable to relevant element condition states. The derived information is employed to estimate maintenance costs that are based on desired condition state, location, influencing factors, defect size, degradation rate and residual risk...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{have been}} shown to be inhibitory toward various pathogenic bac-teria during refrigerated storage of ground beef samples and in subprimals. In this study, the effectiveness of a combination of 4 strains of Lactobacillus at reduc-ing Salmonella in turkey products was evaluated to im-prove the final safety of the product. Turkey breasts (hot and chilled) were inoculated with a 3 -strain Sal-monella cocktail (Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Enter-itidis PT 13 NVSL 96 – 18535, and Heidelberg 3347 - 1 Sheldon) and then treated with 1 × 106 cfu/cm 2 of a Lactobacillus-based intervention comprising NP 51, NP 35, NP 3, and NP 7 (Lactiguard, Nutrition Physiol-ogy Corp., kansas City, MO). The turkey breasts were stored at either 5 °C to simulate refrigerated storage and sampled on d 0, 1, 2, and 3 or at 37 °C to simulate hot carcass applications and sampled at h 0, 2, and 4. Ad-ditionally, ground turkey was inoculated with a 3 -strain Salmonella cocktail, treated with 1 × 106 cfu/g of the LAB <b>intervention,</b> and <b>stored</b> at 5 °C with sampling on d 0, 1, 2, and 3. The reduction of Salmonella in the turkey breasts stored at 5 °C treated with Lactobacillus was 2 log (P < 0. 05) compared with the control turkey breasts after d 2. Salmonella in the turkey breasts held at 37 °C was reduced by 1. 5 log (P < 0. 05) by h 2 and 2 log (P < 0. 05) by h 4. The Salmonella in the ground turkey held at 5 °C using the LAB exhibited a 2 log (P < 0. 05) reduction compared with the control after d 1. These results show that the addition of a Lactoba-cillus-based treatment in turkey products significantly reduces Salmonella during storage. Reduction of inoculated Salmonella cocktail in ground turkey and turkey breasts using Lactobacillus-based interventio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{effectiveness}} of food retail interventions is largely undetermined, yet substantial investments {{have been made}} to improve access to healthy foods in food deserts and swamps via grocery and corner <b>store</b> <b>interventions.</b> This study evaluated the effects of corner store conversions in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights, California on perceived accessibility of healthy foods, perceptions of corner stores, store patronage, food purchasing, and eating behaviors. Methods Household data (n[*]=[*] 1686) were collected at baseline and 12 - to 24 -months post-intervention among residents surrounding eight stores, three of which implemented a multi-faceted intervention and five of which were comparisons. Bivariate analyses and logistic and linear regressions were employed to assess differences in time, treatment, and the interaction between time and treatment to determine the {{effectiveness of}} this intervention. Results Improvements were found in perceived healthy food accessibility and perceptions of corner stores. No changes were found, however, in store patronage, purchasing, or consumption of fruits and vegetables. Conclusions Results suggest limited effectiveness of food retail interventions on improving health behaviors. Future research should focus on other strategies to reduce community-level obesity...|$|R
40|$|As the Santa Fe International Bridge (a port {{of entry}} to the U. S. from Mexico) ends and becomes El Paso Street, {{it is home to}} a large number of small businesses, all of which are {{indispensable}} to the local economy. In these stores, shoppers can find a wide variety of products, from clothing to electronics and everything and anything in between. All of it is for sale at the lowest of prices. Ironically, most of the products are imported from Asia or the Middle East, in many cases illegally. Each downtown store is unique and idiosyncratic when compared to mainstream retail stores. Each has its own peculiar, sometimes chaotic yet beautiful, layout. Its beauty relies on the constantly changing inventories and diversity of products. Art for a Dollar: a downtown <b>store</b> <b>intervention</b> is different from prior interventions but consistent in concept and intention. Based on my experiences as artist and employee of an art gallery, the project compares 2 ̆ 2 La Buena Vida 2 ̆ 2 a store located downtown El Paso at 801 El Paso Street, to an art gallery by pointing out similarities in their functioning structures.

40|$|There is a {{persistent}} gap in math abilities between children from low socioeconomic (SES) families compared to children from high-SES families. Interventions to reduce this gap are often expensive and not easily implemented. This {{study examined the}} efficacy of a cost-effective <b>intervention</b> in grocery <b>stores</b> {{in order to try}} and increase the number of math-related adult-child conversations to increase children’s school readiness. We created and placed signs about general language and math in grocery stores in a low-SES neighborhood and a high-SES neighborhood that encouraged conversations between adults and children while shopping. Researchers used observational coding methods to see how these signs naturally influenced conversations. When signs that contained prompts to engage in math conversations were present there was an overall increase in conversations about math compared to the general language signs or when no signs were posted. When signs were present in the low-SES location, there was an increase in conversations about math between adults and children, whereas the signs did not have this effect in the high-SES location. This study demonstrates the benefits of implementing a cost-effective intervention in a natural environment that could increase math conversations and school readiness in children, especially from low-SES families...|$|R
40|$|Efforts to {{transform}} corner stores to better meet community dietary needs have mostly occurred {{in urban areas}} but are also needed in rural areas. Given important contextual differences between urban and rural areas, {{it is important to}} increase our understanding of the elements that might translate successfully to similar <b>interventions</b> involving <b>stores</b> in more rural areas. Thus, an in-depth examination and comparison of corner stores in each setting is needed. A mixed methods approach, including windshield tours, spatial visualization with analysis of frequency distribution, and spatial regression techniques were used to compare a rural North Carolina and large urban (Los Angeles) food environment. Important similarities and differences were seen between the two settings in regards to food environment context, spatial distribution of stores, food products available, and the factors predicting corner store density. Urban stores {{were more likely to have}} fresh fruits (Pearson chi 2 = 27. 0423; p < 0. 001) and vegetables (Pearson chi 2 = 27. 0423; p < 0. 001). In the urban setting, corner stores in high income areas were more likely to have fresh fruit (Pearson chi 2 = 6. 00; p = 0. 014), while in the rural setting, there was no difference between high and low income area in terms of fresh fruit availability. For the urban area, total population, no vehicle and Hispanic population were significantly positively associated (p < 0. 05), and median household income (p < 0. 001) and Percent Minority (p < 0. 05) were significantly negatively associated with corner store count. For the rural area, total population (p < 0. 05) and supermarket count were positively associated (p < 0. 001), and median household income negatively associated (P < 0. 001), with corner store count. Translational efforts should be informed by these findings, which might influence the success of future interventions and policies in both rural and urban contexts...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quasi-experimental}} study was to measure {{the effectiveness of a}} grocery store tour that emphasized sources of iron-rich, kid-friendly foods on the participants’ knowledge about dietary iron and iron-rich food sources. A second purpose was to determine if, three months after the grocery store tour, the serum iron levels of the children who had previously been identified by the WIC (Supplemental Women, Infants, and Children) program as being low was higher as compared to the serum iron levels of the control group. Ten parents of children with low iron levels participated in this study, 5 in the control group and 5 in the treatment group. Data collection took place for this research study over the course of three months. The results of this study indicated that the grocery <b>store</b> <b>intervention</b> seemed to have no impact on the children’s hemoglobin levels. The results of this study also indicated that the grocery <b>store</b> tour <b>intervention</b> seemed to have no impact on children’s consumption of iron rich foods. However, the grocery <b>store</b> tour <b>intervention</b> did {{have a positive impact on}} parents’ knowledge of iron rich foods and their ability to use unit pricing.
