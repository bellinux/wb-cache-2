2500|$|As of 2015, two {{fuel cell}} {{vehicles}} have been introduced for commercial lease and sale in limited quantities: the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai ix35 FCEV. Additional demonstration models include the Honda FCX Clarity, and Mercedes-Benz F-Cell. As of June 2011 demonstration FCEVs had driven more than , with more than 27,000 refuelings. Demonstration {{fuel cell vehicles}} have been produced with [...] "a driving range of more than [...] between refueling". They can be refueled in less than 5 minutes. The U.S. Department of Energy's Fuel Cell Technology Program claims that, as of 2011, fuel cells achieved 53–59% efficiency at one-quarter power and 42–53% vehicle efficiency at full power, and a durability of over [...] with less than 10% degradation. In a Well-to-Wheels simulation analysis that [...] "did not address the economics and market constraints", General Motors and its partners estimated that per mile traveled, a fuel cell electric vehicle running on compressed gaseous hydrogen produced from natural gas could use about 40% less energy and emit 45% less greenhouse gasses than an internal combustion vehicle. A lead engineer from the Department of Energy whose team is testing fuel cell cars said in 2011 that the potential appeal is that [...] "these are full-function vehicles with no limitations on range or refueling rate so they are a direct replacement for any vehicle. For instance, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> a full sized SUV and pull a boat up into the mountains, {{you can do that}} with this technology and you can't with current battery-only vehicles, which are more geared toward city driving." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You'll see, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> out north," [...] the man {{answered}} shortly. Then {{he turned}} to his better-dressed companion. [...] "What {{are you going to do}} with that carload of lumber we got for Grant?" ...|$|E

60|$|LARRY. Yes, you. You say the Irish {{sense of}} humor is in abeyance. Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> through Rosscullen in a motor car with Haffigan's pig, it won't stay in abeyance. Now I warn you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wretch,' rejoined Nicholas, fiercely, 'touch him at your peril! I {{will not}} stand by, and see it done. My blood is up, and I have the {{strength}} of ten such men as you. Look to yourself, for by Heaven I will not spare you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> me on!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It'll make trouble, Majesty, but it's {{got to be}} done," [...] replied Alfred. [...] "Here {{you have}} a crowd of Eastern friends due next month. We want the range to {{ourselves}} then. But, Stillwell, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> those vaqueros off, won't they hang around in the foothills? I declare they are a bad lot." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a new}} note in the man's {{voice that}} was almost exultant in its quietness. [...] "A good deal, I think. Hetty, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hadn't <b>driven</b> so often beside me here, {{would you have done}} what you have to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care who}} it is! It's the worst writing I ever saw. Now you musn't {{think you can}} impose on us because we are strangers. We are not fools, by a good deal. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have got any {{specimens}} of penmanship of real merit, trot them out!--and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> haven't, <b>drive</b> on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>driven</b> me {{back on my}} 'nature.' Luckily for you {{you never}} have. You've done every thing else, but you've never done that. But what I really don't a bit want," [...] she declared, [...] "is to abet them or to protect them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} be able to. I've been {{studying}} A-B-C-D diagrams of carving for the past month," [...] said Gilbert. [...] "Only don't talk to me while I'm doing it, Anne, for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> the letters out of my head I'll be in a worse predicament than you were in old geometry days when the teacher changed them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, lad, it {{is indeed}} sad to see how little you know. Your hands, Nigel, were always better than your head. No man of gentle birth would speak of a herd of swine; that is the peasant speech. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> them it is a herd. If you hunt them it is other. What call you them, then, Edith?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry," [...] said Mrs. Tolbridge, [...] "that {{he is not}} here, {{but he said he}} {{was going}} to stop and see Miss Panney. I can't tell you any other place to which he was going. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> back by the Witton road, you may find him, or, if he has not yet arrived, it might be well to wait for him." ...|$|E
60|$|The King in his terror called out, 'Stop a moment; I {{will give}} you half my kingdom <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>drive</b> all the wolves away.' But Ferko pretended not to hear, and drove some more {{thousands}} before him, so that everyone quaked with horror and fear.|$|R
5000|$|Also, in Grand Theft Auto 4, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get Niko {{drunk and}} then drive, either he or his {{drinking}} partner will say [...] "Niko, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> drink then <b>drive,</b> you're a bloody idiot".|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he won't. Just {{tell him}} you want to learn, and ask him <b>if</b> he'll let <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> around a few times. Tell him it won't cost him anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now remember. We are to keep close {{together}} {{until we get}} through Sawyer. Then, if we are followed, you are {{to give me a}} chance to get ahead, and you will keep straight on until you tire them out, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> all night. Ralph," [...] he added, [...] "Jim knows the road and you don't, so I am going to let him drive for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For others {{there may}} be excuse," [...] she continued, {{thinking}} then, as always, of that scene at West Putford, and defending to herself him whom to herself she so often accused; [...] "but for you there can be none. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> him from you now, whatever evil may befall him will lie like a weight of lead upon your heart. If you refuse him now, {{he is not the}} man to take it quietly and wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, very well, Macumazahn, very well; {{but what}} {{happened}} to my own people six months ago, and what did I tell the messengers would happen? They drove me away, and they are gone. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> me away you will soon be gone too," [...] and he nodded his white lock at me and smiled. Now I was not more superstitious than other people, but somehow old Indaba-zimbi impressed me. Also I knew his extraordinary influence over every class of native, and bethought me that he might be useful in that way.|$|E
6000|$|Then the King {{raised his}} voice again and called out, 'Stop! you shall have my whole kingdom, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will only <b>drive</b> these wolves back to the places they came from.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Angry? oh, no!' cried Sophy, {{her heart}} quite unlocked; 'but the more I loved and admired, the more I could not speak. And <b>if</b> they <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> to be a governess? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had a {{situation}} like what we read of?' ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the twelfth}} century, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux wrote: [...] "If {{the winds of}} temptation arise; <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are <b>driven</b> upon the rocks of tribulation look to the star, call on Mary; <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are tossed upon the waves of pride, of ambition, of envy, of rivalry, look to the star, call on Mary. Should anger, or avarice, or fleshly desire violently assail the frail vessel of your soul, look at the star, call upon Mary." ...|$|R
6000|$|FRIEDRICH. [...] "Your effrontery astonishes me. After {{what you}} have done, and what is clear as day, you persist, instead of owning {{yourself}} culpable. Do not imagine you will make people believe that black is white; when one [ON, meaning I] does not see, the reason [sic]? ONE p. 218, book XVI +++++++++++++++++ is, one {{does not want to}} see everything. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> the affair to extremity,--all shall be made public; and it will be seen whether, if your Works deserve statues, your conduct does not deserve chains." [...] [--OEuvres de Frederic,--xxii. 302, 301.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} take them to her," [...] said Mrs. Cliff. [...] "She may be stingy, but she is suffering, and I want her to have those {{blankets}} {{because they are the}} very best that I could possibly send her. You can get Andrew Marks to drive you there, but stop two or three doors from the house. She will think you are putting on airs <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> up to the door. And I wish you would give her the blankets just {{as if it was a}} matter of course that anybody would send things to a sick person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is the express," [...] Emily {{reminded}} her; [...] "and {{there is}} time to catch it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> at once to the town." [...] She took Cecilia's hand and pressed it to her bosom. [...] "Thank you again and again, dear, for all you have done for me. Whether we meet again or not, as long as I live I shall love you. Don't cry!" [...] She made a faint attempt to resume her customary gayety, for Cecilia's sake. [...] "Try to be as hard-hearted as I am. Think of your sister--don't think of me. Only kiss me." ...|$|E
50|$|The Driven were an Irish rock band, {{possibly}} {{best known}} for their 1996 single Jesus Loves <b>You</b> More <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Can <b>Drive.</b> From 1995 to 1998, the band consisted of Brendan Markham (vocals, guitar), Darrin Mullins (lead guitar), Ned Kennedy (drums) and Paul Power (bass). After 1998, Ned Kennedy was replaced by Christian Best. Three of the members later went on to form a group called Citizen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Torrance, [...] "I'll start to-morrow. Still, I don't want {{to leave}} the girls here, and it would suit me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could <b>drive</b> them over to Allonby's. I don't mind admitting that they have given me a good deal of anxiety, though they've made things pleasant, too, and I've 'most got afraid of {{wondering}} what Cedar will feel like when they go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fine fighting--when there's {{no getting}} you {{to handle a}} lance, except as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wanted to <b>drive</b> a puddock with a reed! Though you have been better of late, little as your hermit seemed the man to teach you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't explain part of it," [...] he said. [...] "When I {{took hold}} of the Canopus, it didn't seem likely to pay me for my trouble, and I didn't worry about the patents or how far they covered what I was doing. Now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> beyond the {{frontage}} you've made your claim on, it constitutes another mine, which isn't covered by your record and belongs to the Crown. It's open to any jumper who comes along. Besides, unless you do a good many things exactly as the law lays down, your patent mayn't hold good, and any one who knows the regulations can re-record the claim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest Stella--Matilda {{must bring}} you my excuses for to-day. I don't {{in the least}} {{understand}} it, but I seem to have turned lazy. It is most ridiculous--I really cannot get out of bed. Perhaps I did do {{just a little too}} much yesterday. The opera after the garden party, and a ball after the opera, and this tiresome cough all night after the ball. Quite a series, isn't it? Make my apologies to our dear dismal Romayne--and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> out this afternoon, come and have a chat with me. Your affectionate mother, Emily Eyrecourt. P. S.--You know what a fidget Matilda is. If she talks about me, don't believe a word she says to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|So wrote Chancellor Cocceji, on the Saturday, washing {{his hands}} of this sorry business. Voltaire {{is ready to}} make desperate oath, if needful. We said once, M. de Voltaire was not given to lying; far the reverse. But yet, see, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>drive</b> him into a corner with a sword at his throat,--alas, yes, he will lie a little! Forgery lay still less in his habits; but he can do a stroke that way, too (one stroke, unique in his life, I do believe), if a wild boar, with frothy tusks, is upon him. Tell it not in Gath,--except for {{scientific}} purposes! And be judicial, arithmetical, in passing sentence on it; not shrieky, mobbish, and flying off into the Infinite! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd {{better be}} {{prepared}} for one, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> mean to <b>drive</b> her as <b>you</b> have been doing." [...] He flung back the saloon scuttle. [...] "You'd have swamped her in another hour or two--the cabin floorings are all awash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s a {{nice little}} place," [...] said the landlady of the Railway Hotel, as they asked her opinion over lunch; [...] "there’s a little land goes with it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>drive</b> over, I’d better be having {{something}} got ready." ...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2010, Redman {{reached the}} summit of Mount Rainier along with three other wounded service members.
