25|$|It is {{commonly}} {{thought of as}} the lowest temperature possible, {{but it is not the}} lowest enthalpy state possible, because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid, and then to solid; and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization (<b>gas</b> <b>to</b> <b>liquid)</b> and enthalpy of fusion (liquid to solid) exceeds the ideal gas's change in enthalpy to absolute zero. In the quantum-mechanical description, matter (solid) at absolute zero is in its ground state, the point of lowest internal energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of diesel fuel is a {{specific}} fractional distillate of petroleum fuel oil, but alternatives that are not derived from petroleum, such as biodiesel, biomass to liquid (BTL) or <b>gas</b> <b>to</b> <b>liquid</b> (GTL) diesel, are increasingly being developed and adopted. To distinguish these types, petroleum-derived diesel is increasingly called petrodiesel. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) is a standard for defining diesel fuel with substantially lowered sulfur contents. As of 2016, almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in UK, Europe and North America is of a ULSD type. In the UK, diesel fuel for on-road use is commonly abbreviated DERV, standing for diesel-engined road vehicle, which carries a tax premium over equivalent fuel for non-road use. In Australia diesel fuel is also known as distillate, and in Indonesia, it is known as Solar, a trademarked name by the local oil company Pertamina.|$|E
2500|$|Unconventional oil is oil {{produced}} or extracted using techniques {{other than}} the traditional oil well method from sources such as oil sands, oil shale and the conversion of coal or natural <b>gas</b> <b>to</b> <b>liquid</b> hydrocarbons through processes such as [...] Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Currently, unconventional oil production is less efficient and has a larger environmental impact relative to conventional oil production. Compared to conventional oil, much more energy is required to extract oil from non-conventional sources, so increasing costs and carbon emissions. Technology, such as using steam injection in oil sands deposits, is being developed {{to increase the efficiency}} of unconventional oil production.|$|E
