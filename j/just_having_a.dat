25|$|Fern was {{extremely}} successful in her lifetime as a columnist. She {{was said to}} fit her material and subject matter to the audience. Many readers of weekly literary papers were women, and Fern addressed them in a conversational style, often using interjections and exclamation points, while tackling topics that concerned the daily life of ordinary women. Her readers were wives and mothers who worried about their children, current fashions, difficult husbands, and aggravating relatives. Sometimes they felt oppressed, depressed, or stressed. Fern expressed their problems in plain language, addressing women's suffrage, the woman's right to her children in a divorce, unfaithful husbands, social customs that restricted women's freedom, and sometimes <b>just</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> bad day.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of its {{contribution}} to Allied victory in the First World War, Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority. Convinced that Canada had proven itself on the battlefields of Europe, Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which saw such a delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men, its right to equal status as a nation had been consecrated on the battlefield. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of delegations from Canada, India, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa. These also received their own seats in the League of Nations. Canada asked for neither reparations nor mandates. It played only a modest role at Paris, but <b>just</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> seat was a matter of pride. It was cautiously optimistic about the new League of Nations, in which it played an active and independent role.|$|E
25|$|The NFL adopted {{some of the}} {{innovations}} introduced by the AFL immediately {{and a few others}} in the years following the merger. One was including the names on player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks {{to keep track of the}} official game time, instead of <b>just</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> stopwatch used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the two-point conversion to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the AFL than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the Super Bowl, which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.|$|E

On February 10, 2017, Perry released the album's lead single with Skip Marley titled [...] "Chained to the Rhythm", which reached number one in Hungary and number four in the United States. Its second single, [...] "Bon Appétit", features Migos and was released that April. The third single, [...] "Swish Swish" [...] featuring Nicki Minaj, followed the next month.

500|$|Michael Cera plays Nick O'Leary, the [...] "straight {{bass player}} in a gay band" [...] {{teenager}} who is heartbroken after his girlfriend breaks up with him. Cera was the first actor to be cast after being recommended to Sollett by producer Kerry Kohansky Roberts based on his performance in Arrested Development. Sollett called him a [...] "genius" [...] and a [...] "terrific actor", {{as well as a}} [...] "brilliant improvisational comedian". Cera, who had previously taken improvisation classes, said that [...] "It's fun , <b>just</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> conversation. It always feels real because it is real." [...] He lived in an apartment in New York's East Village for the duration of filming.

500|$|In 2007, USOC head Peter Ueberroth {{contended that}} Chicago was in [...] "third or fourth place", with {{a need to}} focus more on the {{international}} relations rather than <b>just</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> stronger technical bid. In September 2009, the IOC gave a written evaluation of the venues, budgets, transportation plans and public support. Chicago's bid was not federally underwritten, unlike other bid cities, which concerned the IOC, given declining tax revenue during a major recession in the US economy. [...] Nevertheless, with Chicago's strong hosting of the AIBA Boxing Championships which exposed the city to many IOC members, the city was cited as a current favorite, and one member claimed the Games were [...] "theirs to lose." [...] Chicago also successfully hosted the 2006 Gay Games, another multinational sporting event. Both events were planned with short lead times.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Bhasker, {{one of the}} song's producers, {{explained}} the track's roots as it [...] "came {{in the middle of}} the process of putting together the album". He further elaborated; [...] "We were <b>just</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> jam session, tracking some things, and Bruno started playing this groove and making up something on the spot; we all thought it was pretty good. We wound up working a long time on that, trying to get it just right." [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] began as a [...] "cha-cha-style duet, à la Santana's [...] "Smooth"." [...] Ronson asked the Dap-Kings to collaborate on the track in order to get a [...] "crisply syncopated, locked-in groove." [...] Regarding the song, Mars says [...] "Man, there's a good pocket on this song right now. Let's keep it going." [...] He also mentioned that it took a long time to create it, commenting [...] "People didn't see us going at each other's throats in the studio and pulling out our hair." [...] He added, [...] "Trying to get these drums right and figure out a bass line." [...] Lawrence believes the lack of [...] "heavy hitting drums" [...] and the presence of a small guitar solo allows the song to be carried by Mars.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told me last summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or <b>just</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality." [...] A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" [...] from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.|$|E
500|$|In {{the writing}} of {{previous}} albums by Rolo Tomassi {{a majority of the}} music was written by James and Eva Spence wrote most of the lyrics. For Astraea, the band treated it as a collaboration between all five members; however James and Cayford were the [...] "main brains". In January 2012, in an interview with Kerrang!, Eva Spence confirmed that the band are self-producing their third full-length with Hysterics producer Jason Sanderson. The choice of returning to Sanderson was because he has been a close friend of the band members for a long time. Regarding the sound of the album, she stated that it will be [...] "more direct and heavier", but also noted that the band [...] "will never shy away from being experimental". However, James Spence went on record saying that during the actual production of the album the band did not consider themselves as part of the overall production; rather <b>just</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> say in every aspect of the album progress. In April 2012, the NME did a studio update with on the album with James Spence stating that the band's writing was [...] "70% complete". He credited how the new members Chris and Nathan [...] "breathed new life" [...] into the band's writing as the original three members had become [...] "too set in their ways". The band members have commented that this has made the writing a lot more fun as the band no longer writes a song then learns it. As the band wrote Astraea they decided to contrast with their typical style more with the clean and ethereal parts, which led to an increase of Eva's singing.|$|E

She {{then went on to}} say, [...] "I remember going into the studio and singing it from it the beginning to end over and over again. I haven't sung like that since my musical theatre days.

During this time, Garcia also studied at what is now the San Francisco Art Institute. The teacher there was Wally Hedrick, an artist who came to prominence during the 1960s. During the classes, he often encouraged Garcia in his drawing and painting skills. Hedrick also introduced Garcia to the fiction of Jack Kerouac, whom Garcia later cited as a major influence.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, Clarkson {{attracted}} {{over 500}} complaints to the BBC when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.

Chris Mole, the Member of Parliament for Ipswich, where five prostitutes were murdered in 2006, wrote a [...] "strongly worded" [...] letter to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson, demanding that Clarkson be sacked. Clarkson dismissed Mole's comments in his Sunday Times column the following weekend, writing, [...] "There are {{more important things to}} worry about than what some balding and irrelevant middle-aged man might have said on a crappy BBC2 motoring show."

Definitely the guru of the whole thing", Newman revealed. Recording and mixing was done over a total of eleven days. The two half-days were booked {{as a result of}} Conley losing his voice recording the vocals. Conley noted that other people would think the band was [...] "rushing, but we were <b>just</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> blast". The band, attempting to finish the album, would do s, relaxing in the control room, and sleeping in the lounge. Conley said that the band was [...] "really psyched" [...] at how the songs sounded.
