5|$|The Bonville–Courtenay feud of 1455 engendered {{a series}} of raids, sieges, and attacks between two major Devon families, the Courtenays and the Bonvilles, in south west England, in the mid-fifteenth century. One of many such aristocratic feuds of the time, it became <b>entwined</b> <b>with</b> {{national}} politics due to the political weight of the protagonists. The Courtenay earls of Devon were the traditional powerbrokers in the region, but by this time a local baronial family, the Bonvilles, had become more powerful and rivalled the Courtenays for royal patronage. Eventually this rivalry spilled over into physical violence, including social disorder, murder and siege.|$|E
5|$|John Neville's {{upbringing}} and carer was <b>entwined</b> <b>with</b> that of {{the north}} of England and specifically, the marcher areas, the eastern and western borders between Scotland and England, controlled from Berwick and Carlisle respectively. His Early activity there consisted of diplomatic meetings with the Scots, at which he acted as a witness, between 1449 and 1451. He {{was also one of}} three men who were instructed, in a letter of 3 February 1449, to not attend the forthcoming parliament and remain in the north guarding the border. He was knighted by King Henry VI at Greenwich on 5 January 1453, alongside Edmund and Jasper Tudor, his brother Thomas Neville, William Herbert, Roger Lewknor, and William Catesby.|$|E

5|$|Since {{little of}} Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our {{image of her}} is largely {{through the eyes of}} others, in {{particular}} Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her {{has been used as a}} symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably <b>entwined</b> <b>with</b> that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origin}} as a {{city-state}} {{on the peninsula}} of Italy in the 8th century BC, to its rise as an empire covering much of Southern Europe, Western Europe, Near East and North Africa to its fall in the 5th century AD, the political history of Ancient Rome was closely <b>entwined</b> <b>with</b> its military history. The core of the campaign history of the Roman military is an aggregate of different accounts of the Roman military's land battles, from its initial defense against and subsequent conquest of the city's hilltop neighbors on the Italian peninsula, to the ultimate struggle of the Western Roman Empire for its existence against invading Huns, Vandals and Germanic tribes. These accounts were written by various authors throughout and after {{the history of the}} Empire. Following the First Punic War, naval battles were less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome due to its encompassment of lands of the periphery and its unchallenged dominance of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cyathus have fruit bodies (peridia) that are vase-, trumpet- or urn-shaped with {{dimensions}} of 4–8mm wide by 7–18mm tall. Fruit bodies are brown to gray-brown in color, {{and covered with}} small hair-like structures on the outer surface. Some species, like C.striatus and C.setosus, have conspicuous bristles called setae {{on the rim of}} the cup. The fruit body is often expanded at the base into a solid rounded mass of hyphae called an emplacement, which typically becomes tangled and <b>entwined</b> <b>with</b> small fragments of the underlying growing surface, improving its stability and helping it from being knocked over by rain. Immature fruit bodies have a whitish membrane, an epiphragm, that covers the peridium opening when young, but eventually dehisces, breaking open during maturation. Viewed with a microscope, the peridium of Cyathus species is made of three distinct layers—the endo-, meso-, and ectoperidium, referring to the inner, middle, and outer layers respectively. While the surface of the ectoperidium in Cyathus is usually hairy, the endoperidial surface is smooth, and depending on the species, may have longitudinal grooves (striations).|$|E

5|$|The Cold War {{split the}} {{temporary}} wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two superpowers with profound {{economic and political}} differences. The USSR was a Marxist–Leninist state led by its Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which in turn was dominated by a leader with different titles over time, and a small committee called the Politburo. The Party controlled the press, the military, the economy and many organizations. It also controlled the other states in the Eastern Bloc, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist China, particularly following the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. In opposition stood the capitalist West, led by the United States, a federal republic with a two-party presidential system. The First World nations of the Western Bloc were generally democratic with a free press and independent organizations, but were economically and politically <b>entwined</b> <b>with</b> a network of banana republics and other authoritarian regimes throughout the Third World, {{most of which were}} the Western Bloc's former colonies. Some major Cold War frontlines such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Congo were still Western colonies in 1947.|$|E
5|$|In central Bristol, {{where the}} river is tidal, it is {{diverted}} from its original course into the New Cut, a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 {{at a cost of}} £600,000. The original course is held at a constant level by lock gates (designed by Jessop) and is known as the Floating Harbour. The Floating Harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop's locks. This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributaries, the River Frome and Siston Brook, and is intimately <b>entwined</b> <b>with</b> Bristol's city centre as few docks are. As a result of this, the Floating Harbour {{is one of the more}} successful pieces of dockland regeneration, with much of the dockside now occupied by residential, office and cultural premises, and the water area heavily used by leisure craft. The Floating Harbour gave the port an advantage by enabling shipping to stay afloat rather than grounding when the tide went down. Downstream of central Bristol the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge, spanned by Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, the river is tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide. It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the Floating Harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary.|$|E

5000|$|GrassMaster is a 100% natural grass pitch {{which is}} {{reinforced}} by 20 million polypropylene (PP) fibres. The PP fibres are injected by computer-controlled machines, 18 deep and 2 cm above the surface, in a grid of +/- 2 x 2 cm. The ingenuity of this pioneering system {{is to be found}} both below and above the surface: the natural grass roots <b>entwine</b> <b>with</b> the fibres and grow deeper and wider, building a stronger and healthier rootzone. The PP fibres above the surface ensure an always even and stable surface. GrassMaster can be installed before seeding, after seeding or on grass sods..|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} Chinese martial arts known as Snake Boxing or Fanged Snake Style (...) which imitate the {{movements}} of snakes. It is a style of Shaolin Boxing. Proponents claim that adopting the fluidity of snakes allows them to <b>entwine</b> <b>with</b> their opponents in defense and strike them from angles they wouldn't expect in offense. Snake style is said to especially lend itself to applications with the Chinese straight sword. The snake {{is also one of}} the animals imitated in Yang family Taijiquan (T'ai chi ch'uan), Baguazhang and Xingyiquan.

25|$|In great {{contrast}} to the bright pristine nature of the stations, the dams are organic and <b>entwined</b> <b>with</b> the natural rock.

In these latter cases, the end of the dam straightens out, and the last section of gravity dam (where the weight of the dam itself resists the force of the water) then acts like a buttress to the more efficient arch dam.|$|E
25|$|This {{struggle}} {{took place}} amid {{strong support for}} slavery among white Southerners, who profited greatly from the system of enslaved labor. But slavery was <b>entwined</b> <b>with</b> the national economy; for instance, the banking, shipping and manufacturing industries of New York City all had strong economic interests in slavery, as did similar industries in other major port cities in the North. The northern textile mills in New York and New England processed Southern cotton and manufactured clothes to outfit slaves. By 1822 half of New York City's exports were related to cotton.|$|E

Yet, historians have only recently begun to consider risk as distinct category of historical analysis. Instead, the study of risk has been fragmented {{into a series of}} rubrics, including: risk society, modernity, history of safety, and disaster studies. This article calls for a more analytically coherent approach to risk in history, which integrates theoretical tools developed by social theorists and contemporary sociologists, with the historian’s attention to change over time, historical contingency, and individual agency. Borrowing from the work of historians of technology and material culture scholars, this approach also pays particular attention to how the material dimensions of risk <b>entwine</b> <b>with</b> politics and culture. The article also offers an overview of the existing literature and suggestions for areas of future research. (author's abstract...|$|R
