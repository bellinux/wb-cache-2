50|$|Full-duplex audio {{systems like}} {{telephones}} can create echo, which {{needs to be}} removed. Echo occurs when the sound {{coming out of the}} speaker, originating from the far end, re-enters the microphone and is sent back to the far end. The sound then reappears at the original source end, but delayed. This feedback path may be acoustic, through the air, or it may be mechanically coupled, for example in a telephone <b>handset.</b> <b>Echo</b> cancellation is a signal-processing operation that subtracts the far-end signal from the microphone signal before it is sent back over the network.|$|E
40|$|In a 4 -wire {{telephone}} set, echo {{may arise}} both by electrical crosstalk in the cord and by acoustical coupling between earpiece and mouthpiece in the <b>handset.</b> The <b>echo</b> loss for these paths {{has been determined}} for two analogue 2 -wire telephone sets. This data is used to derive the echo loss of a hypothetical 4 -wire set having SLR + RLR = 3 dB, and acoustical and electrical properties {{the same as the}} 2 -wire telephone sets. I. 1 Introduction It has been pointed out in several contributions that the choice of LRs for digital telephone sets has to be made considering aspects of loudness and echo in a complete 4 -wire connection. To enable a study of the risk of objectionable echo, Study Group XVI has asked Study Group XII to present information on the subjective effect of talker echo as a function of delay, overall LR and echo path loss. In a digital 4 -wire connection, including 4 -wire subscriber lines and digital telephone sets, the main echo paths are found in the telephone set itself: [...] - t [...] ...|$|R
