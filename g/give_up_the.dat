He chose to abdicate.|$|E

5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} clear in 1922 {{that he would}} never <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made clear that he was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E

5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force {{his way past}} the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loathe to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ground they had taken, fully expected the battle to continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses {{and a lack of}} supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London.|$|E

5|$|By early 1645 the war {{had turned}} decisively against the King, and in February, Parliamentary forces seized the county town of Shrewsbury. This exposed {{the rest of the}} region to attack, and in June a force of 800 Parliamentary {{soldiers}} pushed south towards Ludlow, attacking Stokesay en route. The Royalist garrison, led by Captain Daurett, was heavily outnumbered {{and it would have been}} impossible for them to effectively defend the new gatehouse, which was essentially ornamental. Nonetheless, both sides complied with the protocols of warfare at the time, resulting in a bloodless victory for the Parliamentary force: the besiegers demanded that the garrison surrender, the garrison refused, the attackers demanded a surrender for a second time, and this time the garrison were able to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> castle with dignity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Heraclius died, much of Egypt had been lost, and by 637638 {{the whole of}} Syria was {{in the hands of}} the armies of Islam. With 3,5004,000 troops under his command, 'Amr ibn al-A'as first crossed into Egypt from Palestine at the end of 639 or the {{beginning}} of 640. He was progressively joined by further reinforcements, notably 12,000 soldiers by Al-Zubayr. 'Amr first besieged and conquered Babylon, and then attacked Alexandria. The Byzantines, divided and shocked by the sudden loss of so much territory, agreed to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> city by September 642. The fall of Alexandria extinguished Byzantine rule in Egypt, and allowed the Muslims to continue their military expansion into North Africa; between 643644 'Amr completed the conquest of Cyrenaica. Uthman succeeded Caliph Umar after his death.|$|E
5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1939, the Soviets further reduced their demands and sent Boris Stein to negotiate. Stein and Erkko met five times. Erkko {{rejected}} the Soviet proposals, saying that the Soviet demands would {{mean the end of}} the Finnish neutrality policy and displease the Germans. When the chairman of the Finnish Defense Council C.G.E. Mannerheim was informed of the negotiations, he opined that Finland should <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Suursaari islands because their defence would anyway be impossible during a war, but his arguments did not persuade the majority of the Finnish government. Stein departed Helsinki empty-handed on 6 April.|$|E
