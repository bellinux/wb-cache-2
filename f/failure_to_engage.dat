25|$|Both Troubridge and Milne {{came under}} {{considerable}} criticism for their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> {{and destroy the}} German squadron, criticism which intensified when {{it appeared that the}} presence of the German ships had been influential in the subsequent Turkish decision to enter the war. Troubridge was ordered back to Britain in September, and faced a court of inquiry held at the Navigation School, Portsmouth. After investigating the events surrounding the chase of Goeben and Breslau, the court of inquiry decided to court-martial Troubridge on the grounds of his <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> the enemy. The court martial was held on board , moored at Portland, from 5 to 9 November 1914. After deliberations the court {{came to the conclusion that}} the charge was not proved, owing to the nature of his orders and the Admiralty's failure to clarify them, and Troubridge was ‘fully and honourably acquitted’. Despite this victory the criticism lingered, with accusations that he had let the fleet down. Neither Troubridge nor Milne received another seagoing command, and in January 1915 Troubridge was appointed to head the British naval mission to Serbia.|$|E
500|$|The {{achievement}} of the Kentish contingent put Edward's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> the Danes with his whole army in a poor light. In Cyril Hart's view: [...] "Undoubtedly there were recriminations, which appear to have continued to threaten Edward's authority for some considerable period, especially in Kent; witness the Wessex chronicler's anxiety to find excuses for Edward's failure to support the Kentish contingent." [...] Edward was later to marry Sigehelm's daughter, Eadgifu, and Hart thinks that {{this may have been}} designed to placate his Kentish subjects.|$|E
500|$|Historian Thomas Jentz {{suggests}} that Brevity could have ended in {{victory for the}} British.

Because of their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> 2RTR late that day, several German commanders from Panzer Regiment 5, including its commanding officer, were removed from their posts after the battle. Jentz notes that a feint by the 1st and 7th RTR out of Tobruk might have caused a realignment of the Axis forces, weakening their overall position and perhaps even forcing them {{to give up the}} Sollum area.|$|E
40|$|Simon and Randalls’ (forthcoming) piece does an {{excellent}} job of highlighting how resilience is divergently articulated across multiple sites, however the paper is characterised by an oscillation between an examination of contrasting discourses of resilience (reflected in the ways it is defined and conceptualised) and an attention to specific empirical incidents of its enactment (offering a basis for ontological politics). I argue this limits the analysis in terms of <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with: (i) the materiality of literary representation; (ii) the specificity of tactics for imagining (as opposed to intervening in) ontological futures; and (iii) the more-than-human contingencies of resilience interventions...|$|R

[...] In March 1863, {{after they had}} been captured or destroyed, naval commander David Farragut sought to run the river past Port Hudson {{in a bid to}} regain control over that area, and convinced Banks to make a diversionary land attack on the Confederate stronghold. Banks marched with 12,000 men from Baton Rouge on March 13, but was unable to reach the enemy position due to inaccurate maps. He then compounded the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> the enemy with miscommunications with Farragut. [...] The naval commander successfully navigated two gunboats past Port Hudson, taking fire en route, without support.

It {{has also been}} undermined by accusations of paternalism and past <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with the very people {{it is intended to}} help. This unique book is the first to critique the past, present and future welfare state from a participatory perspective. Peter Beresford, champion of user involvement, draws on pioneering theories and practice of welfare service user movements to offer a blueprint for a new participatory social policy. He controversially challenges orthodox social policy and the limitations of both Fabian and Neo-liberal perspectives in <b>engaging</b> people <b>to</b> improve their own welfare, drawing on service users 'own ideas and experience, including fascinating vignettes from his own family's experience, to demonstrate the value of 'user knowledge'. Filling a much-needed gap in the literature, this accessible text will provide a great introduction for students and a road-map for practitioners of an alternative vision for a future participatory and sustainable social policy. It will also command much wider interest from everyone concerned with how we look after each other in future in society...|$|R

500|$|Although many attend regular {{education}} classes, some children with AS may utilize {{special education services}} because of their social and behavioral difficulties. Adolescents with AS may exhibit ongoing difficulty with self care or organization, and disturbances in social and romantic relationships. Despite high cognitive potential, most young adults with AS remain at home, yet some do marry and work independently. The [...] "different-ness" [...] adolescents experience can be traumatic. Anxiety may stem from preoccupation over possible violations of routines and rituals, from being placed in a situation without a clear schedule or expectations, or from concern with failing in social encounters; the resulting stress may manifest as inattention, withdrawal, reliance on obsessions, hyperactivity, or aggressive or oppositional behavior. Depression is often the result of chronic frustration from repeated <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> others socially, and mood disorders requiring treatment may develop. Clinical experience suggests the rate of suicide may be higher among those with AS, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by systematic empirical studies.|$|E
500|$|Rhin and {{the prisoners}} were taken to Britain, where the frigate was {{immediately}} fitted out as a Royal Navy ship under her old name as HMS Rhin. Oliver was commended for his perseverance {{and he and his}} men shared in the prize money from the frigate. In France, there appears to have been no condemnation of Lamellerie's repeated <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> Royal Navy forces that in terms of weight of shot at least were the inferior of his squadron. In his official report he inaccurately claimed that his frigates had all been too badly damaged during the Atlantic cruise to consider fighting a ship of the line. He was later made a peer after the return of the French monarchy and remained in the French Navy for many years. In British histories his actions have been roundly condemned – William James accuses him of lying in his official despatches and wrote in 1827: [...] "What, then, but a misrepresentation of the facts could have saved this French commodore from being cashiered?", while Richard Woodman wrote in 1998 that [...] "such apparent pusillanimity fed stories of British superiority against all odds and tended to breed a dangerous conceit".|$|E
500|$|In June 1902, Castro {{seized a}} British ship, The Queen, on {{suspicion}} of aiding rebels, in another phase of the Venezuelan civil war. This, together with Castro's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with the British through diplomatic channels, tilted the balance in London in favor of action, with or without German cooperation. By July 1902, the German government was ready {{to return to the}} possibility of joint action, with Matos' insurrection having led to further abuses against German citizens and their property, including by government forces. In mid-August, the United Kingdom and Germany agreed in principle to go ahead with a blockade later in the year. In September, after the Haitian rebel ship the Crête-à-Pierrot hijacked a German ship and seized weapons destined for the Haitian government, Germany sent the gunboat SMS Panther to Haiti. The Panther found the ship and declared that it would sink it, after which the rebel Admiral Hammerton Killick, after evacuating the crew, blew up his ship and himself with it, assisted by fire from the Panther. There were concerns about how the United States would view the action {{in the context of the}} Monroe Doctrine, but despite US State Department legal advice describing the sinking as [...] "illegal and excessive", the State Department endorsed the action, and the New York Times declared that [...] "Germany was quite within her rights in doing a little housecleaning on her own account". Similarly, the British acquisition of the island of Patos, in the mouth of the Orinoco between Venezuela and the British dependency of Trinidad and Tobago, seemed to cause no concern in Washington, even though as a territorial claim it [...] "skirted dangerously close to challenging the Monroe Doctrine".|$|E

500|$|Rainier and Linois had clashed in June 1803, before {{news of the}} {{outbreak}} of war had reached India. Linois had anchored at Pondicherry, a French Indian port, and Rainier had led a powerful squadron to anchor off the harbour {{in anticipation of the}} declaration of war. Concerned that Rainier's numerically superior force would overwhelm his squadron before they could operate against the British merchant convoys in the region, Linois slipped away under cover of darkness and eventually reached Île de France, where he learned that the Napoleonic Wars had begun on 16 May. Sailing to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, Linois resupplied and then departed for a cruise in the South China Sea on 28 December, seeking the large annual convoy of HEIC merchant ships from Canton, known as the China Fleet. This convoy was normally escorted from Canton by several Royal Navy ships of the line, but in 1804 the escort had been delayed. Linois discovered the convoy near the island of Pulo Aura at the eastern entrance to the Strait of Malacca at 08:00 on 14 February and advanced. The convoy commander Commodore Nathaniel Dance had disguised several of the East Indiamen as ships of the line in the hope of convincing Linois that the convoy was well protected. Linois hesitated for over a day, eventually attacking on the morning of 15 February. Dance resisted and Linois withdrew without contesting the engagement. Dance's merchant ships chased Linois's squadron away before resuming their course and meeting their escorts several days later. Linois's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> and defeat the China Fleet infuriated a number of his officers and provoked an angry letter from Napoleon, who accused Linois of believing [...] "that war can be made without running risks".|$|E

This article examines how this trend has manifested itself among the indigenous peoples of Palawan Island and how, despite best intentions, project delivery by “hybrid” NGOs—changing organizational forms with multiple objectives and functions—has often yielded unsustainable and culturally damaging outcomes. We draw on ethnographic research among the Tagbanua and Batak peoples to examine recent claims of broad NGO success in achieving community empowerment and forest conservation on Palawan. We support our argument by examining case studies in which NGOs and state <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> properly <b>engage</b> traditional livelihoods have reinforced outsider control over indigenous needs and aspirations. ...|$|R
25|$|A related {{concept is}} that under American jurisprudence, {{different}} standards of proof are required in {{civil and criminal}} proceedings.

40|$|Abstract Background Scientists {{engaged in}} global health {{research}} are increasingly faced with barriers to {{access and use}} of human tissues from the developing world communities where much of their research is targeted. In part, the problem {{can be traced to}} distrust of researchers from affluent countries, given the history of 'scientific-imperialism' and 'biocolonialism' reflected in past well publicized cases of exploitation of research participants from low to middle income countries. Discussion To a considerable extent, the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> adequately <b>engage</b> host communities, the opacity of informed consent, and the lack of fair benefit-sharing have {{played a significant role in}} eroding trust. These ethical considerations are central to biomedical research in low to middle income countries and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> attend to them can inadvertently contribute to exploitation and erode trust. A 'tissue trust' may be a plausible means for enabling access to human tissues for research in a manner that is responsive to the ethical challenges considered. Summary Preventing exploitation and restoring trust while simultaneously promoting global health research calls for innovative approaches to human tissues research. A tissue trust can reduce the risk of exploitation and promote host capacity as a key benefit. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} of 'participatory development' by transnational non-governmental development organizations (NGDOs) to local 'partners' {{in developing countries}} is today widely criticized, often because of an apparent <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> attain the essentially political goal of 'empowerment'. This article argues that this problem relates closely <b>to</b> a <b>failure</b> amongst NGDOs <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> with the political context in which 'citizenship participation' is contested in developing countries. Case study material reveals how one participatory development intervention has converged with a particular moment in the trajectory of citizenship formation amongst the target group, and with the local politics of citizenship in Cameroon more broadly, in ways that have, at best, ambiguous implications for the 'empowerment' of the local participants. The paper concludes by discussing how 'rights-based' approaches might overcome these problems, and the challenge that this poses for the transnational development community.
