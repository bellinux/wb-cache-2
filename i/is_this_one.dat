25|$|By {{its nature}} Vulgar Latin varied greatly by region and by time period. A few major {{divisions}} can be seen, however. Vulgar Latin dialects began to significantly diverge from Classical Latin during the 3rd century during the classical {{period of the}} Roman Empire. Nevertheless up to the 4th and 5th centuries AD, the most widely spoken dialects were still similar to and mostly mutually intelligible with Classical Latin. With {{the collapse of the}} Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Gothic and Frankish rulers of western Europe created a substantially different Germanic-influenced language, a language that was substantially different from Classical Latin; indeed it <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> that is most often known as Proto-Romance. Similarly in the Eastern Roman Empire as Latin faded as the court language, the Vulgar Latin spoken there became heavily influenced by Greek and Slavic and also became radically different from Classical Latin and from the proto-Romance of Western Europe.|$|E

It offers a demonstration of Kismet's capabilities, narrated as emotive facial expressions that communicate the robot's 'motivational state', Dr. Brazeal: [...] "This one is anger (laugh) extreme anger, disgust, excitement, fear, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> happiness, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> interest, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> sadness, surprise, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> tired, and <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> sleep." ...|$|R
