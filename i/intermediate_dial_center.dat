Audi has brought the shift knob from the RS5 to the S5. There is a shift from having four buttons down each side of the console, to just two {{with the addition of a}} Menu and Car buttons below the MMI control dial (Audi has removed the skip forward / backward buttons that previously occupied the space on either side of the back button). Lastly, a flat-bottom steering wheel style will have a new circular airbag cover as well as piano black trim.|$|R
50|$|The driver {{can use a}} drive-mode <b>dial</b> on the <b>center</b> console {{to select}} “FWD” for best fuel economy; with “4WD Auto” mode selected, the system uses a {{rear-mounted}} electronically controlled transfer clutch to automatically and seamlessly route more power to the rear wheels, depending on driving and road surface conditions. The driver can freely change the drive mode at any time. When “4WD Auto” mode is selected, the Outlander's 4WD system always sends some power to the rear wheels, automatically increasing the amount under full throttle acceleration. The coupling transfers up to forty percent of available torque to the rear wheels under full-throttle acceleration, and this is reduced to twenty five percent over 40 miles per hour. At steady cruising speeds, up to fifteen percent of available torque {{is sent to the}} rear wheels. At low speeds through tight corners, coupling torque is reduced, providing a smoother feel through the corner.|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} employing multiple sensing and event detection modalities and distributed processing is proposed for smart home monitoring applications. Image sensing and vision-based reasoning are employed to verify and further analyze events reported by other sensors. The system has been developed to address the growing application domain in caregiving to the elderly and persons in need of monitored living, who care to live independently while enjoying the assurance of timely access to caregivers when needed. An example of sensed events is the accidental fall of the person under care. A wireless badge node acts as {{a bridge between the}} user and the network. The badge node provides user-centric event sensing functions such as detecting falls, and also provides a voice communication channel between the user and the caregiving center when the system detects an alert and <b>dials</b> the <b>center.</b> The voice connection is carried over an IEEE 802. 15. 4 radio link between the user badge and another node in the network that acts as a modem. Using signal strength measurements, the network nodes keep track of the approximate location of the user in the monitoring environment. The network also includes wall-mounted image sensor nodes, which are triggered upon detection of a fall to analyze their field-of-view and provide the caregiving center with further information about the user’s status. A description of the developed network and several examples of the vision-based reasoning algorithm are presented in the paper...|$|R
50|$|The all-new Expedition was {{developed}} in secret under the U553 program codename and features body-on-frame (BOF) architecture with high-strength lightweight material construction consisting of boron steel and aluminium. The four-door body is constructed from alumimium-alloy, while the frame is constructed from boron steel. The U553 will move to the all-new half-ton hydroformed T3 platform (chassis), which is {{a modified version of}} the half-ton platform underpinning the P552 2015 Ford F-150. The T3 platform will use a new four-wheel independent suspension system design. Updated powertrain systems (engines and transmissions) including a Hybrid variant with proprietary parallel hybrid electric-drive system to help increase fuel efficiency are expected. Expedition will gain Ford's new 10-speed 10R80 SelectShift automatic transmission which will feature artificially intelligent shifting, electronic range select, manual shift mode, and be controlled via a rotary <b>dial</b> on the <b>center</b> console. The next-generation Expedition's chief engineer is Jackie Marshall DiMarco, who is also the chief engineer for the next-generation F-150 pickup.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background While {{there is}} {{extensive}} literature evaluating {{the impact of}} phytoestrogen consumption on breast cancer risk, its role on ovarian cancer has received little attention. Methods We conducted a population-based case-control study to evaluate phytoestrogen intake from foods and supplements and epithelial ovarian cancer risk. Cases were identified in six counties in New Jersey through the New Jersey State Cancer Registry. Controls were identified by random digit <b>dialing,</b> CMS (<b>Centers</b> for Medicare and Medicaid Service) lists, and area sampling. A total of 205 cases and 390 controls were included in analyses. Unconditional logistic regression {{analyses were conducted to}} examine associations with total phytoestrogens, as well as isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, formononetin, and glycitein), lignans (matairesinol, lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol), and coumestrol. Results No statistically significant associations were found with any of the phytoestrogens under evaluation. However, there was a suggestion of an inverse association with total phytoestrogen consumption (from foods and supplements), with an odds ratio (OR) of 0. 62 (95 % CI: 0. 38 - 1. 00; p for trend: 0. 04) for the highest vs. lowest tertile of consumption, after adjusting for reproductive covariates, age, race, education, BMI, and total energy. Further adjustment for smoking and physical activity attenuated risk estimates (OR: 0. 66; 95 % CI: 0. 41 - 1. 08). There was little evidence of an inverse association for isoflavones, lignans, or coumestrol. Conclusions This study provided some suggestion that phytoestrogen consumption may decrease ovarian cancer risk, although results did not reach statistical significance. </p...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1950s, {{a number}} of [...] "dream cars" [...] were built by Packard {{in an attempt to}} keep the marque alive in the imaginations of the American car-buying public. Included in this {{category}} are the 1952 Pan American that led to the production Caribbean and the Panther (also known as Daytona), based on a 1954 platform. Shortly after the introduction of the Caribbean, Packard showed a prototype hardtop called the Balboa. It featured a reverse-slanted rear window that could be lowered for ventilation, a feature introduced in a production car by Mercury in 1957 and still in production in 1966. The Request was based on the 1955 Four Hundred hardtop, but featured a classic upright Packard fluted grille reminiscent of the prewar models. In addition, the 1957 engineering mule [...] "Black Bess" [...] was built to test new features for a future car. This car had a resemblance to the 1958 Edsel. It featured Packard's return to a vertical grill. This grill was very narrow with the familiar ox-yoke shape that was characteristic for Packard, and with front fenders with dual headlights resembling Chrysler products from that era. The engineering mule Black Bess was destroyed by the company shortly after the Packard plant was shuttered. Of the 10 Requests built, only four were sold off the showroom floor. Richard A. Teague also designed the last Packard show car, the Predictor. This hardtop coupe's design followed the lines of the planned 1957 cars. It had many unusual features, among them a roof section that opened either by opening a door or activating a switch, well ahead of later T-tops. The car had seats that rotated out, allowing the passenger easy access, a feature later used on some Chrysler and GM products. The Predictor also had the opera windows, or portholes, found on concurrent Thunderbirds. Other novel ideas were overhead switches—these were in the production Avanti—and a dash design that followed the hood profile, <b>centering</b> <b>dials</b> in the <b>center</b> console area. This feature has only recently been used on production cars. The Predictor survives and is on display at the Studebaker National Museum section of the Center for History in South Bend, Indiana.|$|R
5000|$|Against a {{backdrop}} of a chronology of airline skyjacks, the plot of <b>Dial</b> H-I-S-T-O-R-Y <b>centers</b> on an imagined dialogue between a novelist and a terrorist, based on passages from Don DeLillo's novels Mao II and White Noise. As the plot progresses, {{it becomes clear that}} with the increasing media coverage of terrorist hijacks, this power of producing an inward societal shock has been wrestled from the writer by the terrorist. They are 'playing a zero-sum game' where “what the terrorists gain, novelists lose!” [...] We hear Mouna Abdel-Majid of the PLO tell a reporter, [...] "you westerners, you don't understand ... we have to fight outside our territory and we have to bring the hope to understand our case." [...] The act of writing/terrorizing occupies the central paradox of democracy; it is the irreconcilable tension between the individual and mass culture. Throughout much of Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y, this mass culture becomes synonymous with pop music and the ubiquity of television, particularly its news coverage. As this image-saturated society amplifies throughout the 1960s and 70s, it becomes apparent by the 1980s that the hijackers' political message has been itself hijacked by the media. Whereas in the 1960s hijackers were portrayed as romantic revolutionaries, by the 1990s these have been replaced on television sets by anonymous bombs in suitcases. According to Alexander Provan, [...] "The end of the film seems to suggest that the media is now the ultimate author of fictions that transform themselves into events as they're broadcast." [...] Correlating with a steep rise of the level of violence used, this depersonalization of the terrorist is merely the accommodation of terrorist spectacle for political gain.|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveRadiographic {{parameters}} used {{to define}} acetabular dysplasia {{may be related to}} anthropological characteristics independent of dysplasia. The goal {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between the minimal joint space width (JSW) of the hip and the parameters that define acetabular dysplasia, in clinically normal subjects. DesignOne hundred and eighteen patients who underwent supine abdominal radiography for non-rheumatological indications and had no hip pain or history of hip arthritis were evaluated. JSW was quantified manually using <b>dial</b> calipers, and <b>center</b> edge (CE) angle and acetabular depth were measured for each hip. ResultsCE angle, but not acetabular depth, correlated (inversely) with the minimal hip JSW (r=− 0. 26 and − 0. 20, P= 0. 005 and 0. 038, R (right) and L (left) hips, respectively). CE angle inversely correlated with the pelvic width (r=− 0. 27 and 0. 27, P= 0. 003 and 0. 004, R and L hips, respectively) and acetabular depth correlated with subject's height (r= 0. 27 and 0. 42, P= 0. 008 and < 0. 001 R and L hips, respectively) and leg length (r= 0. 27 and 0. 45, P= 0. 008 and < 0. 001, R and L hips, respectively). Also, pelvic width correlated significantly with the JSW (r= 0. 27 and 0. 20, P= 0. 003 and 0. 033, for R and L hips, respectively). ConclusionsThe radiographic parameters {{used to define}} acetabular dysplasia, CE angle and acetabular depth, are strongly associated with anthropological variables and CE angle is associated with minimal JSW of the hip. It is important to recognize that height and limb length variability may affect radiographic parameters of acetabular dysplasia, and thus may falsely suggest the presence of anatomic abnormalities in some patients...|$|R
