25|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock is a lock {{mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct <b>key.</b> <b>Pin</b> tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|E

50|$|Above each <b>key</b> <b>pin</b> is a {{corresponding}} set of driver pins, which are spring-loaded. Simpler locks typically {{have only one}} driver pin for each <b>key</b> <b>pin,</b> but locks requiring multi-keyed entry, such {{as a group of}} locks having a master key, may have extra driver pins known as spacer pins. The outer casing has several vertical shafts, which hold the spring-loaded pins.|$|E
50|$|The socket is {{very similar}} to FM1, based on a 31×31 grid of pins with a 5×7 central void, 3 pins missing from each corner, and a few {{additional}} <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> missing. Compared to Socket FM1, two <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> were moved, and one more is removed, leaving 904 pins.|$|R
25|$|A client {{that does}} <b>key</b> <b>pinning</b> adds an extra step beyond the normal X.509 {{certificate}} validation: After obtaining the server's certificate {{in the standard}} way, the client checks the public key(s) in the server's certificate chain against a set of (hashes of) public keys for the server name. Typically the public key hashes are bundled with the application. For example, Google Chrome includes public key hashes for the *.google.com certificate that detected fraudulent certificates in 2011. (Chromium does not enforce the hardcoded <b>key</b> <b>pins.)</b> Since then, Mozilla has introduced public <b>key</b> <b>pinning</b> to its Firefox browser.|$|R

50|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock (or Yale lock, after lock {{manufacturers}} Yale) is {{a lock mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct <b>key.</b> <b>Pin</b> tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular pin tumbler locks (also known as radial locks or ace locks).|$|E
50|$|VGA {{connectors}} and cables carry analog component RGBHV (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, vertical sync) video signals, and VESA Display Data Channel (VESA DDC) data. In {{the original}} version of DE-15 pinout, one pin was keyed by plugging the female connector hole; this prevented non-VGA 15 pin cables from being plugged into a VGA socket. Four pins carried Monitor ID bits, which were rarely used; VESA DDC redefined some of these pins and replaced the <b>key</b> <b>pin</b> with +5 V DC power supply. Devices that comply with the DDC host system standard provide 5V ±5% and supply a minimum of 300 mA {{to a maximum of}} 1 A.|$|E

50|$|A {{pin tumbler}} lock is {{composed}} {{of a series of}} spring-loaded stacks called pin stacks. Each pin stack {{is composed of}} two pins that are stacked on top of each other: the <b>key</b> <b>pin,</b> which touches the key when it is inserted, and the driver pin, which is spring driven. When the different length key pins are aligned at their tops by the insertion of the correspondingly cut key at their bases, the tops of the key pins and, consequently, the bases of the driver pins, form a shear line, so that the cylinder can be turned, rotating the key pins away from the driver pins. When no key or the wrong key is in the lock, pin misalignment prevents the cylinder from turning.|$|E
50|$|In {{a master}} keyed lock, {{some or all}} of the shaft hole in the lock have three pins in them instead of two. Between the driver pin and the <b>key</b> <b>pin</b> is a third pin called the spacer pin. Thus each pin line has two shear points, one where the driver and spacer pins meet, and one where the spacer and key pins meet. So the lock will open with two keys; one aligns the first set of shear points and the other aligns the second set of shear points. The locks are {{manufactured}} so one set of shear points is unique to each lock, while the second set is identical in all the locks. A more secure type of mechanism has two separate tumblers, each opened by one key.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduced}} fingerprint {{recognition to}} protect USB Key’s pin number. Pin number is easily stolen and sometimes it’s {{too hard to}} keep in mind. To overcome these problems, a fingerprint key based USB <b>Key</b> <b>pin</b> number protection system has been proposed. Using biometric like fingerprint to protect USB <b>Key</b> <b>pin</b> number improves security and convenience of users. And the fingerprint key is generated by user’s fingerprint and several random points. That avoids user’s privacy information disclosure because it’s hard to restore the template in calculation. With the development of mobile payment {{and more and more}} mobile devices are beginning to equip with fingerprint recognition module, the combination of fingerprint and USB Key has a good prospect and portability. ...|$|E
50|$|The plug has a straight-shaped slot {{known as}} the keyway at one end to allow the key to enter the plug; the other end may have a cam or lever, which {{activates}} a mechanism to retract a locking bolt. The keyway often has protruding ledges that serve to prevent the <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> from falling into the plug, {{and to make the}} lock more resistant to picking. A series of holes, typically five or six of them, are drilled vertically into the plug. These holes contain <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> of various lengths, which are rounded to permit the key to slide over them easily.|$|R
5000|$|When bumping a lock, {{the key is}} {{initially}} inserted into the key way one notch (pin) short of full insertion. Bumping the key inward forces it deeper into the key way. The specially designed teeth of the bump key transmit a slight impact force {{to all of the}} bottom pins in the lock. The <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> transmit this force to the driver pins; the <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> stay in place. This physics action can be visualized by observing the same effect on the desktop toy: Newton's cradle. Because the pin movements are highly elastic, the driver pins [...] "jump" [...] from the <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> for a fraction of a second, moving higher than the cylinder (shear line of the tumbler), then are pushed normally back by the spring to sit against the <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> once again. Even though this separation only lasts a split second, if a light rotational force is continuously applied to the key during the slight impact, the cylinder will turn during the short separation time of the <b>key</b> and driver <b>pins,</b> and the lock can be opened while the driver pins are elevated above the key way. Lock bumping takes only an instant to open the lock. The lock is not visibly damaged, although the force of the bump can leave an indentation {{on the front of the}} cylinder. Certain clicking and vibrating tools designed for bumping can also be used. These allow for rapid repetition of bumping against locks that have advertised [...] "bump proof" [...] features. Only a rare few key-pin locks cannot be bumped.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an online voting authenticationtechnique is {{proposed}} which provides biometric as well aspassword security to voter accounts. Voters are first identifiedby their facial image by using PCA. Second step is thefingerprint recognition. Third one is steganographic method.

40|$|The cis-trans peptidylprolyl {{isomerase}} Pin 1 plays {{a critical}} role in regulating a subset of phosphoproteins by catalyzing conformational changes on the phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs. The phosphorylation-directed ubiquitination {{is one of the major}} mechanisms to regulate the abundance of p 27 Kip 1. In this study, we demonstrate that Pin 1 catalyzes the cis-trans conformational changes of p 27 Kip 1 and further mediates its stability through the polyubiquitination mechanism. Our results show that the phosphorylated Thr- 187 -Pro motif in p 27 Kip 1 is a <b>key</b> <b>Pin</b> 1 -binding site. In addition, NMR analyses show that this phosphorylated Thr- 187 -Pro site undergoes conformational change catalyzed by Pin 1. Moreover, in Pin 1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, p 27 Kip 1 has a shorter lifetime and displays a higher degree of polyubiquitination than in Pin 1 wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that Pin 1 plays {{a critical role}} in regulating p 27 Kip 1 degradation. Additionally, Pin 1 dramatically reduces the interaction between p 27 Kip 1 and Cks 1, possibly via isomerizing the cis-trans conformation of p 27 Kip 1. Our study thus reveals a novel regulatory mechanism for p 27 Kip 1 stability and sheds new light on the biological function of Pin 1 as a general regulator of protein stability...|$|E

50|$|Socket AM3 breaks {{compatibility}} with AM2/AM2+ processors {{due to a}} subtle change in key placement. The AM3 socket has 941 pin contacts in a different layout while AM2+ processors have 940 pins. Tom's Hardware removed the two obstructing <b>key</b> <b>pins</b> from an AM2+ Phenom processor in order to fit it into an AM3 socket. The processor did not work in the AM3 socket, but still worked in an AM2+ socket, suggesting that compatibility issues run deeper than merely the <b>key</b> <b>pins.</b> It is likely because the built-in memory controller in AM2/AM2+ processors only supports DDR2 (unlike AM3 processors, which support both DDR2 & DDR3 memory). In fact, a few motherboards were manufactured that supported both DDR2 and DDR3, however only one type could be used at a time. Despite using an AM3 socket and despite using a northbridge and southbridge found on AM3 motherboards, they support any AM2, AM2+, or AM3 processor.|$|R
