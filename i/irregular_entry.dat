60|$|Horne Fisher had in him {{something}} of the aristocrat, which is very near to the anarchist. It was characteristic of him that he turned into this dark and <b>irregular</b> <b>entry</b> as casually as into his own front door, merely thinking {{that it would be}} a short cut to the house. He made his way through the dim wood for some distance and with some difficulty, until there began to shine through the trees a level light, in lines of silver, which he did not at first understand. The next moment he had come out into the daylight at the top of a steep bank, at the bottom of which a path ran round the rim of a large ornamental lake. The sheet of water which he had seen shimmering through the trees was of considerable extent, but was walled in on every side with woods which were not only dark, but decidedly dismal. At one end of the path was a classical statue of some nameless nymph, and at the other end it was flanked by two classical urns; but the marble was weather-stained and streaked with green and gray. A hundred other signs, smaller but more significant, told him that he had come on some outlying corner of the grounds neglected and seldom visited. In the middle of the lake was what appeared to be an island, and on the island what appeared to be meant for a classical temple, not open like a temple of the winds, but with a blank wall between its Doric pillars. We may say it only seemed like an island, because a second glance revealed a low causeway of flat stones running up to it from the shore and turning it into a peninsula. And certainly it only seemed like a temple, for nobody knew better than Horne Fisher that no god had ever dwelt in that shrine.|$|E

40|$|What do {{we really}} know {{about the number of}} "suspected <b>irregular</b> <b>entry</b> vessels" lost at sea, asks Tony Kevin • RECENT WEEKS have seen rhetoric from both sides of {{politics}} citing high and unsubstantiated figures about deaths of asylum-seekers on suspected <b>irregular</b> <b>entry</b> vessels (SIEVs) seeking to reach Australia, in order to bolster their rival cases for offshore processing in either Malaysia or Nauru. Politicians have publicly advanced figures as high as 900 deaths, or alternatively death rates up to 4 % of asylum-seeker embarkations. Both parties claimed, in effect, that Australia must send those who arrive by boat to offshore processing countries in order to deter other asylum-seekers from embarking on risky voyages to Australia, and thereby to save lives. Now that overseas processing has been politically ruled out, politicians stand ready to blame the other side of politics for any future SIEV deaths at sea.

40|$|In {{the heated}} debate around {{irregular}} migration, the so-called regularization measures represent {{one of the}} main bones of contention – presented by some as the only possible solution to irregular presences and contested by others as rewards for illicit behaviour.

The present paper will use an operational definition of discretion to analyse two European regularization mechanisms that, because of their manifest similarities as well as their different empirical outcomes, lend themselves particularly well to comparison: the Swiss “cas de rigueur” procedure and the Spanish “arraigo”.

This is followed by a review of European responses to the Syrian crisis. Finally, the paper concludes with recommendations for addressing the Syrian refugee crisis. In short, the EU could consider: establishing a Regional Protection Programme (RPP) with a large increase of Syrian refugee resettlement as a required component; increasing refugee resettlement for those who have been affected by the Syrian crisis and are the most in need; continue positive asylum procedures throughout the EU, and grant prima facie recognition including provision of sufficient assistance to Syrian asylum seekers; encourage visa facilitation and family reunification for Syrians; and continue to work with its international partners to find a political and humanitarian solution to the Syrian crisis.

When leaders use a strong and loyal coalition of supporters to overthrow their predecessors and their entire ruling regimes, {{as they do in}} successful rebellions, popular uprisings, and major regime changing coups, they explicitly prove their strength to any potential rivals. These leaders are substantially less likely to be ousted than leaders who take power in ways that do not convey strength so convincingly, such as normal succession and elite reshuffling.

However, existing efforts to consider the possible influences of political opportunity structures on incentives for violence and civil war empirically have almost invariably relied upon measures of democracy to proxy for the hypothesized mechanisms, most notably the argument that the opposing effects of political accommodation and repression will give rise to an inverted U-shaped relationship between democracy and the risk of civil war. The authors detail a number of problems with measures of democracy as proxies for political opportunity structures and develop alternative measures based on the likely risks that political leaders will lose power in irregular challenges and their implications for the incentives for resort to violence. The authors evaluate empirically how the security with which leaders hold office influences the prospects of violent civil conflict.

40|$|La Serie “Policy Briefs” dell’Osservatorio discute in maniera sintetica e policy-oriented i temi di maggiore attualità nel dibattito italiano ed europeo, offrendo un contributo di idee e spunti ai decisori politici e alla comunità degli esperti. Tra i Briefs recentemente pubblicati possono essere menzionati i seguenti: The EU {{external}} policy on migration and asylum: What role for Italy in shaping its future? (A. V. Palm, May 2017); Critical {{aspects of the}} Hungarian Law on asylum seekers’ detention (E. Andriolo, June 2017); Welfare Tourism within the EU: Filling the Perception Gap (D. Pedrali, July 2017). Focusing on the certified shortcomings of the Dublin system and on the recent debate fuelled by the May 2016 proposal of the European Commission (where minimum policy changes to the current Dublin Regulation have been foreseen), the Brief urges the Italian Government to take a proactive stance (not limited to propose the deletion of the <b>irregular</b> <b>entry</b> criterion, or {{to complain about the}} fault of solidarity from other Member States) and advocates the need to make significant changes towards an effective and reasonable system of allocation of asylum seekers. To make these changes possible, a ‘genuine link approach’ between the asylum seeker and the competent EU Member State is suggested, able to substitute the <b>irregular</b> <b>entry</b> criterion and – in the same time – to address the main concerns of many Member States and of other relevant stakeholders. A centralized system for registering all the applications and the attribution of relevant shares according to a reference key would be the first steps in this direction, followed by an assessment of the asylum seeker that takes into account the pivotal importance of the possible relationship(s) of the concerned person with a suitable Member State (or more) through objectively verifiable connections such as family links (in a broader sense than the current one), language, professional and educational ties, private sponsorship and so on. The MS declared competent would fill its annual share of asylum seekers with applicants who are – at least in part – likely to raise less problems as far as financial costs and social integration are concerned and can contribute to the local economy. The whole procedure would be more balanced and less conflictual, while the drivers for secondary movements will be reduced to a large extent. In order to prevent a possible overburden on some Member States (which are usually preferred by asylum seekers as host country), some corrective and compensatory tools are proposed. The recognition of a limited degree of free circulation for economic purposes, to the benefit of the recognized refugee, is suggested too...|$|E
30|$|This problem {{goes beyond}} what a general {{political}} ethics of migration can deliver and requires political and administrative skills more than theoretical insights. Yet {{there is still}} a general lesson that can be drawn. Destination states themselves enhance the problem of mixed flows through indiscriminate policies of closure that push migrants with different motives and claims towards the remaining small doors of family reunification and asylum, which have not been designed for large flows, or towards the backdoor of <b>irregular</b> <b>entry.</b> If such a policy satisfies the normative criteria outlined in this article it would not reduce migration flows across the Mediterranean. It is also an illusion to believe that the right kind of development policies will reduce outmigration pressure in the short run. They are instead more likely to increase it by endowing more people with material and cognitive resources that enable their mobility before conditions improve opportunities to the point where people can afford to stay. Add to this the demographic discrepancy between the “youth bulge” in the MENA and African countries and the rapid ageing of European societies. The implication is that Europe faces a choice between accepting many more economic migrants from the South through regular channels and a policy of closure that violates EU values and undermines EU achievements such as open internal borders.|$|E

I present an acquisition method along these lines for German. The general idea can be roughly summarised as follows: first, generate a set of lexical entry hypotheses for each word-form in the corpus; then, select hypotheses that explain the word-forms found in the corpus “best”.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{substantive}} changes to Spanish immigration {{laws in the}} 1980 s, immigration to Spain and the policies designed to govern it have changed greatly. The pace of this continuous transformation has recently slowed down, offering {{a good opportunity to}} reflect on the ways in which irregular migration has been governed over time. Taking stock of more than three decades of debates in the Spanish Congress, laws, policy documents, interview findings and practices, this dissertation offers a sociological analysis of the messy process of immigration governance in a border country of the European Union. The dissertation starts by analyzing the early problematizations of irregular migration in Spain, understood as the result of discursive and non-discursive practices that provide specific ways of thinking about and acting upon objects. Complicating the assumption that policy shifts are a straightforward result of changes in the political orientation of ruling parties, the dissertation traces the existence of three intersecting sets of logics and practices that have shaped Spanish immigration policy over time: (1) culturalization: a set of logics and practices intimately tied to the history of Spanish colonialism and governing migrants as cultural subjects; (2) labouralization: a set of logics and practices that attempt to manage labour migration flows and frame irregular migrants as workers who contribute to the national labour market; and (3) securitization: a set of logics and practices focused on the defence of state sovereignty, the prevention of <b>irregular</b> <b>entry</b> and the framing of irregular migrants as potential threats. The organization of heterogeneous practices into three broad categories acts as a heuristic device to show how various complementary and at times contradictory logics and practices work together to create a practical regime of migration governance based on a long probationary period during which irregular migrants are scrutinized and policed. Ultimately, this dissertation posits the existence in Spain of a regime governing immigration through probation. This regime entails the rescaling of bordering practices across space and time, the deployment of a space of legal liminality in which irregular migrants are kept, and the use of conditionality and discretion in the assessment of desirability...|$|E
40|$|What {{should we}} make of legislators who equate people {{smuggling}} with human trafficking, asks Savitri Taylor PEOPLE SMUGGLING {{is a matter of}} considerable political concern to Western governments, and has received much international attention in recent years. This is evidenced by the fact that 119 states, including Australia, have become parties to the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Article 3 (a) of the Smuggling Protocol defines “smuggling of migrants” as “the procurement, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit, of the illegal entry of a person into a State Party of which the person is not a national or a permanent resident”. The Protocol refers to a profit motive again in article 6, which requires state parties to criminalise smuggling and related activities where committed by an organised criminal group and transnational in nature. The reference to a profit motive was included {{in order to ensure that}} those assisting migrants or asylum seekers on humanitarian grounds or on the basis of close family ties would not be caught by the Protocol’s provisions. Section 73. 1 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which implements Australia’s Smuggling Protocol obligations, makes it an offence punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment for a person to organize or facilitate the entry of another person into a foreign country contrary to the laws of that country in exchange for direct or indirect benefit. In contrast, a profit motive is not an element of the offences created by 232 A (organisation or facilitation of <b>irregular</b> <b>entry</b> of five or more persons) and 233 (participation in any instance of <b>irregular</b> <b>entry)</b> of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Migration Act to deal with people smuggling into Australia, though these offences carry penalties of up to twenty years and up to ten years of imprisonment respectively. In practice, too, Australian authorities have shown no reluctance in pursuing convictions against persons lacking such motive. Of course, many of those who engage in people smuggling to Australia do have a profit motive. But even here moral distinctions can surely be drawn between organisers and foot soldiers. Although the Australian Federal Police attempt to make organisers the focus of their investigation and prosecution of offences against the Migration Act, most of those actually prosecuted for people smuggling offences thus far have been the foot soldiers, that is to say the crews of suspected illegal entry vessels, or SIEVs. These crews are usually Indonesian fishers who have had to turn to alternative sources of income. During the twentieth century substantial changes to the international law of the sea pushed out the borders of Australian waters into the traditional fishing grounds of Indonesian fishers. While some allowance has been made for traditional fishing activity in a memorandum of understanding between Australia and Indonesia, the Australian interpretation of “traditional” fishing is unreasonably restrictive. In consequence, many Indonesian fishers find themselves convicted of illegal fishing and imprisoned for long periods in Australia for non-payment of fines set well beyond their means or wildest dreams. Upon completion of their sentences they are returned to Indonesia without the fishing boats (which are confiscated by Australian authorities) and without fishing income, but with the need to pay off the debts that that their families were forced to incur in their absence, not to mention the continuing need to provide for their families. The fishers placed in these straits have little choice but to turn to people smuggling. Since they receive payment up-front, their families are at least left better able to survive any time they may spend in Australian jails. To the annoyance of the Howard government, a justified compassion for the circumstances of SIEV crews inclined Australian judges toward leniency in their sentencing. The government therefore amended the Migration Act to ensure that judges did not have the choice of following their inclination. Since 27 September 2001, the Act has specified mandatory minimum penalties for adults convicted of offences under section 232 A and also specified that a court cannot choose to discharge adults it is satisfied committed such offences without proceeding to conviction. Given that Mr Rudd has labeled those who fall foul of the Act’s people smuggling provisions as the “vilest form of human life,” one suspects that none of the provisions just discussed are likely to be changed on his watch. It is true that Mr Rudd’s outburst was a response to the tragedy which befell SIEV 36, and it is important, of course, that those who expose others to risk of death or serious harm should face penalties calculated to deter such behaviour. Article 6 (3) of the Smuggling Protocol, in fact, requires states parties to establish as aggravated offences, people smuggling undertaken in circumstances which “endanger, or are likely to endanger, the lives or safety of the migrants concerned” or that “entail inhuman or degrading treatment, including for exploitation, of such migrants. ” In order to implement Australia’s obligations under the Protocol, section 73. 2 of the Criminal Code provides that a person is guilty of the aggravated offence of people smuggling, if he or she is guilty of the offence in section 73. 1 and intended exploitation of the smuggled person after entry into the foreign country, or in the course of smuggling subjected the person to cruel or inhuman treatment or exposed the person to a risk of the death or serious harm. The aggravated offence is punishable by up to twenty years’ imprisonment. Recollect, though, that Criminal Code offences relate to the smuggling of individuals into foreign countries. By contrast the Migration Act, which deals with smuggling into Australia, does not provide for the imposition of more severe penalties if the offences involve exploitation, cruel treatment or endangerment of smuggled persons. This may not be too great an omission since such conduct will usually involve prosecutable offences under the general criminal law. Nevertheless, the omission does lead one to wonder whether it is really the hapless irregular migrants’ plight or simply the protection of Australia’s borders which is foremost in the mind of Australian legislators responding to the phenomenon of people smuggling. These misgivings are only enhanced when one considers the manner in which Australia has dealt with human trafficking. The Protocol to Prevent Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Crime, has 130 states parties. Australia is one of those parties, but only joined in 14 October 2005, despite the fact that the treaty has been in force generally since 25 December 2003 (and that Australia did not have any difficulty becoming a party to the Smuggling Protocol in 2004 within months of that Protocol entering into force generally). The Trafficking Protocol defines “trafficking in persons” as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. ” It elaborates that “[e]xploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. ” Conduct falling within this definition truly is morally egregious. Division 271 Subdivision B of the Criminal Code implements Australia’s obligation under the Trafficking Protocol to criminalise human trafficking into or out of Australia. The use of force, threats or deception in procuring the entry into or exit from Australia by another person is punishable by up to twelve years’ imprisonment. Where there is intention to exploit the victim or the victim is subjected to cruel or inhuman treatment or exposed to a risk of death or serious harm in the course of the offence the penalty increases to up to twenty years imprisonment. Though few would complain about the severity of these trafficking penalties, it is to be hoped that the Australian public may start to question the political agendas (not to mention moral sensibilities) of legislators who think fit to equate people smuggling with human trafficking in criminal law and public discourse. • Savitri Taylor is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Law at La Trobe Universit...|$|E
40|$|Review Details Date: 16 June 2013 Author: Ann-Mari Jordens Book Details Title: Reluctant Rescuers Publisher: [URL] Date Published: 2012 Author/s: Tony Kevin THIS book, {{a sequel}} to his 2004 {{analysis}} of {{the sinking of the}} SIEV X, A Certain Maritime Incident, is one Tony Kevin hoped he would not have to write. It asks the same questions and employs the same fact-based inductive methods, drawing on referenced public sources, as his earlier book. This book, however, focuses on the sinking of four subsequent asylum boats—in October 2009, November and December 2010 and December 2011. Reluctant Rescuers is not about Australia’s asylum seeker reception and processing policies, nor is it a condemnation of the record and practice of Australian Customs and Border Protection Command’s (BPC) generally good record of achievements since 1998. It is, however, highly critical of the core assumptions and values of the border protection system’s self-generated culture. This, combined with government interference in the Navy’s safety of life at sea (SOLAS) obligations, he argues, has contributed to the deaths of approximately 900 asylum seekers who tried to reach Australia in small boats over the past 13 years. Over 24, 000 people (97 % of embarked asylum seekers) he points out, were safely detected and intercepted into Australian custody. The central question Kevin poses in this book is ‘how can Australia police unauthorised boat arrivals safely and ethically?’ Its paradoxical title, he explains, summarises its key themes—‘the oddity of a basically decent Australian border protection system, that generally protects safety of life at sea and rescues asylum seekers in actual or potential distress at sea… with efficiency and compassion—but that as a system refuses to acknowledge that this is what it does, or what it wants to do’. This book was inspired by the shipwreck of the SIEV 221 on Christmas Island, a tragedy that shocked Australian television viewers in December 2011. Kevin deduced much information on the failed processes that contributed to the deaths of 50 of that boat’s passengers from the only two of the four subsequent enquiries whose findings were open to the public. His forensic analysis of the available evidence inducts his reader as far as possible into this shadowy area of public policy. The procedural deficiencies he identifies stemmed from several practices. Practice of not naming naming boats heading for Australia with asylum seekers, created doubt about whether that boat really existed, and confusion in the system’s chain of command about its legal and ethical obligations according to Australia’s international safety of life at sea commitments. BPC interception of a Suspected <b>Irregular</b> <b>Entry</b> Vessel (SIEV), he observes, ‘only becomes a rescue-at-sea operation once BPC “declares” it to be’. Kevin argues that Australia’s obligations to protect human life are engaged from the time a boat leaves Indonesian territorial waters bound for Australia, not just when a BPC operational aircraft ship or aircrafts detects it to be in distress at sea and declares a SOLAS emergency. The effect of the excision of Australia’s offshore territories Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef from Australia’s migration zone since 2001, he believes, has led Customs and BPC to consider the location and interception of asylum seeker boats heading to these excised areas of lesser priority than those heading for mainland Australia. He fears that this could contribute to a perception that Australia’s rescue obligations for the people on these boats are reduced. Since this book was published. the entire Australian mainland has been excluded from the migration zone. One wonders what effect this will have on the safety of those who will inevitably try to make the longer journey to the Australian mainland. The Coalition’s professed ‘core policy’ of turning back asylum seeker boats to Indonesia when elected, Kevin fears, risks repeating the stress, and damage to solidarity and morale inflicted on the Navy by a similar attempt by the Howard government to turn back the 12 SIEVs intercepted during Operation Relex in 2001. The problem of protecting the safety of desperate people arriving irregularly in boats is not unique to Australia. Despite intensive NATO nations’ maritime surveillance, periodic unexplained disappearances of irregular boats occur in the Mediterranean, and between Haiti and the US, despite intensive US Coast Guard surveillance. ‘It appears that Australia is becoming part of a global process of moral desensitisation and brutalisation taking place on the maritime border zones of rich Western countries that are readily accessible by sea to asylum seekers travelling from or through adjacent poor countries’, Kevin concludes. He has published this book in the hope of promoting public discussion in Australia of the intelligence-based border protection system’s duty of care to human beings. • Ann-Mari Jordens is a Canberra-based writer...|$|E
