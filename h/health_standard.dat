50|$|Allegations of improprieties in the HSUeast branch {{were first}} {{publicly}} revealed in The Sydney Morning Herald on 9 September 2011.

The supplier, that produces ten issues of the union's newsletter, <b>Health</b> <b>Standard,</b> at a price estimated to be ten times the amount for similar productions, provided both Thomson and Williamson with credit cards that were used for personal expenses, such as private school fees. This was the first occasion that Williamson was implicated in any matter. The media report detailed that Williamson was a director of a computer company, United Edge, that provided information technology services to the HSUeast branch, without going to competitive tender. This decision was made while Williamson was general secretary of HSUeast.|$|E
50|$|The sexual {{exploitation}} {{of women and}} girls has dire, lifelong, consequences on their health. Some of these health risks include subjection to physical abuse and violence, poor reproductive health and health issues related to substance abuse (drugs are often used as a coping mechanism). Deaths arising from unsafe, illegal abortions and physical abuse and violence, have also become commonplace in this industry. In terms of reproductive health, children fare worse because they often lack the skills and ability to negotiate condom use and, thus are more vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS and Gonorrhea (a common STD among child prostitutes in the Philippines). It is reported that the prevalence of Gonorrhea was 18.6%. This dismal <b>health</b> <b>standard</b> of the individuals in the sex industry could impede them from attaining the highest possible level of physical, mental and social well-being and maximizing their potential.|$|E
