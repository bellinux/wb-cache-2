Kertész was not permitted to photograph outdoors or to have any project related to national security. Trying to avoid trouble because Elizabeth had started a cosmetics company (Cosmia Laboratories), Kertész ceased to do commissioned work and essentially disappeared from the photographic world for three years.|$|E

5|$|After the Aleutian Islands Campaign, a refit was {{undertaken}} at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. On 25 October, New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor to {{practice for the}} invasion of the Gilbert Islands. On 20 November, while the invasion was under way, she shelled Makin Atoll. During the <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islands the ship was tasked with guarding transports at night when they retreated from the islands, providing anti-aircraft fire for the unloading of supplies and troops, and providing screening fire for the aircraft carriers. After U.S. troops captured the Gilbert Islands on 5 December, New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the English Civil War Lady Drake {{was joined}} at her Devon home, Ash House in the parish of Musbury, by her fourth {{daughter}} Elizabeth Drake and her husband Winston Churchill (1620–1688), a Royalist cavalry captain. Unlike his mother-in-law who had supported the Parliamentary cause, Winston had the misfortune of <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> losing side of the war – for which he, like so many other Cavaliers, was forced to compound; in his case £446 18s. Although Winston had paid off the fine by 1651, it had impoverished him. From this episode may derive the Churchill family motto: Fiel Pero Desdichado ("Faithful but Unfortunate").|$|E

5|$|Between 1912 and 1918, Bulgaria became {{involved}} in three consecutive conflicts—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> losing side {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.|$|E
5|$|By 20 October, the <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The {{previous}} day, the Admiralstab {{had ordered}} the cessation of naval actions {{and the return of}} the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On 27 October, Friedrich der Grosse was detached from the Baltic and returned to the North Sea. Upon her return, she resumed guard duties. The ship participated in the fruitless advance to Norway on 23–25 April 1918. Afterward, she went into drydock for extensive maintenance, which lasted from 26 July to 28 September.|$|E

5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at {{the head}} of a party of 20men. They met little {{resistance}} from Chesapeakes crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only resistance from Chesapeake came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forecastle, being struck in the head with a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the war the 39th Battalion {{suffered}} 405 men killed, while a further 1,637 were wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Distinguished Service Orders (DSOs), one Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), 14 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs), 14 Military Crosses (MCs), 78 Military Medals (MMs) with three Bars, and 22 Mentions in Despatches (MIDs).

5|$|Earlier in the month, Stevens was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel and placed in substantive command of the battalion; he would subsequently lead them through to November 1916. Around this time, the units of the 1st Division, of which the 2nd Battalion was a part, {{became part of the}} larger I Anzac Corps, and in early March, this corps embarked for France– the 2nd Battalion leaving from Alexandria on the SS Ivernia– where they were {{to take part in the}} <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> European battlefield.|$|E

5|$|In 1758, Washington {{participated in}} the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a {{friendly}} fire episode in which his unit and another British unit each thought that {{the other was the}} French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington was not involved in any other major <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.|$|E
5|$|In August and September, {{the first}} {{screenshots}} of Duke Nukem Forever were released in PC Gamer. However, 3D Realms {{did not receive}} the Quake II engine code until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were mock-ups with the Quake engine that the team had made in their spare time. 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of Duke Nukem Forever using the Quake II engine at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The trailer showed Duke <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of a moving truck and firefights with aliens. While critics were impressed, Broussard was {{not happy with the}} progress being made.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, the women's {{movement}} was {{allied with the}} Labour party. In the U.S., Betty Friedan emerged from a radical background to take leadership. Radical Women is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active. During the Spanish Civil War, Dolores Ibárruri (La Pasionaria) led the Communist Party of Spain. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front and clashed with the anarcha-feminist Mujeres Libres.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} after World War I, Britain {{expanded}} Singapore Naval Base at Sembawang on Singapore's north coast {{as part of}} plans to deter Japanese expansionism in the region (the Singapore strategy). The resulting facility {{was among the most}} important in the British Empire and included the large King GeorgeVI graving dock and AdmiraltyIX floating dry dock. The Commonwealth forces allocated to Malaya and Singapore were swiftly defeated in the months after the outbreak of the Pacific War, however, and the island was surrendered to the Japanese on 15February 1942. Singapore was bombed by Japanese aircraft {{on a number of occasions}} during the Battle of Malaya and subsequent <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island itself; these raids caused many civilian deaths.|$|E
5|$|Incorporation into The Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{resulted}} in an economic, political and ethno-cultural unification of Belarusian lands. Of the principalities held by the Duchy, nine of them were settled by a population that would eventually become Belarusian people. During this time, the Duchy was involved in several military campaigns, including <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of Poland against the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410; the joint victory allowed the Duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Independent Maya {{frequently}} attacked Christianised Maya {{settlements and}} encouraged such settlements {{to abandon their}} new religion and resist the Spanish. As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with increasing frequency, independent Maya communities began to request the presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict. The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, as a buffer against Spanish encroachment; they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups that were already undergoing incorporation into the Spanish Empire. With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala, at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while <b>fighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E
