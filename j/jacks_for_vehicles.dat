50|$|Born in {{the small}} Washington city of Dayton, the seat of Columbia County, Hearn became an actor in his twenties, with a first known film credit listed in the 1915 short The Fool's Heart. His initial feature was Her Bitter Cup in 1916, the year during which he was seen in sixteen shorts and features. 1917 was equally {{prolific}} for him, providing seventeen appearances. As short films gave way to features, the number of his annual productions decreased (four in 1918, four in 1919 and five in 1920), but he continued to work steadily, with film credits in every year of his career. He was third-billed in Faith, the 1920 production starring Peggy Hyland with J. Parks Jones, and had a supporting role that year in the serial, Daredevil <b>Jack,</b> a <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> boxing champion <b>Jack</b> Dempsey.|$|R
