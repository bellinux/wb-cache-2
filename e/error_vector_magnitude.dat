The paper begins with a theoretical analysis of injection locking and pulling phenomena based on the discrete-time computation approach, and then develops the prin-ciples of the proposed receiver. The implemented prototype can cover a sensing bandwidth of 140 MHz at a central frequency of 2. 43 GHz and perform differential quadrature phase-shift keying and quadrature phase-shift keying demodulation with the best <b>error</b> <b>vector</b> <b>magnitudes</b> of 6. 6 % and 7. 9 %, respectively, both at a symbol rate of 2 Ms/s.

40|$|This paper proposes an optimum radio-over-fiber (RoF) {{system design}} {{to extend the}} {{coverage}} of the third-generation partnership program (3 GPP) long-term evolution (LTE) base station, i. e., eNodeB. The system is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated as the high-speed interface between eNodeB and a relay node. The LTE signals under test comprise three different modulation schemes, namely, quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK), 16 -quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM), and 64 -QAM, which are modulated onto orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) at 2. 6 GHz. The RoF system design is based on the distributed feedback (DFB) laser direct modulation and direct detection receiver. The spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) considering the third-order intermodulation analysis of the DFB laser achieved 1. 93 -dB dynamic range gain to improve the modulation efficiency. The practical investigation reveals three distinctive optical power transmission regions, namely, linear, intermixing, and nonlinear regions. The QPSK, 16 -QAM, and 64 -QAM systems in the intermixing region achieved <b>error</b> <b>vector</b> <b>magnitudes</b> (EVMs) of $sim$ 1. 144 %, $sim$ 1. 2 %, and $sim$ 1. 21 %, respectively, for 10 -km transmission, whereas at 60 km, the achieved EVMs are $sim$ 5. 86 %, $sim$ 5. 96 %, and $sim$ 6. 01 %, respectively. The intermixing region for the 10 – 60 -km transmission span achieved the most optimized EVM and within the 3 GPP LTE limit of 8 %.

40|$|Power Amplifiers (PAs) {{are the key}} {{building}} blocks of the emerging wireless radios systems. They dominate the power consumption and sources of distortion, especially when driven with modulated signals. Several approaches have been devised to characterize the nonlinearity of a PA. Among these approaches, dynamic amplitude (AM/AM) and phase (AM/PM) distortion characteristics are widely used to characterize the PA nonlinearity {{and its effects on}} the output signal in power, frequency or time domains, when driven with realistic modulated signals. The inherent nonlinear behaviour of PAs generally yield output signals with an unacceptable quality, an undesirable level of out-of-band emission, high <b>Error</b> <b>Vector</b> <b>Magnitudes</b> (EVMs) and low Adjacent Channel Power Ratios (ACPRs), which usually fail to meet the established performance standards. Traditionally, PAs are forced to operate deeply in their back-off region, far from their power capacity, in order to pass the mandatory spectrum mask (ACPR requirement) and to achieve acceptable EVM. Despite its simplicity, this solution is increasingly discarded, as it leads to cost and power inefficient radios. Alternatively, several linearization techniques, such as feedback, feed-forward and predistortion, have been devised to tackle PA nonlinearity and, consequently, improve the achievable the linearity versus power efficiency trade-off. Among these linearization techniques, the Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) technique consists of incorporating an extra nonlinear function before the PA, in order to preprocess the input signal to the PA, so that the overall cascaded systems behave linearly. The overall linearity of the cascaded system (DPD plus PA) relies primarily on the ability of the DPD function to produce nonlinearities that are equal in magnitude and out-of-phase to those generated by the PA. Hence, a good understanding and accurate modeling of PA distortions is a crucial step in the construction of an adequate DPD function. This thesis explores DPD through techniques based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The choice of ANN as a modeling tool was motivated by its proven strength in modeling dynamic nonlinear systems. This thesis starts by providing a summary of the PA nonlinearity problem background, as well as an overview of the most well-known linearization techniques, with a special focus on DPD techniques. The thesis then discusses ANN structures and the learning parameters. Finally, a novel Two Hidden Layers ANN (2 HLANN) model is suggested to predict the dynamic nonlinear behaviour of wideband PAs. An extensive validation of the 2 HLANN model demonstrates its excellent modeling accuracy and linearization capability...|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} {{access networks}} {{should be able}} to cultivate the ongoing evolution in services and applications. Advancements on that front are expected to exhibit the transformation of high definition television (HDTV) and 2 D services into ultra-HDTV and individual interactive 3 D services. Currently deployed passive optical networks (PONs) have been certified to be able to deliver high quality video and internet services while in parallel broadband wireless standards are increasing their spectral efficiency and subscriber utilisation. Exploiting the benefits of both by providing an integrated infrastructure benefiting from the wireless mobility and ease of scalability and escalating bandwidth of next generation PONs are expected to offer service providers the business models justifying the evolved services. In this direction, this thesis deals with the means of transparent routing of standard worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) signal formats over legacy PONs to and from wireless end users based on radio over fibre (RoF). The concept of frequency division multiplexing (FDM) with RoF is used for efficient addressing of individual base stations, bandwidth on-demand provisioning across a cell/sector, simple remote radio heads and no interference with the baseband PON spectrum. Network performance evaluation, initially through simulation, has displayed, in the presence of optical non-linearites and multi-path wireless channels, standard <b>error</b> <b>vector</b> <b>magnitudes</b> (EVMs) at remote radio receivers and bit error rates (BERs) of 1 E- 4 for typical WiMAX rates bidirectionally. To provide enhanced scalability and dynamicity, a newly applied scheme based on extended wavelength band overlay over the splitter, wireless-enabled PONs has been progressively investigated. This allows for the routing of multiple FDM windows to different wavelengths resulting in significantly reduced optical and electrical component costs and no dispersion compensation over the fibre. This has been implemented through the application of a dense array wave guide grating (AWG) and tuneable filter in the optical line terminal (OLT) and optical network unit/base stations (ONU/BSs) respectively. Although {{with the use of a}} splitter the distribution point of the optical network remains largely the same, vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays provide colourless upstream transmission. In addition, an overlapping cell concept is developed and adopted for increased wireless spectral efficiency and resilience. Finally, an experimental test-bed using commercially available WiMAX transceivers was produced, which enabled repetition of the simulation outcomes and therefore confirmed the overall network performance.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the usefulness of dynamic continuous on-line vectorcardiography for monitoring the occurrence of myocardial ischaemia during carotid endarterectomy. Methods. We studied 21 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Patients underwent general anaesthesia with iso¯urane or sevo¯urane. The vectorcardiogram was monitored con-tinuously during carotid endarterectomy. Electrodes were placed according to the previously described lead system and connected to a computerized system for on-line vectorcardio-graphy. Two trend variables were recorded: the QRS vector difference, which re¯ects changes in the shape of the QRS complex; and the ST <b>vector</b> <b>magnitude,</b> which represents de¯ection of the ST segment from the isoelectric level. The ST segment de¯ection was measured 60 ms after termination of the QRS complex. Results. Vectorcardiography was successfully recorded in all 21 patients. Three patients showed intraoperative vectorcardiogram abnormalities. In one of these three patients, both ST <b>vector</b> <b>magnitude</b> and QRS <b>vector</b> difference increased after induction of anaesthesia and ST <b>vector</b> <b>magnitude</b> returned to baseline after administration of nitroglycerin.
