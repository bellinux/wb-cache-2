50|$|Organotin(II) {{compounds}} <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> rare. Compounds {{with the}} empirical formula SnR2 <b>are</b> <b>somewhat</b> fragile and exist as rings or polymers when R is not bulky. The polymers, called polystannanes, have the formula (SnR2)n.|$|R

5|$|The European species Mycena viridimarginata <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> {{similar to}} M.intersecta in appearance, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its greenish-edged gills, cheilocystidia with abruptly tapering points, and clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} soil in Leonard Harrison State Park <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> excessively drained Oquaga channery loam, {{which is}} often associated with well drained Lordstown channery loam. Much of the campground near the eastern boundary is supported by Morris gravelly silt loam, which <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> poorly drained due to a subsoil fragipan. The Oquaga tends to be very strongly acidic (pH 4.8), Morris is strongly acidic (pH 5.3) and Lordstown is moderately acidic (pH 5.5). All of these soils belong to the Inceptisol soil order.|$|E

5|$|In both localities, B.epica occurs among heath on cliff-top dunes of deep, white {{siliceous}} sand over limestone. It co-occurs with B.media in both localities, and B.praemorsa is {{also present}} at Point Culver. Toolinna Cove sand <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> alkaline, making B.epica and B.media the only Banksia species that grow in alkaline soil.|$|E
5|$|Little else {{is known}} about his childhood, {{although}} there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. Rémy — a tradition which <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> undermined {{by the fact that the}} latter disappears from the historical record after 1504, when the child was only one year old.|$|E

With those individuals, such as Mahone, unavailable; Michael is forced to turn to Bagwell himself for assistance.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius subconiatus, {{known from}} Sri Lanka and Indonesia, <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> similar to M.sasicola.

5|$|Nobelium's {{complexing}} ability with chloride ions is most {{similar to}} that of barium, which complexes rather weakly. Its complexing ability with citrate, oxalate, and acetate in an aqueous solution of 0.5Mammonium nitrate is between that of calcium and strontium, although it <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> closer to that of strontium.|$|E

5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas <b>is</b> <b>somewhat</b> depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E
