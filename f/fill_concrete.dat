40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter is to {{transmit}} {{an evaluation of the}} potential for seismically induced liquefaction of engineered fill and saprolite soils that provide foundation support to seismic Category II and non-seismic power block structures at the William States Lee III Nuclear Site. The evaluation is provided as Enclosure 1. The information provided in Enclosure 1 describes the methodologies, results, and conclusions from the analyses of the potential for seismically induced liquefaction of engineered fill and saprolite soils. The evaluation examines the foundation support zones for the Unit 1 non-seismic radwaste building and seismic Category II annex building; and the Unit 2 non-seismic radwaste building, seismic Category II annex building, and non-seismic turbine building. These structures are founded on or over compacted engineered fill over partially weathered/continuous rock, compacted engineered fill over <b>fill</b> <b>concrete</b> and partially weathered/continuous rock, or engineered fill over saprolite soils overlying partially weathered/continuous rock. The non-seismic turbine building for Unit 1 is founded on <b>fill</b> <b>concrete</b> over rock, neither of which is susceptible to liquefaction. The evaluation provided in Enclosure 1 demonstrates that the liquefaction susceptibility for the engineered fill and saprolite soils beneath the radwaste, annex, and turbine buildings is negligible. Therefore, adequate protection is provided to ensure that the radwaste building, annex building, and turbine building structures will not adversely affect the function of www. duke-energy. com,- (_ Document Control Des...|$|E
40|$|Information (RAI) 02. 05. 01 - 047 {{regarding}} {{geological mapping}} of the Lee Nuclear Station (Lee) site. As {{described in this}} response, geologic mapping of rock surfaces was conducted as part of construction activities for the former Cherokee Nuclear Station (Cherokee). Extensive mapping of rock surfaces exposed during Cherokee Units 1 through 3 construction activities was performed at two levels. The first level of geologic mapping consisted of geologic mapping of the top-of-rock surface (after stripping of overburden and before blasting). Top of rock geologic mapping was conducted for Cherokee Units 1 through 3 (1 : 240 scale). The second level of geologic mapping was performed after completion of blasting, removal of rock debris, and cleaning of the exposed foundation-level rock surface. This final excavation (top-of-foundation) mapping was conducted for all of Cherokee Unit 1, and {{for a portion of}} Cherokee Unit 2 (1 : 120 scale). For convenience, Figures 1 and 2 from the Duke Energy response to RAI 02. 05. 01 - 047 are included as Enclosure 1, and illustrate the areas mapped. Following detailed mapping, the Cherokee Unit 1 foundation-level rock was subsequently covered with <b>fill</b> <b>concrete,</b> and then by structural concrete slabs and walls...|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} the architectural and structural drawings and calculations for renovation of and addition to Old Tarble {{for use as}} a special collections library. Old Tarble is an existing building on the campus of Swarthmore College that has seen little use since {{a large portion of the}} structure burned down in 1983. The proposed special collections library would hold many books and manuscripts that currently reside within the McCabe Library Building, including items from the Friends Historical Library, the Peace Collection and the Treasure Room. Design of the addition and analysis of the existing structure was based on the 2003 International Building Code (IBC 2003) using Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD). In compliance with IBC 2003, wind and seismic loadings were calculated according to the specifications laid forth in ASCE 7 - 02 After completion of the architectural design, we entertained two structural design options: steel and concrete. The steel design included a one way joist and girder floor system with metal decking and concrete <b>fill.</b> <b>Concrete</b> design consisted of a two-way flat slab floor system. Whereas the steel design is more economical, the concrete design will provide more fire protection for the rare books, which the library is intended to house. In each case, the roof truss system was designed using steel W-sections and the substructure was composed of cast-in-place reinforced concrete footings and slab on grade...|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} a numerical analysis method for appropriately evaluating load-carrying {{capacity of the}} partially concrete-filled steel-pipe pier models, four partially concrete-filled steel-pipe piers taking height of <b>filled</b> <b>concrete</b> as variable, were analyzed by means of three-dimensional elasto-plastic finite element method.

40|$|Abstract. For typical tubular T-joint, {{the common}} failure {{generally}} occurs near the weld toe on the chord surface {{due to the}} fact that the stiffness of the chord in radial direction is much smaller than that of the brace in axial direction. In this paper, the static strength of tubular T-joints is improved by <b>filling</b> <b>concrete</b> into the chord. The finite element method is used to investigate the improving effeciency of the static strength for tubular T-joints with <b>filling</b> <b>concrete</b> in the chord under axial compression and tension. Firstly, 6 T-joint models were analyzed to prove that <b>filling</b> <b>concrete</b> in the chord is effective to increase the static strength and the stiffness of T-joints with hollow section. Afterwards, based on the analyzing mechanism for CFCT T-joint under axial compression and tension, the different performances under axial compression and tension between circle hollow tubular T-joint and CFCT T-joint were clarified, and the different failure modes for tubular T-joints with hollow section and CFCT T-joints were compared and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Since 1984, the {{coal-fired}} {{plant at}} the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC, formerly Idaho Chemical Processing Plant) has been generating fly ash {{at a rate}} of approximately 1, 000 tons per year. This ash is hydrated and placed in an ash bury pit near the coal-fired plant. The existing ash bury pit will be full in less than 1 year at its present rate of use. A conceptual design to build a new ash bury pit was completed, and the new pit is estimated to cost $ 1. 7 million. This report evaluates ash reutilization alternatives that propose to eliminate this waste stream and save the $ 1. 7 million required to build a new pit. The alternatives include using ash for landfill day cover, concrete admixture, flowable fill, soil stabilization, waste remediation, and carbon recovery technology. Both physical and chemical testing, under the guidance of the American Society for Testing and Materials, have been performed on ash from the existing pit and from different steps within the facility`s processes. The test results have been evaluated, compared to commercial ash, and are discussed as they relate to reutilization alternatives. This study recommends that the ash be used in flowable <b>fill</b> <b>concrete</b> for Deactivation and Demolition work at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory...|$|E
40|$|The unique stylistic particularity of {{the novel}} as a {{literary}} form {{is that it is}} the presentation of the speaking human and his words (Bakhtine, 1978). The speaker in a novel is an exponent of a specific ideology and his words serve to express this ideology. For all its ideological components, the novel's dialogues form the characteristic feature of the narrative gender. The characters <b>fill</b> <b>concrete</b> social roles and they speak from within the limits of those roles, their speech emerging from different social languages. Prosper Merimee's short story, Arsene Guillot (1927 : 85 - 145), offers an ensemble of character's constrained voices, of speakers imprisoned by their own social positions. The novel is developed as a sequence of carnivalesque reversals. Paradoxically, the text establishes a prostitute as an admirable figure (Arsene Guillot) and deposits a pious French bourgeoise from her social acknowledgements. Philippe Hamon, in his book Texte et Ideologie (1984), presents a theory of the semiotic of character's normative knowledge. This factorisation of the ideology notion, in separated normative elements, form a group of knowledges composing the text's ideology-effect. With the assistance of the critical concepts of speech universe, power and position struggle, discourse insignia and speaker's desire of fulfillment elaborated by Francois Flahault (1978), we apply the ideas of Hamon to the non-exclusive study of the dialogues in Arsene Guillot. Our pragmatic analysis emphasizes on how the dialogue contributes to the construction {{of the novel}}'s ideology-effect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Concrete</b> <b>Filled</b> Steel Tube(CFST) {{is widely}} used in civil {{engineering}} structures because of its superior mechanical performance. Yet the mechanical behavior of CFST is highly depended on the construction quality of the <b>filled</b> <b>concrete.</b> Hence {{it is very important}} for the inspection of the construction quality of the <b>filled</b> <b>concrete</b> in CFST structures. In this paper, the ultrasonic testing technique was used to detect the defect of the <b>filled</b> <b>concrete</b> of a CFST arch bridge. During the inspection, the ultrasonic transducer was moved along the circumference of the cross-section of the arch, and the defect of the concrete was comprehensively judged by detecting the change of sonic time, sonic amplitude and sonic frequency. Based on the analysis of the ultrasonic transmission path, the influences of different defects on the sonic time, sonic amplitude and sonic frequency were discussed. The detecting results were verified by core-drilling method. The verification showed that different kinds of defects defected by ultrasonic testing was in good accordance with the drilling samples, which demonstrates the adaptability of the ultrasonic detection technique in the construction quality inspection of CFST structures...|$|R

In addition, these tests aims at understanding the behavior of short columns with lightweight concrete.

Fifteen specimens for each type were tested under axial compression. Additional five specimens <b>filled</b> with ordinary <b>concrete</b> and five bare steel sections were also tested and results were compared to those of lightweight <b>concrete</b> <b>filled</b> sections. The test results of this study show that lightweight <b>concrete</b> <b>filled</b> specimens were capable of reaching the ultimate predicted loads in accordance with BS 5400, EC 4 and LRFD. On the other hand, foamed <b>concrete</b> <b>filled</b> specimens developed the ultimate axial capacity and significantly enchase the strength of bare steel section.

Based on the analysis of existing experimental data, the formula of ultimate bearing capacity of FRP-confined <b>concrete</b> <b>filled</b> steel tube is proposed. The mechanical behavior of FRP-confined <b>concrete</b> <b>filled</b> steel tube is mainly related to the equivalent confinement effect coefficient before the rupture of FRP.

A {{series of tests}} was conducted to study the behavior of short composite columns under axial compressive load; the cross section dimensions were 100 × 70 × 2 [*]mm. A total of 20 stubs have been tested, as follows: 4 hollow thin welded tubes were tested to axial and eccentric load compression, 4 were <b>filled</b> with ordinary <b>concrete</b> appointed by BO columns, 6 were <b>filled</b> with <b>concrete</b> whose natural sand was completely substituted by a crystallized sand slag designated in this paper by BSI, and 6 were tucked in concrete whose natural sand was partially replaced by a crystallized sand slag called BSII. The main parameters studied are {{the height of the}} specimen (300 [*]mm– 500 [*]mm), eccentricity of load and type of <b>filling</b> <b>concrete.</b> Based on test results obtained, it is confirmed that the length of the tubes has a considerable effect on the bearing capacity and the failure mode. In all test tubes, fracture occurred by the convex local buckling of steel section due to the outward thrust of the concrete; it was observed that the sand concrete improves the bearing capacity of tubes compounds compared to those <b>filled</b> with ordinary <b>concrete...</b>|$|R
