40|$|Clean air {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} needed by yarn companies. This factor {{influences}} the quality of yarn, clean air helps produce good quality of yarn. On the other hand, recently many of yarn companies do not consider that factor as important and that can cause several problems. 	This research is conducted at a yarn company named PT Kusumaputra Santosa located at Jl. Raya Jaten Km 9, Karanganyar. The air around ring frame machine is dusty and that causes the surfaces of yarn produced by this machine defected (not aligned). The defect product must be cut at the finishing work center; this prolongs production processes, creating a bottleneck at this work center. Finally the main problem is that the real production does not reach the production target (late of production) that causes profit loss. The root problem is the <b>dust</b> cleaner <b>machine</b> cannot absorb <b>dust</b> optimally, because lack of hole at exhaust arm. 	Based on those problems, this research tries to propose a design improvement of <b>dust</b> cleaner <b>machine</b> by adding 10 exhaust holes at exhaust arm, to maximize the ability of absorbing dust in the air, in order to help PT. Kusumaputra Santosa clean the air condition in the spinning work center. The research employs Rational Method developed by Cross, 1994, to appropriate the design of <b>dust</b> cleaner <b>machine.</b> The research also employs Gravimetric Method to measure the level of dust in the air. There are literature reviews about the product design and improvement methods to help make a good design. 	Finally, with the design improvement, the <b>dust</b> cleaner <b>machine</b> can reduce the dust level in the air from 0. 91 mg/m 3 to 0. 52 mg/m 3, so there will be decreasing the defect product, reduce the number cut and join done by winding machine from 10. 3 /spindle to 7. 8 /spindle, fast production process, no bottleneck, so that the production rate is increase from 0. 38 bale/day to 0. 447 bale/day for yarn type 32 CD, and then increase from 0. 25 bale/day to 0. 3 bale/day for yarn type 30 CD...|$|R

It assumes monitoring of a real natural environment in which motes or smart <b>dust</b> <b>machines</b> swarm in collective and coordinate information among themselves and/or to a backend control platform. In analog mixed signal field work on such devices is gaining momentum such that it is conceived {{to be one of}} the emerging fields in technology, and work was only possible once the technology for fabrication touched the nanoscale regions. Smart dust network involves remote devices connected in a hive sensing burst type datum signals from the environment and relaying information amongst themselves in an energy efficient manner to coordinate an appropriate response to a detected stimulus. The project presumed a RF based communication strategy for coordination amongst the devices through a wireless medium. That is less susceptible to stringent requirements of LOS and a base band processing system that comprised of an environment sensor, an AFE module, an ADC, a DSP and a DAC. Essentially a 10 bit, 2 Mega Hertz MHz pipelined ADC implemented in a STM 65 nm technology. The ADC benefits the smart dust device in allowing it to process data in an energy efficient way and also focusing on reduced complexity as itsdesign feature. While it differs in the other ADC of the system by operating at a higher frequency and assuming a different design philosophy assuming a coherent system sensitive to a clock. The thesis work assumes that various features ofenergy harvesting, regulation and power management present in the smart dustmote would enable the system to contain such a diverse ADC. The ADCs output digital datum would be compatible to the rest of the design modules consisting mainly of DSP sections. The ADC novelty is based on the fact that it removes the necessity of employing a high power consuming OpAmp whose design parameters become more complex as technology scales to the nanoscale era and further down. A systematic, bottom up, test driven approach to design is utilized and various behaviours of the system are captured in Cadence design environment with verilogto layout models and MATLAB and Simulink models...|$|R

40|$|Samples of {{wood dust}} were {{collected}} in the working environment of wood machining processes {{for the purpose of}} determining correction factors for measuring mass concentration of wood dust by photometric method. According to the NIOSH 0600 Norm and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods for photometric measurement, correction factor must be determined before measuring mass concentration of different types of dust. The correction factor is defined as the ratio of mass concentration obtained by the gravimetric method and mass concentration obtained by the photometric method. The correction factor should be determined because of the influence of particle size distribution, density, particle shape and refractive index on values obtained by the photometric method. The aim of the research was to investigate the possibility of using photometric method for the determination of mass concentration of inhalable fraction of airborne wood dust. Sampling was conducted in several woodworking plants during the machining of wet and dry beech-wood, wet and dry oak-wood, wet fir-wood and particleboard. There is a significant correlation between the results obtained by the photometric method and values obtained by the gravimetric method (R 2 = 0. 88) and this is the base for using the photometric method in determining mass concentration of airborne wood dust. According to the results of this research, correction factors must be determined and used for measuring mass concentration of inhalable wood <b>dust</b> during the <b>machining</b> of different wood species and wood with different moisture content. The best corresponding results of photometric and gravimetric methods are obtained for the samples collected during machining of wet fir-wood (k= 1).

Only the results of 8 -hour measurements of mass concentration by gravimetric methods can be compared with limit values of aerosol mass concentration. However, the determination of mass concentration of wood dust by photometric method may be applied not only for short-term exposure measurements but also for additional measurements within the analysis of exposure time profile at workplaces during the working day.

40|$|Among the {{industrial}} sectors that {{are affected by}} dust explosions, the metal working industry {{is one of the}} most frequently involved. Metal dusts are often the by-products of mechanical workings. <b>Dust</b> producing <b>machines</b> are widely distributed, small in size and are generally located in workplaces. Abatement plants are also often located in the working area. The companies that are involved in these explosions are often small, and thus often have limited resources. These factors generally lead to difficulties in managing the risk of explosions. This paper has the aim of investigating the flammability of waste dust produced by metal workings, and to define the dust properties that are more likely to lead to an explosion. For this purpose, a simple and fast flammability test has been used as a cheap way of characterise the flammability of the samples. The test has been called the Speedy Esplosibility Test (SET), and it is similar to the procedure suggested in the new ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 2016) that came into force recently. SET is composed of 4 different tests, derived from standard procedures, each of which represents a different ignition mechanism: • High voltage continuous arc ignition and glowing wire ignition in a Hartman 1. 2 l tube (based on UNI EN 13821 : 2004); • Dust cloud ignition in a G-G furnace and dust layer ignition on a hot plate (based on UNI EN 50281 : 1999).

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 As every {{manufacturer}} of carbon-fiber composite structures knows, {{one of the}} most nettlesome aspects of the production process is that machining, drilling and sanding of carbon fiber composites produces fine dust. These composite materials typically consist of epoxy matrix material reinforced with carbon, graphite, glass, and/or para-aramid fibers. Matrix materials are usually epoxy, polyester, phenolic, fluorocarbon, polyether-sulfone, and silicon. The most commonly used are epoxies and polyesters, which are less expensive than epoxies. It can build up on and short out computers, control panels and servomotors. In the air, it can be inhaled and threaten human health. Further, the accumulation of any dust in a manufacturing facility can be problematic from the regulatory perspective. In fact, dust has been blamed for several explosions in manufacturing facilities, leading the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Admin. (OSHA) and many local governments to more closely monitor and regulate dust accumulation in all manufacturing environments. An increase in human exposure to potentially toxic airborne fibers has accompanied the increased use of composite materials. The dust emitted during the machining of composite materials is potentially damaging to the human lung. Several studies have attempted to characterize the damage to the lung caused by airborne particles from composites, while other studies have characterized the size and concentration of the dust emitted. Some {{studies have shown that the}} chip formation process affects the size distribution of the particles emitted during the machining of composites. Health hazard evaluation of composite matrix material is usually conducted by examining the individual materials that are in the resin system and using sound scientific judgment. The main objective of this research is to quantify the amount of <b>dust</b> generated during <b>machining</b> (predominantly milling) of composites and to calculate what percentage of this dust is harmful to the workers in such composite dust laden environments. This criteria is based on PM (Particulate matter) aerosol standards defined by OSHA in regard to safety and well-being. In addition this research will also highlight the effect of stacking sequence of laminates on the concentration of dust generated and the characterization of these particle sizes. This research also further aims to develop optimized cutting conditions that will help in reducing the amount of dust that would be generated by using an experimental study. During this study different tests were carried out to characterize the different effects that are observed during the machining of Uni-Directional and random fiber composites. The <b>machining</b> <b>dust</b> results showed a very good correlation between the different real time measuring instruments and validated the design of the iso-kinetic sampling tower. Mean aerodynamic diameters of particles found during the machining of Uni-Directional composites was 0. 19 um and that of random fiber composites was found to be 0. 28 um. Tests to find out the optimal cutting conditions for the lowest amount of dust generated was found to be that of using a low cutting speed, high feed and lower depth of cuts.

40|$|This {{document}} represents {{more than}} ten years of collaborative research by labor, industry, and government to reduce respirable crystalline silica exposure during asphalt pavement milling in highway construction. The collaborative research began when the Silica/Asphalt Milling Machine Partnership was formed at the 2003 National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA) Annual Meeting, and studies on milling <b>machine</b> <b>dust</b> controls began later that year. The Silica/Asphalt Milling Machine Partnership is coordinated by NAPA and includes all U. S. and foreign manufacturers of heavy construction equipment that currently sell pavement-milling machines to the U. S. market. In addition to NAPA and the equipment manufacturers, the Silica/Asphalt Milling Machine Partnership includes numerous paving contractors, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Laborers International Union of North America, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, and government organizations including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Federal Highway Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Based on the research of the Silica/Asphalt Milling Machine Partnership, NIOSH recommend engineering controls that include ventilation controls in addition to water-sprays used to cool the cutting teeth. Milling machines that adopt this well-designed dust control approach have been shown to control worker exposures to respirable crystalline silica from asphalt milling operations during 21 days of personal breathing zone sampling at 11 different highway construction sites [NIOSH 2013 b,c]. The 42 personal breathing zone air sampling results (21 days with 2 workers per day) were all below the NIOSH recommended exposure limit of 0. 05 mg/m 3 for respirable crystalline silica ranging from below the limit of detection up to 0. 024 mg/m 3. NIOSH and the Silica/Asphalt Milling Machine Partnership recommend ventilation controls be placed on all new half-lane and larger asphalt milling machines to reduce worker exposure to respirable crystalline silica. It is also recommended that water-sprays be used to suppress <b>dust</b> on milling <b>machines</b> if ventilation <b>dust</b> controls are not available. The ventilation and water-spray dust controls described in this document represent the current knowledge of best practices developed by the Silica/Asphalt Milling Machine Partnership for controlling dust during asphalt pavement milling. This document should not limit manufacturers from implementing future improvements in dust control as new technologies or inventions become available. Manufacturers can use the procedures in Appendices A and B of this document to evaluate current and future dust controls. Appendix D is not included in the posted PDF version of this report.

40|$|Machine vision systems {{often have}} to work with cameras that become dusty during use. Dust {{particles}} produce image artifacts that can affect the performance of a machine vision algorithm. Modeling these artifacts allows us to add them to test images to characterize an algorithm's sensitivity to dust and help develop counter measures. This paper presents an optics-based model that simulates the size and optical density of image artifacts produced by dust particles. For dust particles smaller than the aperture area the image artifact size is determined {{by the size of the}} lens aperture and not the size of the particle, while the artifact’s optical density is determined by the ratio of the particle and aperture areas. We show how the model has been used to evaluate the effect of <b>dust</b> on two <b>machine</b> vision algorithms used on the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers. 1. DUST ARTIFACTS IN IMAGES In the pinhole camera models used in machine vision exactly one ray of light from a point in object space will pass through the camera's pinhole to strike the image plane. With a real lens however, light from a point in object space is collected from a solid angle of rays and projected through the lens onto the image plane, as illustrated in Fig 1. The extent of this solid angle of rays is limited by the lens elements and by the diameter of any diaphragms along the optical path. The limiting diaphragm is called the aperture stop of the lens. The entrance pupil of the lens is the image of the aperture stop as it would be seen if viewed from an axial position in front of the lens. To model the effect of dust on an image we follow the path of light collected by the lens for a single pixel and consider how dust particles on the lens affect the light reaching the pixel...|$|R
40|$|Dust is {{commonly}} found in fusion devices. Though generally of no concern in the present day <b>machines,</b> <b>dust</b> may pose serious safety and operational concerns for ITER. Micron-size dust usually dominates the samples collected from tokamaks. During a plasma discharge micron-size dust particles can become highly mobile and travel over distances of a few meters. Once inside the plasma, dust particles heat up to over 3000 K and emit thermal radiation that can be detected by visible imaging techniques. Observations of naturally occurring and artificially introduced dusts have been performed in DIII-D divertor and scrape-off layer (SOL) using standard frame rate CMOS cameras, a gated-intensified CID camera, and a fast-framing CMOS camera. In the first 2 - 3 plasma discharges after a vent with personnel entry inside the vacuum vessel ('dirty vent') dust levels were quite high with thousands of particles observed in each discharge. Individual particles moving at velocities of up to a few hundred m/s and breakup of larger particles into pieces were observed. After about 15 discharges dust was virtually gone during the stationary portion of a discharge, and appeared at much reduced levels during the plasma initiation and termination phases. After {{a few days of}} plasma operations (about 70 discharges) dust levels were further reduced to just a few observed events per discharge except in discharges with current disruptions that produced significant amounts of dust. An injection of a few milligram of micron-size (6 micron median diameter) carbon dust into a high-power lower single-null ELMing H-mode discharge with strike points swept across the lower divertor floor was performed. A significant increase of the core carbon radiation was observed for about 250 ms after the injection, as the total radiated power increased twofold. Dust particles from the injection were observed by the fast framing camera in the outboard SOL near the midplane. The amount of dust observed by the fast camera immediately after the injection wa...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{microbiology}} {{of the air}} of byres and bruising sheds and of hay, {{grain and}} <b>dust</b> from bruising <b>machines</b> was studied in 12 dairy farms in Ayrshire and one in Perthshire. Seven farms (FLD) had a known case of farmer's lung disease and five farms (non-FLD) were free from the disease. Concentrations of mesophilic organisms and of thermotolerant and thermophilic fungi did not vary significantly between {{the two types of}} farm but the concentrations of thermophilic actinomycetes and bacteria, notably Micropolyspora faeni, were higher in general on FLD farms. Culture filtrate and mycelial extracts of the most commonly isolated organisms were tested against three groups of sera (11 from patients with farmer's lung disease, 14 from healthy personnel on FLD farms and 13 from personnel without farmer's lung disease on non-FLD farms). Only extracts from a Penicillium sp. and a Streptomyces sp. precipitated with a number of sera, when extracts from the 12 most commonly isolated fungi, from six thermophilic actinomycetes other than M. faeni and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, and from two thermophilic bacteria were tested. There was no correlation between disease and seropositivity. All sera reacted to at least one of 60 carbol-saline and trichloracetic acid extracts from 30 samples of hay, grain and dust. Although sera from personnel on both FLD and non-FLD farms precipitated with 16 % and 19 % of these extracts respectively, reactivity to extracts from FLD farms was greater on average than to those from non-FLD farms. When tested by several serological methods against extracts of a type culture of M. faeni and by double diffusion against farmer's lung hay (FLH) and extracts of local isolates of M. faeni, 91 % of all clinical cases of farmer's lung were serologically positive but no one test was adequate for determining sensitisation. Fifty-four per cent of sera from FLD and also from non-FLD farms were positive in at least one test. Sixty-nine per cent of seropositive personnel on FLD farms were also symptomatic. The occurrence of symptoms apparently correlated with the higher concentrations of M. faeni encountered on FLD farms...|$|R
