40|$|Although {{economists have}} {{analyzed}} earnings, unemployment, and labor force participation {{for those with}} bipolar illness, occupational choice {{has yet to be}} explored. Psychological and medical studies often suggest an association between bipolar illness and creative achievement, but they tend to focus on eminent <b>figures,</b> <b>case</b> studies, or small samples. We seek to examine occupational creativity of non-eminent individuals with bipolar disorder. We use Epidemiologic Catchment Area data to estimate a multinomial logit model matched to an index of occupational creativity. Those with bipolar illness appear to be disproportionately concentrated in the most creative occupational category. Nonparametric kernel density estimates reveal that the densities of the occupational creativity variable for the bipolar and non-bipolar individuals significantly differ in the ECA data, and suggest that the probability of engaging in creative activities on the job is higher for bipolar than non-bipolar workers.

40|$|We investigate, in any spacetime {{dimension}} >= 3, {{the problem}} of consistent couplings for a finite collection of massless, spin- 2 fields described, in the free limit, by a sum of Pauli-Fierz actions. We {{show that there is}} no consistent (ghost-free) coupling, with at most two derivatives of the fields, that can mix the various "gravitons". In other words, there are no Yang-Mills-like spin- 2 theories. The only possible deformations are given by a sum of individual Einstein-Hilbert actions. The impossibility of cross-couplings subsists in the presence of scalar matter. Our approach is based on the BRST-based deformation point of view and uses results on the so-called "characteristic cohomology" for massless spin- 2 fields which are explained in detail.

A corollary of Theorem 1. 1 deals with the equivalence of the two-sided estimates on the modulus of continuity on one hand, and on {{the tail of the}} Fourier transform, on the other (Corollary 1. 5).
