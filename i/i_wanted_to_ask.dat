2500|$|In 1994, Joe Little {{was due to}} co-present an {{edition of}} the {{programme}} from the RTÉ studio in Castlebar, County Mayo, during the European Parliament election of that year, when it was realised belatedly {{that it could not}} be heard in Dublin. Disaster was prevented by mere minutes. When the IRA announced its cease-fire that same year, Joe Little was in the Belfast studio beginning an interview with the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when the sound broke down live on air on a temporary basis. During one edition, the entire programme did malfunction, and, with interviews suspended and a commercial break impossible, Hanly intervened to prevent a complete disaster for several minutes by commenting to the show's previous guest: [...] "There was one other question <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you [...] ". Joe Little interviewed Lady Valerie Goulding to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of The Blitz of London by Germany.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! You think so? When I saw you I didn't {{know why}} you were here. I was glad when you spoke to me because {{this is exactly what}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you for. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you if you ever meet Captain Anthony--by any chance--anywhere--you are a sailor too, are you not?--that you, would never mention--never--that--that you had seen me over there." ...|$|E
60|$|COKESON. But we don't {{want to be}} unreasonable. He's quite downhearted. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to let him {{run about}} with the others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is Jonathan?" [...] Helen asked presently. [...] "Something {{happened}} at Metzar's yesterday. Papa wouldn't tell me, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Jonathan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jimmy, I've been {{thinking}} it over. There's something <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you. Do you {{admit that you}} behaved abominably five years ago?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I--er--no, thank you. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you a question. What is your candid {{opinion of}} those verses Mr Wells was reading just now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] {{said the}} deep voice indifferently. [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> was, if {{anything}} had been heard of Fanny Robin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for Captain Houghton,' said Alice, glad to {{lead the}} {{conversation}} away from revelations of which she had an instinctive dread.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Jenney said {{something}} else that--that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you about," [...] she went on, breathing more deeply. [...] "It {{was about the}} railroad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a little}} favor <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of you, Ormesby, but I suppose {{you are all}} in one another's confidence?" [...] said Boone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am a man}} again," [...] Julian declared. [...] "Come along {{round to}} Westminster. There are many things <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> about the Executive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been here}} {{two or three}} days. Well, it's a bit of luck {{catching}} you. You see, what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your advice about...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I'm {{going down}} home pretty early, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your mother {{what is the}} best way to put away my winter things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubted if my step-father {{would bring}} me, but I really meant to come," [...] she said. [...] "For one thing, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{two o'clock}} the Vicar {{hurried into the}} bank. 'Good morning, Mr. Goldsmith, I beg your pardon; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> if Mr. O'More has seen little Maurice Kendal.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Girl, girl, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of you What can grow, grow without rain? What {{can burn}} and never end? What can yearn, cry without tears? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Professor {{spoke up}} like a man," [...] she agreed, [...] "but, Laura, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you something. Did you notice his servant--that man Craig?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some time <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{your advice}} {{about a little}} matter, Mr. Tracy. You see, I've got that young lord's remaims--my goodness, how you jump!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is she gone?' said Mr. Kendal, who {{had been}} musing after his last words. 'Gone to tell her friend, I suppose? <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what this scene was.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been working}} here {{nearly two years}} now under you. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{you to tell me}} frankly if you think it worth while for me to continue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No? You {{are busy}} as ever? <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you about Lee. I {{was sorry to}} hear that there was a rumour that {{something}} was amiss with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But for all that," [...] {{continued}} the lawyer, [...] "there's one point <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> ask: <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{the name of}} that man who walked over the child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed!" [...] exclaimed Patsy Doyle. [...] "I'm {{just crazy}} over this motion picture {{business}} and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you girls a thousand questions about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you mean," [...] she replied, quickly. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you--could father be of any help if I telegraphed him to come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{answered}} {{your question}} just now," [...] said the girl, very quietly, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you one. Do you believe my uncle’s {{story about the}} buried treasure?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{wonder why}} I begged you to come. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you something. You said I was ignorant. That is true. And what can I do but ask you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Frederick, {{although}} I've been in {{the service}} I have rather a good head for business, and I hate beating about the bush. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to marry me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you about, Harney. Isn't {{there some}} place around here {{where we might}} hide the prisoners? A cave, or {{something}} like that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, we won't go into that,' {{said his}} earlship, 'an' <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you a question. I suppose you {{represent}} {{the middle class}} in your country?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Verrian rose awkwardly {{and stood}} {{a long moment}} before his chair. Then he dropped back again, saying, dryly, [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> it anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was thinking, Mr. Macheson," [...] she said, [...] "that I {{should like}} to leave home--if I could--if there was {{anything}} which I could do. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> your advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl nodded shortly. [...] "It's not my business," [...] she said. [...] "I am {{glad you}} came. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you something. Who {{is this man}} Rowan who killed my uncle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What the deuce do you mean?' whispered Melmotte. 'You've {{been at it}} {{from the}} {{beginning}} and ought to know. When <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Brehgert, you swore that you couldn't squeeze a place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> aunt, as this seems, {{from what}} I understand, to be a limited profession, whether my {{entrance}} into {{it would not}} be very expensive?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bo, {{he said a}} lot," [...] replied Helen, reflectively. [...] "I'll {{tell you}} presently. First <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you--has Carmichael ever told you how he's helped me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not directly. But {{my sister}} has, I know, very strong {{opinions}} on such subjects. Now, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you one thing. Is it true that--she--remains here?" ...|$|R
