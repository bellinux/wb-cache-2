40|$|The {{professional}} development of professional <b>educators</b> in {{education is a}} lifelong process which begins with the initial training of professionals and ends up with their retirement. <b>Educators</b> of preschool children have {{a very important role}} in this group. Quality {{professional development}} of professional <b>educators</b> depends on the quality of educational programs designed for them and skill providers. These training programs also include further education and training of <b>educators</b> for successful educational work. In this thesis I analyzed the need for additional permanent education of preschool <b>educators</b> and assistant <b>educators.</b> First, I presented the importance of education and training of <b>educators</b> and principles for their work. I also presented further education and training of <b>educators</b> and elements of action research in lifelong learning and changing teaching practice as a result of lifelong environment. The paper presents the methods and types of further education of <b>educators.</b> In the empirical part I focused on the differences between <b>educators</b> and assistant <b>educators,</b> their need for education and the differences between the positions of the groups discussed in relation to the topic. I was interested whether professional <b>educators</b> in preschool believe that they need additional professional training for successful work and how far the training meets their actual needs. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{national}} survey of 1000 secondary school special <b>educators</b> serving students with mild dis-abilities (i. e., learning disabilities, behavior disorders, mild mental retardation) was conducted to determine {{the current status of}} the knowledge and skills of secondary school special <b>educators</b> to engage in collabora-tion and to identify the frequency and topics of their collaborative interactions with special <b>educators,</b> gen-eral <b>educators,</b> and community service providers. Responses from 407 <b>educators</b> suggested that a large por-tion of special <b>educators</b> interacted frequently with general <b>educators</b> and other special <b>educators,</b> most often for the purpose of sharing information. The respondents reported interacting infrequently with com-munity service providers. The <b>educators</b> perceived themselves to have an average to above average level of competence for a majority of the identified collaboration competencies. The implications of tbe findings for the development of preservice preparation and staff development programs are discussed.

40|$|This paper primary {{objective}} is to analyze the supply of risk management education provided by extension <b>educators</b> to their clients. A survey of county/area extension <b>educators</b> from Mississippi, Texas, Indiana, and Nebraska was conducted during the fall of 2001. A Tobit econometric model was constructed to analyze the extension educators’ supply of risk management training to farmers. Results showed {{that the number of}} risk management education training programs held in the past 3 years by extension <b>educators</b> was positively related to the extension educators’ percent of time devoted to agricultural responsibilities, the value of all crops in the extension <b>educator’s</b> county/area, the extension <b>educator’s</b> previous training on risk management, whether the extension <b>educators</b> held an advanced degree (master or PhD), whether the extension <b>educators</b> perceived themselves as being knowledgeable in risk management techniques, and whether extension <b>educators</b> believe that forward contracts and futures/options strategies result in increased returns for the farmer than selling in the cash market. On the other hand, the number of risk management education training programs held in the past 3 years by extension <b>educators</b> was negatively related to the extension educators’ years of experience, whether the extension <b>educators</b> work in Mississippi, the dollar amount of the value of all livestock in the extension <b>educator’s</b> county/area, and whether the extension <b>educators</b> perceived farmers as being knowledgeable in risk management techniques...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade teacher <b>educators</b> have started to {{systematically}} study the processes involved {{in their efforts to}} improve their teacher education practices.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. This study {{focuses on}} how the HIV and Aids {{pandemic}} affects <b>educators</b> in primary schools and how these <b>educators</b> need to be supported to cope more resiliently with the challenges posed by the HIV/Aids pandemic. This study needed to understand how primary school <b>educators</b> experienced {{the impact of the}} HIV/Aids pandemic, both professionally and personally. <b>Educators</b> in general are personally affected by the HIV/Aids pandemic emotionally, physically, spiritually and socially. Affected <b>educators</b> are professionally affected by the HIV/Aids, when they are burdened by a large numbers of orphans in their classes, absenteeism of learners and colleagues, poor performance of both <b>educators</b> and learners, high workload and multiple roles they have to perform. The impacts, both personal and professional, are mostly negative. However, to date no study has focused on the impacts of the pandemic on primary school <b>educators.</b> In this study, a phenomenological design was followed. Interviews were conducted with a carefully recruited sample of participants (i. e. primary school <b>educators</b> affected by the HIV/Aids pandemic either in their families or by having orphans in their classes) in the Vaal Triangle area. The researcher recruited participants by means of snowball sampling. Fifteen affected <b>educators</b> participated in this study. Primary school <b>educators</b> interviewed, noted poor emotional, spiritual, physical and social health. They also reported that they do not cope with their duties as <b>educators</b> effectively. Affected primary school <b>educators</b> are in need of comprehensive support to deal with the HIV/Aids pandemic related stressors from the DoE, SMT's, colleagues and the community at large. Affected <b>educators</b> noted {{that they need to be}} supported, by means of team work with colleagues and the community; medical support; amongst others HIV education for learners, <b>educators</b> and parents and practical support and counselling for dealing with difficulties created by the HIV/Aids pandemic.
