25|$|In {{recent years}} the local government's {{commitment}} {{to invest in the}} inner-city has been questioned in view of its attempts to close inner-city library branches and a proposal to implement a base tax which would have lowered property taxes in outlying areas, where average household income for all residents is more than triple that of all residents in the inner city — but would have increased taxes for inner-city properties. A change in <b>funding</b> <b>structure</b> will result in the three low income neighbourhoods of Cathedral Area, Al Ritchie and Argyle Park having funding reduced by $40,000 collectively and North Central having funding increased by $15,000.

25|$|In 2010, {{the state}} of Pennsylvania {{provided}} $1,026,815 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is {{in addition to the}} state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education <b>funding</b> <b>structure</b> is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations.

The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district’s students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student’s needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.|$|E

40|$|<b>Funding</b> <b>structures</b> {{matter for}} {{financial}} stability. In particular, overreliance by some banks on {{certain types of}} wholesale funding—especially by U. S. and European banks—contributed to the global financial crisis. Most banks have recently made their <b>funding</b> <b>structures</b> more resilient by raising their capital adequacy ratios and reducing their dependence on short-term wholesale funding. However, some distressed banks remain vulnerable because their equity capital levels are inadequate and they are highly dependent on central bank funds. This chapter examines how bank <b>funding</b> <b>structures</b> have changed over time—especially {{in the run-up to}} the crisis—and how these structures affect financial stability. The analysis considers banks in a number of advanced and emerging market economies and includes systemically important banks. The analysis shows that healthy banks rely more on equity and less on debt (especially short-term debt) and have more diversified <b>funding</b> <b>structures</b> with lower loan-to-deposit ratios. Adequate capital buffers reduce a bank’s probability of default and support financial stability. Therefore, Basel III capital regulations that aim to raise the quantity and quality of capital should con-tinue to be a mainstay of the reform efforts. Basel III liquidity regulations will also play a role by reducing banks’ overreliance on short-term wholesale funding, which has proven detrimental to financial stability. Current reform efforts are aimed at reducing financial instability, but there can be tension among some key regulatory reforms that affect bank <b>funding</b> <b>structures.</b> As this chapter shows, such tension can arise, on the one hand, from pressures to use more secured funding (thereby raising levels of asset encumbrance) as well as deposits and, on the other hand, from bank-resolution initiatives (including the introduction of bail-in powers and th...|$|R
