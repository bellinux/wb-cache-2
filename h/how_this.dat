5|$|During the Iron Age, a Celtic {{language}} and culture emerged in Ireland. How and when the island of Ireland became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts {{being one of the}} more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. Today, {{there is more than one}} school of thought on <b>how</b> <b>this</b> occurred in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{question the}} poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about <b>how</b> <b>this</b> {{may have influenced}} her poetry. Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and Martha Nell Smith have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of <b>how</b> <b>this</b> find reflects metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot, though, {{regardless of the}} object's identity. Both modern crocodilians and birds, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well; the structure is not necessarily tied to metabolic rate.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios about <b>how</b> <b>this</b> {{will continue in}} the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Dubček's reforms {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} the press, and political commentary was allowed {{for the first time}} in mainstream media. At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Within the party, there were varying opinions on <b>how</b> <b>this</b> should proceed; certain economists wished for a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.|$|E

5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or <b>how</b> <b>this</b> decision was made, {{but it is clear that}} they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly <b>how</b> <b>this</b> sound was created. The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may therefore be {{the size of the}} territory of an individual. Other species of birds are also known to use their wings to create sounds that attract mates or mark their territory.|$|E
5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level of well-being and wealth within a given country, but also <b>how</b> <b>this</b> wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E

5|$|Woolly mammoth ivory {{was used}} to create art objects. Several Venus figurines, {{including}} the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Lespugue, were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a boomerang, are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiselled and split into smaller, more manageable pieces. Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened, and it is unknown <b>how</b> <b>this</b> was achieved.|$|E
