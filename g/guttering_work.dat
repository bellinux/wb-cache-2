25|$|In 2009 St Nicholas’ {{received}} {{a grant of}} £3000 for tiling and <b>gutter</b> <b>work</b> from the Friends of Essex Churches.|$|R
50|$|In July 1960, {{the federal}} {{government}} approved an application by Wink {{for more than a}} million dollars in urban renewal funds to upgrade and rehabilitate 221 acre within the city limits of Wink. National attention focused on the small oil town, which used the money for paving and curb and <b>gutter</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R

60|$|HIGGINS. It's all you'll get {{until you}} {{stop being a}} common idiot. If you're {{going to be a}} lady, you'll have to give up feeling {{neglected}} if the men you know don't spend half their time snivelling over you and the other half giving you black eyes. If you can't stand the coldness of my sort of life, and the strain of it, go back to the <b>gutter.</b> <b>Work</b> til you are more a brute than a human being; and then cuddle and squabble and drink til you fall asleep. Oh, it's a fine life, the life of the gutter. It's real: it's warm: it's violent: you can feel it through the thickest skin: you can taste it and smell it without any training or any work. Not like Science and Literature and Classical Music and Philosophy and Art. You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you? Very well: be off with you to the sort of people you like. Marry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money, and a thick pair of lips to kiss you with and a thick pair of boots to kick you with. If you can't appreciate what you've got, you'd better get what you can appreciate.|$|R
5000|$|... "Shanker" [...] - Nickname of {{a former}} flatmate of Strike, whose mother Leda took him in after she found him badly beaten in a <b>gutter.</b> Shanker <b>works</b> in the illegal drugs trade, is about Strike's age, has a {{disfigured}} face, calls Strike [...] "Bunsen" [...] and also hates Whittaker. He is willing to help Strike and Robin with just about anything in return for money. He helps Strike trace Whittaker, helps Robin confront Brockbank, helps Strike apprehend Laing and, at the end, drives Strike to Yorkshire for Robin's wedding.|$|R
50|$|In 1893, {{the local}} {{newspaper}} published a request for donations to help with additional renovations needed at the church. The story said no provisions were made for control of rain water in the 1891 restoration and it was seeping into the walls from parapets and <b>gutters.</b> The restoration <b>work</b> completed in 1891 also did not include all needed repairs to the tower; {{it was reported that}} work on the tower would be postponed because the most immediate need was to control the rain problem. The church received new lighting and a new organ along with other restoration in 1915.|$|R
40|$|The {{colonization}} and {{deterioration of}} building materials from three Spanish cathedrals by lichens and bryophytes was investigated. The materials included sandstones, limestones, granites, tiles, flagstones and mortars. The colonization {{of the different}} types of materials by lichens was induced, to a great extent, by the input of bird excrements, giving rise to a characteristic ornithocoprophilous flora. Communities of mosses grew preferentially on mortars with pronounced disintegrating effects due to penetration of rhizoids. Both lichens and bryophytes lead to mechanical and chemical damage to stonework. This represents a stage in the succession which gives rise to the later invasion by vascular plants, whose roots cause important deterioration {{in the structure of the}} buildings, mainly roofings, tiles, <b>guttering,</b> etc. This <b>work</b> has been sponsored by the CEC (contract EV 4 V 0061 E) and the CICYT (PAT 89 - 0767).

40|$|In {{immersion}} lithography, the wafer on {{the chuck}} is immersed by the immersion hood. Interaction of the chuck with the immersion hood {{leads to a}} position disturbance on the wafer. Three disturbance observers are designed with the aim for immersion hood disturbance compensation: An inverse rigid-body plant based observer, a Kalman observer and an H infinity observer. First {{a model of the}} wafer positioning system with immersion hood is built. Then the observers are designed using this model. After that, the observers are analyzed using Bode plots and a gutter disturbance simulation. Finally, the observers are tested for applicability on a wafer scanner. Theoretically, the Kalman and H-infinity observers can estimate a 1 degree of freedom immersion hood disturbance force on a full model of the wafer positioning system. The inverse rigid-body plant based observer can estimate a multiple degree of freedom disturbance force on a rigid body model of the wafer positioning system. Experiments showed that a multiple degree of freedom disturbance estimation is needed for accurate compensation and that online compensation is required due to varying <b>gutter</b> disturbance. Future <b>work</b> must be focused on stable, online high bandwidth compensation using a multiple degree of freedom disturbance observer.

40|$|Effects of poor {{environmental}} hygiene on population health were {{studied in the}} precarious living quarters of Doukoure, the village of Niangon-adjame and the viable living quarters of millionaire’s in Yopougon town. This study included sanitation, water sources, as well as, population health. It appears that excreta management is from self-purification works (WC with septic tank) (60 %), collective purification <b>work</b> (<b>gutter</b> storm water, sewer) (26 %), anarchic connections (30 %) and defecation in nature relatively less important (2 %) for all living quarters visited. Furthermore, almost 90 % of the populations {{have access to the}} drinking water, which is rather used. In Doukouré’s living quarters and Niangon-Adjamé’s village, public tap water (7 %) and traditional wells (3 %) are used for domestic needs. Data collected in 15 health centers in the town on 125 446 cases of morbidity, revealed that malaria is much contracted by populations with 58 % cases against 14 % for diarrhea and 28 % for acute respiratory infections. Under-five children are much affected with 24 % of the patients among which 43 % were cases of the diarrheic diseases. Also, malaria and respiratory infections are more important during rainy seasons, in contrast to diarrheal diseases caused by poor hygiene of people...|$|R
