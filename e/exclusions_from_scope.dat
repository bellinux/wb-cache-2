40|$|The {{scope of}} justice {{has been defined}} as the {{boundary}} within which justice is per-ceived to be relevant. The empirical literature on this topic is primarily aimed at pre-dicting when a target will be excludedfrom the scope ofjustice and at examining po-tential consequences of <b>exclusion,</b> <b>from</b> accepting a target's suffering to active harm-doing such as mass internment and genocide. The concept of the scope ofjus-tice is interesting and heuristically useful, but there are severalproblems with the em-pirical literature that impede its progress. For example, the proposed mediator often has not been measured, or operationalizations of the scope ofjustice have been con-founded with other constructs. Also, although the scope ofjustice remains one possi-ble explanationfor results obtained in various experiments, there are equally compel-ling alternatives that do not implicate <b>exclusion</b> <b>from</b> the <b>scope</b> ofjustice. We offer suggestions about how to study scope ofjustice issues in thefuture and identify points that need to be clarified regarding the conceptualization of the scope ofjustice.

40|$|This paper makes a {{critical}} {{appraisal of the}} provisions of the 2005 Hague Convention on the Choice of Court Agreements from the perspective of Serbian Law. First, it is noted that the Convention does not apply to submission and does not regulate the effects of belated invocation of the existence of the choice of court agreement before the court not chosen. It also does not prevent that the reverse situation, that the party invokes nullity of the choice of court agreement past the initial stage in the proceedings. Secondly, the res iudicata effect of domestic arbitral awards seems to be jeopardized by the provisions authorizing the court of the contracting state to refuse to recognize and enforce a judgment of the other contracting state based on the choice of court agreement, solely if the judgment is inconsistent with a judgment given in the requested state (and not if it is inconsistent with an arbitral award given in the requested state). Thirdly, and most importantly, great number of <b>exclusions</b> <b>from</b> the <b>scope</b> of application and some very broad grounds for non-recognition of foreign forum selection clauses makes this instrument less attractive than it should be...|$|R
40|$|Between March and June 2010, the European Commission has {{conducted}} a consultation on {{the review of}} Council Regulation 1383 / 2003, concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing IP rights (the so-called Border Measures Regulation; BMR). The Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property, Competition and Tax Law, Munich, participatet in that consultation with a statement. In that statement, the Institute proposes several amendments to the definitions, scope and procedural provisions of the BMR. The proposals go into much detail, yet their main line can be generalized int wo ways: In terms {{of the scope of}} the BMR, firstly, the Intitute sees a need to distinguish between genuine acts of transit and other forms of passage. Genuine acts of transit should be excluded <b>from</b> the <b>scope</b> of the BMR. However, the transit definition or genuinity-requirement is not demed to be fulfilled wehere, in particular, there is a substantiated threat of either trade diversion onto any of the markets of the EU member states or of a misuse of the transit procedure for conduct of an illicit activity. In view of the special nature of such transits, a specific <b>exclusion</b> <b>from</b> the <b>scope</b> is also proposed for specific public health-related transits. In terms of procedural rights under the BMR, secondly, the Institute proposes several amendments with a view to achieving a better balancing of rights and enhanced TRIPS-conformity...|$|R

Similar general population cadmium exposures {{in other parts of}} the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels.

Although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} analyse the effectiveness of the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements in making international commercial cross-border litigation easier. Transnational litigation is so complicated that an international litigant feels like a trapped insect in a spider’s web. Now that there is a global Convention in this area, it would be useful to determine how successful the new instrument is in protecting and freeing the international litigants from the transnational litigation’s web of complexities. Interestingly, the Hague Convention mainly applies its rules to exclusive choice of court clauses or agreements only. This paper argues that the exclusive choice of court agreement feature of the Hague Convention will resolve the problem of parallel proceedings and make international litigation a bit more predictable, certain and cheaper. Apart from these benefits, it is not likely to make an international litigant’s life easier in any significant manner. It is argued that the Hague Convention’s success is impeded by its narrow scope of applicability to exclusive choice of court agreements only, a wide variety of <b>exclusions</b> <b>from</b> the <b>scope</b> of the Convention, a lack of provision for parties with no choice of court agreements, a convoluted declarations system, a lack of protection for small and medium-sized enterprises entering into standard form contracts online as business-consumers, inadequate provision for issues arising out of judicial corruption and no provision for civil procedure rules. The paper ends with a few recommendations, which if adopted, would enhance the effectiveness of the Hague Convention considerably. It concludes that international litigation, being the default dispute resolution mechanism, needs to be worked upon and improved, possibly through a broader and better global Convention...|$|R
