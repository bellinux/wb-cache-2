40|$|Xu's (2008) paper {{inspired}} us {{to investigate}} the relationship between exchange rate and trade deficit. Based on economic theories, if a country does not interfere its exchange rate and allows it be totally flexible in the market, the exchange rate should have long-run (cointegrate) and short-run (causality) relationships with the trade deficits. After our research, {{we found out that}} there was no cointegrating and causality between China, <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea's</b> exchange rate <b>and</b> their trade deficit with the U. S. Since China's exchange rate was well known for fixing or pegging with other countries' currencies, <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea's</b> data couldn't prove they had a flexible exchange rate. There must be other factors not included in our study. Just based on exchange rates and trade deficits, we have to conclude that China, <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea's</b> government influence their exchange rates by excessively holding U. S. dollars as their foreign currency reserves. All three countries had an unfair advantage on their export with the U. S., which caused the U. S. trade deficit to grow continuously...|$|R

5|$|After {{affecting}} the Philippines, Soudelor moved {{into an area}} of low wind shear and with favorable outflow.

It also affected Taiwan, where floods covered highways and caused mudslides. Early on June18, Soudelor reached peak 10‑minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph). Subsequently, an increase in shear and {{the passage of a}} trough weakened the typhoon and caused it to turn to the northeast. Soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on June19, and subsequently it passed between <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea.</b> It became an extratropical cyclone that day, dissipating on June24. In Japan, the storm caused widespread power outages, although damage was minimal, and there were 21injuries. In South Korea, there was $12.1million in damage and two deaths.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{assuming}} power, Suharto government adopted {{policy of}} neutrality in the Cold War, but was nevertheless quietly {{aligned with the}} Western bloc (including <b>Japan</b> <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Korea)</b> {{with the objective of}} securing support for Indonesia's economic recovery. Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. Diplomatic relations with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in 30 September Movement (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI, Soviet Union embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister Adam Malik managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with Malaysia in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in August 1967.
