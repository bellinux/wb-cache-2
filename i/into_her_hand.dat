5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the support}} of Emperor Shōmu and Empress Kōmyō, {{with whom he had}} family-ties, Nakamaro rapidly climbed the career ladder during the 740s and 750s {{achieving}} some of the highest ranks and court positions. During {{the early years of the}} reign of Emperor Junnin, whom he supported, Nakamaro ruled the country de facto. Following the death of Kōmyō in 760, the retired Empress Kōken started to take government affairs <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> resulting in a conflict between Nakamaro/Junnin on one side and Kōken and her close associate Dōkyō on the other.|$|E
25|$|When {{all have}} left, the Marschallin, {{reminded}} {{of her own}} early marriage by Ochs's young bride, sadly ponders her fleeting youth and the fickleness of men ("Da geht er hin..."). By this time Octavian returns (in men's clothes) ("Ach, du bist wieder da"), she has realized {{that one day he}} will leave her ("Die Zeit, die ist ein sonderbar Ding"). She muses on the passage of time (a clock is heard chiming thirteen times), and turns Octavian away. After he has left, she suddenly realizes that she has forgotten to kiss him goodbye, and sends some footmen after him; however, it is too late, he is gone. The Marschallin summons her page to take the silver rose to Octavian to deliver to Sophie. After Mohammed departs, she stares pensively <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> mirror (or similar) as the curtain falls.|$|E
60|$|Woman {{would be}} more charming if one could fall <b>into</b> <b>her</b> arms without falling <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R

60|$|She {{dropped into}} {{a chair at the}} bedside, and let <b>her</b> face fall <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and cried.|$|R
60|$|She had {{no sooner}} taken it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> than, whether being very hasty at it, {{somewhat}} unhandy, {{or that the}} decree of the Fairy had so ordained it, it ran <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> and she fell down in a swoon.|$|E
60|$|She {{gathered}} the reins <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> preliminary to starting.|$|E
60|$|So saying, he put <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> five broad gold {{pieces of}} Philip and Mary.|$|E
60|$|The {{nurse was}} {{standing}} by the window. She turned sharply on Joan's entrance. Joan slipped the box <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
60|$|When {{his mother}} {{appeared}} with her bonnet on, Tom {{came out to}} her in the passage, and put money <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
6000|$|And {{just as she}} {{was going}} out the {{following}} letter was put <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> come by one of the many posts from Rockstone:--- ...|$|R
60|$|He put {{the note}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> in silence. She read it, and darted back to Lucia's room.|$|E
60|$|She {{wrenched}} herself free. She stood {{away from}} him, her skirt gathered up <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> prepared for flight.|$|E
60|$|In some {{surprise}} the youth put the cigar-case <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> and she immediately flung {{it into a}} neighbouring pool.|$|E
60|$|Lenora looked up. Then {{her head}} {{suddenly}} sank <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> She knew quite well that her secret had escaped her. Laura patted her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Lenora's face sank <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> for a moment. Quest {{stood on}} one side while Laura passed her arm around the other girl's waist. Presently he returned.|$|R
6000|$|Bartley {{drove up}} {{abreast of the}} wreck, and, saying, [...] "Still, Jerry! Don't be afraid, Marcia,"--he put the reins <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and sprang out to the rescue.|$|R
60|$|Little Dorrit took it {{from her}} bosom, and gave it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> which {{remained}} stretched out after receiving it.|$|E

60|$|The child did not obey. She {{stood looking}} {{from her mother}} to her sister. The latter pushed a dish <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|ALICK [wagging {{his head}} sadly]. I {{had to tell}} her. And then I--I-- bought her a {{sealskin}} muff, and I just slipped it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and came away.|$|R
60|$|She {{held the}} sheet over her shoulder, and Imogene came languidly and took it; Mrs. Bowen dropped her face {{forward on the}} desk, <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> while Imogene was reading.|$|R
60|$|She {{emptied the}} purse <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own <b>hand,</b> and solemnly counted out the twenty pieces of gold. She {{was about to}} replace them all into the purse, when Marguerite pressed one of them back <b>into</b> <b>her</b> {{wrinkled}} <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|With a sigh {{for every}} piece of money, Fagin told the amount <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a 'good-night.' ...|$|E

60|$|He was {{pressing}} one of {{the papers}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> holding her fingers tightly in his, and compelling her gaze with the ardent excitement of his own.|$|E
60|$|Hetty went {{close to}} the rocking-chair, and stood without her usual smile, and without any attempt to entice Totty, simply waiting for her aunt to give the child <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{this ritual}} the bride will place both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> {{the hands of}} the groom and then her brother will place rice <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and then bride and groom {{together}} will offer the rice as a sacrifice into the sacred fire.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Hold this,' {{he said to}} Anne, whose curiosity {{still kept}} her {{standing}} near. He {{turned on the light}} of a dark lantern he had brought, and gave it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I wagged another negative. A {{nurse and}} a little English girl had been near me, and were {{following}} me, now. The shopwoman ran to the nurse, thrust the beads <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come now, I {{do believe}} you are {{laughing}} at it!" [...] said Meta, taking the derided vessels <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] "Now, they really are genuine, and very curious things, are not they, Flora?" ...|$|R
60|$|Her head fell {{suddenly}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> It {{was almost}} {{the first sign of}} emotion. Tavernake analyzed it mercilessly. He knew very well that it was fear, the coward's fear of that terrible moment.|$|R
