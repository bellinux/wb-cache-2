40|$|This chapter reviews <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> {{from the}} shelf of French Guiana as a {{regional}} example of sedimentologic process occurring on the whole stable continental margin from the Amazon to the Orinoco River. <b>Green</b> <b>grains</b> have been observed and analyzed off the Orinoco delta and on the continental shelf of Surinam. These <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> were identified as “chamosite” and “glauconite. ” The muddy coast of French Guiana is generally very flat and occupied by wet swamps and mangrove {{as a result of}} the equatorial climate. Most <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> on the continental shelf represent the verdine facies. <b>Green</b> <b>grains</b> are ubiquitous on the shelf and top of the slope off French Guiana. Two sedimentological facies exist: glaucony deeper than 150 m and verdine at shallower depths. The verdine facies has mainly developed from mineral debris and especially chloritized biotite. Carbonate bioclasts and faecal pellets are also utilized. The mica flakes were never wholly replaced by authigenic clay and the phenomenon leads to mixed grains where authigenic and substrate remains are recognizable. Carbonate substrates lead to mainly clay pure <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> becasue the initial carbonate has been dissolved. The formation of verdine can be located in a general marine environment at a comparatively warm sea-water temperature and at a depth probably shallower than 60 m...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} short-duration chickpea genotypes and post-harvest management of <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> for expanding the period of green grain availability in northern India. Two super-early chickpea breeding lines, ICCV 96029 and ICCV 96030, developed at ICRISAT were evaluated for green grain yield and other ancillary characters. Both lines were found early in flowering and podding and produced > 2. 0 t ha- 1 fresh green seed yield in 75 days after sowing when sown in first week of October. Though the early podding lines could make available <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> for a longer period, the acceptability of these lines was restricted due to their susceptibility to diseases and less-preferred pale yellowish grain color. Hence, {{efforts were made to}} improve these traits by crossing super-early lines with well adapted cultivars/elite lines. Over 260 progenies (F 4 to F 6) were evaluated along with checks ICCV 96030 and PBG 1 during crop season 2005 / 06. Many progenies were found superior to the best check ICCV 96030 and selected for further evaluation. Experiments conducted on different packaging and storage methods showed that <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> and pods packed with/without peduncles in polyethylene (PE) packs in presence/absence of CaCl 2 extended the shelf life. In PE packs, <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> without CaCl 2 in thermocol box could be stored for up to 15 days at refrigeration temperature. Green pods showed better shelf life than shelled <b>green</b> <b>grains.</b> Acetic acid solutions with salt solutions could be used to enhance the shelf life of <b>green</b> <b>grains.</b> Thus, the early podding varieties can be used for expanding the availability of <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> and the storage methods identified in this study can be used for extending shelf life of green pods/grains of chickpe...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{consumed}} legumes in the North and Northeast of Brazil, representing an important source of protein, energy, fibre and minerals, in addition to generating employment and income. The aim of this study was to determine the chemical composition, and the effect of thermal processing on the <b>green</b> <b>grain</b> from biofortified cowpea cultivars. Samples of <b>green</b> <b>grain</b> from four cowpea cultivars were analysed, only one not being biofortified (standard). Centesimal composition and total energy value (TEV) were determined before and after thermal processing. The mean values of the characteristics under evaluation were compared by Student's t-test and Tukey's test (. < 0. 05). Moisture and TEV content in the raw <b>green</b> <b>grain</b> ranged from 58. 32 to 60. 66 % and from 159 to 170 Kcal/ 100 g (wet basis) respectively. The ash, protein, lipid and carbohydrate (dry basis) content of the raw <b>green</b> <b>grain</b> varied from 1. 58 to 1. 68 %, 11. 03 to 13. 25 %, 1. 31 to 2. 23 %, and 36. 11 to 38. 13 % respectively. After heat treatment, there was an increase in lipid content (1. 57 to 2. 36 %) and a reduction in the levels of ash (0. 83 to 1. 09 %), protein (10. 25 to 13. 13 %) and carbohydrates (25. 22 to 28. 50 %), except for the BRS Tumucumaque cultivar, which had a reduction in lipid content (2. 04 %) and an increase in protein content (12. 94 %). It was concluded that the grain from the cowpea cultivars was affected by thermal processing, reducing the levels of ash, protein and carbohydrates, and increasing the lipid content in three of the four cowpea cultivars under study. BRS Tumucumaque was the only cultivar that did not behave in a similar way to the others, with an increase in protein content and a reduction in lipids after heat treatment...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{arrangement}} of soybean plants, determined by row spacing and seeding rate, affects the intraspecific competition for water, light, and nutrients, {{as well as}} plant architecture and grain development, quality, and chemical composition. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate the effect of row spacing and seeding rate on the grain size produced, and the influence of these three factors on chlorophyll retention and protein and oil content in grain. Two experiments were conducted in the 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 growing seasons, using a 4 × 3 factorial randomized block design with three replications. Four different row spacings [20 cm (narrow row), 50 cm (conventional), 20 / 80 cm (twin rows) and crossed lines (50 cm) ] and three seeding rates (150, 300, and 450 thousand viable seeds ha- 1) were evaluated. The grains were classified by size using oblong sieves and then the effects of spatial arrangements and size of grain on the percentage of <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> and protein and oil contents were evaluated. Higher plant densities were associated with larger grain size, whereas the effects of spacing between the rows on the grain size varied between growing seasons. The arrangement in cross-rows and high plant density produced a higher percentage of <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> under weather conditions favorable to the development of this attribute. The effects of plant spatial arrangements on the contents of protein and oil in grains were variable, and {{it was not possible to}} determine whether the spatial {{arrangement of}} plants had an effect on the levels of protein and oil in grains.

40|$|International audienceIron-rich {{smectite}} {{is commonly}} {{described in the}} diagenetic fraction of deep-sea sediment, as millimeter to centimeter aggregates dispersed in the sediment, or as a coating on sedimentary particles or nodules. This study examines several factors to elucidate formation mechanisms of a particular iron-rich smectite and its potential transformation to glauconite. The study combines a detailed mineralogical investigation on natural samples and a chemical modeling approach to assess mineralogical reactions and pathways. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations and analytical electron microscopy (TEM-AEM) analyses were conducted on microtomed samples of millimeter- to centimeter-long <b>green</b> <b>grains.</b> These grains are widespread in pelagic calcareous sediment from the Costa Rica margin. They are composed of pyrites that are partially dissolved and are surrounded by amorphous or very poorly crystallized iron-rich particles. Iron-rich montmorillonite grows from an amorphous precursor and its formation requires the input of Si, O, Mg, K, Na and Ca; our results suggest that these inputs are supported by the dissolution of sedimentary phases such as volcanic glasses, siliceous fossils and silicates. Thermodynamic modeling of fluid-sediment interactions was conducted with the geochemical computer code PhreeqC, using mineralogical and pore fluid compositions from sediment samples and calculated estimates for thermodynamic constants of smectites that are not maintained by the computer code. Simulations confirm {{the possibility that the}} <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> are the product of pyrite alteration by seawater under oxidizing conditions. The extent of smectite production is controlled by the kinetics of pyrite dissolution and fluid migration. The absence of aluminum in the Costa Rica margin system explains the formation of an iron-rich montmorillonite instead of glauconite, whereas the presence of calcite that buffers the system explains the formation of an iron-rich montmorillonite instead of iron oxides...|$|E

We detected the acidification process caused by the UV irradiation by monitoring the intensity of the asymmetric stretching mode of the CO 2 molecule at 2343 cm− 1. The comparison between free and AuNPs functionalized proton caged compound demonstrates a highly enhanced CO 2 yield, hence pH variation, in the latter case.

The dry grains have nutritional value similar to common bean, containing approximately 63 % of carbohydrates, 25 % of protein and 6 % of fibers (AZEVEDO et al, 2003). Grain consumption contributes synergistically to its medicinal properties as antioxidant, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antimicrobial, with a positive effect against some chronic diseases (DÍAZ et al, 2010). The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) has nutraceutical properties quite pronounced and increasingly consumed in human food, the beneficial effects of its bioactive compounds remains unexplored (BECKER; SIDDHURAJU, 2007).

A produtividade de vagens verdes e de grãos verdes e secos obtida pelas linhagens TE- 90 - 170 - 76 F; CNCX- 409 - 12 F; CNCX- 405 - 17 F; TE- 90 - 180 - 10 F; TE- 87 - 108 - 6 G, Linhagem avançada e pela cultivar IPA 206, foram superiores a 5, 0 t/ha para vagens verdes, a 3, 0 t/ha para grãos verdes e a 1, 2 t/ha para grãos secos, consideradas altas para o feijão-caupi. As maiores produtividade de vagens verdes (6, 5 e 6, 5 t/ha), de grãos verdes (3, 8 e 3, 8 t/ha), e de grãos secos (1, 8 e 1, 8 t/ha) foram obtidas, respectivamente, com as linhagem CNCX- 409 - 12 F e cultivar IPA 206. Ten breeding {{lines and}} three cultivars of cowpea-bean were evaluated. The experiment {{was set up}} in Areia, Brazil, between April and July/ 00, in Red-yellow Latossoil. The breeding lines TE- 92 - 199 - 20 F; TE- 90 - 170 - 29 F; TE- 90 - 170 - 76 F; CNCX- 405 - 17 F; CNCX- 409 - 12 F; TE- 90 - 180 - 10 F; TE- 87 - 108 - 6 G, Linhagem avançada, and IPA 206, BR- 03 Tracuateua, cvs., presented length and average weight of pods according to the commercial patterns and number of pods by plant according to the pattern of the species (above twenty pods). The yield of green pods, green and dry grains, obtained by the breeding lines TE- 90 - 170 - 76 F; CNCX- 409 - 12 F; CNC- 405 - 17 F; TE- 90 - 180 - 0 F; TE- 87 - 108 - 6 G, Linhagem avançada and IPA 206, cultivar, were superior to 5. 0 t/ha for green pods, to 3. 0 t/ha for <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> and to 1. 2 t/ha for dry grains, considered highest for the cowpea-beans. Highest yield of green pods (6. 5 and 6. 5 t/ha), <b>green</b> <b>grains</b> (3. 8 and 3. 8 t/ha), and dry grains (1. 8 and 1. 8 t/ha) were obtained, respectively, with the breeding line CNCX- 409 - 12 F and IPA 206 cv...|$|E
40|$|Light {{intensity}} {{is one of}} the most important environmental factors to determine the growth and yield of rice. However, little information is known about the response of indica cultivars, especially Vietnamese cultivars to shading conditions. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in 2015 to determine the response of Vietnamese cultivars to shading condition during the grain filling period. Fourteen Vietnamese cultivars were covered by black cloth (50 % shading treatment) after the heading stage in the field conditions. Grain yield of fourteen Vietnamese cultivars in shading condition fell to about 32. 2 – 65. 0 % of the natural light condition. The most sensitive cultivars to shading are ‘Jasmine 85 ’ and ‘OM 2395 ’, of which the grain yield decreased to 65. 0 and 59. 8 % of natural light condition, respectively. The shaded yield decreased corresponding to the reduction in crop growth rate (CGR) and yield components, especially in the percentage of filled grain due to the increase in spikelet sterility. Shading increased the percentage of immature grains in all cultivars. Shading induced an increase in the percentage of chalky and <b>green</b> <b>grains,</b> which was largest in ‘OM 2517 ’ and ‘OM 5451 ’, respectively. Clearly, shading depressed both grain yield and the appearance quality of brown rice in Vietnamese cultivars, similarly reported in previous studies with Japanese cultivars. 　光強度は，水稲の生育・収量を決定する最も重要な環境要因である．しかし，光強度の減少，すなわち遮光処理がインド型水稲品種，特にベトナム産品種の生育・収量に及ぼす影響に関する知見は限られている．本研究では，登熟期間の遮光がベトナム産水稲品種の乾物生産，収量と収量構成要素，玄米の外観品質に及ぼす影響を 2015 年に調査した．ベトナム産水稲 14 品種を圃場栽培を行い，最初に出穂が認められた品種の出穂期以降収穫期まで，群落上層を黒色寒冷紗（遮光率 50 ）を用いて被覆する，遮光処理を行った．ベトナム産 14 品種の収量は，遮光に伴い自然光条件に比較して 32. 2 ～ 65. 0 の低下がみられた．遮光処理の影響が大きかった品種は‘Jasmine 85 ’ と‘OM 2395 ’ で，それぞれ 65. 0 ， 59. 8 の収量低下がみられた．収量の低下には，登熟期の個体群成長速度，収量構成要素では穎花不稔の増加による登熟歩合の低下に起因していた．遮光処理はすべての品種で玄米の未熟粒割合を増加させた．遮光処理により，白未熟粒と青未熟粒の増加がみられ，その程度は白未熟粒が‘OM 2517 ’ で，青未熟粒が‘OM 5415 ’ で最も著しかった．以上の結果，遮光処理はベトナム産水稲 14 品種の収量と玄米の外観品質を低下させたが，その程度には品種間差があることが明らかになり，これらの傾向は日本産水稲品種で得られた結果と同様であった...|$|E
