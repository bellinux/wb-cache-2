During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him {{into the bottom of}} the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear.

40|$|This thesis evaluates some {{relevant}} aspects {{related to}} structural integrity for work boats and high speed vessels with floating frames. This structural design {{is expected to}} significantly reduce the building cost, {{but it is also}} expected to reduce the structural strength of the vessel. A model of {{a modified version of the}} JumboCat 60 (JC 60) with floating frames is used as a recurring example in the calculations. As of date, the use of floating frames in not acknowledge by the classification societies. The traditional version of the JC 60 is however classified according to the DNV HSLC rules, and it is shown that the scantlings for the <b>floating</b> <b>frame</b> version exceeds the minimum requirements in the rules. Finite element models of the traditional and the <b>floating</b> <b>frame</b> version of the JC 60 has been developed. These has been analysed for three different load conditions as defined in the DNV Classification Notes 30. 8, namely the symmetric bottom slamming, the transverse split force, and the torsional/pitch-connecting moment load condition. These load conditions are assumed to be the most critical. From the finite element analyses, it is seen that the structural response for both models is quite similar. Only the transverse split force load condition analyses showed stresses exceeding the allowable stress levels given in the DNV HSLC rules. However, the results indicated that the hull beam of the traditional model was slightly stiffer, so it is suggested that the plate thickness for the shell plating in the <b>floating</b> <b>frame</b> version is increased at some critical regions. An increase of the longitudinal stiffener shear area is also seen necessary to reduce high shear stresses at critical areas for the <b>floating</b> <b>frame</b> version. A fatigue assessment of the longitudinal stiffener-transverse <b>floating</b> <b>frame</b> connection has been performed. Three different locations were identified as potentially critical in terms of excessive fatigue damage. Those were located at the middle of the stiffener flange at the weld toe, at the edge of the stiffener flange at the weld toe, and at the edge of the frame bottom flange. The long term distribution of stresses was approximated by a twoparameter Weibull distribution. The shape factor was set to 0. 81 and the number of load cycles for 20 years of service was set to 100 million. The maximum stress range in the load history was assumed to occur for symmetric bottom slamming. Four finite element models of the structural detail were developed and analysed for determination of the maximum stress range.

Accurate modeling of the leaf springs is necessary in evaluating ride comfort, braking performance, vibration characteristics, and stability. In order to accurately model the deformations and vibrations of the leaf springs, nonlinear finite-element procedures, which account for the dynamic coupling between different modes of displacement, are employed. Two finite-element methods that {{take into account the}} effect of the distributed inertia and elasticity are discussed in this investigation to model the dynamics of leaf springs. The first is based on a <b>floating</b> <b>frame</b> of reference formulation, while the second is an absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The <b>floating</b> <b>frame</b> of reference formulation allows for using a reduced-order model by employing component mode synthesis techniques, while the absolute nodal coordinate formulation enables more detailed finite-element models for the large deformation of very flexible leaf springs.

Further analysis revealed that 85 % of the total entrainment occurred at the dam's third powerplant. These numbers represent a significant loss to the tribal fisheries upstream of the dam. In response to a suggestion by the NWPPC Independent Scientific Review Panel, the scope of work for the Chief Joseph Kokanee Enhancement Project was expanded to include a multiyear pilot test of a strobe light system to help mitigate fish entrainment.

A <b>floating</b> <b>frame</b> is a transverse frame fittedto the longitudinal stiffener flanges without contact with the shell plating, {{as opposed to the}} traditionalfixed frame which is welded to the shell plating with the stiffeners most commonly fitted through cut outsin the frame. To study the <b>floating</b> <b>frame</b> structure in a bigger perspective a finite element analysis is performed on amid ship compartment of an existing 60 m high speed catamaran ferry. The analysis is performed on amodel with scantlings as the original craft but with introduced floating frames. Stresses are analysed withrespect to maximum allowable stress as given in the DNV-rules for HAZ. High stresses are found {{in the bottom of the}} frames due to the reduced bending stiffness without effectiveflange from the shell plating. A large deformation in the shell plating relative the transverse frames isfound, creating high stresses in the stiffener webs. This deformation is induced by a large verticaldeformation of the frames. It is concluded that the transverse frames requires an increased stiffness to achieve acceptable stress levels.

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} a detailed comparison between two optimization methods {{that are used}} to perform the structural optimization of flexible components within a multibody system (MBS) simulation. The dynamic analysis of flexible MBS is based on a nonlinear finite element formulation. The first method is a weakly coupled method, which reformulates the dynamic response optimization problem in a two-level approach. First, a rigid or flexible MBS simulation is performed, and second, each component is optimized independently using a quasi-static approach in which a series of equivalent static load (ESL) cases obtained from the MBS simulation are applied to the respective components. The second method, the fully coupled method, performs the dynamic response optimization using the time response obtained directly from the flexible MBS simulation.

The shellfish production on the islands is usually individual attempt of farmers, producing minor quantities mostly in polyculture. This production has bigger potential but it’s limited owing to the EU quality control regulations which do not allow the export, and by domestic market which has drastically decreased due to the collapse of tourism during the recent war.
