We went {{a lot of different ways}} with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop <b>formula.</b> <b>I</b> think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine.

500|$|After {{the second}} verse and chorus, the song {{features}} a break down influenced by house music. Gaga chants {{the lines in}} the same way she does in the middle of [...] "Born This Way". Then she sings, [...] "I wanna love you/ But something's pulling me away from you/ Jesus is my virtue, Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to." [...] In this section, Gaga's vocals drew comparison to that of Rihanna's by Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone. He also added that her voice sounded less dark and dramatic and was full of [...] "bubbly sweetness". Popjustice wrote that the breakdown sounded like tribal-techno, and the whole song was [...] "a turbo-charged electrogothic wrongness anthem". Dan Martin from NME wrote that the breakdown was in the dubstep genre with the chorus being [...] "pure-pop". There were some similarities and influences of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] in the song, which Gaga said was deliberate. She explained that while sometimes it is important for her to push herself in new directions, she did want her characteristic sound to be imbibed in her records. [...] "I wanted [...] to be an evolution from where I’ve been before {{but in terms of the}} <b>formula</b> <b>I</b> wanted there to be something about 'Judas' that reminded people of what I’ve done in the past," [...] she added. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of C minor with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of B3 to E5 and the song follows a basic sequence of A–Fm7–Cm–B–Cm as its chord progression.|$|E

I worked not {{from the ranks of}} the Labour Party itself, because I flatter myself that I was clear-sighted enough to see that the Labour Party as it existed after the war, split up by factions, devoted to the selfish {{interests}} of the great trades unions and with the taint of Miller retarding all progress, had nothing in it of the real spirit of freedom. It was every man for his own betterment and the world in which he lived might go hang. I stayed with the Coalitionists, though I was often a thorn in their side, but because I was also useful to them I bent them often towards the light. Then they began to fear me, or rather my principles. It was out of my principles, although I was not nominally one of them, that Dartrey admits freely to-day he built up the Democratic Party. He had been working on the same lines for years, a little too much from the idealistic point of view. He needed the <b>formula.</b> <b>I</b> gave it to him. Horlock came into office again and I worked with him for a time. Gradually, however, my position became more and more difficult. In the end he offered me a post in the Cabinet, induced me to resign my own seat, which I admit was a doubtful one, and sent me to fight Hellesfield, which it was never intended that I should win. Then Miller dug his own grave. He opposed me there and I lost the seat. Horlock was politely regretful, scarcely saw what could be done for me at the moment, was disposed to join in a paltry little domestic plot to send me to the Lords. This was at the time I came down to Martinhoe, the time, except for those brief moments in Paris, when I first met you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [50] Perhaps {{it may be}} said, in farther {{support of}} Mr. Ricardo, [...] that he meant, [...] "when the utility is {{constant}} or given, the [...] price varies as the quantity of labour." [...] If he meant this, [...] he should have said it; but, had he meant it, he could have [...] hardly missed the necessary result, that utility would be [...] one measure of price (which he expressly denies it to be); [...] and that, to prove saleableness, he had to prove a given [...] quantity of utility, {{as well as a}} given quantity of labour: [...] to wit, in his own instance, that the deer and fish would [...] each feed the same number of men, for the same number of [...] days, with equal pleasure to their palates. The fact is, he [...] did not know what he meant himself. The general idea which [...] he had derived from commercial experience, without being [...] able to analyse it, was, that when the demand is constant, [...] the price varies as the quantity of labour required for [...] production; or,--using the <b>formula</b> <b>I</b> gave in last [...] paper--when y is constant, xy varies as x. But demand [...] never is, nor can be, ultimately constant, if x varies [...] distinctly; for, as price rises, consumers fall away; and as [...] soon as there is a monopoly (and all scarcity is a form of [...] monopoly; so that every commodity is affected occasionally [...] by some colour of monopoly), y becomes the most [...] influential condition of the price. Thus the price of a [...] painting depends less on its merit than on the interest [...] taken in it by the public; the price of singing less on the [...] labour of the singer than the number of persons who desire [...] to hear him; and the price of gold less on the scarcity [...] which affects it in common with cerium or iridium, than on [...] the sun-light colour and unalterable purity by which it [...] attracts the admiration and answers the trust of mankind.|$|E

50|$|Development of {{selective}} ATR agonists and antagonists aided {{the discovery of}} ATRs' functional roles within the nervous system. 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo4,5-pyridine derivatives were the first compounds described to have antagonizing properties at the AT2 receptors. Inventors at Warner-Lambert Company LLC substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline with various functional groups to create numerous compounds of <b>formula</b> <b>I</b> that had improved affinity for ATR. EMA400, the racemate drug to EMA401, was originally Compound 6, one of the 48 compounds of <b>formula</b> <b>I.</b> Compound 6 had higher binding affinity for ATR, {{compared to the other}} 48 compounds, with an IC value of 2.8 nM in a rabbit uterus binding assay. It was also inactive in the ATR binding assay at concentrations of 10-5 M, suggesting high selectivity for ATR. Example 47, the S-enantiomer of Compound 6 and later named EMA401, was at the time an unanalyzed compound of <b>formula</b> <b>I.</b> Compound 6, under the name PD-126,055, and five other ATR antagonists (PD-123,319, L-159,686, PD-121,981, L-161,638 and L-163,579) were reported to have previously unknown analgesic properties by investigators from the University of Queensland. Greater understanding of the pathobiology of neuropathic pain had been and still is of high demand, as is better neuropathic pain relief medication. By 2020, the neuropathic pain treatment market is projected to reach $3.6 billion USD. The report on those six drugs was the first to clearly elucidate the role of angiotensin II type 2 receptors in neuropathic pain and implicated ATR antagonists as potential drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
