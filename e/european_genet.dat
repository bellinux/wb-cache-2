40|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective se- rologic survey for antibodies against the MPB 70 protein of Mycobacterium bovis in wild carni- vores from Don˜ ana National Park (southwest- ern Spain). Serum samples from 118 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), 39 Iberian lynx (Lynx pardi- nus), 31 Eurasian badgers (Meles meles), five Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon), four <b>European</b> <b>genet</b> (Genetta genetta), and one Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) {{were analyzed using}} an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay. Antibodies against the MPB 70 protein of M. bovis were detected in seven badgers, five foxes, and one lynx. The frequency of positive animals was significantly higher in badger (23 %) than in lynx (3 %) and fox (4 %). Antibodies were not detected in other species. Annual antibody frequency peaked at 38 % in badgers and 11 % for red fox. These species may contribute to persistence of bovine tuberculosis in Don˜ ana. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{ecology and}} {{behavior}} of eight <b>European</b> <b>genets,</b> Genetta genetta, were studied over 2 years by radiotracking in southwestern Spain. Genets were exclusively noc­ turnal, starting activity after sunset and ending before sunrise. Time spent in activity av­ eraged 28 % daily {{and seemed to be}} influenced by individual body mass and movement distances. Distance traveled averaged 2. 8 kin/day, apparently influenced by individual body mass, distance between resting sites, and habitat composition within home range. Resting sites were thickets (69 %, n = 546) and trees (31 %; mainly hollow trees). Seven individuals were sampled > 70 days and averaged 16. 3 sites for resting. Re-use rate of resting sites was 5. 3 times/site. Mean distance between consecutive resting sites was 728 m, although the distance was shorter for young than for adults. Ash stands were the only vegetation type used more than expected, both for resting and for activity; other types were seldom used. Maximum size of home ranges averaged 7. 8 km 2. Ash stands represented an average of 14 % of the home-range area and seemed to determine shape and size of the home range. Home ranges of adult males and females overlapped greatly, but intrasexual overlap was minimal, suggesting that animals were territorial. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Microsatellite markers were {{developed}} to assess population structure and patterns of trans- location in the introduced <b>European</b> common <b>genet</b> (Genetta genetta). Primer pairs were designed for 60 microsatellite sequences enriched for CA, GA, CATC and TAGA repeat motifs. Eleven loci {{that proved to be}} polymorphic were genotyped in 33 individuals from southwestern France. The number of alleles per locus and observed heterozygosities varied from three to seven and from 0. 2121 to 0. 7576, respectively. One locus (B 103) showed signif- icant departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, probably due to the presence of null alleles. Tests of linkage disequilibrium did not detect significant associations among loci. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the largest}} colonies of griffon {{vultures}} in Europe, as well as Spanish Ibex, Roe Deer, Wild Boar, <b>European</b> badgers, common <b>genets,</b> grey wagtails, among others, have their habitat in these lonely mountains. Among the aquatic animals there are trout {{in some of the}} rivers and amphibians such as the Marbled newt in many of the ponds of the range.|$|R
50|$|The heavy {{depopulation}} has favored wildlife, so {{that one}} of the last colonies of griffon vultures in Europe is in the Iberian System. Wolves and eagles (Aquila chrysaetos, Hieraaetus fasciatus, Hieraaetus pennatus, Circaetus gallicus) are also relatively common in the lonely heights. Among the mammals, the Spanish ibex, roe deer, wild boar, <b>European</b> badgers, common <b>genets,</b> among others, have their habitat in many of these desolate mountain ranges.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the autumn-winter diet of three carnivores (Mustela lutreola, Lutra lutra and Genetta genetta) in northern Spain. Diet composition was analysed from 85 European mink, 156 otter and 564 spotted genet fecal samples The European mink diet {{was based on}} small mammals (relative frequency of occurrences 38. 1 %), fish (30. 9 %) and birds (16. 7 %). Spotted genet consumed mainly small mammals, birds and fruits, whilst otter predated practically only fish (95 %). Using Levins' index, trophic-niche widths in <b>European</b> mink, small-spotted <b>genet</b> and Eurasian otter were 3. 76, 3. 77 and 1. 10, respectively. The trophic niche overlap by Pianka index for autumn-winter was 0. 77 for European mink vs. Small-spotted genet, and 0. 60 for European mink vs. otter.

5000|$|Walls of Jericho {{were formed}} {{following}} {{the demise of}} two Detroit based bands. The first being the influential Earthmover, featuring members Mike Hasty (guitar) and Wes Keely (drums). The second was a band called Universal Stomp which Aaron Ruby (bass) played in. Both bands fizzled out at {{around the same time}} prompting the three friends to start a new band. At the same time Candace Kucsulain, 2 year singer for the band Apathemy auditioned with the band. After numerous other auditions for lead singer the band accepted Candace as their new frontwoman in September 1998. For the first few months the band would perform with friends of theirs filling in on guitar however later decided to ask close friend Chris Rawson in as full-time member who was able to offer more commitment to the band. With the line-up complete the five piece began touring the local Detroit hardcore scene. Soon after in April 1999 the band released their first EP on 7" [...] through label Underestimated, which was followed shortly thereafter by a CD EP containing that 7" [...] and demo tracks, called A Day and a Thousand Years released on Florida based Eulogy Recordings. This was later released by <b>European</b> imprint <b>Genet.</b> After continuous touring in support of their EP releases, the band attracted the attention of both Ferret and Trustkill Records. They went on to sign with Trustkill which resulted in the December 1999 release of their debut full-length album The Bound Feed the Gagged. The band hit the touring and hardcore festival circuit the following year. In August 2000 they began touring the United States in support of straight-edgers Earth Crisis, Swedish melodic death metal band In Flames, and Oakland, CA's metallic Skinlab. After another spate of touring in 2001, drummer Wes Keely announced he would be leaving the band to finish school in Seattle, Washington. With the band based in Detroit it would prove impossible for them to continue together. Keely was replaced by ex Suicide Machines drummer Derek Grant. Five months after touring with the band Grant announced he would be leaving to join Chicago punk rockers Alkaline Trio.|$|R

Se describe la dieta otoño-invernal de tres carnívoros (Mustela lutreola, Lutra lutra y Genetta genetta) en el norte de España. La dieta fue analizada a partir de 85 muestras de visón europeo, 156 de nutria euroasiática y 564 de gineta común. El visón europeo basó su dieta en micromamíferos (38, 1 % de frecuencia relativa), peces (30, 9 %) y aves (16, 7 %). La gineta común consumió principalmente micromamíferos, aves y frutos, mientras la nutria predó casi exclusivamente peces (95 %). Los índices de Levins de la anchura del nicho trófico del visón europeo, la gineta común y la nutria fueron 3, 76, 3, 77 y 1, 10 respectivamente. Los solapamientos del nicho trófico durante otoño-invierno del visón europeo (índice de Pianka) respecto a la gineta común y la nutria euroasiática fueron 0, 77 y 0, 60, respectivamente. El tamaño medio de las truchas consumidas por las nutrias fue mayor que el de las consumidas por el visón europeo.
