40|$|PRIOR to {{the present}} century, the subject of mutuality in {{specific}} performance was an unsolved puzzle. The decisions of the courts were in the main wise, but the attempts both of courts and text writers to formulate a statement of the principle governing these decisions were far from happy. After two centuries of litigation and discussion, the current formula was that the remedy must be mutual, must be equally available to both parties. The worst fault of this formula was its plausibility. <b>Equality</b> <b>is</b> <b>equity,</b> and perfect equality between the parties to a contract is not attained unless remedies are equally available to both. The plausibility of the doctrine served to keep it alive, even to this day...|$|E

Ethics refer to standards of what people believe is morally the right or wrong thing to do. There are many ethical standards to which we can adhere in distributive settings.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{equality}} and <b>equity</b> measures has <b>been</b> introduced by the British Government to tackle the seemingly intractable problems of Northern Ireland. These measures represent a range of initiatives {{in the areas of}} social need, fair employment, education reform and community relations. The implementation of the community relations programme is considered in some detail as a case study in improving equality and equity in Northern Ireland. Qualitative data from community relations officers, charged with implementing the policy, are examined in the light of problems encountered with the programme. The influences on delivering community relations, as one component of this comprehensive thrust to attain <b>equality</b> and <b>equity,</b> <b>are</b> also considered using an explanatory model. The article concludes that changes in attitudes and behaviour between the two communities are occurring, albeit slowly, promoted by the measures described. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

40|$|The {{ideology}} and commitment {{of social justice}} principles is central to Early Years practice, however, the term social justice in education is complex and remains contested. This paper explores the ideology of social justice through links between equality and equity {{and how it is}} embedded within Early Years, and what remain the potential challenges for leadership. Interviews in English multi-cultural and mono-cultural primary schools were conducted. Findings showed that the ideology of social justice, <b>equality</b> and <b>equity</b> <b>was</b> interpreted differently. Multi-cultural schools appear to use a greater variety of activities to embed social justice principles that involved their diverse communities more to enrich the curriculum. In mono-cultural schools leadership had to be more creative in promoting equality and equity given the smaller proportion of their diverse pupil and staff population. Tentative conclusions suggest that the vision for permeating equality and equity in Early Years, at best, is at early stages...|$|R
40|$|Is {{education}} a {{human right}} or a driver of economic development? How international organisations frame their strategies {{is determined to}} a great extent by their response to this question. This chapter argues that a sound education system is one that is rights-based and seeks to achieve social cohesion, equality of access, and equity of opportunity. Efforts to generate economic returns from education to individuals and societies, while important, should not dominate development policies. As the post- 2015 Development Agenda emerges, tensions between those who perceive education as a human right and those who see it as a tool of economic development are increasingly coming to the fore, notably due to growing influence and interest among international private entities, both foundations and corporations, in steering the agenda towards the development of market opportunities. The author argues that preserving {{the role of the state}} as the ultimate democratic arbiter of rights, <b>equality,</b> and <b>equity</b> <b>is</b> the only way, albeit imperfect, of guaranteeing education as a public good...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have studied {{equality}} and equity from an HR perspective in South Africa. The study is partly made from an inductive approach and an analytical interpretation {{in line with}} hermeneutic has been used. The data is mainly contracted from interviews with HR professionals within various South African organizations. A mix of snowball and convenience sample has been used and among our respondents {{there are a variety}} and mix of the following variables: gender, position (manager/practitioner), race (blacks/white) and organization sector(public/parastatal/private). Our main findings <b>are</b> that <b>equality</b> and <b>equity</b> <b>are</b> highly debated topics and that the laws regulating them have a major effect on the HR professionals’ dailywork. The study gives us various perspectives of employment equity but a majority of our respondents do believe that the regulation of employment <b>equity</b> <b>is</b> needed. We find that there are obstacles for achieving equality in South African workplaces and our respondents have given us examples of different ways of how to tackle them. Many of our respondents are also of the opinion that {{there is a lack of}} implementation of the regulations and that it is time to rewrite several Acts...|$|R

Gender parity, {{which is used to}} measure gender balance in a given situation, can aid in achieving gender <b>equality</b> but <b>is</b> not the goal in and of itself.

As of 2017, the global movement for gender equality has not incorporated the proposition of genders besides women and men, or gender identities outside of the gender binary.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} the interest was {{to understand the}} discursive formation of educational equality in political texts concerning the national core curriculum in Finland in the beginning of 2010 s. The research problem was to describe and analyze discourses of educational equality and to analyze who are portrayed as actors of educational equality. The material consists of statements which different organizations, administrative bodies of education and private individuals gave in response to presentations, prepared in 2010 and 2012, regarding the objectives of the comprehensive school and the distribution of lesson hours. The research is based on critical discourse analysis and the analysis of social actors. This research showed that educational equality in unified schooling and in equal preparedness for further studies and as regional and socio-economic <b>equality</b> <b>is</b> still represented as a strong ideological and political will in Finnish educational policy. The research showed the multi-threaded nature of the concept of educational equality and the combination of new interpretations with established, historically formed discourses. Six discourses of educational <b>equality</b> <b>were</b> identified from the research material: common school, differentiation, legal, state control, freedom and internationality discourse. Pupils, freedom of choice, <b>equality</b> and <b>equity</b> <b>are</b> represented as the active actors of educational equality. Schools, local authorities, pupils and legislation are positioned as pas- sive actors. Day-to-day educators, such as parents, teachers and other members of personnel at schools are excluded from being actors of educational equality. The policy of educational equality consists mostly of Finnish policy. Based on {{this research}} it is possible to argue that due to its many meanings and static nature, educational equality has become a concept which is hard to grasp. Its meaning is based on existence and positive characteristics but its humane factors are mainly gone. At the same time several partly contradictory meanings lessen the explanatory power of educational equality and it can be described as a floating concept...|$|R
40|$|Achieving {{economic}} growth while reducing poverty in an equitable manner demands that governments in Sub-Saharan Africa commit actions {{and resources to}} address gender inequalities, even more so under a changing climate {{which is expected to}} widen social inequalities (Dankelman, 2012). Internationally, the UN asserts that achieving gender equality, development and peace must be supported by explicit budgetary allocation to targeted activities to ensure gender equality at all scales (OSAGI, 2001). Over the past two decades, Uganda has advanced gender equality and empowerment of women. Uganda’s commitment to promote gender <b>equality</b> and <b>equity</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by enacting the National Gender Policy (1997, revised in 2007). Other components of the political and legal efforts to tackle gender inequality include (i) the 1995 Constitution of Uganda in articles 32 (3 & 4); (ii) the Equal Opportunities Act (2007); (iii) the Public Finance Management Act (2015); and (iv) the National Development Plan II (2015 / 16 - 2019 / 20). However, despite all these initiatives, effective gender mainstreaming as a strategy for addressing gender inequalities remains a big challenge, as manifested by Uganda’s Gender Inequality Index of 0. 538, ranking 122 out of 155 countries in the 2014 index (UNDP, 2015) ...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{health has}} emerged as an {{organizational}} framework that incorporates men into {{maternal and child health}} (MCH) programs. For several decades, medical anthropologists have conducted reproductive health research that explores male partners' effects on women's health and the health of children. This article summarizes exemplary research in this area, showing how ethnographic studies by medical anthropologists contribute new insights to the growing public health and demographic literature on men and reproductive health. The first half of the article begins by exploring reproductive rights, examining the concept from an anthropological perspective. As part of this discussion, the question of <b>equality</b> versus <b>equity</b> <b>is</b> addressed, introducing anthropological perspectives on ways to incorporate men fairly into reproductive health programs and policies. The second half of the article then turns to a number of salient examples of men's relevance in the areas of contraception, abortion, pregnancy and childbirth, infertility, and fetal harm. Medical anthropological research [...] as well as prominent gaps in that research [...] is highlighted. The article concludes with thoughts on future areas of anthropological research that may improve understandings of men's influences on women's reproductive health.

40|$|AbstractThe {{history of}} Islam had not itself been {{previously}} confronted {{with what is}} now called “women's issues,” despite the great diversity in customs and cultures among Muslims over the centuries. As a result of their encounter with the West, however, and its particular history during the Dark Ages, calls for the liberation of women have begun to be loud. Though these have found their way into the discourse of those living in Muslim societies, {{the truth is that the}} Muslim woman has been liberated for centuries under Islamic rule. What is striking in this new discourse is the way in which it puts women against men in a continuous struggle and state of competition. Islam, however, is a religion which recognizes the equal status of men and women in the eyes of God, as is attested by numerous passages in the Holy Qur’an. The most fundamental aspect of this status is the unity of the human spirit shared by both genders. As Allah says “O mankind! Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad a multitude of men and women. Be careful of your duty toward Allah in whom ye claim (your rights) of one another, and toward the wombs (that bare you) ”. The fundamental principle is that both men and women are honored members of creation, possessing equality with respect to spirituality and worship. Following from this spiritual and legal <b>equality</b> <b>is</b> the <b>equity</b> envisioned by Islam in the social relations between men and women. Socially, the relationship between them is one of complementarity, and not of competition. As the Qur’an says, “And in no wise covet those things in which Allah Hath bestowed His gifts More freely on some of you than on others: To men is allotted what they earn, and to women what they earn: But ask Allah of His bounty”. From this follows the concept of social equity, and not identity. This standpoint maintains the distinction between men as men, and women as women, a distinction which has come under attack from some materialist philosophies. Either of the two genders fulfills its role in life in accordance with its natural specificities and responsibilities...|$|R
