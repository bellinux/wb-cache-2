Alternatively, conjoint analysis (a ranking of users' preferences which can then be statistically analysed) may be used. Approximate estimates of price elasticity can be calculated from the <b>income</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand, under conditions of preference independence. This approach has been emprirically validated using bundles of goods (e.g. food, healthcare, education, recreation, etc.).|$|E

40|$|A popular {{functional}} {{form for}} modeling the consumption block of a {{computable general equilibrium}} model (CGE) is the Linear Expenditure System (LES) for which the Engel curves are straight lines. The LES {{does not allow for}} the existence of inferior commodities, elastic demand and for gross substitution. To calibrate the parameters outside information on <b>income</b> <b>elasticities</b> and on the expenditure elasticity of the marginal utility of expenditure (Frisch parameter) is needed. In this paper we propose to use the Indirect Addilog System (IAS) that allows for non-straight Engel curves, inferior commodities, elastic demand and gross substitution, and for which the outside data requirement is the same as for LES. In the empirical part we estimate the <b>income</b> <b>elasticities</b> of the IAS from the 1998 Palestinian Expenditure and Consumption Survey (PECS). We replace the LES consumption block with a priori fixed <b>income</b> <b>elasticities</b> of the CGE model, that we previously constructed for Palestine based on the 1998 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), by the IAS with estimated <b>income</b> <b>elasticities</b> and perform a sensitivity analysis for the choice of the Frisch parameter. A comparison with the results obtained by the LES-model with the same <b>income</b> <b>elasticities</b> makes it possible to further clarify the importance of using a IAS to represent consumption behaviors.

Results found suggest GDP to be a major determinant of the Health and POS drug-related public expenditures of a country. Labelled drug-related public expenditure showed a positive association with the GDP across the countries considered: r = 0.81 in the case of Health, and r = 0.91 for POS. The percentage change in Health and POS expenditures due to a one percent increase in GDP (the <b>income</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand) was estimated to be 1.78% and 1.23% respectively.|$|E
25|$|In economics, the Laffer {{curve is}} a {{theoretical}} {{representation of the}} relationship between government revenue raised by taxation and all possible rates of taxation. It is used to illustrate the concept of taxable <b>income</b> <b>elasticity</b> (that taxable income will change in response to changes in the rate of taxation). The curve is constructed by thought experiment. First, the amount of tax revenue raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% is considered. It is clear that a 0% tax rate raises no revenue, but the Laffer curve hypothesis is that a 100% tax rate will also generate no revenue because at such a rate {{there is no longer any}} incentive for a rational taxpayer to earn any income, thus the revenue raised will be 100% of nothing. If both a 0% rate and 100% rate of taxation generate no revenue, it follows from the extreme value theorem that there must exist at least one rate in between where tax revenue would be a maximum. The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph which starts at 0% tax, zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue raised at an intermediate rate of taxation and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate.|$|E

40|$|One {{might expect}} that {{differences}} in <b>income</b> <b>elasticities</b> in trade and/or differences in growth rates among countries would give rise to strong secular trends in real exchange rates; for example, fast-growing countries might need steady depreciation to get the world to accept their growing exports. In fact, however, <b>income</b> <b>elasticities</b> are systematically related to growth rates by the " 45 -degree rule", under which fast-growing countries appear to face high <b>income</b> <b>elasticities</b> of demand for their exports, while having low <b>income</b> <b>elasticities</b> of import demand. The net effect of this relationship between elasticities and growth rates is that secular trends in real exchange rates are much smaller than one might otherwise have expected: relative PPP holds fairly well. This paper documents {{the existence of a}} " 45 -degree rule", and suggests an explanation in terms of increasing returns and product differentiation. ...|$|R
