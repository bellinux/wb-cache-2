5|$|Skyline Drive was {{originally}} lined with miles of chestnut log <b>guardrails.</b> However, the <b>guardrails</b> rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced. The Marys Rock Tunnel was partially lined with concrete in 1958 to prevent icicles {{in the winter}} and water seepage in the summer. In 1983, the Federal Highway Administration began work to replace several of the original stone walls on the drive with concrete walls that used the original stone as a veneer. The road was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1997. On September 22, 2005, Skyline Drive was designated a National Scenic Byway. Skyline Drive was designated a National Historic Landmark in October 2008 for its pioneering place in the development of national parks in the eastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{interchanges}} {{were built}} along the turnpike, {{most of which}} were trumpet interchanges where all ramps merge at the toll booths; only the New Stanton, Carlisle and Middlesex interchanges did not follow this design. Lighting was installed approaching interchanges, along with acceleration and deceleration lanes. The road also featured <b>guardrails,</b> consisting of steel panels attached to I-beams. Large exit signs were used, and road signs had cat's-eye reflectors to increase visibility at night; billboards were prohibited. In September 1940, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ruled that trucks and buses would be allowed to use the highway.|$|E
5|$|The Main Cell Block {{was built}} in two stages. Construction of the {{southern}} half of the block began in 1853 {{and most of the}} masonry works were finished within a year. The section was finished in 1855, including the association wards, a circular jarrah stairwell, and 18 solitary confinement cells in the Refractory Block. However, iron fittings for the <b>guardrails,</b> which had been ordered from England three years previously, still had not arrived. Anxious for the new cell block to start being used, Henderson ordered that doors and rails be made locally, with iron salvaged from convict transport ships. The obvious transition between the local and imported railing now marks the boundary between the southern and northern wings. Prisoners were transferred from the temporary South Beach prison on 1 June 1855.|$|E
30|$|A {{possible}} {{application is}} wooden <b>guardrail</b> beam that utilizes small logs. Although steel W-beam <b>guardrail</b> and steel post {{are widely used}} currently, wood {{can be a great}} material for the <b>guardrail</b> because of the ability of the carbon sink and beauty. Wooden post and steel W-beam <b>guardrail</b> have been developed and already used [4 – 6]. Zhang et al. [7] developed another wooden <b>guardrail</b> system which consists of cedar round timber beam and concrete post. <b>Guardrail</b> beam is an important road facility to save a life. The <b>guardrail</b> beams should satisfy the requirements of structural performance. One of the requirements is that the <b>guardrail</b> beam should have enough strength to withstand the force of vehicle impact.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to develop a}} <b>Guardrail</b> Asset Management Framework and a Condition-Based Model to assist {{agencies}} in the development of <b>guardrail</b> preservation programs. Both of the <b>guardrail</b> asset management tools can be incorporated into an existing asset management program to assist agencies in utilizing <b>guardrail</b> inventory to forecast key asset management parameters such as the <b>guardrail</b> condition, funds necessary for maintenance and repair, backlogged funding, <b>guardrail</b> system value, and the <b>guardrail</b> sustainability ratio. Each of these parameters is described and determined for a case study involving six scenarios modeling funding and maintenance constraints that can arise in an asset management program. ^ The <b>Guardrail</b> Asset Management Framework is {{to be used as a}} guide, by state and local agencies, to determine key asset management objectives and practices that contribute to the use of the Condition-Based Model. The Condition-Based Model produces results that can be used to monitor the <b>guardrail</b> system. In monitoring the <b>guardrail</b> system, the agency can then adjust the asset management objectives and practices to better fit to the agency’s goals and available resources. Utilizing the <b>guardrail</b> asset management tools can assist agencies in the development or advancement of their <b>guardrail</b> asset management and preservation programs. ...|$|R

5|$|Field {{survey for}} the roadway began in January 1931. On July 18 of that year, an {{official}} groundbreaking for Skyline Drive took place. The {{first section of}} the road was to be built from the Rapidan Camp to the Skyland Resort, but would be extended from Swift Run Gap to Thornton Gap. The funds for the first stretch of the drive came from the Federal Drought Relief Administration and employed local farmers and apple pickers who suffered from a severe drought in 1930. In the later part of 1932, Congress approved $1 million (equivalent to $ in ,) in funds to construct Skyline Drive, which would extend from Front Royal to Swift Run Gap. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was formed in 1933 and would have {{a hand in the}} construction of Skyline Drive. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was impressed with the scenery of the mountains and established the first CCC camps along Skyline Drive. These camps were the first to be placed in a national park. The CCC graded the slopes {{on both sides of the}} roadway, built <b>guardrails</b> and stone walls, constructed overlooks, and planted thousands of trees and shrubs along the parkway. Three different companies were awarded contracts for bituminous surfacing of the road. The section of Skyline Drive between Thornton Gap and Swift Run Gap opened in the middle part of 1934 and cost $1,570,479 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the roadway included the Marys Rock Tunnel, a tunnel that was bored through Marys Rock. A tunnel was constructed at this location as opposed to a cut. The tunnel was justified as a money-saving measure but was also suggested to challenge Bureau of Public Roads and National Park Service landscape architects. With the official establishment of Shenandoah National Park in 1935, the CCC hired 300 men, most of whom were not local to the area, to continue to build Skyline Drive. On October 1, 1936, the drive was completed between Front Royal and Thornton Gap at a cost of $1,235,177 (equivalent to $ in ,). The portion of Skyline Drive from Swift Run Gap to Jarman Gap was opened to traffic on August 29, 1939, costing $1,666,528 (equivalent to $ in ,). The road between Jarman Gap and Rockfish Gap was built as part of the Blue Ridge Parkway and was completed on August 11, 1939, at a cost of $358,636 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the Blue Ridge Parkway was given to Shenandoah National Park in 1961 and became the southernmost portion of Skyline Drive. The creation of the park and the construction of Skyline Drive resulted in many people losing their homes either voluntarily or forcibly; several homes within the present-day park were razed.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the issue of fatal motorcycle collisions with <b>guardrail</b> based on U. S. accident statistics. Motorcycle crashes were found to be the leading source of fatalities in <b>guardrail</b> crashes. In 2005 for the first time, motorcycle riders suffered more fatalities (224) than the passengers of cars (171) or any other single vehicle type involved in a <b>guardrail</b> collision. In terms of fatalities per registered vehicle, motorcycle riders are dramatically overrepresented in number of fatalities resulting from <b>guardrail</b> impacts. Motorcycles compose only 2 % of the vehicle fleet, but account for 42 % of all fatalities resulting from <b>guardrail</b> collisions. Motorcycle-guardrail crash fatalities are a growing problem. From 2000 - 2005, the number of car occupants who were fatally injured in <b>guardrail</b> collisions declined by 31 % from 251 to 171 deaths. In contrast, the number of motorcyclists fatally-injured in <b>guardrail</b> crashes increased by 73 % from 129 to 224 fatalities during the same time period. Over two-thirds of motorcycle riders who were fatally injured in a <b>guardrail</b> crash were wearing a helmet. Approximately, one in eight motorcyclists who struck a <b>guardrail</b> were fatally injured – a fatality risk over 80 times higher than for car occupants involved in a collision with a <b>guardrail...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Guardrail</b> is {{intended}} to deflect. The amount of deflection is dependent {{on a number of}} factors some of which include type and weight of impacting vehicle, height the <b>guardrail</b> is placed, type of soil the posts may be embedded within, length of embeddment of the posts, and distance of the hinge point to the face of <b>guardrail</b> are just a few. A <b>guardrail</b> that deflects significantly can causes pocketing which has the potential to snag a vehicle which may cause it to flip or rollroll, or cause the rail to fail allowing a vehicle to penetrate the <b>guardrail.</b>|$|R

25|$|Building on {{his first}} {{guardrail}} designs, Sicking developed the first guardrail system capable of safely accommodating light trucks and SUV’s. As {{the center of gravity}} and bumper heights of SUV’s and light trucks increased, pre-1990 <b>guardrails</b> that based their designs on low bumper height vehicles were no longer sufficient. Larger vehicles began to exhibit a tendency to rollover, vault, or rupture <b>guardrails.</b> Sicking led his team to develop a guardrail system that addressed the needs of all vehicle, increasing the rail mounting height, moving rail splices from the posts to the midspan, and increasing blockout depth by four inches. To date, 27 states have adopted this guardrail design, 10 more are currently adopting it, and the remaining 13 have adopted or are evaluating slight variation of this system.|$|E
40|$|After {{a violent}} crash {{that took place}} at the {{entrance}} of the road on a bridge, the <b>guardrail</b> installed as protection collapsed and the vehicle left the roadway. As {{at the base of a}} number of <b>guardrail</b> posts, a situation of severe corrosion was found evident, its inﬂuence on the resistance and on the mode of collapse of the <b>guardrail</b> was explored. To this purpose, the information about the state of the place collected immediately after the accident and the plastic deformations observed on the deformed <b>guardrail</b> contributed decisively to reconstructing the dynamics of the impact. Later, using the same assumptions and the same methods of calculation used to assess the strength of the <b>guardrail</b> in a condition of degradation, the impact of a similar <b>guardrail</b> in perfect structural conditions was simulated. The comparison between the two analyses indicated the limited inﬂuence of corrosion on the <b>guardrail</b> in question and on the dynamics of the accident that had occurred...|$|R
50|$|Lastly, {{a vehicle}} can become {{airborne}} upon striking a <b>guardrail</b> with a buried end treatment if the slope {{to which the}} end anchor is buried is relatively flat (3:1 or flatter), which may negate {{the purpose of the}} <b>guardrail,</b> if the vehicle continues beyond the <b>guardrail</b> and strikes the object the <b>guardrail</b> was protecting. Additionally, an airborne vehicle is likely to collide in a manner that the vehicle was not designed for, increasing the risk of failure in the vehicle's collision safety systems. <b>Guardrail</b> will have some give and deflection upon impact. The amount of deflection depends on many factors of which speed and weight of vehicle, type of <b>guardrail</b> installed, height of rail, length of posts, soil conditions {{and a number of other}} factors can all play a role. <b>Guardrail</b> must be installed so that it is not so rigid that the rail will fail upon impact or the posts will snap off at the point where they are embedded within the ground.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{installations}} of <b>guardrail</b> {{are designed}} to allow the guiderail to deform under the load of the crash, and safely redirecting a vehicle back onto the roadway at a somewhat shallow angle.

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} an {{increased number of}} vehicles and increased vehicle speed on roads such that the frequency and severity of run-off roadway accidents has increased dramatically. Evaluation of <b>guardrail</b> system performance as an element of providing a safe environment for vehicles and to reduce occupant injuries is deemed to be vital issue. Hence, this paper is going to assess deflection and vehicle trajectory of current <b>guardrail</b> systems. For this purpose, the results of full-scale crash tests for different types of <b>guardrail</b> system are collected from previous crash tests available in the literature. The results showed that for Test 3 - 11 (according to NCHRP Report 350) with similar post spacing (1905 mm), the trend of vehicle exit speed declined while <b>guardrail</b> maximum permanent deflection increased. In addition, among all system types, <b>guardrail</b> with curb and Thrie-beam <b>guardrail</b> systems were subjected to the lowest amount of deflection although Thrie-beam <b>guardrail</b> was subjected to higher average values for both vehicle exit speed and exit angle. Further, weak-post <b>guardrail</b> system showed to have the highest maximum dynamic and permanent deformation compared to other systems whereas it caused the lowest exit angle to the vehicles...|$|R

5000|$|In traffic engineering, highway <b>guardrail</b> {{may prevent}} an errant vehicle from hitting {{roadside}} obstacles {{which may be}} either man-made (sign structures, culvert inlets, utility poles) or natural (trees, rock croppings), running {{off the road and}} going down a steep embankment, or veering off the roadway into oncoming traffic (commonly referred to as a median barrier). Roadside obstacles are typically referred to as fixed objects. A secondary objective is keeping the vehicle upright while deflected along the <b>guardrail.</b> The most common type of <b>guardrail</b> in use today is the Blocked-Out W-beam (Strong Post). [...] Strong-post W-beam <b>guardrail</b> consists of wood posts and wood blockouts or steel posts with wood or plastic blockouts. The wood or plastic blockouts reduce or minimize a vehicle snagging on the posts upon impact. In addition, a blockout may be used to increase the offset of <b>guardrail</b> with an obstacle such as a curb.The posts' primary purpose is to maintain the height of the <b>guardrail</b> during the initial stages of post deflection. [...] Maintaining <b>guardrail</b> height also reduces the potential for a vehicle to vault over the <b>guardrail</b> upon initial impact. The posts also {{play a role in the}} amount of resistance and deflection a <b>guardrail</b> may experience during impact. Resistance in a strong post system results from a combination of tensile and flexural stiffness of the rail and the bending and shearing resistance of the posts. [...] One of the main concerns with strong-post W-beam <b>guardrail</b> has been the ability of the system to contain and redirect modern vehicles that have a higher center of gravity along with the increased weight of those vehicles. The problem with this is that a <b>guardrail</b> of the optimum height for a car might not keep a truck from toppling over it, while a motorbike might slip under a higher rail. To address these concerns, significant research and development of a system that could contain and redirect vehicles of varying weights and heights was developed and crash tested (both controlled and simulated). As a result, the Midwest <b>Guardrail</b> System (MGS) was developed and successfully crash tested per NCHRP Report 350 TL-3 criteria. [...] MGS has a higher mounting height, uses larger posts and blockouts as compared to the strong-post W-beam <b>guardrail.</b> One other significant difference is that MGS rail splices occur at mid-span compared to at the posts like the strong-post w-beam <b>guardrail.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{placement}} of energy attenuation devices (e.g. <b>guardrails,</b> wide grassy areas, sand barrels) is also common. Some road fixtures such as road signs and fire hydrants {{are designed to}} collapse on impact. Light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them. Highway authorities may also remove larger trees from the immediate vicinity of the road. During heavy rains, if the elevation of the road surface isn't higher than the surrounding landscape, it may result in flooding.|$|E

40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{increase in}} number of motorcycles and fatalities in some ASEAN countries is becoming a main concern {{for the safety of}} motorcyclists along exclusive motorcycle lanes. The existing w-beam <b>guardrail</b> system along exclusive motorcycle lanes was originally designed to reduce severity of a crash when cars and trucks involve in run-off road accident – but not specifically to protect motorcyclists during such accident. However, the consequences of this <b>guardrail</b> design on the passive safety of motorcyclist have been given little consideration. Thus, Probability of the motorcyclists getting injured on collision with <b>guardrail</b> is higher compared to other motor vehicle’s driver. In order to investigate the passive safety of motorcyclists while in collision with this <b>guardrail,</b> this study carried out computer simulation of typical crash scenario and conducted a physical crash test to validate the simulation model. The study examines the crash mechanism as related to injury severity when motorcyclist interacts with W-beam <b>guardrail.</b> A three-dimensional computer simulation of a scaled Hybrid III 50 th percentile Male dummy mounted on a motorcycle and colliding with W-beam <b>guardrail</b> was carried out.
