25|$|Initially, {{imported}} oil was taxed {{much more than}} British-produced coal, but in 1934 Oliver Stanley, the Minister for Transport, reduced taxes on <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> while raising the Road Fund charge on road locomotives to £100 per year, provoking protests by engine manufacturers, hauliers, showmen and the coal industry. This was {{at a time of}} high unemployment in the mining industry, when the steam haulage business represented a market of 950,000 tons of coal annually. The tax was devastating to the businesses of heavy hauliers and showmen and precipitated the scrapping of many engines.|$|E

In addition, this report explores the potential for nonresidential users to move away from distillate <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and how this might impact future prices, and discusses conversion of distillate <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> users to other fuels over the next 5 years. Because the President's and Secretary's request focused on converting factories and other large-volume users of mostly high-sulfur distillate <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> to other <b>fuels,</b> transportation sector use of low-sulfur distillate <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> is not examined here...|$|R

2500|$|Petroleum is used mostly, by volume, for {{producing}} fuel oil and gasoline, both important [...] "primary energy" [...] sources. 84 {{percent by volume}} of the hydrocarbons present in petroleum is converted into energy-rich fuels (petroleum-based fuels), including gasoline, diesel, jet, heating, and other <b>fuel</b> <b>oils,</b> and liquefied petroleum gas. The lighter grades of crude oil produce the best yields of these products, but as the world's reserves of light and medium oil are depleted, oil refineries are increasingly having to process heavy oil and bitumen, and use more complex and expensive methods to produce the products required. Because heavier crude oils have too much carbon and not enough hydrogen, these processes generally involve removing carbon from or adding hydrogen to the molecules, and using fluid catalytic cracking to convert the longer, more complex molecules in the oil to the shorter, simpler ones in the fuels.|$|E

2500|$|The 1859 {{discovery}} {{of crude oil}} in western Pennsylvania set off an [...] "oil rush" [...] reminiscent of the 1849 California Gold Rush and {{would prove to be}} a valuable resource {{on the eve of the}} Civil War. Because crude oil needs to be distilled to extract usable <b>fuel</b> <b>oils,</b> oil refining quickly became a major industry in the area. However, the rural and mountainous terrain of these Pennsylvania oilfields allowed neither economical in-situ refining nor efficient railroad transportation of extracted oil. Beginning in 1865, the construction of oil pipelines to connect the oilfields with railroads or oil refineries alleviated this geographical bottleneck but also put thousands of coopers and teamsters (who made the barrels and drove the wagons to transport oil) out of business. As the network of oil pipelines expanded, they became more integrated with both the railway and telegraph systems which enabled even greater coordination in production, scheduling, and pricing.|$|E
2500|$|Tractors {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running spark-ignition and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors {{of the era}} could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any light grade of fuel oil such as diesel fuel, heating oil, or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name [...] "distillate" [...] often referred {{to any of the}} aforementioned light <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> The engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. Engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.|$|E
2500|$|When {{biodiesel}} is cooled below {{a certain}} point, {{some of the}} molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than {{one quarter of the}} wavelengths of visible light – this is the cloud point (CP). As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a 45micrometre filter is the cold filter plugging point (CFPP). As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe, there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries. The temperature at which pure (B100) biodiesel starts to gel varies significantly and depends upon the mix of esters and therefore the feedstock oil used to produce the biodiesel. For example, biodiesel produced from low erucic acid varieties of canola seed (RME) starts to gel at approximately [...] Biodiesel produced from beef tallow and palm oil tends to gel at around [...] and [...] respectively. There are a number of commercially available additives that will significantly lower the pour point and cold filter plugging point of pure biodiesel. Winter operation is also possible by blending biodiesel with other <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> including #2 low sulfur diesel fuel and #1 diesel / kerosene.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{disastrous}} {{failure of the}} mid-June convoys, it was wondered if Malta could hold out on the meagre supplies rescued from [...] "Harpoon" [...] and [...] "Vigorous" [...] until another convoy could be organised. Escorting merchant ships in the brilliance of a Mediterranean moonlit period was courting inevitable disaster. This situation limited operations {{in the immediate future}} to the moonless period in July or August between the 10th and 16th of those months. July passed as the Ohio could not be fitted-out in time. Once the due planning had been carried out it was decided to begin the operation in August. Ohio steamed down to Dunglass on the Clyde and loaded 11,500 tons of kerosene and diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> She was the only ship carrying these supplies which were so vital to Malta's survival. Before she sailed special strengthening was given to the tanker to protect her against the shock of bombs exploding near her. In the previous convoy, the tanker Kentucky had been sunk with only a few hours' repair work needed on a steam pipe, which had been broken by the force of such explosions. The Ministry was determined that this should not happen again, and so Ohios engines were mounted on rubber bearings, to reduce shock, and all steam pipes were supported with steel springs and baulks of timber. While the merchant ships were gathering in the Clyde Estuary, the naval forces had already reached Scapa Flow. Admiral Syfret joined [...] there on 27 July and held a convoy conference on 2 August; the same day, all leave had been stopped.

During full power trials on 10 December 1940, King George V at 41,630 tons displacement achieved 111,700 shp at 230 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.715lb per shp. [...] After 1942 the Royal Navy was forced to use <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> with considerably higher viscosity and greater seawater content than these boilers could efficiently use. The poor quality of the oil fuel combined with the seawater contamination to reduce the efficiency of the steam power plant and increased the maintenance required. [...] By 1944 the specific full power fuel consumption had increased to 0.8lb per shp and boiler maintenance was becoming increasingly difficult. The Admiralty had been aware of this problem and were designing new types of oil sprayers and burners that could burn the available fuel oil much more efficiently, and sometime after 1944, Duke of York and Anson were fitted with new, higher pressure, oil sprayers and burners that restored the boilers to full efficiency. These same oil sprayers and burners were used in [...] along with other detail improvements so that Vanguard achieved a full power specific fuel consumption of 0.63lb per shp while using the same steam pressures and temperatures as used on the King George V class.|$|E
