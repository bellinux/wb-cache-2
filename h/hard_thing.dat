He liked its graphics but wrote that its music [...] "isn’t too hot". Buchanan enjoyed its multiplayer component and wrote that [...] "the slowdown when all four join in is minima—nice programming {{on the part of}} Looking Glass". Although he complained that the game's vehicle damage is not [...] "segmented throughout your car", he concluded by calling the game [...] "pure, unadulterated fun [...] has enough tracks and hidden vehicles to keep you playing for a very long time". Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote, [...] "Graphically, Destruction Derby 64 surpasses the old PlayStation games by quite a bit - not that that is a particularly <b>hard</b> <b>thing</b> to do". He found that its framerate was adequate even in split-screen mode, and concluded that it was [...] "a better game than its PlayStation counterparts". He finished, [...] "Give it a rent next time you're rounding up the posse for a day of gaming." ...|$|E

[...] While the Mexican Football Association did not object, they deferred to FIFA headquarters in Zurich for an official ruling.

[...] Furthermore, a ban was placed on Domínguez for playing in an exhibition game outside the league but still alongside men.

500|$|Co-writer Frank Spotnitz {{described}} the episode as a [...] "fortunate accident". Late {{in the fourth}} season of the show Gillian Anderson left the show for a week to film her part in the film The Mighty. The producers, knowing {{that they would have}} to write an episode without Dana Scully, decided it was not fair to have David Duchovny carry the same workload as in a normal episode considering her absence. As such, a story was devised in which his involvement would be light. This resulted in the decision to write, for the second year in a row, an episode focused on Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). Howard Gordon, having written the previous Skinner-centric episode, [...] "Avatar", joined Spotnitz and the two wrote the episode over a weekend while another Gordon-written episode, [...] "Synchrony", was in production. The writers felt that this was the perfect time to bring in Skinner's deal with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) to cure Scully's cancer, made in the episode [...] "Memento Mori". Frank Spotnitz said of Skinner's deal, [...] "The <b>hard</b> <b>thing</b> for Skinner was that we had to keep him in the middle. We had him tell Mulder not to bargain with The Smoking Man in order to save Scully's life. And then he himself struck a Faustian bargain with the Cigarette Smoking Man and was in his debt for some kind." ...|$|E

Neither of my opponents had a car and they didn’t want to chase after me on one of those velocipedes. A journalist from our circle of friends suggested cycling in a velodrome which is actually just as tiring, especially for someone who is not used to it. But I agreed. A few days later, one morning at ten, I began my laps in the Vélodrome d’Hiver. An hour went by and then another. The spectators, Fernand Léger was among them, cheered me on with increasing enthusiasm until quite unexpectedly the sound of a gong brought me to a halt. I had won my meal by my honourable average speed. (Metzinger) ...|$|E

2500|$|Some reviewers have criticised the game's control system. Eurogamers review {{stated that}} the jump timing {{sometimes}} feels [...] "off by {{a fraction of a}} fraction of a second" [...] and that this can be a minor annoyance when attempting challenges which require dexterity and timing.

He goes on to say that the character acceleration and deceleration [...] "isn't as quick as it could be" [...] but that his biggest complaint is the way the game handles player movement between foreground, middleground and background on the 2.5D plane. He says that [...] "there are instances where it doesn't do what you want it to do, and these points stick out like a sore thumb." [...] This is an issue that has been raised by Media Molecule's co-founder Mark Healey who stated in an interview that [...] "The Z [...] movement is an incredibly <b>hard</b> <b>thing</b> for us to get right. There's times when it annoys me actually." [...] He went on to say they would continue refining it, suggesting improvements via a future update IGN's review commented that the story mode ended [...] "in a somewhat disappointing manner" [...] and the story as a whole doesn't make sense.|$|E
