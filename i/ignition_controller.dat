50|$|An {{alternative}} to the pilot light is a system to create a high voltage electrical arc or spark between two electrodes, in order to light the gas flowing to the burner. Fail-safe design for such a system requires the burner flame to be detected by passing an electric current through the flame, which is received by the flame rectification circuit inside an <b>ignition</b> <b>controller</b> connected to the gas valve. Flame rectification occurs when electrons flow through the flame burning, which the <b>ignition</b> <b>controller</b> senses and knows the flame is there, keeping the gas valve open. If the appliance loses gas or the flame goes out, the <b>ignition</b> <b>controller</b> doesn't see the flame, closing the gas valve.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm and its hardware implementation on low-cost real-time embedded system implementing traction control for supermotard or motocross motorcycles. A key innovative feature, proposed in this work, {{is that the}} control of the torque is obtained introducing a cut in the ignition spark using a switch in parallel to the switch used to turn off the engine. Therefore, the torque control is obtained without modifying the <b>ignition</b> <b>controller</b> and it can be applied to every existing commercial motorcycle.|$|E

At T minus five minutes, the SRB safe and arm device is rotated to the arm position. The solid rocket motor ignition commands are issued when the three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) are at or above 90-percent rated thrust, no SSME fail and/or SRB <b>ignition</b> Pyrotechnic Initiator <b>Controller</b> (PIC) low voltage is indicated {{and there are no}} holds from the Launch Processing System (LPS).|$|R
40|$|Spark {{ignition}} engines {{have many}} advantages, but {{to increase the}} power and efficiency, {{they have a problem}} to set the right ignition timing, at which the maximum power can be achieved. In reality, the optimum ignition timing is immediately prior to, or close to knock (detonation). On the other hand, the value of this optimum ignition timing is dependent primarily on the rotation of the crank shaft and the level of throttle openings. To provide the right timing, it is very difficult if only using mechanical control system as found in conventional engines. So, in this study, a new electro-mechanical method based on Fuzzy Logic <b>Ignition</b> <b>Controller</b> (FLIC) which follows the pattern of the timing in the knock chart was created. In fact the results of the FLIC study, was able to provide correction for each ignition, according to the data on the chart of the optimal ignition timings for all combinations of engine rotations and throttle openings. From the final data recorded, {{it can be said that}} the FLIC able to push the power up to 15 % above normal, while eliminating the knock...|$|E
40|$|The rocket {{launching}} {{facilities were}} inaugurated in 1969 and completed in 1971 at Syowa Station (60 ° 002 ̆ 7 S, 39 ° 352 ̆ 7 E: geomagnetic lat. 69. 6 °S, long. 77. 1 °E). In the rocket range, about 500 m south-west {{of the main}} base: of Syowa, there are three buildings, namely a propellant magazine (10. 4 × 6. Om), a radar-telemeter hut (14. 4 × 6 m) and an assembly shop (12 × 7. 6 m) connected with a turntable. A turntable (8 m in diameter) {{in the center of}} the launching platform is at the same level as the floor of the assembly shop. A rocket carriage can be moved on rails from the assembly shop onto the launching turntable. Rotation of the turntable and movement of the launcher are remote-controlled. An iron-grating box covered with a vinyl sheet is attached to the launcher for keeping the rocket warm. The box is air-conditioned. The rocket is assembled and tested in the assembly shop and transferred to the turntable. The whole launching system is capable of firing a rocket with a diameter up to 350 mm. A radar-telemeter system and the igniter and timer controlers are installed in the radar-telemeter hut. A radar-tracking system with a power of 10 kW is used to measure the azimuth angle, the elevation angle, and the direct range, as well as to record telemeter signals in two channels transmitted by PPM modulation. The receiving frequency of the telemeter system is 290 MHz and the data in 12 channels is recorded. The control system consists of an <b>ignition</b> <b>controller,</b> a timer controller, and a probe controller. These control systems were designed to be operated by a limited number of technicians. There are two types of single-stage sounding rockets, S- 160 JA and S- 210 JA. Their specifications are as follows: [table] Butadiene solid propellant is used from the viewpoint of low temperaturecharacteristics. There is another type of rocket which will be used in the future; S- 310 JA type (payload 40 kg, peak altitude 220 km). These rockets were developed by the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science, University of Tokyo. In order to fire the rockets at the moment when auroral activities begin to show a drastic increase at the onset of an auroral substorm, some considerations were needed in the procedure of the firings in the Antarctic severe natural environment. As a result of many considerations and trainings, the rocket could be fired within one minute after the receiving of the introduction in the rocket launching. The ground-based observations were consolidated at Syowa Station, assisting the direct measurements of physical quantities in auroras by means of the sounding rockets. The instruments to be used in the auroral observations are: all-sky camera (35 mm, every 10 s), auroral zenith photometer (4278 A), multicolour geomagnetic meridian scanning photometers (4278, 5577, 6300 A, H_β), high sensitive TV camera and VHP auroral radar. It was 10 th February 1970 when the first launching of the sounding rocket was carried out at Syowa. Since then, four S- 160 JA type and nineteen S- 210 JA type rockets were flown during the period of the research program in 1970 - 1973. Objects of measurements were electron and ion densities, electric and magnetic fields, infrared and ultra-violet emissions, energetic paticles, X-rays and radiowave in aurora. Through the successful rocket flights, the significant information to reveal the physical nature of auroras was obtained. The present paper mainly reports on the progress of the research program by means of sounding rockets at Syowa Station in 1970 - 1973 concerning the transportation, the construction and maintenance of the launching facilities, arrangements of the rocket firing and tracking and the obtained results of the rocket flights. During the period of International Magnetospheric Study (IMS, 1976 - 1979), the rocket facilities will be reopened and more than twenty sounding rockets (S- 310 JA and S- 210 JA) are scheduled to be launched from Syowa Station...|$|E
