5000|$|<b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> are {{produced}} by specially calibrated X-ray machines generally operating in the 10 to 30 kV range to produce X-rays with HVL less than 0.035 mm in aluminum. (HVL is half-value layer, and refers to a thickness of a given material that will cut the X-ray flux by 50%). <b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> are absorbed by air and therefore treatments must be given at fixed distances for which the machine has been calibrated. In human tissue <b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> have a half-value depth of 0.5 mm and are essentially absorbed within the first 2 mm of skin. [...] The exact mechanism of action is unknown {{but it does have}} effects on the Langerhans cells in the epidermis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> {{are part}} of the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum comprising low energy (ultrasoft) X-rays. These were first investigated by Gustav Bucky in 1923 using a cathode vacuum tube with a lithium borate glass window, which he labeled <b>Grenz</b> <b>rays</b> as he believed that the biological effects resembled those of UV light and traditional X-rays and hence were on the border between the two (Grenz = border in German). These rays are also known as Bucky rays.|$|E

5000|$|On July 29, 1977, H.F., a 51-year-old teacher, was {{attempting}} to remove a casserole dish from her new 600-watt microwave oven. The oven signaled {{the end of the}} heating cycle, but the light and the cooking blower were on. During retrieval of the dish, she inserted two thirds of her bare forearms into the oven, for a total time of about five seconds. The oven was still operating. She felt [...] "hot pulsating sensation" [...] and burning in fingers and fingernails and a sensation of [...] "needles" [...] over the exposed areas. Jabbing pain, swelling, and red-orange discoloration of dorsal sides of both hands and forearms appeared shortly afterwards. The next day she sought medical help. Since then, she has undergone treatment with oral and topical cortisone, <b>Grenz</b> <b>rays,</b> ultrasound, and later acupuncture, without relief. Symptoms persisted, including high sensitivity to radiant heat (sun, desk lamp, etc.) and growing intolerance to pressure of clothes and to touch in hands and forearms. Neurological examinations in 1980 and 1981 did not yield a definite diagnosis. Neuronal latencies were within norm. Electromyography discovered denervation in the median nerve, ulnar nerve, and radial nerve on both arms. Severe reduction of number of sweat glands in the finger pulps, in comparison with a random control, was also found. The injury was determined to be caused by the full power of the magnetron; the pulsating sensation was caused either by the stirrer (a mechanical mirror distributing the microwave beam across the oven space to prevent formation of hot and cold spots), or by the arterial pulsation in combination with increased nerve sensitivity. Damage to the A beta fibers, A delta fibers, and group C nerve fibers was the cause of the burning sensation. The increased hypersensitivity to radiant heat is caused by the damage to the A beta, A delta, and polymodal nociceptors (the group C fibers); this damage is induced by a single-time overheating of the skin to 48.5-50 Â°C, and the resulting sensitivity persists for a long time. Degeneration of the alpha motor neurons is also caused by the exposure to heat and radiation. Most of the major nerve trunks were not affected. Damage to the A beta fibers (located in the skin), discovered by the two-point discrimination test, is permanent; the Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner corpuscles, and Merkel nerve endings, which degenerated after denervation, do not regenerate. The sympathetic nervous system was involved as well; the reduction in active sweat glands was caused by destruction of their innervation, the initial edema and reddening was also caused by sympathetic nerve damage.|$|E
40|$|In {{dermatologic}} oncology several good indications for radiotherapy are known. Precancerous lesions can {{be treated}} by <b>grenz</b> <b>rays,</b> as e. g. large senile (actinic) keratoses, lentigo maligna or large lesions of Bowen's disease or Queyrat's erythroplasia. Well-known indications are also mid-sized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, especially {{in the face of}} elderly patients. The lentigo-maligna melanoma should no longer be considered a radioresistant tumor, and it must be stressed that larger lesions can be successfully treated by radiotherapy. Dermato-radiotherapy shows also excellent palliative results, e. g. in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides, but also in Kaposi's sarcoma either of the classical type or AIDS-associated. In conclusion, radiotherapy is a good alternative treatment modality, especially in elderly patients, since it is painless and is possible on an outpatient basis with excellent functional results...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis is {{a common}} skin disease that can also involve the nails. All parts of the nail and {{surrounding}} structures can become affected. The incidence of nail involvement increases with duration of psoriasis. Although {{it is difficult to}} treat psoriatic nails, the condition may respond to therapy. To assess evidence for the efficacy and safety of the treatments for nail psoriasis. We searched the following databases up to March 2012 : the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched trials databases and checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). All RCTs of any design concerning interventions for nail psoriasis. Two authors independently assessed trial risk of bias and extracted the data. We collected adverse effects from the included studies. We included 18 studies involving 1266 participants. We were not able to pool due to the heterogeneity of many of the studies. Our primary outcomes were 'Global improvement of nail psoriasis as rated by a clinician', 'Improvement of nail psoriasis scores (NAS, NAPSI) ', 'Improvement of nail psoriasis in the participant's opinion'. Our secondary outcomes were 'Adverse effects (and serious adverse effects) '; 'Effects on quality of life'; and 'Improvement in nail features, pain score, nail thickness, thickness of subungual hyperkeratosis, number of affected nails, and nail growth'. We assessed short-term (3 to 6 months), medium-term (6 to 12 months), and long-term (> 12 months) treatments separately if possible. Two systemic biologic studies and three radiotherapy studies reported significant results for our first two primary outcomes. Infliximab 5 mg/kg showed 57. 2 % nail score improvement versus - 4. 1 % for placebo (P < 0. 001); golimumab 50 mg and 100 mg showed 33 % and 54 % improvement, respectively, versus 0 % for placebo (P < 0. 001), both after medium-term treatment. Infliximab and golimumab also showed significant results after short-term treatment. From the 3 radiotherapy studies, only the superficial radiotherapy (SRT) study showed 20 % versus 0 % nail score improvement (P = 0. 03) after short-term treatment. Studies with ciclosporin, methotrexate, and ustekinumab were not significantly better than their respective comparators: etretinate, ciclosporin, and placebo. Nor were studies with topical interventions (5 -fluorouracil 1 % in Belanyx lotion, tazarotene 0. 1 % cream, calcipotriol 50 ug/g, calcipotriol 0. 005 %) better than their respective comparators: Belanyx lotion, clobetasol propionate, betamethasone dipropionate with salicylic acid, or betamethasone dipropionate. Of our secondary outcomes, not all included studies reported adverse events; those that did only reported mild adverse effects, and there were more in studies with systemic interventions. Only one study reported the effect on quality of life, and two studies reported nail improvement only per feature. Infliximab, golimumab, SRT, <b>grenz</b> <b>rays,</b> and electron beam caused significant nail improvement compared to the comparative treatment. Although the quality of trials was generally poor, this review may have some implications for clinical practice. Although powerful systemic treatments {{have been shown to be}} beneficial, they may have serious adverse effects. So they are not a realistic option for people troubled with nail psoriasis, unless the patient is prescribed these systemic treatments because of cutaneous psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis or the nail psoriasis is severe, refractory to other treatments, or has a major impact on the person's quality of life. Because of their design and timescale, RCTs generally do not pick up serious side-effects. This review reported only mild adverse effects, recorded mainly for systemic treatments. Radiotherapy for psoriasis is not used in common practice. The evidence for the use of topical treatments is inconclusive and of poor quality; however, this does not imply that they do not work. Future trials need to be rigorous in design, with adequate reporting. Trials should correctly describe the participants' characteristics and diagnostic features, use standard validated nail scores and participant-reported outcomes, be long enough to report efficacy and safety, and include details of effects on nail feature...|$|E
