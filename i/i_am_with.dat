I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>with</b> a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps.

500|$|Details {{of a film}} {{examining}} Hitchcock's {{obsession with}} Hedren were reported in December 2011. The Girl, written by Gwyneth Hughes, would star Toby Jones as Hitchcock and Sienna Miller as Hedren. In a post-production BBC press release about the film in November 2012, Hughes described her enthusiasm when she was approached about the project while on holiday: [...] " [...] {{got a phone call}} from producer Amanda Jenks. She only managed to get out the words 'Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren' before I was already shouting 'yes yes yes!' to this seductive, sinister, deeply touching story of love and obsession among Hollywood royalty." [...] Hughes interviewed Hedren and members of Hitchcock's crew before preparing a script. She described her discussions with Hedren: [...] "Her wisdom and insights have helped me to put her real life ordeal on to the screen. I know Tippi is absolutely thrilled, as <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>with</b> the casting of Sienna Miller to play her." [...] The film's title was inspired by the name Hitchcock used for Hedren after she stopped working for him.|$|E

I feel happiest when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>with</b> these birds and animals," [...] he said, [...] "I am a part of them without anything to explain." [...] His understanding of the dynamics of purebred animal breeding was that deviation from the original, useful type led to degeneration of a breed. While best known as a horse breeder, he also raised pheasants—including exotic varieties from the Himalayas—and other breeds of birds. By 1905 he started a pheasant farm on his property in Morris Plains, gathering the birds he had kept on the west coast, and buying others from overseas using the profits from his first published book of cartoons. [...] As of 1908 he owned the largest private collection of pheasants and wild waterfowl in America. At various times, his menagerie also contained angora goats, Persian fat-tailed sheep, Sicilian donkeys, and Chinese ducks. [...] Three times, he built up collections of cockfighting roosters, once selling them to finance his start the first time he lived and worked in San Francisco.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 62, based on 24 reviews. Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani {{wrote that the}} album's [...] "strength" [...] is [...] "its individual songs... a testament to Beyoncé as one of today's most reliable singles artists", but felt that [...] "the real disparity is her inability to reconcile the adult-contemporary schmaltz of <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>with</b> the more modern, edgy sounds of Sasha Fierce." [...] Adam Mattera of The Observer felt that both discs lack depth, observing that the first is [...] "too busy chasing radio formats to expose any genuine soul", and criticizing the second disc's [...] "succession of independent woman anthems such as 'Single Ladies' and 'Diva', which will no doubt inspire drag queens the world over but leave most others bemused." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman called its double-disc [...] "gimmick" [...] "flimsy" [...] and favored its second disc's [...] "decent, if easily forgettable, upbeat pop." [...] He expressed that on the I Am... disc, [...] "Beyoncé feels each line to the fullest extent, which almost rescues the set's staidness." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau named it the [...] "dud of the month", indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought". He found its [...] "split-personality bit" [...] to be [...] "deeply vapid", only observing [...] "three good songs on this 11-track artifact".|$|E
500|$|December {{started with}} the last group stage match of the UEFA Cup. Benfica visited Beveren and won 3-0 with a double from Zlatko Zahovič, {{ensuring}} qualification for the round of 32 behind Stuttgart. On 6 December, Benfica received Estoril. The visitors scored first, but Benfica responded through Simão with a double inside ten minutes, giving them the first league win in a month and returning them to first place. On 12 December, Benfica played away to Belenenses. Trapattoni's team did not perform to expectations and lost 4–1, the largest defeat there since 1947–48. Trapattoni remained optimistic, saying, [...] "Losing a game like this is not catastrophic. Give up? No, that is not my vocabulary." [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} defeat, José Moreira lost his starting goalkeeping place to Quim. Trapattoni, in the preview for the upcoming match with Penafiel, said, [...] "Benfica needs to forget this humiliating defeat quickly. Four goals...three goals in eight minutes, it is true we {{are in a state of}} emergency. We have the mentality to react and will do so." [...] On the same day, Benfica discovered their next opponent in the UEFA Cup would be CSKA Moscow. On 18 December, Benfica beat Penafiel 1–0 with a goal from Argel. On 21 December, Benfica played the last game of the year, hosting third-tier team AD Oliveirense for the Portuguese Cup. Benfica won 4–1 but required extra time to beat the visitors after a 1-1 draw in regular time. Throughout the game, Benfica fans whistled the team for the poor game. Later, Trapattoni acknowledged the performance, saying, [...] "For the first time, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>with</b> the fans since the team deserved the whistles." ...|$|E
