Throughout his life, {{he wrote}} over 100,000 Chinese {{characters}} in the Han Shi Zhangju (韓詩章句) as a detailed commentary to Han Ying's version of the Classic of Poetry. However, he never accepted any student/apprentice(s) so he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> inherit his legacy.|$|E
25|$|Negative dialectics {{comprises}} {{a monument}} {{to the end of the}} tradition of the individual subject as the locus of criticism. Without a revolutionary working class, the Frankfurt School <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> rely on but the individual subject. But, as the liberal capitalist social basis of the autonomous individual receded into the past, the dialectic based on it became more and more abstract.|$|E
25|$|Geera, {{who was now}} {{the only}} child left on their {{escarpment}} home, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> play with and {{no one to talk}} to as her father was often away. Geera spent all day sitting, hunched over and watching the camps of the local Aboriginals and looking out to sea to her five sisters. Eventually she turned to stone, dust and leaves building up around her until she became a part of the escarpment. She is known today as Mount Keira.|$|E

25|$|Finally, in {{the fall}} of 1887, Willcox and Reid, after garnering {{interest}} in their fellow students throughout the year, helped Virginia put its first regularly organized team in the field. But in these early days they had <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> play. Fortunately, Pantops Academy, a boys' school founded just up the road from the UVA Grounds, agreed to a game on November 13, 1887. After playing to a scoreless tie, a rematch was scheduled for March 1888. The historic first touchdown was scored by quarterback Herbert Barry and the University won 26–0.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} decades after Reconstruction, when white Democrats regained power in the state legislatures, they began to make voter {{registration}} more complicated, to reduce black voting. With a combination of intimidation, fraud and violence by paramilitary groups, they suppressed black voting and turned Republicans out of office. From 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor white voters. This disfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th century, depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries. They <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> represent their interests, resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services, such as schools, for blacks and poor whites.|$|E
25|$|James Hildreth hit {{his second}} quick knock against Glamorgan in a week, taking 71 runs off 37 balls to lift Somerset Sabres to a victory at Taunton. Along with Keith Parsons making 57 off 28, {{they made a}} dent in the theory that spinners are useful in Twenty20 cricket, as {{experienced}} off-spinner Robert Croft was dispatched for 50 runs in four overs. The slow left arm bowler Dean Cosker was also taken for 45 in his four, and Somerset made a total of 212 for 3. In reply, the visitors <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> pass 30 once Mike Powell went, Ian Blackwell taking four Glamorgan Dragons wickets for 26 runs as the Welshmen crumbled to 123 all out, Sourav Ganguly top-scoring with 35.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Washington drove into the Bears red zone and sent their special teams unit to attempt a 35-yard field goal. Backup quarterback Jay Schroeder, who was the holder on the play, called an audible for a fake field goal, but due the roaring crowd at Soldier Field, his {{receivers}} didn't hear the call. As a result, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> throw to after the snap, and slipped on the 25-yard line while trying to run for a first down. Chicago then took over {{and drove to the}} Washington 14-yard line. But with just over nine minutes left in the game, McMahon's pass was intercepted by Barry Wilburn in the end zone. Later on, McMahon was intercepted again, this time by Dennis Woodberry at the Chicago 43. Three plays later, Washington attempted to put the game away with a quarterback sneak on fourth and inches, but Williams was stopped short with 1:13 left, giving the Bears one last chance to drive for a winning score. However, the Redskins defense again rose to the occasion, forcing Walter Payton out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker on fourth down and 8.|$|E
500|$|When Longacre {{began work}} on the two new coins in early 1849, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> assist him. Longacre wrote the {{following}} year {{that he had been}} warned by a Mint employee that one of the officers (undoubtedly Peale) planned to undermine the chief engraver's position by having the work of preparing designs and dies done outside Mint premises. Accordingly, when the gold coin bill became law, Longacre apprised Patterson that he was ready to begin work on the gold dollar. The Mint Director agreed, and after viewing a model of the head on the obverse, authorized Longacre to proceed with preparation of dies. According to Longacre, ...|$|E

Sanders was impressed with MalcolmX's leadership and work ethic. She felt he was selfless {{when it came to}} helping others, but he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> lean on when he needed help. She thought maybe she could be that person. He also began to pressure her to join the Nation of Islam. In mid 1956, Sanders converted. Like many members of the Nation of Islam, she changed her surname to [...] "X", which represented the family name of her African ancestors that she could never know.|$|E

Donna is driven by a fierce need for approval and acceptance, which makes her try too hard. Robbie revealed that she shares some of Donna's characteristics. She said [...] "'s fiery and outgoing and I'm a bit like that. Sometimes I can be too loud and say things when I shouldn't. But I don't stalk people. Other than that, we're kind of similar." ...|$|E
500|$|Conteh {{now found}} himself {{in the middle of a}} war zone, {{starving}} and homeless. He wandered about for several months and finally came to Kenema where he began treating the sick in the midst of the fighting. Although he had friends overseas, and could have procured a job outside Sierra Leone, he chose to stay and help his people because [...] "they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> help them". Due to the war, most experts familiar with Lassa fever had left the country, and patients suspected of having the disease began to be brought to Conteh for treatment. The Lassa team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). In Kenema, Conteh became director of the only Lassa fever isolation ward in the world. Rebels from the Revolutionary United Front took over the town of Kenema in 1997 and 1999, but Conteh never left his post. It is thought that the rebels spared the hospital from destruction because they were afraid of catching Lassa fever. When the civil war ended in 2002, the government of Sierra Leone began the process of rebuilding the country.|$|E

After Xun Xu's death, Emperor Xiaowu (r. 372–396) designated Xun Xu's son, Xun Heng (荀恆), as the new Duke of Linhuai. The peerage was later passed on to Xun Heng's son, Xun Longfu (荀龍符), and finally abolished in 420 when Liu Yu ended the Jin dynasty and founded the Liu Song dynasty.|$|E

He also called for [...] "a non-exclusive national dialogue with a view to a peaceful resolution of the Chadian conflict". Prime Minister Delwa Kassire Koumakoye, claiming victory, was dismissive of the rebel declaration of cease-fire, saying that the government <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> sign a cease-fire with because the rebels [...] "don't exist anymore ...

2500|$|De León was a fiery disciplinarian whom, it was joked, {{would fall}} ill when she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> scold. She {{maintained}} a strict supervision over {{the behavior of}} her stars, restraining their spending habits by withholding portions of their salaries until their withheld pay was sufficient {{to buy a new}} house or car. De León though would periodically hand out cash advances to LVN actresses so they could purchase new gowns. She would involve herself into the personal lives of her stars, engineering for example, the reconcillation between Nestor de Villa and his father, with whom he had become estranged after he disapproved of his becoming an actor. She frequently invited many of her actors to her Quezon City home along Broadway Street. De León was also willing to help in manually sewing the costumes of her actresses.|$|E
2500|$|The 1918 {{pandemic}} killed tens {{of millions}} and sickened hundreds of millions; the loss of this {{many people in the}} population caused upheaval and psychological damage to many people. There were not enough doctors, hospital rooms, or medical supplies for the living as they contracted the disease. Dead bodies were [...] often left unburied as few people were available to deal with them. There can be great social disruption as well as a sense of fear. Efforts to deal with pandemics can leave a great deal to be desired because of human selfishness, lack of trust, illegal behavior, and ignorance. For example, in the 1918 pandemic: [...] "This horrific disconnect between reassurances and reality destroyed the credibility of those in authority.
