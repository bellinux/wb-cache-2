5|$|Bavaro {{struggled}} with a degenerative knee condition throughout the 1990 season and was rarely able to practice. The Giants cut him in July 1991 {{because of the}} injury. After some initial dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He took the position after the team's coach took a chance and wrote Bavaro a letter to ask him if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> coaching.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 2007, Ripken {{expressed}} interest in purchasing the Baltimore Orioles if current owner Peter Angelos were to sell the team. He {{had yet to be}} approached about the potential purchase of the team.

5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Hockey Stick Fight with Kip James as Special Guest Referee between 3Live Kru (B.G. James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) and Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) followed. In this match, {{hockey sticks}} were hung above {{each of the}} {{turnbuckles}} in the ring, with only the legal men allowed to use them. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Killings pinned Young after a top rope leg drop onto a hockey stick that laid across Young's groin to win the match for his team at 10 minutes and 23 seconds. After this bout, Christian Cage made his debut, announcing he wanted to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Coach Scott D'Amore and Bobby Roode came out and offered Cage a spot in Team Canada, which Cage said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the Pacquiao fight, Cotto {{moved to}} the light middleweight division. On June 5, 2010, he fought against undefeated Israeli WBA Light Middleweight Champion Yuri Foreman at Yankee Stadium in New York City. Bob Arum had said that if Cotto were to win, he would become a front runner to defend the WBA belt against Manny Pacquiao in November. Cotto stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> {{a return to the}} welterweight division, in case of an {{interesting}} fight. Cotto ended up knocking Foreman down with a signature left hook to the body in the ninth round, after Foreman tore his knee, Cotto, claiming the WBA light middleweight title, his fourth overall in three different weight divisions.|$|E
5|$|Born's {{position}} at Cambridge {{was only a}} temporary one, and his tenure at Göttingen was terminated in May 1935. He therefore accepted an offer from C. V. Raman to go to Bangalore in 1935. Born considered taking a permanent position there, but the Indian Institute of Science did not create an additional chair for him. In November 1935, the Born family had their German citizenship revoked, rendering them stateless. A few weeks later Göttingen cancelled Born's doctorate. Born considered an offer from Pyotr Kapitsa in Moscow, and started taking Russian lessons from Rudolf Peierls's Russian-born wife Genia. But then Charles Galton Darwin asked Born if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> becoming his successor as Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, an offer that Born promptly accepted, assuming the chair in October 1936.|$|E
5|$|By 23 April the Red Army had {{surrounded}} Berlin, and Goebbels made a proclamation urging {{its citizens}} {{to defend the}} city. That same day, Göring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, arguing that since Hitler was isolated in Berlin, Göring should assume leadership of Germany. Göring set a deadline, after which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> Hitler incapacitated. Hitler responded by having Göring arrested, and in his last will and testament, written on 29 April, he removed Göring from all government positions. On 28 April Hitler discovered that Himmler, who had left Berlin on 20 April, was trying to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies. He ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in Berlin) shot.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{endorsed}} Humphrey at the convention, to {{the dismay}} of some anti-war figures who considered it a betrayal. Humphrey went on to lose the general election to Richard Nixon. McGovern returned to his Senate reelection race, facing Republican former Governor Archie M. Gubbrud. While South Dakota voters sympathized with McGovern over his daughter's arrest, he initially suffered a substantial drop in popularity over the events in Chicago. However, McGovern conducted an energetic campaign that focused on his service to the state, while Gubbrud ran a lackluster effort. In November, McGovern won 57percent of the vote in what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> the easiest and most decisive victory of his career.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} {{no doubts}} about her loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, {{especially}} not in matters which affected her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> them his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{nomination}} in April 2005 {{of a new}} NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background, Michael D. Griffin, changed the situation, as Griffin stated <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> a manned servicing mission. Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by Atlantis was scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008, halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008. Since {{a failure of the}} backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit.|$|E

5|$|As {{the reigning}} 200 m {{champion}} {{at both the}} World Youth and World Junior championships, Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the Senior World Championships in Paris. He beat all comers at the 200 m in the World Championship trials. Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted that, {{even if he did}} not make the final, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> setting a personal best a success. However, he suffered a bout of conjunctivitis before the event, and it ruined his training schedule. Realising {{that he would not be}} in peak condition, the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals, on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced. Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity, but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead. Even though he missed the World Championships, Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on the strength of his junior record-equalling run.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{confirmed}} his presidential ambitions on his October 16, 2007 show, stating {{his intention to}} run both on the Republican and Democratic platforms, but only as a favorite son in his native South Carolina. In an interview with Larry King he revealed that, as his running mate, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> Mike Huckabee (who himself jokingly offered Colbert the vice presidential position). He also speculated {{on the possibility of}} a Colbert-Putin or Colbert-Colbert ticket. Colbert abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary. On November 1, 2007, it was announced that he would not appear on the Democratic primary ballot either, after being deemed ineligible by the South Carolina Democratic Party executive committee. Several days later he announced that he was withdrawing from the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1170, Gervase was {{involved}} with attempts to keep Thomas Becket, {{who had been in}} exile, from returning to England. Working with Gervase were Roger de Pont L'Évêque the Archbishop of York, Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury, Reginald de Warenne the Sheriff of Sussex, and Ranulf de Broc. Gervase was part of the party that met Becket at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when the archbishop returned to England. The lay members of the group, led by Gervase, complained that the archbishop was sowing dissension in the land by his excommunication of the three ecclesiastics who were with the group, but Becket managed to calm the officials by stating <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> the matter and reply to them the next day. The next day the group was accompanied by some clergy sent by the ecclesiastics who had been excommunicated by Becket. Nothing further was accomplished by this meeting except further offers from Becket to consider other options. Afterwards, Gervase and Ranulf de Broc tried to discover which of the citizens of London had welcomed Becket back into the kingdom, but were frustrated by refusal of the London clergy to appear and by the laymen refusing to answer to anything but royal writs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1170, de Broc was {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} keep Becket from returning to England.

De Broc was part of the party that met Becket at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when the archbishop returned to England.

5|$|During {{his early}} years, Boganda {{was adopted by}} Catholic missionaries. As a boy he {{attended}} the school opened at Mbaiki (the administrative centre for the Lobaye prefecture) by the post's founder, Lieutenant Mayer. From December 1921 to December 1922, he spent {{two hours a day}} with Monsignor Jean-Réné Calloch learning how to read, while spending the rest of his time performing manual labour. On 24 December, he was received into the church under the name Barthélemy, in honour of one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ who was believed to have worked as Christian missionary in Africa. Father Gabriel Herrau sent Boganda to the Catholic School of Betou and then to the school of the Saint Paul Mission at Bangui, where he completed his primary studies under Mgr Calloch, whom <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> his spiritual father. The missionaries there, encouraged by his intellectual promise and pious demeanour, helped him continue secondary studies at small seminaries in Brazzaville and Kisantu (under Belgian Jesuits) before he moved on to the great seminary at Yaoundé. On 17 March 1938, fulfilling an ambition he had had since age twelve, he was ordained and became the first Roman Catholic priest native to Oubangui-Chari, as the colony was then called. He ministered at Bangui, Grimari and Bangassou, and in 1939, his bishop denied his request to join the French Army. He was needed at home, as many Frenchmen involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in World War II, during which he served in a number of missions.|$|E
