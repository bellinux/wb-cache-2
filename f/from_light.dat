5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} (commonly {{known as}} the dog conch or by its better-known synonym, Strombus canarium) is a species of edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Strombidae (true conches). Known from illustrations in books dating from the late 17th century, L.canarium is an Indo-Pacific species occurring from India and Sri Lanka to Melanesia, Australia and southern Japan. The shell of adult individuals is coloured <b>from</b> <b>light</b> yellowish-brown to golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated body whorl, a flared, thick outer lip and a shallow stromboid notch. The shell is valued as an ornament, {{and because it is}} heavy and compact it is also often used as a sinker for fishing nets.|$|E
5|$|Like most rare-earth elements, {{praseodymium}} most readily {{forms the}} +3 oxidation state, {{which is the}} only stable state in aqueous solution, although the +4 oxidation state is known in some solid compounds and, uniquely among the lanthanides, the +5 oxidation state is attainable in matrix-isolation conditions. Aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish-green, and similarly praseodymium results in various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light <b>from</b> <b>light</b> sources.|$|E

5|$|Most Limousin cattle have a {{coloration}} that varies <b>from</b> <b>light</b> wheat to darker golden-red. Other coloration, mainly black, {{has been}} developed through cross-breeding and grading up from other breeds of cattle. In addition to altering natural coloration, other traits, such as polled (a genetic lack of horns), have been introduced through cross breeding. Angus cattle have been the dominant source of black and polled genes now present in graded-up high content Limousins found throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Organisms differ {{according}} {{to the number of}} constructed molecules in their cells. Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy <b>from</b> <b>light,</b> whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.|$|E

5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away <b>from</b> <b>light</b> and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} pods {{introduced}} to IndyCar in 2012 {{intended to prevent}} cars from becoming airborne when hitting another in the rear proved to be ineffective as there were major crashes resulting from such contact during the 2013 race in Houston involving Dario Franchitti and the 2017 Indianapolis 500 involving Scott Dixon.
