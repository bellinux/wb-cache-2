40|$|Kanamycin {{sulphate}} (KS) is a Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{protein synthesis}} inhibitor. Due to its intense hydrophilicity, KS is cleared {{from the body}} within 8 [*]h. KS has a very short plasma half-life (2. 5 [*]h). KS is used in high concentrations to reach the therapeutic levels in plasma, which results in serious nephrotoxicity/ototoxicity. To overcome aforementioned limitations, the current study aimed to develop KS loaded PLGA-Vitamin-E-TPGS nanoparticles (KS-PLGA-TPGS NPs), {{to act as an}} efficient carrier for controlled delivery of KS. To achieve a substantial extension in blood circulation, a combined design, affixation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to KS-PLGA-TPGS NPs and adsorption of water-soluble chitosan (WSC) (cationic deacetylated chitin) to particle surface, was raised for surface modification of NPs. Surface modified NPs (KS-PEG-WSC NPs) were prepared to provide controlled delivery and circulate in the bloodstream {{for an extended period of}} time, thus minimizing dosing frequency. In vivo pharmacokinetics and in vivo biodistribution following intramuscular administration were investigated. NPs surface charge was close to neutral + 3. 61 [*]mV and significantly affected by the WSC coating. KS-PEG-WSC NPs presented striking prolongation in blood circulation, reduced protein binding, and long <b>drew-out</b> the blood circulation half-life with resultant reduced kidney sequestration vis-à-vis KS-PLGA-TPGS NPs. The studies, therefore, indicate the successful formulation development of KS-PEG-WSC NPs with reduced frequency of dosing of KS indicating low incidence of nephrotoxicity/ototoxicity...|$|R

5000|$|Fibre OpticsThe ancient Romans {{knew how}} to heat and <b>draw-out</b> glass into fibres of such small {{diameter}} that they became flexible. They also observed that light falling on one end was transmitted to the other. ( [...] We now know {{this is due to}} multiple reflections at the internal surface of the fibre.) These multiple reflections in a sense mix the light beams together thereby preventing an image being transmitted by a single fibre - (more accurately, the different path-lengths experienced by individual light-rays alter their relative phases so rendering the beam incoherent and thus unable to reconstitute the image.) The end result is that the light emerging from a single fibre will be some kind of average of the intensity and colour of the light falling on the 'front' end.|$|E
5000|$|The {{radiant energy}} {{released}} by an electric arc {{is capable of}} permanently injuring or killing a human being at distances of up to 20 ft. The distance from an arc flash source within which an unprotected person has a 50% chance of receiving a second degree burn {{is referred to as}} the [...] "flash protection boundary". The incident energy of 1.2 cal/cm^2 on a bare skin was selected in solving the equation for the arc flash boundary in IEEE 1584. The IEEE 1584 arc flash boundary equations can also be used to calculate the arc flash boundaries with boundary energy other than 1.2 cal/cm^2 such as onset to 2nd degree burn energy. Those conducting flash hazard analyses must consider this boundary, and then must determine what PPE should be worn within the flash protection boundary. Remote operators or robots can be used to perform activities that have a high risk for arc flash incidents, such as inserting <b>draw-out</b> circuit breakers on a live electrical bus. Remote racking systems are available which keep the operator outside the arc flash hazard zone.|$|E
50|$|The {{column on}} the sheet of {{parchment}} containing the prosaic song Ha'azinu is made wider than other columns, {{so as to make}} room for the poem's layout, written in the format of sixty-seven double half-columns, meaning to say, spaces are made between the verses which appear to descend in two columns. The prosaic song itself is preceded by a blank space, above which are six lines that are written in a format fixed by tradition, with the following words at the head of each line: the 1st line starting with ואעידה and ending with ידעתי; the 2nd line starting with אחרי and ending with מן; the 3rd line starting with הדרך and ending with הרעה; the 4th line starting with באחרית and ending with God's divine name, יהוה; the 5th line starting with להכעיסו and ending with כל; and the 6th line starting with קהל and ending with תמם. It is to be noted that the original Yemenite practice was to write these six short lines with indentations before and after the text of each line, rather than <b>draw-out</b> the lines unto the margins by stretching certain letters within the text. The scribal practice of indenting these six lines was also the widespread practice used in Turkey, in very old and exquisite Torah scrolls during the time of Rabbi Chaim Benveniste (1603-1673). After these six lines there is a space followed by the Prosaic Song, written in the format of a song. The Yemenite tradition follows the Aleppo Codex's layout of the Prosaic Song, excepting lines 38 and 39, being the only deviation in word sequence, now believed by most scholars to be an anomaly, by way of confusing the double usage of the Hebrew word גם (q.v. Deut. 32:25) and not knowing which word Maimonides actually had in mind when bringing down the condensed layout for the song.|$|E

This work attempts to answer this question by collecting, categorizing, and situating the extant research investigating Crowdsourcing for policy, within the broader Crowdsourcing literature. To do so, the work first extends the Crowdsourcing literature by introducing, defining, explaining, and using seven universal characteristics of all general Crowdsourcing techniques, to vividly <b>draw-out</b> the relative trade-offs of each mode of Crowdsourcing. From this beginning, the work systematically and explicitly weds the three types of Crowdsourcing to the stages of the Policy cycle as a method of situating the extant literature spanning both domains. Thereafter, we discuss the trends, highlighting the research gaps, and outline the overlaps in the research on Crowdsourcing for policy, stemming from our analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} {{involved}} {{the determination of}} surface water quality index of tropical sacred wetland viz. Dakor Pilgrimage Wetland (DPW), Central Gujarat, India. The main aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate various water quality parameters to <b>draw-out</b> the water quality index for an assessment of a tropical aquatic body. The monthly values of pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Total alkalinity (TA), Total Hardness (TH), Total Hardness, Calcium Hardness (Ca), Magnesium Hardness (Mg), Chloride, Sulphate, Phosphate, Sodium, and Potassium, were analyzed to compute water quality index (WQI). The results manifest that WQI at site 1 (D 1) was maximum (161. 74), followed by D 2 (159. 96), and minimum at site 3 (D 3) (157. 19). The values clearly depicts that quality of water is completely unfit for human consumption unless and until strict and mandatory steps are taken to rejuvenate it. The suggestive measures to improve the overall health of an aquatic body is also discussed herewith alongwith conservation measures and management strategies...|$|E
40|$|Do {{cinematic}} {{representations of}} the natural world only put us in further remove from nature? A phenomenological approach shows that nature screened can produce a richer understanding of human–nature relations as these unfold in visual contact. If vision accesses the world in a unique relationship of sight, in which our contact with the world is defined by vi-sion prior to any other interaction, the cinema offers a special setting for a phenomenology that seeks to <b>draw-out</b> the significance of human relations with the world of nature that come before utility or action. A detailed analy-sis of the opening sequence of Terrence Malick’s The New World (2005) demonstrates how the act of viewing positions the viewer in relation to what she sees. This position, prior to action and with the impossibility to act is seen here as an ethical position, a position of responsibility in the Levinasian sense. Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of vision is put here to use alongside the hermeneutic phenomenology of Heidegger and the existential responsi-bility of Levinas, while subverting Levinas ’ anthropocentrism and rejectin...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the wealth}} of {{interest}} in South Mexico’s Ejercito Zapatista Liberacion Nacional (EZLN), few studies have attempted to deconstruct the discourse of the Zapatistas according to its component parts. Most scholars have so far addressed the Zapatistas {{from the standpoint of}} political theory, international relations or anthropology, and in so doing have tended to engage primarily with broader polemical agendas. Furthermore, in their determination to typologise the Zapatistas as ‘this’ or ‘that’ sort of movement, scholars have overlooked the nuances and shades of meaning that exist within the Zapatista discourse, as well as the evolution of those meanings over time. As a result, the content and ongoing construction of the Zapatistas’ message has been eclipsed by a more encompassing, contested, and ultimately chimeric quest to reify the movement’s ‘essence’ or ‘truth’. This thesis represents an empirical analysis of the EZLN’s collective discourse that focuses on the content and constructed nature of their collective action frames. Combining three strands of social movement frame analysis, it avers to <b>draw-out</b> the ever-changing detail of the EZLN’s discursive output and so add value to the debates that surround the Zapatistas. It also makes several theoretical contributions to social movement frame analysis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceUniversity of ExeterGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{incident}} has impacted significantly on {{the offshore}} drilling {{industry in the}} US and globally. The final environmental, political, and financial consequences will not be known for decades, but it is already clear that the incident has changed, {{and will continue to}} change, the way business is done for all operating companies, drilling contractors, regulators, and industry associations that function in the offshore oil and gas industry. Social science research shows that high- performing organizations seek opportunities to learn from failures, and Deepwater Horizon provides such an opportunity for the pipeline industry. Whilst the technical details of well-control systems may not be directly relevant, there are broader organizational factors that can provide significant lessons to any organization that designs, maintains, and/or operates complex and potentially hazardous technology. Accident investigations, including Deepwater Horizon, continue to highlight common organizational failures that can have catastrophic consequences, and it is these lessons that are the subject of this paper. The key question is why accidents continue to occur despite the level of engineering and management system controls that are apparently in place. There is an enormous volume of published material available regarding the causes of the Deepwater Horizon blowout. This paper is based on analysis of that material to <b>draw-out</b> lessons that are relevant to management of gas pipeline companies including: managing the cost / safety tradeoff the down side of good news maintaining a focus on the need for multiple barriers the value of professional judgment and experience understanding the difference between personal safety and system integrity contractor relationships, and linking incentives for senior management to system safety performance...|$|E
