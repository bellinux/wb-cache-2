40|$|Abstract [...] Modern grid is {{the most}} complex {{man-made}} monitoring system, which is a wide-area monitoring system (WAMS). Next-generation smart grid will {{play a crucial role}} which will provide time synchronization of the data, the electric power system status (WAMS), protection and control. WAMS will provide safe and efficient energy transfers well as reliable and optimize the management of the grid. Fuses are used more in power supply, transmission lines and associated equipment. As a general rule increased Uses of fuses {{can be attributed to the}} low-cost, simple to maintain and reliable protection. Application of fuse is one of the main areas in the entire conservation plan and other significant protection coordination unit used in smart grids.

50|$|Cutouts are {{typically}} mounted about 20 degrees off vertical {{so that the}} center of gravity of the fuse holder is displaced and the fuse holder will rotate and fall open under its own weight when the <b>fuse</b> <b>blows.</b> Mechanical tension on the fuse link normally holds an ejector spring in a stable position. When the <b>fuse</b> <b>blows,</b> the released spring pulls the stub of the fuse link out of the fuse holder tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and fuse holder. This quenches any arc in the fuse holder.|$|R

The {{power factor correction}} of electrical loads and energy losses due to poor power factor are the problems common to all industrial companies. Therefore, the study of APFC unit is of greatimportance. Initially, the system is operative with controlled power factor. Then it may transit to state with power factor not controlled. On {{the failure of the}} system, an inspection is carried out to detect the type of failure. The system may fail due to <b>Fuse</b> <b>blown</b> off, Transformer burnt, Programming problem, Output relay faulty. In case of the first two types of failure the components are replaced and corrected; while in last two types of failures the problem is repaired and corrected. The system remains in up state with power factor controlled and power factor not controlled. The system is analyzed by making use of regenerative point technique. The various measures of system effectiveness are obtained including the profit incurred to the system. Graphs have been plotted to depict the behavior of the profit with respect to revenue/loss per unit up time when power factor controlled and when power factor not controlled, cost per unit replacement...|$|E

40|$|Electricity {{has become}} a major {{necessity}} in the modern world, and the availability has to reach to not only the city area but to the rural areas of population as well. To ensure the electrical distribution system is healthy, protection schemes have to be in place and one such method is the use of <b>fuse</b> <b>blow</b> method. This method is extensively used by the electric utility’s distribution system in Sabah and has shown effective protection requirements. However, this comes as a tradeoff to customers experiencing outages of electric supply. The study was carried out to identify the impact of <b>fuse</b> <b>blow</b> method and the accompanying results from actual performance of the overhead distribution system in a selected area, which in this case is the Kota Belud area. Many factors influence the reliability of the system such as the length of the distribution feeders, number of customers in each point of the system and placement of the fuses. The method used was the enumerative analysis to calculate the reliability impact of the <b>fuse</b> <b>blow</b> method. From the calculations, the result is then compared with the actual performance of the system in a one year period. The length of the feeders has the biggest impact to the reliability calculation and this is reflected by the data of actual performance of the feeders. A delicate balance of fusing coordination and limiting of feeder length is needed to ensure that the impact of the <b>fuse</b> <b>blow</b> method to the customer is adequately mitigated...|$|R

40|$|The semi-conductor fuses in this {{research}} are fabricated on a submicron process. A voltage potential is applied across the fuse, {{in order to achieve}} a blow. This current peaks with a short pulse in the order of tens of milliamps which has a long decrease to zero current flow, resulting in a <b>blown</b> <b>fuse.</b> A <b>fuse</b> <b>blows</b> due to the pinching together of electrically insulating material which initially surrounds the conducting pathway. The pinch cuts across the conductor, and so halts the current flow. In small-geometry fuses a cavity also forms during the blowing process. The company wishes to understand the <b>fuse</b> <b>blow</b> process mathematically in order to develop a model that can accurately simulate the <b>blowing</b> of the <b>fuses.</b> This report records the thermal, electrical, solid and fluid mechanics of the blowing process that was discussed at the Study Group, with remarks on possible future research for modelling the process...|$|R

Each time, our engineers explored all possible explanations and {{were never able to}} find anything wrong with the car. Still, just to be sure, we replaced several parts that could have been related to the alleged problem - all at no expense to the customer. When the <b>fuse</b> kept <b>blowing</b> despite the new parts, and faced with no diagnosis showing anything wrong with the car, the engineers were moved to consider the possibility that the fuse had been tampered with. After investigating, they determined that the car's front trunk had been opened immediately before the fuse failure on each of these occasions. (The fuse is accessed through the front trunk.) Ultimately, Tesla service applied non-tamper tape to the fuse switch. From that point on, the fuse performed flawlessly." ...|$|R
2500|$|Fuse {{selection}} {{depends on}} the load's characteristics. Semiconductor devices may use a fast or ultrafast fuse as semiconductor devices heat rapidly when excess current flows.

40|$|Increased Distributed Generation (DG) {{presence}} on radial distribution feeders {{is becoming a}} common trend. The existing Overcurrent Protection (OCP) scheme on such feeders consists mainly of overcurrent protection devices (OCPDs) such as fuses and reclosers. When DG {{is placed on the}} remote end of a 3 -phase lateral, the radial configuration of the feeder is lost. As a result, OCP issues may arise which lead to permanent outages even when the fault is temporary. This thesis presents a new approach that revises the existing OCP scheme of a radial feeder to address the presence of DG. The fuses on the laterals with DGs are removed and multifunction recloser/relays (MFRs) are added to address three specific OCP issues; fuse fatigue, nuisance <b>fuse</b> <b>blowing,</b> and <b>fuse</b> misoperation. The new approach requires no communication medium, provides backup protection for the DG unit, and allows the remaining laterals to retain their existing protective devices. The results are reported using the IEEE 34 node radial test feeder to validate the new approach and the IEEE 123 node radial test feeder to generalize the approach. The new approach completely mitigated the fuse misoperation and nuisance <b>fuse</b> <b>blowing</b> issues and most of the fuse fatigue issues that were present on the radial test feeders. Specifically, the approach demonstrates that coordination between the existing protection devices on radial distribution feeders is maintained in the presence of DG...|$|R

In fact, they were simply palming the already <b>blown</b> <b>fuses</b> and then handing them back to the experimenters.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} transient overvoltages in medium voltage (33 kV) network and the research is based on feeder lines in the Uva province. Parameters which influence lightning performance of overhead distribution lines such as line height, line length, type of structure, availability of shield wire and flash density {{in the area are}} discussed in details. More over, failures due to transient overvoltages {{and its impact on the}} reliability of the network are analyzed in this study. Lightning may cause flashovers from direct strokes or induced voltage from nearby strokes. Direct lightning to power distribution lines causes insulation flashovers in great majority of the cases. Therefore the goal of this research is to estimate the lightning performance level of feeder lines and investigate improvements. Shielding effect from nearby trees, critical flashover voltages for different flashover paths and deterioration of insulation with aging are also discussed. Thus the analysis of lightning related incidents such as transformer failures, arrester failures and nuisance <b>fuse</b> <b>blows</b> are presented. The study of transformer installation reveals that arrester lead length becomes critical during a lightning discharge since it generates high voltage stress in the winding which may fail the distribution transformer. Earth rod impulse resistance is also an important parameter which increases the voltage stress. It is necessary to develop models, using, electrical parameters for simulation of transient overvoltages. The PSCAD software is especially developed to study transient simulations of power systems. Variation of transient overvoltages due to strikes to phase wires, strikes to earth wire, and variation due to striking distance are discussed in this study. Further, simulation of surge arrester performance and nuisance <b>fuse</b> <b>blows</b> are also presented. Finally, the study presents applications to achieve zero lead length in substation, introduction of surge durable fuses and procedures which can be implemented to improve lightning performance in the MV network...|$|R
50|$|A similar {{approach}} {{can be used to}} program digital logic circuits. In this case, <b>fuses</b> are <b>blown</b> by the laser, enabling or disabling various logic circuits.

40|$|SummaryDynamic rearrangements of the actin {{cytoskeleton}} play a {{key role}} in numerous cellular processes. In Drosophila, fusion between a muscle founder cell and a fusion competent myoblast (FCM) is mediated by an invasive, F-actin-enriched podosome-like structure (PLS). Here, we show that the dynamics of the PLS is controlled by Blown <b>fuse</b> (<b>Blow),</b> a cytoplasmic protein required for myoblast fusion but whose molecular function has been elusive. We demonstrate that Blow is an FCM-specific protein that colocalizes with WASP, WIP/Solitary, and the actin focus within the PLS. Biochemically, Blow modulates the stability of the WASP-WIP complex by competing with WASP for WIP binding, leading to a rapid exchange of WASP, WIP and G-actin within the PLS, which, in turn, actively invades the adjacent founder cell to promote fusion pore formation. These studies identify a regulatory protein that modulates the actin cytoskeletal dynamics by controlling the stability of the WASP-WIP complex...|$|R
