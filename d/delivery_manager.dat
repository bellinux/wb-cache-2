30|$|Evaluating Gap 9 {{was crucial}} to {{identifying}} whether employees followed managers’ requirements {{and were able to}} perform services at the desired level in the Taiwanese hotel industry. The Gap 9 score in this study was − 0.547, indicating a difference between service performance standards and the actual service delivered. Gap 9 often occurred because of some limits, such as poor service attitudes, poorly qualified employees, insufficient service capacity, and inadequate internal communication systems. Because of these constraints, employees could not offer services at the level required by the management. The existence of Gap 9 was related to Gap 1. Moreover, if managers do not fully understand tourists’ expectations, employees cannot deliver service adequately. Therefore, to reduce the gap between employees’ perceptions of managers’ requirements and service <b>delivery,</b> <b>managers</b> in the hotel industry in Taiwan should apply internal investigation systems to evaluate whether their employees can meet the stipulated service standards.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} and implementation of IT/IS systems inherently requires a deep understanding of user requirements. However, experience shows that a key barrier to the success of an IT/IS system, is the manner by which it is adopted by end users. As such, this viewpoint article presents an overview of those typical enterprise IT user traits as experience by the author. These traits are placed {{in the context of the}} steps that need to be taken in terms of a lifecycle approach to business systems implementation. Thus, the paper describes those drivers which inhibit the adoption of enterprise IT/IS projects from a user expectation point of view. By outlining key benefits of such systems, the author presents a 6 -stage approach to benefits realisation, known as the acronym, ASSIST. By applying such an approach, the management of business process change and delivery of IT/IS should be more achievable, by addressing the specific needs and expectations of different types of users, as identified in the text of the article. In doing so, the definition of those key IT/IS benefits as outlined in the ASSIST phase approach described is therefore a useful addition to existing project management and business analysis tools and techniques, that can be utilised by enterprise IT system <b>delivery</b> <b>managers</b> as well as Senior IT/IS managemen...|$|R

40|$|The {{responsibilities}} of the state increased hugely {{over the course of}} the 20 th century and this resulted in a massive expansion in state expenditure. However, from the 1970 s onwards, there was a questioning of the role of the state in a modem society. This questioning was given the name 'New Public Management' (NPM); with one of the key changes brought about by NPM was an increased emphasis on management as opposed to administration. Reforms were introduced into a number of countries (including the UK and Ireland). However, the speed and intensity of reform varied. It is argued that this is due to a number of factors and these include motive, opportunity, the political system and the culture of the country. A review of the UK showed a wide-range of reforms being introduced over a sustained period; whereas in Ireland the reforms started later and was less intense. UK Executive Agencies were researched because their work is more readily measured and these were matched with their Irish equivalents. A combination of document analysis, semi-structured interviews and two case studies were used to determine the key elements of a Performance Management System. The research shows that for the UK organisations the PMS is given visibility through published documents and is embedded into the organisations. However, in Ireland there is a gap between the rhetoric of reform and the reality. Furthermore, there is limited visibility given to performance information in the published documents and there were different views as to whether the PMS was embedded into public sector organisations; with the <b>delivery</b> <b>managers</b> suggested that they had a comprehensive PMS but the overseers/commentators disagreed with this.

40|$|The chapter has {{reviewed}} selected Australian {{examples of}} individualised housing and social assistance. A {{number of key}} issues were raised about the implementation of individualised housing and social support programs. The issues raised are not dissimilar to the international experience outlined in Chapters 2 and 3. First, the examples highlight the need {{to ensure that there}} remains a balance between both demand and supply-side responses. Interviewees noted that the provision of therapeutic programs with individualised forms of assistance is not a substitute for long-term supply side interventions that address the shortage of accommodation. Both components are required to deliver positive outcomes for clients. In Australia, the Common Ground and Foyer models of homelessness intervention provide clients with access to transitional or permanent housing, as well as integrated client-directed service response. While the Indigenous home ownership scheme is a demand-side response, historically housing assistance for Indigenous Australians has been weighted towards supply-side responses (e. g. provision of Indigenous Community Housing). This is exhibited by Indigenous Australians being less likely to access financial subsidies for home ownership and housing investment (e. g. negative gearing, capital gains tax exemptions on main residence, and First Home Ownership Scheme). Second, while most managers embraced client-centred approaches to service design and delivery they raised concerns about passing the responsibility on to vulnerable clients to navigate, advocate and determine forms and degree of support. Service providers recognised that there is considerable variation in client capacity to engage with and to navigate complex systems of service <b>delivery.</b> <b>Managers</b> in the homelessness sector were critical about the notion of choice for vulnerable client groups such as ex-offenders, who continue to face discrimination from private landlords regardless of the development of th...|$|R

Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Kerman province. Data were collected from Iranian Maternal and Neonatal Network at public and private hospitals. All live births from March 2014 to March 2015 considered as the source population. The risk factors including maternal age, gravida, parity, abortion, pregnancy risk factors, maternal nationality, maternal education, maternity insurance, place of living, consanguinity, neonate sex, preterm labor, place of birth, <b>delivery</b> <b>manager,</b> and delivery type were compared between LBW and normal birth weight groups. Results: The prevalence of LBW was 9. 4 % in the present study. Preterm labor (odds ratio [OR]: 22. 06; P 35 years (OR: 1. 21; P = 0. 001), delivery by cesarean section (OR: 1. 17; P = 0. 002), pregnancy risk factors (OR: 1. 67; P < 0. 001), maternal illiteracy (OR: 1. 91; P < 0. 001), living in the rural area (OR: 1. 19; P < 0. 001), consanguineous (OR: 1. 08; P = 0. 025), and delivery by obstetrician (OR: 1. 12; P = 0. 029) were identified as significant factors associated with LBW in this study. Conclusions: Prevention of preterm labor, consanguineous marriage, pregnancy age 35 years old, and maternal medical risk factors are some critical interventions to reduce its burden. Increasing the access to high-quality health-care services in rural and deprived areas is another effective strategy for the prevention of LBW...|$|E

40|$|Information systems manager Information systems {{managers}} work {{in every}} size of organisation in every industry and service sector, usually {{with a staff}} of technicians, programmers and database administrators reporting to them. They install computer systems, ensure that back up systems operate effectively, buy hardware and software, provide the IT technology infrastructures for an organisation, and contribute to organisation policy with regard to quality standards and strategic planning. This is another role within the IT sector where actual job titles are dependent on the employing organisation. You might, for example, be a service <b>delivery</b> <b>manager</b> in a software house or a data processing manager in an end-user organisation. Typical Work Activities Information systems managers direct the work of systems analysts, computer programmers, support specialists, and other computer-related workers. The role of an information systems manager is ultimately dependent on the employing organisation and the complexity of its information systems. There are, however, standard activities, and responsibilities are likely to include: • evaluating user needs and system functionality; • ensuring that IT facilities meet the needs of individuals and projects; • planning, developing and implementing the IT budget, obtaining competitive prices from suppliers, where appropriate, to ensure cost effectiveness; • scheduling upgrades and security backups of hardware and software systems; • researching and installing new systems; • ensuring the smooth running of all IT systems, including anti-virus software, print services and email provision; • ensuring that software licensing laws are adhered to; • providing secure access to the network for remote users; • ensuring the security of data from internal and external attack; • providing users with appropriate support and advice; • managing crisis situations, which may involve complex technical hardware or software problems; • mentoring and training new IT support staff; • keeping up to date with the latest technologies.

40|$|Aged {{care reform}} has {{forced us to}} become more transparent, more {{accountable}} and more efficient {{in the delivery of}} both home based and residential care services. We’re working with a client group which is now savvier than ever, wanting to access the best services for the lowest cost. This consumer-focus has meant that in order to keep up, we’ve had to develop and refine the innovations that will best distinguish us from our competitors. While these innovations are critical to the ongoing sustainability of the business, we cannot ignore the group which delivers them. The best services simply cannot be delivered without the best staff. However, this is not without its challenges. With expanding service delivery comes a reliance on our expanding workforce and this is, particularly in the home care space, a remote and mobile one. Across the sector, remote and mobile workers have long been a disenfranchised group. Working remotely, at times both in the physical and emotional sense of the word, this group has had a history of going without the appropriate supervision, support and sense of belonging that is so vital to attracting and retaining a skilled and happy workforce. By definition, remote and mobile workers have little connection to the ‘home base’ of an organisation. They don’t have the creature comforts of a work station, desk or pod to call home, instead their ‘office’ becomes their car, or clients’ homes. They don’t enjoy the same level of routine of office-based workers, who see familiar faces every morning for a quick debrief in the coffee room or at the water cooler, and their main relationships are with the clients they visit every day, who can often present with their own challenging and complex behaviours. This combination can compound feelings of stress, isolation and severe disengagement. Pre the ‘new world order’, Benetas’ Community Services operated as two completely separate divisions. Community Services, the organisation’s government funded home care service arm, spoke little to Benetas At Home, the fee for service division. This lack of communication, attributed directly to the fact these divisions were operating as two separate entities, with two separate structures and two separate general managers, contributed significantly to inefficiencies, poor staff engagement and limited our ability to achieve the best outcomes for our clients and their families. Approximately 200 home care workers were spread out across Victoria, from the tip of the Mornington Peninsula, to East Gippsland and the Mallee. Their sense of connection to Benetas came through a monthly newsletter posted out to them, and their professional development and support was limited to a Carer Support Coordinator who checked in with them at a quarterly staff meeting. It’s obvious this was far from best practice, and the resulting disengagement, feelings of being unsupported and isolated, and compromised client outcomes were inevitable. A disengaged workforce is simply not a good workforce. And it had to stop. The first step, like any step in solving a problem, was to acknowledge the issue. Staff engagement and productivity was not where it needed to be. We knew this because we received formal and anecdotal feedback from both staff and clients. Something had to be done. We then set out to understand why this was the case, and how the underlying structures of the organisation could actually be used to benefit our remote and mobile workforce. We recognised that we had an inappropriate and inefficient organisational structure around our community care services. We were operating two separate divisions, but both targeted the same client group and both were dependent in some way on the operations of the other. Job roles overlapped and this lead to lack of role clarity; there was process duplication and this lead to confusion and inefficiency. This just didn’t make any sense for the professional development of staff, or the financial sustainability of the business. And it certainly wasn’t contributing to a sense of cohesion across our workforce. So in April 2014, we amalgamated our Benetas at Home, Community Services and Respite Services divisions, and added an In-Home Nursing Service launching our new Benetas Home Care division. Benetas Home Care comprises all of our in-home and community services, including government-funded Home Care packages, fee-for-service care, in home nursing, memory loss and dementia support, and a variety of respite care options. Two key forces guided the amalgamation; Australian Government aged care reforms and Benetas strategic objectives. We recognised that reform is creating a competitive and consumer driven environment so the onus is on us to remain commercially viable and position ourselves as a provider of choice. Our strategic objectives demand that we provide an exemplary customer experience, grow the business and maximise our sustainability. The amalgamation process involved consultation, research, benchmarking and business modelling and produced a new structure and introduced new ways of working. Change always brings challenges but has also created new opportunities for staff in the way of new and different job roles, additional leadership roles and more integrated and supportive team structures. As part of this, we regionalised what had been one giant pool of home care staff within Community Services and Benetas At Home, into three teams. These three teams, compared to the previous ‘one’ which had no sense of connection or belonging, were attached to an existing Benetas operational region. Straight away, this gave each team, and each staff member within that team, a sense of ‘you’re a part of us. ’ Each team was then assigned an In Home Service <b>Delivery</b> <b>Manager,</b> so three people to support home care staff, rather than a single Carer Support Coordinator. These managers have been charged with recruiting, supporting and training staff and have the necessary skill set and experience to provide regular, comprehensive and accessible supervision to each staff member. As part of the organisation’s Strategic Plan: Towards 2019, we also called upon technological innovations to help us connect this group. In September last year, Benetas In Home Service Assistants were given access to the eRoster system, which has facilitated a more connected mobile workforce. eRoster enables staff to view their rosters remotely, access emails and view important client information on their smart phone, tablet or home computer. This system has improved client care significantly, with staff able to receive point in time rosters and updates on changes to client requirements. A text messaging system was also introduced, which gives us the ability to communicate quickly to carers and enables carers to respond free of charge. This has resulted in significant efficiencies in our rostering process, ensuring shifts are filled as quickly as possible and means that carers feel connected at all times. It also means that the two or three people responsible for rostering within a region can manage their large staff pool effectively. In addition, a regular ‘pulse check’ survey has been introduced and focus groups have been conducted at different sites {{to get a sense of}} how staff are feeling within the new structure, and to identify and respond to any issues before they have an impact on staff performance and client outcomes. These sessions have been supplemented with increased communication activity in the form of a monthly regional-specific newsletter, a monthly Home Care specific newsletter, and regular briefings from myself as Benetas Home Care General Manager. Staff have also been offered increased professional development, with training and opportunities to ‘act’ in higher roles presented regularly. Each staff member is also engaged in a six-monthly performance review activity, which gives them the opportunity to identify areas for development with their manager. Development of a Home Care Learning and Development Plan, integrating training for all Benetas Home Care, is underway. This will cover mandatory compliance training, and training specific to job roles and client needs. A feature of the Plan will be the use of online training making it easier for remote staff to participate. Feedback from staff has been overwhelmingly positive. Staff report a sense of belonging and connection with the business that was completely absent before. One staff member reflected this in a recent ‘pulse check’ survey that: “We are all working towards one common goal - there is no ‘us’ and them. ” And clients are reporting the same thing. Which tells us that we’re getting something right. Engaging, supporting and maintaining a skilled remote and mobile workforce has always been a challenge, particularly for traditional workplaces that just aren’t used to the associated autonomy of team members. And while Benetas has made significant inroads to improving outcomes for staff and clients in this space, there is more work to be done. Our vision for the next five years sees us offering the highest quality integrated statewide home care service program which responds to individual client needs and acts as a gateway to all Benetas services. We will trial new and innovative models of care that respect diversity and different needs, and we will demonstrate quality, choice and value for money for clients. But we are under no illusion that this can be achieved without the best people on board, working in the most collaborative and connected way possible. We’re just as committed to supporting our staff in the most effective way possible, because we know that we can achieve every little without them...|$|E

This approach {{is based on}} constructs from operations management, econometrics, and marketing {{and can be used}} by managers to make better decisions about product/service design and positioning services according to market needs. Empirical data for this study were collected from the pizza delivery industry in a large metropolitan area in the western United States. Pizza delivery profiles were experimentally designed based on seven attributes: promised delivery time, actual delivery time, pizza variety, pizza temperature, money-back guarantee, price, and discount. An econometric procedure known as probabilistic discrete choice analysis was used to identify the customer pizza choice patterns and managers’ perceptions of customer choice patterns. The results show how customers trade off among different attributes when choosing a pizza <b>delivery</b> company. <b>Managers</b> can use this information to position their operations according to customer needs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Algorithm {{of vehicle}} {{scheduling}} optimization could be integrated in the GIS platform. Therefore, distribution software can automatically make the <b>delivery</b> plan and <b>managers</b> also {{can make the}} optimizing choice of the optimal distribution route. Firstly, this paper introduces the necessity of introducing GIS into the logistics industry. Moreover, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the current path planning in the logistics distribution which often used in some algorithms (genetic algorithm, mountain climbing algorithm, ant colony algorithm, etc.) will be listed. Finally, a more practical hybrid algorithm will be used to the GIS so that managers can optimize the logistics distribution path selection...|$|R
40|$|Information {{management}} {{is growing in}} impor-tance in health care <b>delivery.</b> Practitioners, case <b>managers,</b> third-party payers, and health care policy makers are increasingly basing their health care decisions on timely and relevant clini-cal data. Since 1997, San Jose State University nursing students have been using the Nightingale Tracker, a computerized clinical communication system, to document client care, electronically transfer clinical information to their instructors, and maintain a systematic method for storing clinical data for further use in program planning, prediction of health care trends, and other research endeavors. Clearly, the potential increase in quality care makes the investment in this informa...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two primary}} anti-patterns for an Agile Leader; micromanagement and absenteeism. If a process is under control, and within allowed tolerances, staff {{should have the}} {{authority}} to deliver, without management intervention. This assumes a robust monitoring and reporting process, to identify when management intervention becomes required. This brings us to the other extreme, an absentee manager. A manager is ‘absentee’, even if they are physically in the office, if they do not monitor or engage with their staff to ensure <b>delivery.</b> Without a <b>manager</b> to eliminate impediments, it becomes nearly impossible to meet any schedules or budgets.|$|R
40|$|The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) {{has been}} {{considering}} a more decentralised {{approach to the}} delivery of interventions for customers. The central objective of such a decentralised approach would be to devolve greater powers to Jobcentre Plus Districts Managers and Personal Advisers (PAs) {{so that they could}} decide the appropriate type of provision needed to suit their customers and the local labour market. Under a devolved approach to service <b>delivery,</b> District <b>Managers</b> would have a high degree of discretion over provision made available to their local area and would be guided by a ‘menu of provision’ including such options as in-work support, specialist help for people with disabilities or the most disadvantaged customers, wage subsidies and employability skills. PAs would be empowered to choose relevant elements from that menu {{in order to meet the}} needs of their particular customers. Under such a system, receipt of services would not be dependent on the type of benefit claimed but would reflect individual customer needs. There would be fewer rules on eligibility, programme mix and length, with more flexibility, variation and local innovation...|$|R
40|$|Software process {{improvement}} (SPI) knowledge is often brought into organizations from outside, for example, by external experts. The {{idea of this}} work is to build up an improvement management framework for supporting managers in their work; finding improvement potentials and making strategic decisions about the implementation of improvement measures. The adaptation of the information <b>delivery</b> to the <b>manager's</b> needs and skills is {{one aspect of the}} framework and is solved by employing case-based reasoning. Additionally, we use an organizational model that is put forward as the basis for choosing the improvement action that fits most appropriately within the context and is most promising with respect to the organizational goals...|$|R
50|$|With an {{understanding}} of mental processing capability and a hierarchy that supports the proficiency {{of work in the}} organization Jaques provided some insight into effective managerial practices that are aimed at freeing up the human potential in the organization. For example, Jaques advocates the importance of effectively assigning tasks to individuals in the organization delivered by contextualizing the significance of the task(s) to the organization's purpose in terms of output including clear deliverables in respect of quantity and quality and the time for <b>delivery.</b> Moreover, a <b>manager</b> has an obligation to provide coaching to his or her subordinates, and the manager is in fact accountable for his or her subordinates' outputs.|$|R
40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the Engineering Doctorate (EngD) degree, at Loughborough University. The enterprises that deliver capability are trying to evolve into through-life businesses by shifting away from the traditional pattern of designing and manufacturing successive generations of products, towards a new paradigm centred on support, sustainability and the incremental enhancements of existing capabilities from technology insertions and changes to process. The provision of seamless through-life customer solutions depends heavily on management {{of information and knowledge}} between, and within the different parts of the supply chain enterprise. This research characterised and described Capability Engineering (CE) as applied in the defence enterprise and identified to BAE Systems important considerations for managing knowledge within that context. The terms Capability Engineering and Through Life Capability Management (TLCM), used synonymously in this thesis, denote a complex evolving domain that requires new approaches to better understand the different viewpoints, models and practices. The findings and novelty of this research is demonstrated through the following achievements:  Defined the problem space that Requirements Engineers can use in through-life management projects.  Made a contribution to the development of models for Systems Architects to enable them to incorporate ‘soft’ systems within their consideration.  Independently developed a TLCM activity model against which BAE Systems validated the BAE Systems TLCM activity model, which is now used by UK Ministry of Defence (MoD).  Developed, and published within INCOSE 1, the INCOSE Capability Engineering ontology.  Through the novel analysis of a directly applicable case study, highlighted to Functional <b>Delivery</b> <b>Managers</b> the significance of avoiding the decoupling of information and knowledge in the context of TLCM.  Through experimentation and knowledge gained within this research, identified inadequacies in the TechniCall (rapid access to experts) service which led to the generation of requirements for an improved service which is now being implemented by BAE Systems. The results showed that managing knowledge is distinct when compared to information management. Over-reliance on information management in the absence of tacit knowledge can lead to a loss {{in the value of the}} information, which can result in unintended consequences. Capability is realised through a combination of component systems and Capability Engineering is equivalent to a holistic perspective of Systems Engineering. A sector-independent Capability Engineering ontology is developed to enable semantic interoperability between different domains i. e. defence, rail and information technology. This helped to better understand the dependencies of contributing component systems within defence, and supported collaboration across different domains. Although the evaluation of the ontology through expert review has been accomplished; the ontology, KM analysis framework and soft systems transitioning approach developed still need to undergo independent verification and validation. This requires application to other case studies to check and exploit their suitability. This Engineering Doctorate research has been disseminated through a number of peer reviewed publications...|$|R
40|$|This study assesses if the Online Manager, a new {{technology}} implemented by the company Virtual Managers {{with the aid of}} CRM Systems, did create value for the firm. We propose a service deliver model based upon five service components: Virtual front office and back office, physical front office and back office and an integrator component. Furthermore, we discuss how the components should be designed in order to deliver value to the customer and profit to the company, then, a comparison is done between two periods (2007 and 2008) of time to determine the differences occurred at the level of service <b>delivery</b> in Virtual <b>Manager.</b> A linkage between our service delivery schematic and service quality is made in a value creation point of view, through the use value and exchange value dimensions. We conclude that in Virtual Managers, knowledge creation {{still has a long way}} to go...|$|R
