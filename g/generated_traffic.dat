5|$|Passenger {{traffic on}} the GCR was never heavy {{because it was the}} last main line to be built and had {{difficulty}} competing against longer-established rivals (especially the Midland Railway from its terminal at St Pancras) for the lucrative intercity passenger business. Low passenger traffic meant Marylebone was the quietest and most pleasant of London's termini. The GCR was unhappy about having to use part of the Metropolitan Railway's route to reach Marylebone, and opened a new line to High Wycombe on 2 April 1906. The additional suburban services <b>generated</b> <b>traffic</b> for the station, which had previously been so empty on occasion that the staff outnumbered passengers. While passenger traffic remained relatively sparse, the line was heavily used for freight, especially coal; in 1914, 67% of traffic was goods-related. Trains ran from the north and East Midlands to the freight depot adjoining the station, which was marginally the largest in London.|$|E
25|$|The {{announcement}} of the Gateway Program in 2005 by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation meant a large expenditure in transportation infrastructure. Despite the oppositions by the Metro Vancouver and several mayoral councils, the project went ahead to create the South Fraser Perimeter Road and the Port Mann Bridge, both which pass through major portions of Surrey. It has been criticized to be contradictory to not only Metro Vancouver's Sustainable Region Initiative, but also Surrey's Sustainability Charter. Studies have shown that {{with an increase in}} road capacity, <b>generated</b> <b>traffic</b> increases, that is traffic that is diverted (shifted in time and route) and induced travel (increased total motor vehicle travel). With the construction of the 10 lane Port Mann Bridge, the problem of suburban sprawl is exacerbated not only with the additional capacity, but RapidBus service was also cancelled despite expectations of a stop in Surrey.|$|E
2500|$|The {{line and}} Asker Station opened on 7 October 1872. [...] From 1875 Asker Station had four employees: a station master, a telegraphist and two carriers. The station served 17,466 {{passengers}} that year, rising to 33,851 in 1900. Travel time from Asker to Oslo West Station was about an hour. The {{arrival of the}} railway in Asker resulted in city dwellers buying or renting holiday homes in Asker. There was at first little settlements around the station, but as it <b>generated</b> <b>traffic</b> the interest for the area grew through the 1870s. Soon the neighborhood's general store moved to {{the vicinity of the}} station. A Narvesen kiosk opened at the station at about the turn of the century. Growth was gradual. From 1910 Statistics Norway registered Asker Station as a settlement, with 20 building and 184 residents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} characterizing analytically the autocorrelation structure of TCP traffic. We show that, under simple models, a single TCP connection <b>generates</b> <b>traffic</b> with an exponentially decreasing autocorrelation function. However, several TCP connections sharing a given link can <b>generate</b> <b>traffic</b> with long term dependencies, {{under the condition that}} the distribution of their round trip delays is heavy tailed. ...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{explicit}} port forwarding rules {{available through}} PCP allow hosts {{to reduce the}} amount of <b>generated</b> <b>traffic</b> by eliminating workarounds in form of outgoing NAT keepalive messages, which are required for maintaining connections to servers and for various NAT traversal techniques such as TCP hole punching. At the same time, less <b>generated</b> <b>traffic</b> reduces the power consumption, directly improving the battery runtime for mobile devices.|$|E
50|$|All <b>generated</b> <b>traffic</b> {{uses the}} UDP/IP protocols. Avoiding setting up {{connections}} between nodes lets more traffic {{flow in the}} network and the operational redundancy of every node can be used. Moreover, the UDP protocol {{could be seen as}} increasing the anonymity in the net because {{there is no need to}} validate source hosts to receive a datagram.|$|E

50|$|IXP traffic, anyway, is only {{a measure}} of local network traffic (mainly e-mail), while most of African <b>generated</b> <b>traffic</b> is routed through other continents, and most web {{contents}} created in Africa are hosted on Web servers located elsewhere. Additionally, measurable data do not consider private peering, i.e., inter-ISP traffic that does not go through IXPs. For example, the main academic network in South Africa, TENET, has 10 Gbit/s private peering with ISP Internet Solutions both in Johannesburg and Cape Town.|$|E

Now Inner Budapest has only 0.95 {{million inhabitants}} while the former suburb's population increased to 0.75 million. In the 1960s neighbouring villages became the new suburbs (second suburban belt) with rapidly increasing population (from 1950 to 2009 these former villages and small towns population increased from 300,000 to nearly 800,000).

5000|$|All self-similar traffic models {{suffer from}} one {{significant}} drawback: estimating the self-similarity parameters from real network traffic requires {{huge amounts of}} data and takes extended computation. The most modern method, wavelet multi-resolution analysis, is more efficient, but still very costly. This is clearly undesirable in a traffic model. SWING uses a surprisingly simple model for the network traffic analysis and generation. The model examines characteristics of users, Request-Response Exchanges (RREs), connections, individual packets, and the overall network. No attempt is made to analyze self-similarity characteristics; any self-similarity in the <b>generated</b> <b>traffic</b> comes naturally from the aggregation of many ON/OFF sources.9 ...|$|E

[...] In addition, mudslides killed three people, and left 5,000 homeless. The remnants of Lester produced heavy rainfall across the Southwestern United States causing flash flooding of arroyos and [...] moderate flooding in Denver.

50|$|Austin {{was founded}} in 1862, {{as part of a}} silver rush reputedly {{triggered}} by a Pony Express rider, William Talcott whose horse kicked over a rock. By summer 1863, Austin and the surrounding Reese River Mining District had a population of over 10,000, and it became the county seat of Lander County. In 1871 the Manhattan Silver Mining Company had consolidated most of the claims. The company grew {{to have a lot of}} influence in the area and its secretary M..J. Farrell was the state senator for Lander County. Farrell set out to fix the lack of a railroad with a controversial project, approved only after a bitter debate in the 1874 legislature, overriding the Governor’s veto. The legislature authorized Lander County in 1875 to grant a $200,000 of its bonds as a subsidy to build a railroad, a time limit of five years was set to finish the project.The Nevada Central Railroad wasn’t even started until 4 ½ years later, Anson Phelps Stokes the grandson of the founder of the Phelps Dodge Corporation and a partner in the mining company came to town. With Stokes involved he brought in General James H. Ledlie, a former Union officer in the Civil War. The crews went to work desperately, only to bring the line within 2 mi of the Austin town limits with less than a day left before the deadline. An emergency meeting of the Austin Town Board extended the town limits by two miles and the last rails were laid just minutes before the deadline. The line from Battle Mountain to Austin was 92 mi. Nevada Central was only profitable as long as the mines at Austin were operating at full capacity. By the middle 1930s most of the mines that <b>generated</b> <b>traffic</b> at Battle Mountain were shut down and boarded up and the NCRR had passed into receivership for the last time in 1938.|$|E
