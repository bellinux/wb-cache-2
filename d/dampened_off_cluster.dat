40|$|The diffuse plasma {{that fills}} galaxy groups and {{clusters}} (the intracluster medium, hereafter ICM) is {{a by-product of}} galaxy formation. The present thermal state of this gas results from a competition between gas cooling and heating. The heating comes from two distinct sources: gravitational heating associated {{with the collapse of}} the dark matter halo and additional thermal input from the formation of galaxies and their black holes. A long term goal of this research is to decode the observed temperature, density and entropy profiles of clusters and to understand the relative roles of these processes. However, a long standing problem has been that cosmological simulations based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and Eulerian mesh-based codes predict different results even when cooling and galaxy/black hole heating are switched <b>off.</b> <b>Clusters</b> formed in SPH simulations show near powerlaw entropy profiles, while those formed in Eulerian simulations develop a core and do not allow gas to reach such low entropies.

40|$|A common {{approach}} used to fuse simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI is to correlate trial-by-trial {{variability in the}} EEG, or variability of components derived therefrom, with the blood oxygenation level dependent response. When this correlation is done using the conventional univariate approach, for example with the general linear model, there is the usual problem of correcting the statistics for multiple comparisons. Cluster thresholding is often used as the correction of choice, though in many cases it is utilized in an ad hoc way, for example by employing the same cluster thresholds for both traditional regressors (stimulus or behaviorally derived) and EEG-derived regressors. In this paper we describe a resampling procedure {{that takes into account}} the a priori statistics of the trial-to-trial variability of the EEG-derived regressors in a way that trades <b>off</b> <b>cluster</b> size and maximum voxel Z-score to properly correct for multiple comparisons.

40|$|Blood {{flow data}} from direct {{measurements}} (4 D flow MRI) or numerical simulations opens new {{possibilities for the}} understanding of the development of cardiac diseases. However, before this new data can be used in clinical studies or for diagnosis, it is important to develop a notion of the characteristics of typical flow structures. To support this process we developed a novel blood flow clustering and exploration method. The method builds on the concept of coherent flow structures. Coherence maps for cross-sectional slices are defined to show the overall degree of coherence of the flow. In coherent regions the method summarizes the dominant blood flow using a small number of pathline representatives. In contrast to other clustering approaches the clustering is restricted to coherent regions and pathlines with low coherence values, which are not suitable for clustering and thus are not forced into clusters. The coherence map is based on the Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). It is created on selected planes in the inflow respective outflow area of a region of interest. The FTLE value measures the rate of separation of pathlines originating from this plane. Different to previous work using FTLE we do not focus on separating extremal lines but on local minima and regions of low FTLE intensities to extract coherent flow. The coherence map and the extracted clusters serve as basis for the flow exploration. The extracted clusters can be selected and inspected individually. Their flow rate and coherence provide a measure for their significance. Switching <b>off</b> <b>clusters</b> reduces the amount of occlusion and reveals the remaining part of the flow. The non-coherent regions can also be explored by interactive manual pathline seeding in the coherence map...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to support}} {{evolving}} standards, rapid prototyping and fast time-to-market {{are some of the}} key reasons for desiring programmability in future wireless base-stations. However, supporting highly complex signal processing algorithms for multiple users at high data rates (in Mbps), requiring billions of operations per second, while providing power efficiency present challenges in attaining that goal. This paper demonstrates the viability of stream processors for physical layer base-station processing by demonstrating a fully loaded 3 G base-station for 32 users meeting 128 Kbps/user (rate 1 / 2 constraint 9 coded data rate) at estimated power consumption of 8. 2 W. However, when the system load decreases and the amount of data parallelism reduces, clusters of ALUs in the stream processor remain unutilized and waste power. We provide reconfiguration support in stream processors that allows us to turn <b>off</b> <b>clusters</b> dynamically as the data parallelism reduces. Support is provided to turn off ALUs as well such that only the minimum number of ALUs in active clusters needed to meet performance requirements are scheduled. When the system load changes from a fully loaded 32 -user base-station at constraint length 9 to say, a more typical 16 active users at constraint length 7, the power consumption can reduce to 2. 23 W with 5. 06 W power savings due to frequency scaling and a further 0. 91 W due to hardware reconfiguration. Thus, by providing real-time and power efficient support in fully programmable hardware, the architecture and algorithm development for wireless communication systems can be made independent and limited versions of future systems can be deployed which can co-exist with current systems until programmable architecture research rises to meet the challenge...|$|R

40|$|Abridged) The {{thermal state}} of the intracluster medium results from a {{competition}} between gas cooling and heating. The heating comes from two distinct sources: gravitational heating from {{the collapse of the}} dark matter halo and thermal input from galaxy/black hole formation. However, a long standing problem has been that cosmological simulations based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and Eulerian mesh codes predict different results even when cooling and galaxy/black hole heating are switched <b>off.</b> <b>Clusters</b> formed in SPH simulations show near powerlaw entropy profiles, while those formed in mesh simulations develop a core and do not allow gas to reach such low entropies. Since the cooling rate is closely connected to the minimum entropy of the gas, the differences are of potentially key importance. In this paper, we investigate the origin of this discrepancy. By comparing simulations run using the GADGET- 2 SPH code and the FLASH adaptive Eulerian mesh code, we show that the discrepancy arises during the idealised merger of two clusters. The difference is not sensitive to the resolution of our simulations, nor is it is due differences in the gravity solvers, Galilean non-invariance of the mesh code, or an effect of unsuitable artificial viscosity in the SPH code. Instead, we find that the difference is inherent to the treatment of eddies and fluid instabilities. These are suppressed in the SPH simulations, while the cluster mergers generate strong vortices in the mesh simulations that efficiently mix the fluid and erase the low entropy gas. Consequently, particles in the SPH simulations retain a close connection to their initial entropy, while this connection is much weaker in the mesh simulations. We discuss the potentially profound implications of these results. Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} regular burning of {{woodland}} vegetation in Africa {{over an extended}} period (46 years) was studied in the Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda. Areas identified as having different vegetation types in 1958 were revisited to analyze vegetation changes and to test the prediction that convergence would occur {{as a result of the}} regular fire. In each of the three vegetation cover types, a transect was analysed. Results show that the vegetation cover types have changed and there is evidence of vegetation convergence. A detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and a Morisita similarity index analysis showed a good separation between the 1958 and 2004 transects for each of the vegetation cover types. The DCA also showed that the three 2004 transects were ompositionally closer to each other than the 1958 transects. The 2004 transects had also shifted away from the 1958 transects. Whereas in 1958 compositional similarity was highest between the Terminalia glaucescens conversion transect (T 2) and the wooded grassland conversion transect (T 3) (0. 86), in 2004 it was most similar between the transects closest to Wairingo river (T 1 and T 2, correlation coefficient of 0. 80). T 1 was referred to as the Terminalia woodland transect. Comparing the 2004 transects to the 1958 transects, a low compositional similarity was observed. The highest was between T 3 - 1958 and T 3 - 2004 (0. 62).
