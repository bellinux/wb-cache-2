The authors hypothesised that exposure to diesel exhaust (DE), {{a major source of}} PM, would induce airway neutrophilia in healthy subjects, and that either these responses would be exaggerated in subjects with mild allergic asthma, or DE would exacerbate pre-existent allergic airways. Healthy and mild asthmatic subjects were exposed for 2 h to ambient levels of DE (particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 µm (PM 10) 108 µg·m– 3) and lung function and airway inflammation were assessed. Both groups showed an increase in airway resistance of similar magnitude after DE exposure. Healthy subjects developed airway inflammation 6 h after DE exposure, with airways neutrophilia and lymphocytosis together with an increase in interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) protein in lavage fluid, increased IL- 8 messenger ribonucleic acid expression in the bronchial mucosa and upregulation of the endothelial adhesion molecules. In asthmatic subjects, DE exposure did not induce a neutrophilic response or exacerbate their pre-existing eosinophilic airway inflammation. Epithelial staining for the cytokine IL- 10 was increased after DE in the asthmatic group. Differential effects on the airways of healthy subjects and asthmatics of particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 µm at concentrations below current World Health Organisation air quality standards have been observed in this study.

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{repeatedly}} established {{adverse health effects}} due to long-term exposure to ambient air pollution. The Swiss Study on Air Pollution and Lung Disease in Adults (SAPALDIA) published a - 3. 14 % decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) per 10 microg x m(- 3) increment in particulate matter (particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 microm (PM(10)). Compared to the within-subject variability of FVC, the effect may be considered small. This individual (or clinical) perspective is, however, misleading. The {{purpose of this study}} was to demonstrate the public health relevance of apparently "small" effects, using the impact of PM 10 on FVC as an example. The scenario compares a population A, exposed to an annual mean PM 10 of 20 microg x m(- 3), with a population B exposed to 30 microg x m(- 3) mean PM 10. A shift of - 3. 14 % in the population distribution of FVC increases the number of subjects in the lower tail of the distribution. In population B a relative increase was expected of 47 % (16 - 91 %) in the prevalence of "FVC < 80 % predicted", (i. e., from 5. 17 to 7. 59 % and 5. 88 to 8. 65 % among males and females, respectively). The relative increase in the prevalence of "FVC < 70 % predicted" (approximately 1 % of population) was 63 % (30 - 98 %, males) and 57 % (21 - 86 %, females). An epidemiological estimate of a change in the mean value of the population distribution should not be misinterpreted as an effect on the individual level. However, the impact of a 10 microg x m(- 3) increase in particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 microm (PM 10) on the number of subjects with a clinically relevant reduction in lung function is quantitatively important...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe ELPI is an {{electrical}} low-pressure impactor that classifies aerosol particles {{according to their}} <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter,</b> and generates the amount of particles impacted {{on each of the}} 12 stages. This number depends on the measured current induced by the pre-charged particles and on the density which is given by the user and may not be a priori known. In addition, the density used by the software is considered to be similar for all stages. In this paper, a method to evaluate the density of the particles on each stage is proposed in order to consequently increase the accuracy of the results given by the software. The data needed are the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter,</b> the equivalent diameter and information on the form. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> is a range defined by the <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of the stages of the ELPI. To measure the equivalent diameter and evaluate the form, an adapted procedure that used microscopy and image processing tools was set up with the study of two different polydispersed aerosols, silica and fly ash particles from wood combustion. This method was validated with Silica particles (ρ = 2. 5 g cm− 3 with the pycnometer) : the density was found to be 2. 2 g cm− 3 and 2. 4 g cm− 3 for stages 2 (dae around 76 nm) and 3 (dae around 127 nm), respectively.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} constitutes one of {{the main}} threats to public health in Europe. Significant impacts on the health of Europeans in terms of morbidity and mortality have been observed, even in cases of low exposure and where pollutant levels are within limits set by the European Union (EU). The respiratory system is a primary target of the harmful effects of key air pollutants. Emissions of many air pollutants have decreased substantially over the past decades in Europe, resulting in diminished concentrations and improved air quality. However, in several European cities concentrations still exceed EU reference values and, more often, the stricter World Health Organization air quality guidelines for all regulated air pollutants (particles with 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameters</b> of 10 and 2. 5  µm, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), benzo[a]pyrene and ozone (O 3)) except sulfur dioxide.

The current authors aimed to determine whether pre-natal {{exposure to}} air pollution is associated with lung function changes in the newborn. In a prospective birth cohort of 241 healthy term-born neonates, tidal breathing, lung volume, ventilation inhomogeneity and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were measured during unsedated sleep at age 5 weeks. Maternal exposure to particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 microm (PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)), and distance to major roads were estimated during pregnancy. The association between these exposures and lung function was assessed using linear regression. Minute ventilation was higher in infants with higher pre-natal PM(10) exposure (24. 9 mL x min(- 1) per microg x m(- 3) PM(10)). The eNO was increased in infants with higher pre-natal NO(2) exposure (0. 98 ppb per microg x m(- 3) NO(2)). Post-natal exposure to air pollution did not modify these findings. No association was found for pre-natal exposure to O(3) and lung function parameters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) on total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in 30 European cities {{participating in the}} Air Pollution on Health: a European Approach (APHEA) - 2 project were investigated. The association was examined using hierarchical models implemented in two stages. In the first stage, data from each city were analysed separately, whereas in the second stage, the city-specific air pollution estimates were regressed on city-specific covariates to obtain overall estimates and to explore sources of possible heterogeneity. A significant association of NO 2 with total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was found, with stronger effects on cause-specific mortality. There was evidence of confounding in respiratory mortality with black smoke and sulphur dioxide. The effect of NO 2 on total and cardiovascular mortality was observed mainly in western and southern European cities, and was larger when smoking prevalence was lower and household gas consumption was higher. The effect of NO 2 on respiratory mortality was higher in cities with {{a larger proportion of}} elderly persons in the population and higher levels of particulate matter with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 mm.

Daily particulate matter (particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 mm (PM 10)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) associations with hospitalisations for respiratory diseases (n 5100 690), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n 538 577), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) among COPD patients (n 59886) and out-of-hospital respiratory deaths (n 55490) were estimated for residents aged o 35 years. For an increase of 10 mg?m- 3 in PM 10, we found an immediate 0. 59 % (lag 0 – 1 days) increase in hospitalisations for respiratory diseases and a 0. 67 % increase for COPD; the 1. 91 % increase in LRTI hospitalisations lasted longer (lag 0 – 3 days) and the 3. 95 % increase in respiratory mortality lasted 6 days.

However, several aspects {{of the relationship between}} particulate matter with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 mu m (PM 10) and respiratory mortality require further investigation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the PM 10 -respiratory mortality association in Italy and examine potentially susceptible groups. All deaths from natural (n= 276, 205) and respiratory (n= 19, 629) causes among subjects aged >= 35 yrs in 10 northern, central and southern Italian cities in 2001 - 2005 were included in the study. Pollution data for PM 10, nitrogen dioxide and ozone were also obtained. A time-stratified case-crossover analysis was carried out. Different cumulative lags were selected to analyse immediate, delayed, prolonged and best-time effects of air pollution. The shape of the exposure-response curve was analysed. Age, sex, chronic conditions and death site were investigated as potential effect modifiers. We found a 2. 29 % (95 % CI 1. 03 - 3. 58 %) increase in respiratory mortality at 0 - 3 days lag. The increase in respiratory mortality was higher in summer (7. 57 %). The exposure-response curve had a linear shape without any threshold. Sex and chronic diseases modified the relationship between particular matter (PM) and respiratory mortality. The effect of PM on respiratory mortality was stronger and more persistent than that on natural mortality.

40|$|The origin(s) of {{systemic}} inflammation {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is unclear. We investigated the impact of exposure to ambient air pollution on systemic biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8 and fibrinogen) and tissue repair (hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)) in 242 clinically stable COPD patients (mean age 67. 8 years and forced expiratory volume in 1 s 71. 3 % predicted) in Barcelona, Spain, in 2004 - 2006. A spatiotemporal exposure assessment framework was applied to predict ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and levels of particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 2. 5 μm (PM 2. 5) at each participant's home address during 10 periods of 24 h (lags 1 - 10) and 1 year prior to the blood sampling date. We used linear regression models to estimate associations between biomarkers and exposure levels. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in NO 2 exposure in lag 5 was associated with 51 %, 10 % and 9 % increases in CRP, fibrinogen and HGF levels respectively. We also observed 12 % and 8 % increases in IL- 8 associated with an IQR increase in NO 2 exposure in lag 3 and over the year before sampling, respectively. These increases were larger in former smokers. The results for PM 2. 5 were not conclusive. These results show that exposure to ambient NO 2 increases systemic inflammation in COPD patients, especially in former smokers. Copyright © ERS 2014...|$|R
40|$|A {{multicentre}} study (Pollution Effects on Asthmatic Children in Europe (PEACE) study) investigated {{the relationship between}} the daily variation of respiratory health and air pollution in children with chronic respiratory symptoms. Data were collected for 75 children in Hettstedt (polluted) and 63 children in Zerbst (control), Eastern Germany. The panels were followed from October 1993 to March 1994. Compared to all participating centres, these panels were the youngest and were in the healthiest condition. Respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were recorded daily in a diary. Ambient air pollutants as well as meteorological parameters were measured at local monitoring stations on a daily basis. During an episode in November, SO 2 levels went up to 499 and 363 μg·m- 3. The particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 μm (PM 10) values in the urban and in the control region ranged 1 - 95 μg·m- 3, but were missing during the SO 2 episode in November due to technical problems. The association between air pollution and health outcomes was analysed using regression models. In Zerbst, the control area, no association between elevated levels of air pollution and respiratory health were observed. In Hettstedt, the urban area, a significant decrease in PEF as well as an increase of cough in association with increased levels of PM 10 was observed. Prolonged exposure to PM 10 quantified by a 7 day mean showed the largest estimates. The results presented here suggest small adverse health effects of low levels of inhalable particles in a group of children with a low prevalence of respiratory symptoms...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{epidemiological}} {{association between}} cancer {{and exposure to}} ambient air pollution particles (particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 mm (PM 10)) has been related {{to the ability of}} PM 10 and its constituent nanoparticles (NPs) to cause reactive oxidative species (ROS) -driven DNA damage. However, there are no data on the molecular response to these genotoxic effects. In order to assess whether PM 10, NP and ROS-driven DNA damage induce carcinogenesis pathways, A 549 cells were treated with tert-butyl-hyperperoxide (Tbh), urban dust (UD), carbon black (CB), nanoparticulate CB (NPCB), benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) and NPCB coated with BaP for f 24 h. Single- and double-strand breakage of DNA was determined by comet assay; cell cycle status was analysed using flow cytometry. Nuclear extracts or acid-extracted histones were used for Western blot analysis of p-ser 15 -p 53 (p 53 phosphorylated at ser 15), p 53 binding protein (53 BP) 1, phospho-histone H 2 A. X (p-H 2 A. X) and phospho-BRCA 1 (p-BRCA 1). UD caused both single- and double-strand DNA breaks, while other tested NPs caused only single-strand DNA breaks. NPs significantly altered cell cycle kinetics. Tbh enhanced p-H 2 A. X after 1 and 6 h (2. 1 - and 2. 2 -fold, respectively). NP increased 53 BP 1 expression at 1 h (2. 4 – 8. 7 -fold) and p-BRCA 1 at 1 – 6 h. N-acetylcysteine blocked NP-driven p-ser 15 -p 53 response.

A population-based sample of 4, 365 adults was followed up after 11 yrs, including questionnaire, spirometry and DNA blood sampling. PM 10 exposure was estimated by dispersion modelling and temporal interpolation. The main effects on annual decline in forced expiratory flow at 25 – 75 % of forced vital capacity (FEF 25 – 75 %) and interactions with PM 10 reduction were investigated for polymorphisms HMOX 1 rs 2071746 (T/A), rs 735266 (T/A) and rs 5995098 (G/C), HMOX 1 (GT) n promoter repeat, GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 deletions, and GSTP 1 p.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{adverse health}} effects of {{particulate}} matter pollution are of in-creasing concern. In a recent bronchoscopic study in healthy volunteers, pronounced airway inflammation was detected following exposure to diesel exhaust (DE). The present {{study was conducted in}} order to evaluate the time kinetics of the inflammatory response following exposure to DE using induced sputum from healthy volunteers. Fifteen healthy nonsmoking volunteers were exposed to DE particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 mm 300 mg. m- 3 and air for 1 h on two separate occasions. Sputum induction with hypertonic saline was performed 6 and 24 h after each exposure. Analyses of sputum differential cell counts and soluble protein con-centrations were performed. Six hours after exposure to DE, a significant increase was found in the percentage of sputum neutrophils (37. 7 versus 26. 2 % p= 0. 002) together with increases in the concentrations of interleukin- 6 (12. 0 versus 6. 3 pg. mL- 1, p= 0. 006) and methylhista-mine (0. 11 versus 0. 12 mg. L- 1, p= 0. 024). Irrespective of exposure, a significant increase was found in the percentage of sputum neutrophils at 24 as compared to 6 h, indicating that the procedure of sputum induction itself may change the composition of sputum. This study demonstrates that exposure to diesel exhaust induces inflammatory response in healthy human airways, represented by an early increase in interleukin- 6 and methylhistamine concentration and the percentage of neutrophils. Induced spu-tum provides a safe tool for the investigation of the inflammatory effects of diesel exhaust, but care must be taken when interpreting results from repeated sputum inductions...|$|R

40|$|The Pollution Effects on Asthmatic Children in Europe (PEACE) {{study is}} a {{multicentre}} study of the acute effects of particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 μm (PM 10), black smoke (BS), sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) on the respiratory health of children with chronic respiratory symptoms. The {{study was conducted in}} the winter of 1993 / 1994 by 14 research centres in Europe. A total of 2, 010 children, divided over 28 panels in urban and suburban locations, was followed for at least 2 months. Exposure to air pollution was monitored on a daily basis. Health status was monitored by daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and a symptom diary. The association between respiratory health and air pollution levels was calculated with time series analysis. Combined effect estimates of air pollution on PEF or the daily prevalence of respiratory symptoms and bronchodilator use were calculated from the panel-specific effect estimates. Fixed effect models were used and, in cases of heterogeneity, random effect models. No clear associations between PM 10, BS, SO 2 or NO 2 and morning PEF, evening PEF, prevalence of respiratory symptoms or bronchodilator use could be detected. Only previous day PM 10 was negatively associated with evening PEF, but only in locations where BS was high compared to PM 10 concentrations. There were no consistent differences in effect estimates between subgroups based on urban versus suburban, geographical location or mean levels of PM 10, BS, SO 2 and NO 2. The lack of association could not be attributed to a lack of statistical power, low levels of exposure or incorrect trend specifications.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Within the {{framework}} of the APHEA 2 (Air Pollution on Health: a European Approach) project, the effects of ambient particles on mortality among persons o 65 yrs were investigated. Daily measurements for particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 mm (PM 10) and black smoke (BS), as well as the daily number of deaths among persons o 65 yrs of age, from 29 European cities, have been collected. Data on other pollutants and meteorological variables, to adjust for confounding effects and data on city characteristics, to investigate potential effect modification, were also recorded. For individual city analysis, generalised additive models extending Poisson regression, using a locally weighted regression (LOESS) smoother to control for seasonal effects, were applied. To combine individual city results and explore effect modification, second stage regression models were applied. The per cent increase (95 % confidence intervals), associated with a 10 mg?m- 3 increase in PM 10, in the elderly daily number of deaths was 0. 8 % (0. 7 – 0. 9 %) and the corresponding number for BS was 0. 6 % (0. 5 – 0. 8 %). The effect size was modified by the long-term average levels of nitrogen dioxide (higher levels were associated with larger effects), temperature (larger effects were observed in warmer countries), and by the proportion of the elderly in each city (a larger proportion was associated with higher effects). These results indicate that ambient particles have effects on mortality among the elderly, with relative risks comparable or slightly higher than those observed for total mortality and similar effect modification patterns. The effects among the older persons are of particular importance, since the attributable number of events will be much larger, compared to the number of deaths among the younger population...|$|R
40|$|Exacerbations {{of asthma}} have been {{associated}} with exposure to ozone or particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 microm (PM 10). We postulated in this study that the association of summertime air pollution (i. e. ozone and PM 10) with acute respiratory symptoms, medication use and peak expiratory flow differs among patients grouped according to asthma severity. During the summer of 1995, effects of ambient air pollution on these parameters were studied in a panel of 60 nonsmoking patients with intermittent to severe persistent asthma. These patients were recruited from our Pulmonary Out-patient Clinic. Subgroup analysis was performed on the degree of hyperresponsiveness and lung steroid use {{before the start of the}} study, as indictors for the severity of asthma. Associations of the parameters studied with ozone, PM 10, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and black smoke were evaluated using time series analysis. Several episodes with increased summertime air pollution occurred during the 96 day study period. Eight hour average ozone concentrations exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines (120 microg x m(- 3)) on 16 occasions. Daily mean levels of PM 10 were moderately elevated (range 16 - 98 microg x m(- 3)). Levels of the other measured pollutants were low. There was a consistent, positive association of the prevalence of shortness of breath (maximal relative risk (RRmax) 1. 18) with ozone, PM 10, black smoke and NO 2. In addition, bronchodilator use was associated with both ozone and PM 10 levels (RRmax 1. 16). Stratification by airway hyperresponsiveness and steroid use did not affect the magnitude of the observed associations. No associations with peak expiratory flow measurements were found.

During three consecutive winters starting in 1992 / 1993, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and respiratory symptoms were registered in a daily diary. Daily measurements of particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 mu m (PM 10), black smoke (BS), sulphate, sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) were conducted. The difference in PM 10, BS and sulphate concentrations between urban and nonurban areas was small, but there was more contrast in the concentrations of SO 2 and NO 2, In symptomatic subjects from urban areas, PM 10, BS, sulphate and SO 2 concentrations were associated with the prevalence of large decrements in morning PEF (> 20 % below the median). BS in particular was also associated with upper respiratory symptoms (URS), The magnitude of the effect estimates was in the order of an 80 % increase in PEF decrements and a 20 % increase in URS for a 40 mu g. m(- 3) increase of the same day BS concentration. In symptomatic subjects from nonurban areas, no consistent associations between air pollution and health indicators were observed.

40|$|Background: We {{examined}} {{the association between}} short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and nighttime primary care visits due to asthma attack. We also investigated the modifying effects of age on this association. Methods: A case–crossover study was conducted at a primary care clinic in metropolitan Tokyo. The subjects were 308 children aged 0 – 14 years and 95 adolescents and adults aged 15 – 64 years. All subjects made visits to the clinic for an asthma attack at between 7 PM and 12 AM. Data on hourly concentrations of particulate matter with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> ≤ 2. 5 µm (PM 2. 5), ozone, and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) were obtained. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of primary care visits per unit increment of each air pollutant. Results: Among children, the ORs in warmer months per 10 ppb increment of the 24 -hour mean concentration of ozone were 1. 16 (95 % confidential interval [CI], 1. 00 – 1. 33) adjusted for temperature, and 1. 29 (95 % CI, 1. 08 – 1. 55) adjusted for PM 2. 5, NO 2, and temperature. With respect to modification of the association by age, the ORs for 24 -hour mean concentration of ozone—after adjustment for PM 2. 5, NO 2 and temperature in warmer months—in children aged 0 – 1 years, 2 – 5 years, and 6 – 14 years were 1. 06 (95 % CI, 0. 63 – 1. 78), 1. 37 (95 % CI, 1. 05 – 1. 71), and 1. 25 (95 % CI, 0. 87 – 1. 82), respectively. There was no association between ozone and primary care visits among adults.

40|$|An {{association}} between farming and respira-tory diseases was {{recognized in the}} 18 th century [1]. In the 20 th century medicine first focused on acute lung diseases in farmers such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis or the organic dust toxic shock syn-drome (ODTS) and on allergic asthma [2]. In {{the last few years}} interest has turned to chronic ob-structive pulmonary diseases (COPD). A previous publication based on Swiss mortality data demon-strated a higher mortality rate from COPD, but a lower mortality from lung cancer among dairy farmers [3], suggesting either that smoking is not a major cause of COPD in this group or that farm-ers may smoke less than the average population. In California mortality studies found significantly el-evated mortality rates among farmers for all respi-ratory diseases [4]. Furthermore, several epidemi-ological studies in Northern and Central Europe reported a significantly higher prevalence of re-spiratory symptoms related to COPD such as cough and phlegm for dairy farmers compared with the general population [5 – 9]. A longitudinal study in dairy farmers in the French province of Doubs concluded that dairy farming is associated with a loss in respiratory function correlating with the duration of exposure [10]. Dairy farmers are exposed to organic dusts of a complex nature as characterised in detail by Kull-man et al. [11]. Toxic and immunogenic dust con-stituents include histamine, endotoxins, mite anti-gen, cow urine antigen and microrganisms (yeast and moulds, mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria) [11]. All these substances are known to be biolog-ically active and some can induce chronic airway inflammation [7, 12, 13]. Only dust particles smaller than 10 µ m can enter the lower airway sys-tem. [14] This PM 10 dust fraction (PM 10 = particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 µ m) may therefore {{play a role in the}} development of obstructive airway diseases.

40|$|As {{a part of}} the Pollution Effects on Asthmatic Children in Europe (PEACE) investigation, a 10 week {{panel study}} was {{conducted}} in Oslo, Norway, from December 1, 1993 to February 14, 1994. Of the 180 children recruited, 125 satisfactorily filled out a daily diary for the entire period, in addition to measuring peak expiratory, flow (PEF) twice daily. The children fulfilled the common PEACE selection criteria for having shown symptoms of lower airways disease. In Norway, geographic and climatic considerations led to choosing the control and urban sites slightly differently from other countries. The urban half of the population of school-age children was selected from those living in the city centre at low altitude whereas the control group lived in the regions surrounding the city, at higher elevations, usually above the winter inversion layer. This led to higher concentrations in the urban region as compared to the control, of particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 μm (PM 10) (period average of 19. 3 vs 11. 2 μg. m- 3), black smoke (period average of 27. 6 vs 13. 1 μg. m- 3), NO 2 (period average of 49. 3 vs 20. 8 μg. m- 3) and SO 2 (period average of 12. 4 vs 3. 4 μg. m- 3). The statistical multivariate, autoregressive time-series based analysis showed no consistent adverse relationship between symptom incidence, prevalence, bronchodilator use or PEF and air pollution exposure in children in Oslo. For symptom prevalence, however, some positive correlations were present, indicative of an adverse effect of pollution exposure, especially to SO 2. The prevalence of phlegm in the control population was positively associated with exposure to all compounds. PEF showed conflicting results with both negative and positive associations, yet giving an indication of a slight adverse effect of particles and NO/NO 2. Most adverse associations of air pollution with health parameters were found in the control population. In conclusion, no clear effects of air pollution could be seen on peak expiratory flow or medication use. The control panel tended to react more strongly to air pollution levels...|$|R
