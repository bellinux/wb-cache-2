2500|$|In 2010, Eagleman {{published}} Why the Net Matters (Canongate Books), {{in which}} {{he argued that the}} advent of the internet mitigates some of the traditional existential threats to civilizations.

5000|$|Much of the {{original}} impetus for the project, however, dated back a year earlier to a small meeting on <b>digital</b> <b>books</b> that Voyager sponsored on Bloomsday, 1990, attended by various pioneering multimedia and hypertext experts. Voyager had earlier released a successful CD companion to Beethoven's 9th Symphony, and Voyager President's president Bob Stein had obtained a grant to work on creating a similar product for literature. [...] At this meeting, the consensus emerged that, to overcome the relative inconvenience of being tied to a low-resolution and cumbersome <b>digital</b> display, <b>digital</b> <b>books</b> would have to offer [...] "added value".
