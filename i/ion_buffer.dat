Some {{signs and symptoms of}} ataxia are loss of balance, loss of muscle coordination in an arm, hand, or leg, difficulty walking, slur of speech, or difficulty swallowing. Ataxia is a non-specific condition characterized by a lack of voluntary movements to some degree. Rather than involving damage to the cerebellum, ataxia in EAST syndrome is due to the KCNJ10 mutation. In the brain, KCNJ10 is expressed in glial cells surrounding synapses and blood vessels as a K+ <b>ion</b> <b>buffer.</b> K+ is necessary to maintain a neuronal cell's membrane potential, and these glial cells are responsible for transferring K+ ions from sites of excess K+ to sites with deficient K+. KCNJ10 is a major potassium channel in these glial cells, and when this gene is mutated, these glial cells cannot properly clear K+ from the extracellular space and deliver K+ ions to places that need it. Excess K+ in these areas of synapse disturbs physiological excitability, resulting in symptoms of ataxia.|$|E

Furthermore, a dual metal <b>ion</b> <b>buffer</b> calibration standard incorporating copper(II) and iron(III) coordinating ligands to regulate the levels of free copper(II) and iron(III) in the buffer has been developed to enable simultaneous calibration of the bielectrode ISE array. In this work, the bielectrode ISE array has been employed in the continuous flow analysis (CFA) of free copper(II) and iron(III) in seawater media. It is shown that the individual electrodes displayed Nernstian response in the metal <b>ion</b> <b>buffer</b> calibration standard over a wide dynamic range (viz., 10 − 15 to 10 − 5 M aCu 2 + and 10 − 21 to 10 − 11 M aFe 3 +), {{and the results of}} repetitive CFA analyses of free copper(II) and iron(III) in seawater are commensurate with the typical values found in coastal seawater samples.

Most pertinent to the research proposed here is our own result (Fishtik and Povar 2006; Povar 1995, a, Povar 1996 b, c, 2000 a, b; Povar and Luca 2003, Povar and Spînu 2014 e).

30|$|The {{buffer action}} of {{homogeneous}} metal buffer systems {{is based on}} complexation reactions. The ligands, capable to bind the metals, thus, reducing their concentrations, {{appear to be a}} part of the resistance mechanism. The presence of excess ligand may fix the concentration of free metal ions at some value. If an additional amount of metal is added to the buffered solution, its concentration will be changed only slightly. This action is analogous to the acid-base buffer, and hence solutions containing an excess of chelating agent can be regarded as “metal buffers”. These theoretical relationships provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of buffer action, of <b>ion</b> <b>buffer</b> systems based on the complexing, competitive reactions (Povar and Spinu 2014 e, f).|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of hydrogen ions during the hydrolysis of ATP by myosin B {{and the consequent}} fall in pH can produce alterations in enzymatic activity directly, or by in-fluencing Ca ion concentrations controlled by metal-chelate systems. Adequate hydro-gen <b>ion</b> <b>buffer</b> systems can limit pH changes to acceptable levels. However, several com-monly used hydrogen ion buffers {{have been reported to}} have specific effects on contractile protein responses, and all buffers can indirectly change activity through their contributions to the ionic strength. In this study, ten potentially useful buffers suitable for pH control between pH 5 and 9 were evaluated for their effects on myo-sin B ATPase activity. In contrast to previous reports, all were found to have no effect on this system if both the buffering value (AH+/apH) and the ionic strength were maintained constant. Simple methods are presented for determining the total and ionized concentrations of any buffet pH control at any operating pH. Undesirable decreases in pH may occur in experimental reactions such as those in-volving t’he hydrolysis of ATP, in which there is significant hydrogen ion production (1). Reactions in the presence of metal-chelate systems, used to control the concen-tration of activating ions such as calcium, require even more stringent pH control than would otherwise be necessary. For example, if ethylene glycol bis(/?-aminoethyl ether) -N,N’-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) is used to buffer Ca ion concentrations, a drop in pH of 0. 1 unit may lead to a 50 % increase in the Ca ion concentration. These considerations emphasize the importance of using optimal hydrogen <b>ion</b> <b>buffer</b> systems for investiga-tions of the ATPase activity of contractile protein systems. The suitability of any particular buffer for a given reaction depends on a variety of factors (2).

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for in-line solid-phase extraction capillary electrophoresis (SPE-CE) for basic analytes was developed. The method {{is based on}} the use of a weak cation-exchange monolith synthesised in situ in {{the front end of the}} CE capillary via photoinitiated polymerization to form poly(methacrylic acid-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate), which was used to create the SPE phase in-line with the CE separation capillary. The monolithic SPE material exhibited a surface area of 23. 1 m 2 /g and a capacity of 403 nM for dopamine. Adsorption of the analytes as protonated, cationic species onto the SPE phase was achieved using an electrolyte of 6 mM phosphate and 12 mM sodium <b>ion,</b> <b>buffered</b> at pH 7. 0, which is above the pKa of the monolith but below the pKa of the analytes. Elution of the analytes from the SPE phase was achieved using an electrolyte with a pH below that of the pKa of the monolith, namely 12 mM phosphate and 12 mM sodium <b>ion,</b> <b>buffered</b> at pH 3. 0. Due to the discontinuous electrolyte combination, analytes were simultaneously eluted and focused as the electrophoretically mobilised pH step boundary moved through the SPE monolith, after which the analytes were separated by conventional CZE in the remainder of the capillary. Quantitative extraction from a solution of 0. 5 μg/ml dopamine and epinephrine was achieved when flushing up to 15 column volumes of sample through the capillary. The limits of detection (S/N = 3) for dopamine and epinephrine were 3. 7 and 4. 3 ng/ml, and this method provided a sensitivity enhancement for dopamine of 462 times compared to CZE using hydrodynamic injection. The developed method was used to preconcentrate a test mixture of neurotransmitters comprising dopamine, epinephrine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, metanephrine and also histamine. The applicability of this approach to real life samples was demonstrated by using a urine sample from a healthy person to detect dopamine at sub-ppm levels...|$|R

The incorporation of 0. 05 mN- 2 -hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′- 2 -ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), a new hydrogen <b>ion</b> <b>buffer,</b> into agar medium at pH 6. 8 led to the production of colonies at least 60 % greater in diameter than those obtained on media without HEPES at pH 6. 5 or 6. 0. In addition, the colonies often had the “fried-egg” appearance typical of “classical” large-colony-forming mycoplasmas. The addition of HEPES to liquid medium in the presence of 0. 1 % urea resulted in a slightly higher number of viable organisms and a corresponding increase in ammonia production. Rapid death of the mycoplasmas occurred on continued incubation of the liquid medium cultures even in the presence of HEPES. The larger colony size facilitated the study of hemadsorption and tissue-culture cell adsorption. Preliminary results of such tests in which these phenomena have been demonstrated are presented.

When tested at different times, native microbial community responses to acute cupric ion stress were quantitatively quite similar even when there were large differences in bacterial abundances and in situ metabolic rates.

In order to asses the potential of the various concepts, a principal understanding of the underlying mechanisms is necessary. The charge transfer (CT) complex Cu:TCNQ, which consists of copper as the metallic donor and Teracyanoquinodimethane as organic acceptor, is studied within the scope of this thesis. An established and widely accepted theory to the switching mechanisms in Cu:TCNQ has still been missing, despite published work of several groups on this topic. The main aim of this study is therefore the improvement of the physical understanding of the resistive switching effect in Cu:TCNQ thin films. In a first step, the design and construction of a high vacuum chamber is presented, which is customized for the deposition of Cu:TCNQ thin films. The development of two different thermal evaporation routes allows {{for the first time the}} fabrication of functional test structure with Cu:TCNQ layer thicknesses below 100 nm. The electrical characterization of these simple memory cells displays promising results. Among other things, the switching threshold voltages are reduced to the lowest reported values (< 2. 5 V) for Cu:TCNQ memory cells to date. Above all, valuable contributions regarding the physical origins of the switching mechanism could be extracted from the results of the electrical and physical characterization. It could be demonstrated for the first time, that the electrical characteristics of the reference cells were dominated by an interface layer to the Al top electrode. This interface could be identified as a thin, naturally formed aluminum oxide/-hydroxide layer. Impedance spectroscopic measurements in off– and on–state could be fitted accurately by means of equivalent circuit models, which are introduced for the Cu:TCNQ memory cells. Comparison samples without a Cu:TCNQ layer (Al/AlOx/Cu) are prepared in this context for the first time, and show remarkably similar current voltage characteristics. A new theory explaining the resistive switching in standard Cu:TCNQ memory cells is presented under consideration of all obtained results. It is suggested, that in devices with Al top electrodes, a naturally formed aluminum oxide interface layer acts as a solid electrolyte which mediates a Cu ion based electrochemical switching. The Cu:TCNQ layer appears to be a suitable spacer, which possibly stabilizes the reversible switching by acting as a Cu <b>ion</b> <b>buffer...</b>|$|E

The effects of these mobile phase parameters on the retardation of 26 nu-cleobases, nucleosides and nucleotides on the cation exchanger Partisil- 10 SCX and the anion exchanger Partisil- 10 SAX were examined and resulted in the formulation of the following simple rules: (1) These ion exchangers also have reversed-phase and normal-phase prop-erties; their occurrence is determined by the polarity of the mobile phase. (2) The {{ion concentration}} has an effect only on ion-exchange properties. (3) The pH of the mobile phase determines the degree of protonation of the solutes, and therefore the charge and polarity. Many solutes have different pK values, thus providing a tool for the variation of selectivity. (4) The polarity of the <b>buffer</b> <b>ions</b> has an indirect effect on ion-exchange chro-matography through differential distribution of the <b>buffer</b> <b>ions</b> over the two phases. This differential distribution is caused by reversed-phase or normal-phase charac-teristics. The integration of these three types of chromatography has been demonstrated by some examples...|$|R
