50|$|After redevelopment, {{wind shear}} {{continued}} to be a problem, with convection located southwest of the center. <b>Early</b> on <b>August</b> 17, a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed the system to become better organized. The convection became more concentrated and the circulation less exposed. As a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong <b>early</b> on <b>August</b> 18, still in the central South China Sea. Around that time, the storm began moving more quickly to the northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast. Although the JMA estimated peak 10 - minute sustained winds of only 75 km/h (45 mph), the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1 - minute winds of 100 km/h (65 mph), <b>early</b> on <b>August</b> 19. By that time, the storm was near Hainan, and at 1240 UTC that day, Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong.

5000|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{crossed the}} west coast of Africa between August 15 and August 16. Later that day and <b>early</b> on <b>August</b> 17, the system began developing more convection, while located just west of Sierra Leone. As a result, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system in the Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs). Thereafter, further organization briefly halted, though by <b>early</b> on <b>August</b> 18, associated convection became more concentrated. On the following day, the wave reached a [...] "high" [...] probability of tropical cyclogenesis. Between <b>early</b> on <b>August</b> 19 and <b>early</b> on <b>August</b> 21, minimal structural improvement occurred, despite increases in development probability. By August 21, the system developed enough organization for the NHC to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Nine; at the time, the depression was located about 715 mi (1150 km) east of the Leeward Islands, moving westward to the south of a large ridge. Conditions were generally favorable for further intensification, with the exception of northeasterly wind shear.|$|R
