Barbossa and his crew suffer a curse from Aztec gold that makes them a team of living-dead.

5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} and riboswitches {{are thought}} to be evolutionarily ancient due to their wide-scale distribution in distantly-related organisms. It has been proposed that, in the RNA world, RNA thermosensors would have been responsible for temperature-dependent regulation of other RNA molecules. RNA thermometers in modern organisms may be molecular fossils which could <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> a previously more widespread importance in an RNA world.|$|E

5|$|In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials {{have been}} found on Arran, {{although}} not Bute and place name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around Largs and an ornate silver brooch was found on a hillside near Hunterston that is of likely 7th-century Irish origin but with a 10th-century runic inscription. Five Hogback monuments found in Govan <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the series, Marceline the Vampire Queen is a thousand-year-old vampire. The Ice King is a {{recurring}} antagonist of the series, and frequently steals princesses throughout Ooo; although he is often at odds with Finn and Jake, he is generally not a serious threat. He was formerly a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who discovered a magic crown that gives him magical ice powers but eroded his memory and made him go insane. In addition, throughout the series, various character and events <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> the mysterious Mushroom War, a cataclysmic war that destroyed modern human society.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E
5|$|Telescopic {{observations}} in the mid-20th century began to <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> Io's unusual nature. Spectroscopic observations suggested that Io's surface was devoid of water ice (a substance {{found to be}} plentiful on the other Galilean satellites). The same observations suggested a surface dominated by evaporates composed of sodium salts and sulfur. Radiotelescopic observations revealed Io's influence on the Jovian magnetosphere, as demonstrated by decametric wavelength bursts tied to the orbital period of Io.|$|E
5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages {{can be attributed to}} the tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E

5|$|Ahalya's {{seduction}} by Indra and its repercussions {{form the}} central narrative {{of her story}} in all scriptural sources for her life. Although the Brahmanas (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the earliest scriptures to <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> her relationship with Indra, the 5th- to 4th-century BCE Hindu epic Ramayana– whose hero is Rama– {{is the first to}} explicitly mention her extra-marital affair in detail. Medieval story-tellers often focus on Ahalya's deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of the saving grace of God. Her story has been retold numerous times in the scriptures and lives on in modern-age poetry and short stories, as well as in dance and drama. While ancient narratives are Rama-centric, contemporary ones focus on Ahalya, telling the story from her perspective. Other traditions deal with her children.|$|E
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{retained}} Chotiner as {{a consultant}} to his first congressional campaign in 1946. In an era when the perceived threat of communism was a major domestic issue, Chotiner advised the future president to link his liberal opponent, Representative Jerry Voorhis, to a political organization which was believed to be communist-dominated. Nixon was elected, and hired Chotiner to run his 1950 Senate campaign against Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. Chotiner used a similar strategy in that campaign, stressing Douglas' liberal voting record and printing the accusations on pink paper to <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> communist sympathy. Congressman Nixon easily defeated Douglas, and Chotiner next managed Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign and counseled Nixon through allegations of antisemitism and revelations that there were privately run funds to pay Nixon's political expenses—revelations that the candidate decisively overcame with his televised Checkers speech.|$|E

5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Kingdom saw {{the decline}} of the {{official}} cult of Nyuserre. Evidence from this period come from works undertaken in the Karnak temple by Senusret I, who dedicated a number of statues of Old Kingdom kings including at least one of Nyuserre, to a cult of Amun and of the royal ancestors. At the same time, the 12th Dynasty saw the widespread dismantling of many Old Kingdom funerary temples for their materials, which were notably reused in the pyramid complexes of Amenemhat I and Senusret I. These events are contemporaneous with the life of the last priest serving the official cult of Nyuserre, a certain Inhotep. Both of these facts <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> a lapse of royal interest in the state-sponsored funerary cults of Old Kingdom rulers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat changes, the Solo Remix includes redrawn high-definition sprites and is optimized for the Retina display of iOS devices. The original soundtrack and additional remixes {{of these songs}} are included. Wireless and social media features are also included: the Tin Pin Slammer can be played with other players via wireless connections, and the game can connect with the player's social media applications to display these as scanned thoughts from non-player characters within the game. The Solo Remix version features a remixed soundtrack from the original DS release. New assets {{at the conclusion of}} the iOS game <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> a possible sequel, but no confirmation has been made by Square Enix. The iOS version of the game was pulled from the iOS App Store in February 2015 due to an issue that prevented the game from working with the iOS 8 operating system launched in September 2014, though the Android version remains available. It returned to the App Store in June 2015.|$|E

5|$|Krøyer's {{paintings}} of Marie between 1888 and 1906 present {{a record of}} the years they spent together. They show some of their most enjoyable times but also <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> the marital tension that increased as time went by. Among the most notable {{paintings of}} her are Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore (1892), one of Denmark's most popular works, which shows Marie on the beach with their dog and with the moonlight reflected in the sea, Roses (1893), which depicts her relaxing in the garden, and Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife (1899). Also of note are the depictions of Marie on holiday in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast of Italy in 1890; the portrait for the frieze in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel; Chez Moi, a series of watercolours of Marie and the couple's daughter Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen; and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, his last painting of her in which she is shown captured in the firelight with Alfvén.|$|E
5|$|The author {{noted that}} the {{character}} of Lavi was popular with fans, placing third in a poll (behind Allen and Kanda) despite infrequent appearances in later story arcs, and she promised that Lavi would return. The story arc involving Alma Karma, featuring several characters, was difficult for the author; as a result, the next arc in which Allen leaves the Black Order contained fewer characters per chapter due to its different format. The character of Apocryphos was introduced to <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> the Heart, a plot element briefly described in a past storyline which would later reappear. Due to Jump Square (the manga's magazine at the time) readership—older men, rather than children—Hoshino found Allen the most difficult character to write. She does not want Allen's problems in recent story arcs to lead to portraying him as a troubled teenager, preferring to show him as a cheerful person with a balance of strength and sorrow. After D.Gray-man dark narrative, Hoshino plans to write more lighthearted series in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{thunderstorm}} {{that would}} eventually produce the infamous F3tornado in Fort Worth developed from a cluster of storms that formed west of the city. At 4:38p.m. CST (22:38UTC), a severe thunderstorm warning was issued on the quickly organizing storm for Parker County. About an hour later, another severe thunderstorm warning was issued, this time for Tarrant County, as the storm continued to track eastward. Radar imagery showed that the supercell was rapidly organizing, developing a bounded weak echo region and hook echo—radar signatures that <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> a strong and potentially tornadic thunderstorm—in less than a half-hour. Radar also indicated that a broad mesocyclone had developed by around 6:00p.m. CST (00:00 UTC), extending vertically through {{the entirety of the}} supercell. At around the same time, a wall cloud was spotted in association with the rotating thunderstorm while baseball-sized hail fell ahead of the rotation in northern Fort Worth along Interstate 820. Winds from the downdraft of another small thunderstorm south of Fort Worth allowed the strengthening supercell to organize further. At 6:10p.m. (00:10UTC), a tornado warning was issued for Tarrant County, and accordingly emergency sirens were activated in the Fort Worth a minute later.|$|E
