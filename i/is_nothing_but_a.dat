25|$|Any ring R can {{be viewed}} as a preadditive {{category}} with a single object. With this understanding, a left R-module <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> (covariant) additive functor from R to the category Ab of abelian groups. Right R-modules are contravariant additive functors. This suggests that, if C is any preadditive category, a covariant additive functor from C to Ab should be considered a generalized left module over C; these functors form a functor category C-Mod which is the natural generalization of the module category R-Mod.|$|E
25|$|In 1839, {{the philosopher}} Hermann Ulrici {{wrote that the}} play and its {{depiction}} of human life reflected the views of Platonism. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> dream, suggesting influence from Plato and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour {{as an indication of}} parody about class differences.|$|E

The Seventh Doctor also met Hitler in the Virgin New Adventures novel , where Hitler was possessed by the powerful being known as the Timewyrm from pre-WW2 to 1940, learning to control its power before the Doctor tricked Hitler into banishing it by claiming that it was doing nothing to help him when in reality the Timewyrm's power was all that kept Hitler remotely stable {{in the early days of}} the war.|$|E

500|$|While Christian theologians {{held that}} the natural world {{was part of an}} unchanging {{designed}} hierarchy, some theologians speculated that the world might have developed through natural processes. Thomas Aquinas went even farther than Augustine of Hippo in arguing that scriptural texts like Genesis should not be interpreted in a literal way that conflicted with or constrained what natural philosophers learned about the workings of the natural world. He saw that the autonomy of nature was a sign of God's goodness, and detected no conflict between a divinely created universe and the idea that the universe had developed over time through natural mechanisms. However, Aquinas disputed the views of those (like the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles) who held that such natural processes showed that the universe could have developed without an underlying purpose. Aquinas rather held that: [...] "Hence, it is clear that nature <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> certain kind of art, i.e., the divine art, impressed upon things, by which these things are moved to a determinate end. It is as if the shipbuilder were able to give to timbers that by which they would move themselves to {{take the form of a}} ship." ...|$|E
500|$|The entire 13th Red Army stalled {{because of}} its defeat at Radzymin. After that success the Poles slowly but {{steadily}} pushed the Soviets back beyond {{the first line of}} defences that had been overrun several days before. By the end of 16 August, the 28th and 30th Infantry Regiments manned most of the trench line along the Rządza River, near the village of Dybów. Although initially the Russian command wanted to use the outskirts of Radzymin as a pivot for a tactical withdrawal to the Radzymin–Brześć line, the following day the Soviet commander ordered a full retreat towards Wyszków and later Grodno. Meanwhile, Piłsudski's 4th Army outflanked the surprised Russians and went as far north as the left wing of Nikolai Sollogub's 16th Red Army, which at that time was constantly pressured from the front by the 10th and 15th divisions. This made existing Russian plans obsolete, and Polish forces started a pursuit that ended with the victorious Battle of the Niemen River in September. On the day of Polish victory the Soviets issued a propaganda poster in Moscow proclaiming: [...] "Warsaw has fallen. With it the Poland of yesterday became history. It <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> legend now while the truth of today is the red reality. Long live the Soviets! Long live the invincible Red Army!" ...|$|E

500|$|The Berlin Vossische Zeitung, wrote: [...] "We have {{to count}} on reverses like that near Arras. Such events {{are a kind of}} {{tactical}} reverse. If this tactical reverse is not followed by strategical effects i.e., breaking through {{on the part of the}} aggressor, then the whole battle <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> weakening of the attacked party in men and materiel." [...] The same day, the Frankfurter Zeitung commented: [...] "If the British succeed in breaking through it will render conditions worse for them as it will result in freedom of operations which is Germany's own special art of war". General Ludendorff was less sanguine. The news of the battle reached him during his 52nd birthday celebrations at his headquarters in Kreuznach. He wrote: [...] "I had looked forward to the expected offensive with confidence and was now deeply depressed". He telephoned each of his commanders and [...] "gained the impression that the principles laid down by OHL were sound but the whole art of leadership lies in applying them correctly". (A later court of inquiry would establish that Falkenhausen had indeed misunderstood the principles of defence in depth.) Ludendorff immediately ordered reinforcements. Then, on 11 April, he sacked Falkenhausen's chief of staff and replaced him with [...] Loßberg. Loßberg went armed with vollmacht (a power of command [...] enabling him to issue orders in the army ccommander's name), replacing Falkenhausen. Within hours of arriving, Loßberg began to restructure the German defences. The British aimed to consolidate the gains made in the first days of the offensive, to keep the initiative and to break through in concert with the French at Aisne. From 16 April, it was apparent that the French part of the Nivelle Offensive on the Aisne had not achieved a breakthrough. Haig continued to attack at Arras, to continue to divert troops from the French on the Aisne.|$|E
