5|$|In March 2007, Silverstein {{appeared}} {{at a rally}} of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference. He highlighted {{what he describes as}} the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks. Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> for concern.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mortality, cancer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of considerable morbidity in women. Women {{have a lower}} lifetime probability of being diagnosed with cancer (38% vs 45% for men), but {{are more likely to}} be diagnosed with cancer at an earlier age.|$|E

5|$|The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization {{state that}} a {{blood lead level}} of 10μg/dL or above <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> for concern; however, lead may impair {{development}} and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, {{and there is no}} known safe exposure level. Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10μg/dL.|$|E
5|$|As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to {{the west}} between the two rivers into {{the foothills of the}} Berkshire Downs as far as Calcot, Tilehurst and Purley; to the south and {{south-east}} {{on the south side of}} the Kennet as far as Whitley Wood, Lower Earley and Woodley; and to the north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills as far as Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Caversham Park Village. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain. Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet floodplain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of road congestion there.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E

50|$|PND is {{suggested}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of extra-oral halitosis, especially when <b>a</b> sinus infection <b>is</b> also present. Acid reflux or heartburn {{is believed to}} aggravate {{and in some cases}} cause post-nasal drip. Post-nasal drip can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of laryngeal inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, leading to symptoms of vocal cord dysfunction (VCD).|$|R
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of it.|$|E
5|$|To {{termites}}, any {{breach of}} their tunnels or nests <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> for alarm. When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which {{causes them to}} be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area, {{which is also a}} way to recruit extra workers.|$|E

5|$|Yusuf {{has built}} a largely subservient and loyal {{apparatus}} by putting his fellow Majerteen clansmen in strategic positions. The National Security Agency (NSA) under General Mohamed Warsame (“Darwish”) and the so-called “Majerteen militia” units in the TFG army operate in parallel and often above other security agencies. Their exact number is hard to ascertain, but estimates suggest about 2,000. They are well catered for, well armed and often carry out counter-insurgency operations {{with little or no}} coordination with other security agencies. In the short term, this strategy may appear effective for the president, who can unilaterally employ the force essentially as he pleases. However, it undermines morale in the security services and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> of their high desertion rates.|$|E

25|$|Limited {{geographic}} range {{is the most}} important determinant of genus extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as mass extinction arises.

25|$|While {{the cause}} and {{progression}} of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood, research indicates that, among several other key observations, iron, aluminum, and copper accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
