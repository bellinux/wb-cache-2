5|$|Following {{the launch}} ceremony, the {{builders}} {{had planned to}} have Great Britain towed to the Thames for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour authorities had failed {{to carry out the}} necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner. Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision to fit the engines prior to launch, which resulted in a <b>deeper</b> <b>draught.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} HMS Glatton was also derived {{from that of}} Cerberus, {{although}} she exchanged one turret for heavier guns and armour. She was given a <b>deeper</b> <b>draught</b> for better seakeeping abilities, but retained the low freeboard of the older ships to make her a smaller target, {{making it difficult to}} weather head seas in heavy weather. Nominally intended for coast defence, she was designed to attack the defences of deep-water ports like Brest and Cherbourg.|$|E
25|$|The {{ships were}} the first freighters in ten years to be built to the highest Soviet ice class {{notation}} available for merchant ships, ULA. Their hulls, rudders and propulsion systems were dimensioned according to the then-latest ice class rules of the USSR Register of Shipping. When the ships are loaded to a <b>deeper</b> <b>draught,</b> their ice class is reduced to UL which, despite being slightly lower, is still equivalent to the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super.|$|E

500|$|Calypso and Calliope {{differed}} from their nine predecessors of the Comus class in armament; {{they were also}} slightly longer, had a <b>deeper</b> <b>draught,</b> and displaced 390 tons more. Originally planned as a ten-gun corvette, Calliope was completed with four [...] breechloaders in sponsons fore and aft on each side, twelve [...] breechloaders in broadside between the 6-inch guns, and six quick-firing Nordenfelts.|$|E
500|$|Hoods armour {{scheme was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the battlecruiser [...] with an [...] waterline belt. Unlike on Tiger, the armour was angled outwards 12° from the waterline to increase its relative thickness in relation to flat-trajectory shells. This change increased the ship's vulnerability to plunging (high-trajectory) shells as it exposed more of the vulnerable deck armour. [...] of armour {{was added to the}} design in late 1916, based on British experiences at the Battle of Jutland, at the cost of <b>deeper</b> <b>draught</b> and slightly decreased speed.|$|E
500|$|As {{the land}} dried, the peaty soils shrank, causing the land surface to drop. Much of the Middle Levels was flooded in 1841-2, and this led the Commissioners {{to obtain an}} Act of Parliament in 1844, which {{authorised}} {{the construction of a}} new main drain, [...] long, in order that water could flow by gravity to Wiggenhall St Germans, where the levels of the tidal river were about [...] lower than at Salters Lode. The work was completed in 1848, and the sluice at Marmount Priory was also built at this time, in order to allow boats with a <b>deeper</b> <b>draught</b> to navigate through Upwell and Outwell. A railway line from [...] to [...] passed through the port of March from 1846, which soon became a railway hub, with branch lines to Wisbech and St Ives. Traffic transferred from the waterways, which made the drainage responsibilities of the Commissioners easier. The new main drain enabled Whittlesey Mere to be drained. A pumping station with an Appold centrifugal pump was used to achieve this, rather than the more traditional scoop wheel. The pump had been shown for the first time at the Great Exhibition in 1851, where it amazed visitors, and its inventor was commissioned to design a pump for the draining of the mere. It was [...] in diameter, and powered by a [...] steam engine, could raise 101 tons of water per minute by [...] In 1862 an Act of Parliament created the Middle Level Commissioners as a separate body to the Bedford Level Corporation, although they had been almost independent since 1810, and they embarked on a series of improvements. Drainage was always the primary function, but navigation was also important, and the new body had powers to charge tolls for the use of the waterways.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{strongly}} {{believed that}} they had naval superiority over the Union. Although Union ships outnumbered Milne's available force, many of the United States fleet were simply remodeled merchant ships, and the British had an advantage {{in the number of}} total guns available. [...] Bourne suggested that this advantage could change during the war as both sides turned more to ironclads. [...] In particular, British ironclads had a <b>deeper</b> <b>draught</b> and could not operate in American coastal waters, leaving a close blockade dependent on wooden ships vulnerable to Union ironclads.|$|E
2500|$|The Calypsos {{differed}} from the ships of the preceding Comus class in armament, including new 6-inch rifles {{in place of the}} 7-inch muzzleloaders and 64-pounders that originally armed the first ships of the parent class. Although similar in general appearance to their predecessors, the Calypsos had guns sponsoned out both fore and aft and had no gunports under the quarterdeck and foredeck. They were also slightly longer, had a <b>deeper</b> <b>draught,</b> and displaced 390 tons more. [...] Calypsos engine produced an indicated were of 4,023 horsepower, over 50% more powerful than those of her nine half-sisters, which gave her one more knot of speed. [...] This compound-expansion engine could drive Calypso at 13¾ knots, or 14¾ knots with forced draught.|$|E

In 2000 Strintzis Lines renamed themselves as Blue Ferries. In 2001 she was sold to Marco Shipping Agency, Dubai and renamed Merdif.|$|E

50|$|The Sloyne is an {{anchorage}} in the River Mersey, in North West England. It lies off the Wirral shore between Rock Ferry and New Ferry.

In the 20th century it became the unloading point for the Tranmere Oil Terminal, being able to accommodate vessels of up to 65,000 tons.|$|E

50|$|The Vikings built many unique {{types of}} watercraft, {{often used for}} more {{peaceful}} tasks. The knarr was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, <b>deeper</b> <b>draught,</b> and {{a small number of}} oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the 'beitass', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind. It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.|$|E

After just three weeks, she broke down with a serious engine failure and was towed to dry dock on the Clyde.|$|E
50|$|Shipping in Melbourne was {{initially}} accommodated at wharves on the Yarra River downstream of Queen Street, and for ships of <b>deeper</b> <b>draught,</b> at anchorages in Port Phillip Bay. The Melbourne Harbour Trust acted on plans {{that had been}} developed in the immediate post war period, to construct a new dock {{at the mouth of}} the Yarra, which would reduce the turn-around time for shipping by avoiding the difficult route up to the river wharves. The shore at the head of Port Phillip Bay once accommodated fishermen's shacks, the last of which was demolished in the 1970s to expand the dock.|$|E
