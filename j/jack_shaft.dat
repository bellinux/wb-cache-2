2500|$|Lambert {{stopped the}} work {{at this stage of}} {{fabrication}} and shipped the non-working engine and incomplete automobile to a small machine shop that he owned in Ohio City. This way he could then devote his personal attention to the engine and automobile when he could from his businesses he was running there. The automobile consisted of two clutches and two chains, which were connected to a <b>jack</b> <b>shaft.</b> The two clutches gave two speeds forward and there was no reverse speed used. The single front wheel of the tricycle designed automobile was steered by a foot lever and a hand lever. This direct steering method provided that the arms could be rested and the steering done by the feet, and vice versa. One item that needed to be solved for completion and a working engine was a means of carburation. Lambert heard of a means of vaporizing gasoline by Gottlieb Daimler of Germany. He went to New York to see the engine that was operating a boat. After seeing this complicated carburetor Lambert developed what he called the [...] "vaporizer." [...] This was a simpler carburetor than Daimler's, which he was then able to get the engine working the way he intended it to. The automobile was completed soon after he had it Ohio City.|$|E
50|$|The Power gas {{locomotive}} {{was built}} by Gotaverken. It had a vertical, five cylinder, two-stroke diesel engine with opposed pistons. There was a single crankshaft connected to both upper and lower pistons. The exhaust from the diesel engine powered the gas turbine which drove the wheels through reduction gearing, <b>jack</b> <b>shaft</b> and side rods.|$|E
50|$|In 1908 and 1909 Krauss {{supplied}} 29 locomotives with {{a conventional}} outside driving gear, which nevertheless used a <b>jack</b> <b>shaft</b> between the main axles. They were given locomotive numbers 4507 - 4535. This driving gear enabled the water tank {{to be located}} below the boiler in the frame, {{so that there was}} more space on the gangways.|$|E
50|$|Microtunnel boring {{machines}} {{are very similar}} to tunnel {{boring machines}} (TBM) but on a smaller scale. These machines generally vary from 0.61 to 1.5 m but smaller and larger machines have existed. Usually the operator controls the machine from a control room {{on the surface of the}} ground. The Microtunneling machine and jacking frame are set up in a shaft at the required depth. The operator is given constant feedback about the machine’s location, orientation and hydraulic devices via a computer console or CCTV camera. Most machines also have video cameras set up to enable the operator to monitor activities in the <b>jacking</b> <b>shaft</b> and at the separation plant. The operator controls the MTBM and the jacking frame from the safety of the control room which is usually situated on the surface, next to the <b>jacking</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In general, as {{with flat}} belts, rope drives {{were used for}} {{connections}} from stationary engines to the <b>jack</b> <b>shafts</b> and line shafts of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery. Unlike leather belts, however, rope drives were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances. Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the [...] "flying rope", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of a pipe jacking project of the Wu'ai Electric Power Tunnel, funded by Shenyang Power Company and constructed under the supervision of China Railway Construction Corporation in Shenyang, China. This project involves excavation of three <b>jacking</b> <b>shafts</b> and drilling tunnels by pipe jacking technique. A 3. 5 m diameter reinforced concrete pipe was jacked below the Hunhe River over a length of 1000 m. Hand shield approach was adopted on the river bank as an alternative of operating an earth pressure balance micro tunnel boring machine under the river. The stress-strain behavior of shafts under the maximum applied jacking forces was evaluated by means of finite element analyses. Monitoring data (i. e., tunnel alignment, jacking forces, resistance at the jacking head, frictional resistance and torque of the boring machine) were collected during the jacking process and are presented here. A tunnel face collapse was experienced; the corresponding countermeasure actions adopted are described. The jacking design (i. e., pipe, <b>jacking</b> machine, and <b>shafts)</b> and remediation for tunnel failure may provide reference for future projects and assist in the development of new design guidelines...|$|R
50|$|The engine (with {{electric}} starter) {{is connected}} to the hydraulic transmission by a torsionally flexible clutch and a short articulated drive shaft. The reversing gear is directly connected to the hydraulic transmission and drives the <b>jack</b> <b>shaft.</b> The torque is transmitted by side rods to the wheels. A belt drive from the engine drives the radiator fan, the air compressor and the alternator.|$|E
50|$|Although {{starting}} cranks {{had been}} replaced by electric starters for decades, Ford cars included a manual starting feature until 1948 as an antidote to dead-battery syndrome. The wheel-lug wrench served as a handle (also for the jack) and the <b>jack</b> <b>shaft</b> with bayonet-coupling pins could be inserted through a small hole in the grille to engage a bayonet socket on the forward end of the engine crankshaft. A quick-and-easy twist of the handle was sufficient to start the flat head V8, and the bayonet coupling was self-disengaging for safety.|$|E
5000|$|The CB900C is {{something}} of a [...] "parts bin" [...] bike, as it shares components with two contemporary Honda bikes, the CB750 and CB900F. The GL and CX series of touring motorcycles of the time are the source of the final drive and rear suspension assemblies of the CB900C. The frame was derived from the European CB900F, extended 2 inches to accommodate the sub-transmission components. The sub-transmission involves a <b>jack</b> <b>shaft</b> that allows the rider to select a [...] "high" [...] or [...] "low" [...] range for the five gears, effectively giving an overdrive 6th speed for cruising.|$|E
60|$|The {{men took}} up the lad, and turned {{to go to the}} bottom of the <b>shaft.</b> <b>Jack</b> looked a few yards down a cross-road, and then {{followed}} them. He was in the act of turning into the next road to glance at that also, when he felt a suck of air.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine room}} of [...] was {{lengthened}} by ten feet to accommodate an experimental direct-drive propulsion system using concentric counter-rotating propellers. Although counter-rotating propellers produced impressive gains in {{speed on the}} experimental , in Jack the results were disappointing {{because of the difficulty}} in sealing the <b>shaft.</b> <b>Jack</b> was also used to test polymer ejection that could reduce flow noises that degraded sonar performance.|$|R
40|$|Microtunnelling technology, which {{includes}} different techniques for installing, replacing and rehabilitating buried pipes and cables, {{is among the}} new technologies appearing in world. The current interest in the technology {{is the result of}} increased activities to create underground installations such as the wastewater and surface water collection network, which in addition to high water tables, face the problem of landslide and problematic soil conditions. The most important and expensive parts of Microtunneling technology is concerned with pipe <b>jack</b> excavation method, <b>shaft</b> construction and any ground support systems to be used. Shaft is a point that cutting machine starts to excavate and imposed force on the back of pipes. The initial alignment of the pipe jack and its adjustment and positioning during pipe jacking process plays a major role. This paper is mainly concerned with the results of a case study conducted on a project to create a main collector of sewage network in {{the west bank of the}} river in the town of Ahwaz, southern part of Iran. Based on the specifications of the most critical borehole in the route of project, a new method for designing of the thrust wall is presented...|$|R
50|$|This {{self-locking}} {{property is}} {{one reason for the}} very large use of the screw in threaded fasteners such as wood screws, sheet metal screws, studs and bolts. Tightening the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to untighten. This property is also the basis for the use of screws in screw top container lids, vises, C-clamps, and screw jacks. A heavy object can be raised by turning the <b>jack</b> <b>shaft,</b> but when the shaft is released it will stay at whatever height it is raised to.|$|E
50|$|By 2005 Hani {{completed}} and released over 167 remixes! After {{ten years of}} producing & remixing for various labels, Hani decided {{to start his own}} record label to claim 100% of copyright ownership and publishing. He established Soterios Records in 2006 when downloading music from the Internet caused most major record companies to take a nose-dive in sales. Soterios is the portal to the many colors of Hani’s creative mind. It features his collaborative efforts with singers such as : Kristine W, Andrea Martin, Roland Clark & Virgin Killer. Hani writes, produces & programs almost 100% of his label’s releases under names such as : <b>Jack</b> <b>Shaft,</b> Miles Black Love, Extra Sauce & Ridikulous Kool. Soterios Records is currently on various online platforms including Beatport and iTunes.|$|E
5000|$|The Iveco PowerStar is an Australian {{developed}} and built prime mover, assembled in Dandenong, Victoria. It {{is based on}} the European Cab-Over-Engine models, but with a bonnet, it was available as both a day cab, as well as a sleeper cab. When first released in the late 1990s, it was available with Iveco engines, and also American engines, including Detroit Diesel's Series 60, Cummins ISM, ISX and Signature and Caterpillar C12 and C15. A selection of transmissions was also available, such as Iveco's ZF [...] "Eurotronic", Eaton's RoadRanger and Eaton's automated manual the Autoshift. Rear diffs were usually Meritor units, drive shafts were usually Spicer 1810 series on the main shaft and 1710 series on the <b>jack</b> <b>shaft</b> between the two diffs. Rear suspension was either Hendrickson HAS461 or NeWay. Electrical system was a 24 volt system.|$|E
5000|$|The shaft effect, {{also known}} as {{elevator}} effect or <b>shaft</b> <b>jacking,</b> is a phenomenon occurring in shaft-drive motorcycles. This effect occurs because the acceleration being applied to the rear wheel creates a reactive force on the drive shaft. This in turn lifts the rider and {{the body of the}} bike, exacerbating the natural [...] "tucking under" [...] of the rear wheel. Under acceleration Newton's third law says trying to turn the wheel forward exerts a reactionary force against the drive mechanism. In the case of a belt, this makes the top part of the belt tighten and the whole bike [...] "shrug" [...] down just a bit. This is typically obscured because acceleration causes the rear wheel to [...] "tuck under." [...] A shaft-drive, on the other hand has a rigid connection to the hub so this reactionary force turns the shaft backwards about the rear wheel and the middle of the bike [...] "tightens" [...] and lifts the rider up. This effect {{is one of the most}} notable differences between riding a shaft-driven motorcycle and a typical motorcycle. The effect is most pronounced on older models of motorcycle as most modern shaft-driven bikes use one or two Paralevers to limit the rotation of the rear hub relative to the bike frame.|$|R
