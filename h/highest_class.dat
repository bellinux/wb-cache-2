5|$|The 2012 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 66th {{season of}} FIA Formula One motor racing. It {{featured}} the 63rd FIA Formula One World Championship, a motor racing series for Formula One cars, recognised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) – the governing body of motorsport – as the <b>highest</b> <b>class</b> of competition for open-wheel racing cars. The championship was contested over twenty rounds, {{which started in}} Australia on 18 March and ended in Brazil on 25 November. The 2012 season saw {{the return of the}} United States Grand Prix, which was held at the Circuit of the Americas, a purpose-built circuit in Austin, Texas. After being cancelled in 2011 due to civil protests, the Bahrain Grand Prix also returned to the calendar.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Order of Karađorđe's Star was {{categorized}} {{as a senior}} state award, and organized into four classes. The Grand Cross of Karađorđe's Star, the <b>highest</b> <b>class,</b> consisted of a badge of the Order on a sash and breast star; a Grand Officer of Karađorđe's Star was decorated with a badge necklet and a slightly smaller breast star; a Commander of Karađorđe's Star was only awarded a badge necklet; and {{the recipient of the}} Order's fourth class, the Officer of Karađorđe's Star, would receive a small triangular chest ribbon. The Order was usually awarded for services to the Karađorđević dynasty, the Serbian state or the Serb people, while Karađorđević princes received a Grand Cross at baptism. Recipients included both soldiers and civilians, though until 1906 only Serbian citizens were permitted to receive the award.|$|E
5|$|The biggest {{group were}} the Bamonns, who were {{converts}} from the priestly Brahmin class. All Brahmin sub-castes {{such as the}} Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Padyes, and Daivadnyas, especially the goldsmiths and a few merchants, were lumped into the Christian caste of Bamonn. The descendants of Goud Saraswat converts comprised the majority of this caste. The Bamonns were further divided into other castes according to rank. In Mangalore, they were sub-divided into Sirudhegars (the <b>highest</b> <b>class),</b> Alhdhengars, Cutdhnangars, Dhivodegars, Nathnolegars, Sashragars, Puruvargars, and Maidhegars. These names are taken from the villages to which they once belonged. This group constituted the landed gentry. In accordance with traditional Hindu law that allowed a Brahmin to practice any occupation except cultivation, the Bamonns refrained from cultivating their lands, and leased them to tenants.|$|E

25|$|From 2005/2006 to 2006/2007, {{there was}} a {{significant}} increase in the number of schools in Puntland, up 137 institutions from just one year prior. During the same period, the number of classes in the region increased by 504, with 762 more teachers also offering their services. Total student enrollment increased by 27% over the previous year, with girls lagging only slightly behind boys in attendance in most regions. The <b>highest</b> <b>class</b> enrollment was observed in the northernmost Bari region, and the lowest was observed in the under-populated Ayn region.

25|$|The {{papers of}} the day {{described}} the new ship as 320ft long, 44ft broad, and 28ft 8.5 in deep. On deck there was accommodation for 90 saloon and 40 second saloon passengers. This was later reported as 150 saloon and 46 second saloon passengers. She {{was to have a}} speed of 12.5 knots at sea on a draught of 12ft. The total capacity on a draught of 21ft will be 3500 tons, including bunker coal. She was built of steel of the <b>highest</b> <b>class</b> of the British Corporation Registry and under their special survey. The propulsion was two triple-expansion engines. The vessel was built under the supervision of Captain Cameron, Marine Superintendent of the company. At her sea trials near Skelmorlie on the Firth of Clyde she attained 15 knots.|$|E

25|$|In Feb. 1992, {{he scored}} a memorable 131 against the touring West Bengal {{side in a}} 3-day match at Dhaka. Batting first the {{tourists}} scored 384/5 (decl.) left-handed No. 3 Raja Venkat scored 154, another more well known left-hander Sourav Ganguly made 129. In reply, the home side was struggling at 77/4. At this stage, Moni entered the wicket. With ever reliable Aminul Islam, he put on 104 for the 5th wicket. There was good understanding between the two, as {{they were involved in}} a number of vital partnerships down the order for Bangladesh. Aminul Islam went for 55, but Moni carried on ruthlessly demolishing the opposition bowling. Bangladesh eventually reached 302, thanks mainly to 131 by Moni. Aided by the tail enders, he went after the WB bowling. He was especially harsh on the slow bowlers, lofting them for a number of sixes. As the national stadium crowd were basking in afternoon sunshine (it was early spring), they also enjoyed batting of the <b>highest</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{will be a}} lot {{of sympathy}} for Watkins when he takes the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the <b>highest</b> <b>class,</b> who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas do not agree with the pundits who have criticised his selection. Very simply, we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. Our best spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E
25|$|Miss Jummy (18831889), was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare who won two British Classic Races in 1886. In {{a career}} that lasted from July 1885 to September 1886 the filly ran fifteen times and won eight races at {{distances}} ranging from five furlongs to one and three quarter miles. As a two-year-old in 1885, Miss Jummy won three times from seven starts, but when tried in the <b>highest</b> <b>class</b> she was unplaced behind the future Triple Crown winner Ormonde in the Dewhurst Stakes. In 1886, Miss Jummy was unbeaten when racing against her own age and sex, winning five races including the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Oaks at Epsom, the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood and the Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster. She was unsuccessful in open competition, finishing unplaced in the Grand Prix de Paris and the Eclipse Stakes. At the end of 1886 she was retired to stud where her record was disappointing.|$|E
