5|$|In the 1940s, the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the castle tower collapsed; the corner {{fell to the ground}} intact and because of its archaeological value it was decided to leave the fallen stonework in place on the ground, rather than risk further damaging it by removing it. In 1946 the castle was given to the Ministry of Works, and <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control of the Welsh heritage agency Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction. The castle sits within the grounds of the small Loughor Castle Park.|$|E

After the closure of the station, all trains terminated at Avonmouth Dock. The station site <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of Avonmouth Docks.|$|E
