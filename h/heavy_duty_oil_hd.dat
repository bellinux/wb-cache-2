40|$|The M. A. N. -KZ type is one {{of large}} two-cycle marine diesel engines. In order to save the system oil in engines, it is {{important}} to reduce the leakage loss and to keep the oil in good quality as far as possible. Leakage tests and measurements of acid value, performed on the Hôsei Maru during her three voyages in 1960, gave the following results. 1) The mean total consumption was 130 l/day, and the rate of consumption as ""piston rod scraped oil"" was largest (Table 1, Table 2, Fig. 2). It should be collected carefully, and be returned into the system after a chemical treatment (Fig. 3). 2) Water and combustibles gave heavy injuries to the system oil. 3) A mass of exhaust gas leaking into the crank case through control valve bearings caused a severe deterioration to the system oil. For the purpose of intercepting exhaust gas, it seems useful to reinforce Labyrinth seals and apply a special grease to bearings (Fig. 1, ① ④). 4) <b>Heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>oil</b> is not suitable to this kind of engine, because it makes emulsion with water and gives fatal damages not only to the oil but also to the engine (Table 3). ...|$|R

40|$|Energy use in trucks {{has been}} {{increasing}} {{at a faster rate}} than that of automobiles within the U. S. transportation sector. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook (AEO), a 23 % increase in fuel consumption for the U. S. <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> truck segment is expected between 2009 to 2020. The <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> vehicle <b>oil</b> consumption is projected to grow between 2009 and 2050 while light duty vehicle (LDV) fuel consumption will eventually experience a decrease. By 2050, the oil consumption rate by LDVs is anticipated to decrease below 2009 levels due to CAFE standards and biofuel use. In contrast, the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>oil</b> consumption rate is anticipated to double. The increasing trend in oil consumption for heavy trucks is linked to the vitality, security, and growth of the U. S. economy. An essential part of a stable and vibrant U. S. economy is a productive U. S. trucking industry. Studies have shown that the U. S. gross domestic product (GDP) is strongly correlated to freight transport. Over 90 % of all U. S. freight tonnage is transported by diesel power and over 75 % is transported by trucks. Given the vital role that the trucking industry plays in the economy, improving the efficiency of the transportation of goods was a central focus of the Cummins High Efficient Clean Combustion (HECC) program. In a commercial vehicle, the diesel engine remains the largest source of fuel efficiency loss, but remains the greatest opportunity for fuel efficiency improvements. In addition to reducing oil consumption and the dependency on foreign oil, this project will mitigate the impact on the environment by meeting US EPA 2010 emissions regulations. Innovation is a key element in sustaining a U. S. trucking industry that is competitive in global markets. Unlike passenger vehicles, the trucking industry cannot simply downsize the vehicle and still transport the freight with improved efficiency. The truck manufacturing and supporting industries are faced with numerous challenges to reduce oil consumption and greenhouse gases, meet stringent emissions regulations, provide customer value, and improve safety. The HECC program successfully reduced engine fuel consumption and greenhouse gases while providing greater customer valve. The US EPA 2010 emissions standard poses a significant challenge for developing clean diesel powertrains that meet the DoE Vehicle Technologies Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP) for fuel efficiency improvement while remaining affordable. Along with exhaust emissions, an emphasis on <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> vehicle fuel efficiency is being driven by increased energy costs as well as the potential regulation of greenhouse gases. An important element of the success of meeting emissions while significantly improving efficiency is leveraging Cummins component technologies such as fuel injection equipment, aftertreatment, turbomahcinery, electronic controls, and combustion systems. Innovation in component technology coupled with system integration is enabling Cummins to move forward with the development of high efficiency clean diesel products with a long term goal of reaching a 55 % peak brake thermal efficiency for the engine plus aftertreatment system. The first step in developing high efficiency clean products has been supported by the DoE co-sponsored HECC program. The objectives of the HECC program are: (1) To design and develop advanced diesel engine architectures capable of achieving US EPA 2010 emission regulations while improving the brake thermal efficiency by 10 % compared to the baseline (a state of the art 2007 production diesel engine). (2) To design and develop components and subsystems (fuel systems, air handling, controls, etc) to enable construction and development of multi-cylinder engines. (3) To perform an assessment of the commercial viability of the newly developed engine technology. (4) To specify fuel properties conducive to improvements in emissions, reliability, and fuel efficiency for engines using high-efficiency clean combustion (HECC) technologies. To demonstrate the technology is compatible with B 20 (biodiesel). (5) To further improve the brake thermal efficiency of the engine as integrated into the vehicle. To demonstrate robustness and commercial viability of the HECC engine technology as integrated into the vehicles. The Cummins HECC program supported the Advanced Combustion Engine R&D and Fuels Technology initiatives of the DoE Vehicle Technologies Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP). In particular, the HECC project goals enabled the DoE Vehicle Technologies Program (VTP) to meet energy-efficiency improvement targets for advanced combustion engines suitable for passenger and commercial vehicles, as well as addressing technology barriers and R&D needs that are common between passenger and commercial vehicle applications of advanced combustion engines...|$|R
5000|$|The main use of ZDDP is in {{anti-wear}} additives to lubricants such as greases, gear oils, {{and motor}} oils, which usually contain from 600ppm for some modern energy conserving low viscosity oils to 2000ppm of this additive in some racing oils. It {{has been reported}} that zinc and phosphorus emissions may damage catalytic converters and standard formulations of lubricating oils for gasoline engines now have reduced amounts of the additive due to the API limiting the concentration of this additive in new API SM and SN oils, however this only affects 20 and 30 grade [...] "ILSAC" [...] oils, 40 and higher grades have no regulation regarding the concentration of ZDDP except for diesel oils meeting the API CJ-4 specification which have had the level of zddp reduced slightly, although most diesel <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> Engine <b>oils</b> still have a higher concentration of this additive. [...] Crankcase oils with reduced ZDDP have been cited as causing damage to, or failure of, classic/collector car flat tappet camshafts and lifters which undergo very high boundary layer pressures and/or shear forces at their contact faces, and in other regions such as big-end/main bearings, and piston rings and pins. Roller camshafts/followers are more commonly used to reduce camshaft lobe friction in modern engines. There are additives, such as STP(R) Oil Treatment, and some racing oils such as PurOl, Brad Penn and Valvoline VR-1, which are available in the retail market with the necessary amount of ZDDP for engines using increased valve spring pressures. The same ZDDP compounds serve also as corrosion inhibitors and antioxidants.|$|R
