40|$|AbstractThe {{generalized}} {{theory of}} thermo-elasticity of Type III recently developed by Green and Naghdi is employed to study thermo-elastic interactions in a homogeneous isotropic unbounded solid having distributed instantaneous and continuous heat sources. The solutions are derived by using Laplace transform {{on time and}} then Fourier transform on space. It is found that the interactions consist of a wave travelling {{with the speed of}} <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> and a diffusive part. The temperature and the deformation field are both continuous at the <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> front while the stress field exhibits finite discontinuity at this location in case of instantaneous distributed heat sources. For continuous distributed heat sources, the thermal, deformation, and stress fields are however all continuous at the <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> front. All the fields suffer exponential attenuation at the <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> front and the attenuation is influenced by the thermo-elastic coupling and the thermal diffusivity of the medium. The results of the present analysis are compared to those derived by using other generalized thermo-elasticity theories such as L-S theory and G-L theory. The analysis reveals that G-N theory III eliminates some of the finite discontinuities and δ-function singularity in the deformation, temperature and stress fields derived by using other generalized thermo-elasticity theories in earlier investigations. Finally, numerical results applicable to a copper-like material are presented in order to illustrate the analytical result...|$|E

We {{take into account the}} effect of the thermal and viscous dissipation energies upon the corresponding waves and, consequently, we study the damped in time wave solutions. There are five basic waves in an isotropic and homogeneous thermoviscoelastic porous space. Two of them are shear waves, while the remaining three are <b>dilatational</b> <b>waves.</b> The shear waves are uncoupled, damped in time with decay rate depending only on the viscosity coefficients.

The explicit form of the dispersion equation is obtained in terms of the wave speed and the thermoviscoelastic homogeneous profile. Furthermore, we use numerical methods and computations to solve the secular equation for some special classes of thermoviscoelastic materials considered in literature...|$|R

The {{present study}} investigates {{novelties}} brought about into the classic Biot’s theory of propagation of elastic waves in a fluid-saturated porous solid by inclusion of non-Newtonian effects that are important, for example, for hydrocarbons. Based on our previous results (Tsiklauri & Beresnev: 2001, Phys. Rev.

We found that the replacement of an ordinary Newtonian fluid by a Maxwell fluid in the fluid-saturated porous solid results in: (a) an overall increase of the phase velocities of both the rotational and <b>dilatational</b> <b>waves.</b> With the increase of frequency these quantities tend to a fixed, higher, as compared to the Newtonian limiting case, level which is not changing with the decrease of the Deborah number α.

40|$|A {{study is}} made of the {{propagation}} of time-harmonic magneto-thermoviscoelastic plane waves in a homogeneous electrically conducting viscoelastic medium of Kelvin-Voigt type permeated by a primary uniform external magnetic field when the entire medium rotates with a uniform angular velocity. The generalized thermoelasticity theory of type II (Green and Naghdi model) is used to study the propagation of waves. A more general dispersion equation for coupled waves is derived to ascertain the effects of rotation, finite thermal wave speed of GN theory, viscoelastic parameters and the external magnetic field on the phase velocity, the attenuation coefficient, and the specific energy loss of the waves. Limiting cases for low and high frequencies are also studied. In absence of rotation, external magnetic field, and viscoelasticity, the general dispersion equation reduces to the dispersion equation for coupled thermal <b>dilatational</b> <b>waves</b> in generalized thermoelasticity II (GN model), not considered before.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{propagation}} of plane time harmonic waves in the infinite space filled by a time differential dual-phase-lag thermoelastic material. There are six possible basic waves travelling with distinct speeds, out of which, two are shear waves, and the remaining four are <b>dilatational</b> <b>waves.</b> The shear waves {{are found to be}} uncoupled, undamped in time and travels independently with the speed that is unaffected by the thermal effects. All the other possible four <b>dilatational</b> <b>waves</b> are found to be coupled, damped in time and dispersive due to the presence of thermal properties of the material. In fact, there is a damped in time longitudinal quasi-elastic wave whose amplitude decreases exponentially to zero when the time is going to infinity. There is also a quasi-thermal mode, like the classical purely thermal disturbance, which is a standing wave decaying exponentially to zero when the time goes to infinity. Furthermore, there are two possible longitudinal quasi-thermal waves that are damped in time with different decreasing rates or there is one plane harmonic in time longitudinal thermal wave, depending on the values of the time delays. The surface wave problem is studied for a half space filled by a dual-phase-lag thermoelastic material. The surface of the half space is free of traction and it is free to exchange heat with the ambient medium. The dispersion relation is written in an explicit way and the secular equation is established.

40|$|The {{identifiability}} {{of the two}} damping {{components of}} a Generalized Rayleigh Damping model is investigated through analysis of the continuum equilibrium equations {{as well as a}} simple spring-mass system. Generalized Rayleigh Damping provides a more diversified attenuation model than pure Viscoelasticity, with two parameters to describe attenuation effects and account for the complex damping behavior found in biological tissue. For heterogeneous Rayleigh Damped materials, there is no equivalent Viscoelastic system to describe the observed motions. For homogeneous systems, the inverse problem to determine the two Rayleigh Damping components is seen to be uniquely posed, {{in the sense that the}} inverse matrix for parameter identification is full rank, with certain conditions: when either multi-frequency data is available or when both shear and <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> propagation is taken into account. For the multi-frequency case, the frequency dependency of the elastic parameters adds a level of complexity to the reconstruction problem that must be addressed for reasonable solutions. For the <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> case, the accuracy of compressional wave measurement in fluid saturated soft tissues becomes an issue for qualitative parameter identification. These issues can be addressed with reasonable assumptions on the negligible damping levels of dilatational waves in soft tissue. In general, the parameters of a Generalized Rayleigh Damping model are identifiable for the elastography inverse problem, although with more complex conditions than the simpler Viscoelastic damping model. The value of this approach is the additional structural information provided by the Generalized Rayleigh Damping model, which can be linked to tissue composition as well as rheological interpretations...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, TNO has {{developed}} a water-filled interferometer, which is able to determine acoustical properties of a sound absorbing material or a compliant layer like the Alberich coating. The frequency range of the measurements is 1. 5 to 20 kHz. The main results are mostly {{in the form of}} absolute reflection losses of the material mounted onto an air-backed stiff, massive brass block. The transmission loss TL of the material mounted, for example, onto a semi-submerged steel plate cannot be obtained directly from these data. This difficulty can be circumvented by considering the complex impedance of the layer. This quantity yields much more information about the acoustical properties of the material itself, like the sound speed for dilatational waves. If this speed is known, it is in principle feasible to calculate transmission losses for a layer on a steel plate under various configurations. Wider applications are also possible, such as determination of compressional wave speeds of rubbers with cavities. Recently, a novel method has been developed in order to measure the complex (amplitude and phase) reflection coefficient as a function of frequency using the interferometer. From these data the complex impedance of a layer can be calculated. Corrections can be included {{for the fact that the}} terminator block has a finite impedance. The complex <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> speed as a function of frequency can be determined by using a rootfinding algorithm in the complex impedance curves. Measurements of the <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> speed in various rubbers with cylindrical cavities are presented. It is again shown that the introduction of air cavities in rubber (mounted on stiff material) reduces dramatically the compressional wave speed, but the novelty lies in the possibility of directly comparing experimental wave speeds with theoretical data...|$|E
40|$|The main revised {{results are}} as follows : (1) The amplitudes of the radial {{component}} of the displacement of the dilatational waves at a distant point have maximum values at certain ha's in both single and quadruple sources. (2) The amplitudes of the dilatational waves at a distant point in the two cases vanish when the wave lengths are very long compared with the dimension of the origin. (3) The amplitude of the <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> generated from the quadruple source becomes appoximately equal to that from the single source when ha> 4, {{as the result of}} the fact that the distortional waves appear less and less intensely than the dilatational waves when the wave length diminishes as compared with the size of the seismic origin. (4) In the case where the normal pressure at the origin is expressed by two zonal harmonics P 0 (cosθ) and P 2 (cosθ), so long as the wave length is greater than the radius of the seismic origin, the component due to the term P 0 (cosθ) is greater than that due to the term P 2 (cosθ). Should the wave length become comparable with the dimension of the seismic origin, we find that the azimuthal distribution of the displacement of the <b>dilatational</b> <b>wave</b> becomes quite similar to the azimuthal distribution in the pressure at the seismic origin. (5) Although we cannot, from the mere results of these calculations, say anything conclusive regarding the wave length of such waves as might be generated from a seismic origin, the writer considers it preferable to think that waves might be generated having wave lengths comparable with the size of the origin than to think that the wave lengths of the waves are very much longer than the dimension of the seismic origin, (see summary of my "Notes on the Origins of Earthquakes, second paper.

30|$|The sound {{absorption}} coefficients of porous materials, such as wood, are {{proportional to the}} porosity and roughness of the internal pore wall. Researchers developed a theory for the propagation of stress waves in a porous elastic solid [7, 8]. The waves are propagated in two <b>dilatational</b> <b>waves</b> and one rotational wave when they propagate through the pore. In particular, in the low-frequency band range, the waves in porous materials are propagated {{in the form of}} Poiseuille flow. The Poiseuille flow is a pressure-induced channel flow in a long duct. It is distinguished from drag-induced flow, such as Couette flow. Friction between propagating wave and the internal pore wall critically influence the Poiseuille flow. Thus, in the low-frequency band range, the effect of the roughness of the internal pore wall is dominant because the sound wave propagates with the form of Poiseuille flow. In comparison, in the high-frequency band range, the effect of porosity is dominant because the form of Poiseuille flow is collapsed.|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that a {{boundary}} slip velocity starts {{to play an important}} role when the length scale over which the fluid velocity changes approaches the slip length, i. e., when the fluid is highly confined, for example, fluid flow through porous rock or blood vessel capillaries. Zhu and Granick [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 096105 (2001) ] have recently experimentally established the existence of a boundary slip in a Newtonian liquid. They reported typical values of the slip length of the order of few micrometers. In this light, the effect of introduction of the boundary slip into the theory of propagation of elastic waves in a fluid-saturated porous medium formulated by Biot [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 28, 179 - 191 (1956) ] is investigated. Namely, the effect of introduction of boundary slip upon the function F(kappa) that measures the deviation from Poiseuille flow friction as a function of frequency parameter K is studied. By postulating phenomenological dependence of the slip velocity upon frequency, notable deviations in the domain of intermediate frequencies in the behavior of F(kappa) are introduced with the incorporation of the boundary slip into the model. It {{is known that}} F(kappa) crucially enters Biot's equations, which describe dynamics of fluid-saturated porous solid. Thus, consequences of the nonzero boundary slip by calculating the phase velocities and attenuation coefficients of both rotational and <b>dilatational</b> <b>waves</b> with the variation of frequency are investigated. The new model should allow one to fit the experimental seismic data in circumstances when Biot's theory fails, as the introduction of phenomenological dependence of the slip velocity upon frequency, which is based on robust physical arguments, adds an additional degree of freedom to the model. In fact, it predicts higher than the Biot's theory values of attenuation coefficients of the both rotational and <b>dilatational</b> <b>waves</b> in the intermediate frequency domain, which is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, the introduction of the boundary slip yields threefold benefits: (1) better agreement of theory with experimental data since the parametric space of the model is larger (includes effects of boundary slip); (2) the possibility to identify types of porous medium and physical situations where boundary slip is important; and (3) constrain model parameters that are related to the boundary slip.
