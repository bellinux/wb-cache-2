5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} {{are mostly}} silent but make high-pitched mewing or hissing notes at the nest and screeching noises when squabbling at a carcass. Young birds {{have been heard}} making a hissing croak in flight. They also hiss or <b>growl</b> when threatened or angry.|$|E
5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this sound {{is similar to that}} of the chirp. It may {{resemble}} a <b>growl.</b> Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling <b>growl</b> or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} <b>growls</b> of domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, exhibit predictable variations {{in a range}} of key acoustic parameters when they are given in two contrasting experimental contexts, and whether humans are sensitive to such variation. In a standardized experimental paradigm, an experimenter visited 32 domestic dogs and generated an aggression context and a play context. In these contexts, 204 isolated <b>growls</b> were recorded and subsequently acoustically analysed. Contrary to previous findings on barks, fundamental and formant frequencies of <b>growls</b> did not vary between the two contexts. However, <b>growls</b> from the aggression context were significantly longer than <b>growls</b> from the play context. Additionally, the temporal structure of the vocal sequences containing <b>growls</b> differed significantly between the contexts. In a series of psychoacoustic experiments, human listeners were not able to discriminate between <b>growls</b> recorded in the two contexts, however both aggressiveness and playfulness ratings were strongly influenced by dog weight, with larger dogs being perceived as more aggressive than smaller dogs. However, participants were able to attribute aggressiveness and playfulness to synthesized sequences in which <b>growls</b> occurred at a two rates, typical of either the aggression or the play context. We conclude that context-related variation in <b>growling</b> behaviour resides in the temporal structure, rather than in the acoustic composition of isolated <b>growls,</b> and furthermore that human listeners are able to attribute context on the basis of <b>growling</b> rate. In addition, human appear to have an intuitive acoustic bias toward perceiving larger dogs as more aggressive...|$|R
50|$|<b>Growling</b> - <b>Growling</b> is a {{technique}} that is how it sounds. You create a type of <b>growling</b> sound into the trombone while playing a pitch, creating divided sound with the pitch. Primary examples of this are found in Dixieland/New Orleans Jazz trombone parts.|$|R

5|$|Gojira play a {{technical}} and rhythmic style of heavy metal with precision drumming along with blast beats, unusual rhythm patterns, and start-and-stop riffs. Gojira {{have also been}} known to incorporate textured atmospheric elements and instrumental songs into their music. Gojira songs have progressive and uncommon song structures, rarely using the standard verse-chorus songwriting. The vocal style is varied, using the screamed style often employed in extreme metal, with the death <b>growl</b> style predominantly used in death metal, in addition to clean vocals and higher screams. At times, death metal growls and clean vocals are mixed to create an aggressive but melodic effect.|$|E
5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are usually {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a {{fundamental}} frequency between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly <b>growl</b> when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is an {{especially}} noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter {{may be the most}} vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low <b>growl</b> is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates.|$|E

50|$|<b>Growling,</b> {{making up}} {{approximately}} 65% of the vocalisations, {{is used in}} an agonistic context for dominance, and as a defensive sound. Similar to many domestic dogs, a reactive usage of defensive <b>growling</b> is only rarely observed. <b>Growling</b> very often occurs {{in combination with other}} sounds, and has been observed almost exclusively in swooshing noises (similar to barking).|$|R

25|$|Later studies support {{coevolution}} in that dogs can discriminate {{the emotional}} expressions of human faces, {{and that most}} people can tell from a bark whether a dog is alone, being approached by a stranger, playing, or being aggressive, and can tell from a <b>growl</b> how big the dog is.|$|E
25|$|The now extinct Hare Indian dog of {{northern}} Canada {{was not known}} to bark in its native homeland, though puppies born in Europe learned how to imitate the barking of other dogs. When hurt or afraid, it howled like a wolf, and when curious, it made a sound described as a <b>growl</b> building up to a howl.|$|E
25|$|Trout Mask Replica {{incorporated}} {{a wide variety}} of musical styles, including blues, avant garde/experimental, and rock. The relentless practice prior to recording blended the music into an iconoclastic whole of contrapuntal tempos, featuring slide guitar, polyrhythmic drumming (with French's drums and cymbals covered in cardboard), honking saxophone and bass clarinet. Van Vliet's vocals range from his signature Howlin' Wolf-inspired <b>growl</b> to frenzied falsetto to laconic, casual ramblings.|$|E

2500|$|Death metal vocals are {{referred}} to as death growls; hoarse roars/snarls. Death <b>growling</b> is mistakenly thought to be a form of screaming using the lowest vocal register known as vocal fry, however vocal fry is actually a form of overtone screaming, and while <b>growling</b> can be performed this way by experienced vocalists who use the fry screaming technique, [...] "true" [...] death <b>growling</b> is in fact created by an altogether different technique. The three major methods of harsh vocalization used in the genre are often mistaken for each other, encompassing vocal fry screaming, false chord screaming, and [...] "true" [...] death <b>growls.</b> <b>Growling</b> is sometimes also referred to as Cookie Monster vocals, tongue-in-cheek, due to the vocal similarity to the voice of the popular Sesame Street character of the same name. Although often criticized, death <b>growls</b> serve the aesthetic purpose of matching death metal's aggressive lyrical content. High-pitched screaming is occasionally utilized in death metal, being heard in songs by Death, Aborted, Exhumed, Dying Fetus, Cannibal Corpse, and Deicide.|$|R

25|$|When Backstabber Etiquette was {{recorded}} in 2002, vocalist Mel Mongeon had replaced Christoff, and her distinctive <b>growl</b> was markedly different than Brent's deep sound. Mel's higher pitched scream became the norm for the band. The musical style became more heavily influenced by death metal and showed more technical aspirations. This style persisted over the splits recorded between Backstabber Etiquette and Legacy of Hopelessness (these recordings are largely what make up the tracks on the Collection of Splits 2002-2004).|$|E
50|$|<b>Growling</b> Bear (Gordon Tootoosis), {{an elderly}} Lakota {{medicine}} man, has an apocalyptic vision that the buffalo his people rely upon will soon vanish from the prairie and the Lakota {{will live in}} square houses. His vision is controversial and his apprentice, Soaring Eagle (Gerald Auger), convinces {{most of the people}} to disregard <b>Growling</b> Bear's dark vision. A young boy named White Feather (Chevez Ezaneh) overhears and seeks out the now discredited <b>Growling</b> Bear to learn more about his vision. Before he dies, <b>Growling</b> Bear gives White Feather a necklace symbolizing the Lakota medicine wheel. This necklace is passed on to various characters through the miniseries.|$|R

In 1992, Living Sacrifice released their second album, Nonexistent. In this album, Living Sacrifice switched from thrash metal to down-tuned death metal, and D.J. started experimenting with a death <b>growl</b> in his vocal approach.

25|$|It is {{not unusual}} in Somers to see some (introduced) koalas and the suburb {{is well known for}} its Koala Walk. The {{distinctive}} <b>growl</b> of Koalas can often be heard in the town. Travellers are advised to take care, as koalas frequently cross local roads, and show little road sense. Occasionally echidnas have been seen in the area around The Promenade. Bushy-tail and ring- tail Possums are commonplace, and can often be seen soon after nightfall, scurrying along powerlines and thus silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E
