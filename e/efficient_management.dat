40|$|Energy {{efficient}} computing {{has recently}} become hot research area. Many works {{have been carried}} out on conserving energy, but considering energy efficiency in grid computing is few. This paper proposes energy <b>efficient</b> resource <b>management</b> in mobile grid. The objective of energy <b>efficient</b> resource <b>management</b> in mobile grid is to maximize the utility of the mobile grid which is denoted as the sum of grid application utility. The utility function models benefits of application and system. By using nonlinear optimization theory, energy <b>efficient</b> resource <b>management</b> in mobile grid can be formulated as multi objective optimization problem. In order to derive a distributed algorithm to solve global optimization problem in mobile grid, we decompose the problem into the sub problems. The proposed energy <b>efficient</b> resource <b>management</b> algorithm decomposes the optimization problem via iterative method. To test the performance of the proposed algorithm, the simulations are conducted to compare proposed energy <b>efficient</b> resource <b>management</b> algorithm with other energy aware scheduling algorithm...|$|R

25|$|As {{early as}} 1894, when his {{campaign}} reached a size {{too big to}} be directed by a few individuals, Plunkett founded the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society (IAOS), with Lord Monteagle, Thomas A.

IAOS soon became the powerhouse of co-operation, with 33 affiliated dairy cooperative societies and cooperative banks, introducing co-operation among Irish farmers by proving the benefits obtainable through more economical and <b>efficient</b> <b>management.</b> The following year he and Russell began publishing its journal The Irish Homestead to spread information on farming. Four years later there were 243 affiliated societies. Within a decade 800 societies were in existence, with a trade turnover of three million pounds sterling.|$|E
25|$|Under the City of Rahway's form of government, all {{executive}} and administrative authority is vested {{in the office}} of the mayor, who appoints the Business Administrator and department directors. The Business Administrator develops an annual budget for the city, manages the city's departments and oversees its employees. This form of government gives citizens a centralized line of authority for the <b>efficient</b> <b>management</b> of the city's business. There are nine members of the Municipal Council, all elected to four-year terms of office. Six members of the council are elected from each of six wards. The other three members are elected to represent the entire city at large, and come up for election at the same time as the mayor two years after the ward seats are up for election.|$|E
25|$|At Economy the Harmonists {{intended}} {{to become more}} involved in manufacturing and their new town on the Ohio River provided better access to eastern markets and water access {{to the south and}} west than they had in Indiana. By 1826 the Harmonists had woolen and cotton mills in operation as well as a steam-operated grain mill. The Harmonist society also ran a wine press, a hotel, post office, saw mills, stores, and a variety of farms. Here, under the business acumen and <b>efficient</b> <b>management</b> of Frederick Rapp, they enjoyed such prosperity that by 1829 they dominated trade and the markets of Pittsburgh and down the Ohio River. The Harmonists' competitors accused them of creating a monopoly and called on state government to dissolve the group. Despite the attacks, the Harmonists developed Economy into a prosperous factory town, engaged in farming on a large scale, and maintained a brewery, distillery, and wine-making operation. They also pioneered the manufacturing of silk in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The DoDSR, {{along with}} its {{precursor}} repositories, were designated as the ultimate storage facility for all serologically negative HIV specimens obtained through military HIV testing programs. Growing initially through the routine screening of all civilian applicants, and then through the continued screening of retained military personnel (at approximate two year intervals), by 1990 the DoDSR inventory had grown to contain over six million serum specimens, and by 1996 over 17 million specimens. Standardized processes {{in place at the}} contracted military HIV testing laboratories ensured <b>efficient</b> <b>management</b> of the growing inventory, permitting the DoDSR to enforce standards in specimen labelling, configuration, and shipment of specimens which facilitated their physical integration into the DoDSR inventory. Contracts for HIV testing, negotiated by the individual military services, covered all specimens shipped from Military Treatment Facilities for HIV testing within the United States; for this reason unless specifically removed, serum from military beneficiaries (i.e. spouses and children) would also find their way into the DoDSR inventory.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} of the Roman vicariate, as described above, rested largely on usage; it was not constructed as a compact whole at one single time. The most important ordinances respecting it were issued at various times {{during the course of}} the last two centuries, showing that for a long time the inadequacy of its organization, especially as regards the great length of time necessary for the settlement of matters brought before it, had been severely felt, more, however, by the subordinates of the vicariate than by its higher officials. It could not be said that its methods of business were in any way compatible with modern ideas as to <b>efficient</b> <b>management.</b> The lack of harmony was doubly evident after the entire central administration of the Church had been reformed by the Constitution Sapienti Consilio, of 29 June 1908. During the past various difficulties had stood in the way of a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate. Not the least of these was the lack of space in the former office of the vicariate. It was not until after the purchase of the Palazzo Mariscotti near San Francesco alle Stimmate, which was assigned to the cardinal vicar and his officials and arranged for their use, that Pius X was able to carry out his long cherished plan for a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate.|$|E

2500|$|Few {{opponents of}} the project argue that, during the {{construction}} process, damage to the environment could be caused by the concrete facility. However, one study states that when environmentally friendly methods of construction (like [...] "swamp-restoration") are adopted, {{there will be a}} net positive effect (such as improving the Han River). Buddhist groups have voiced fears that it would submerge nearby Buddhist relics, which would cause irreparable damage to a significant portion of Korea's cultural legacy. On the other hand, some say that once the Kyungboo Canal is developed, another 177 cultural assets could be discovered during excavations, which could be used for a tourist attraction. In particular, the development of the canal would increase the accessibility to cultural assets that are far to reach, and hence more <b>efficient</b> <b>management</b> of those assets would be possible.|$|E
2500|$|Both Wilson and Eisenhower entered office {{committed}} to reorganizing the Department of Defense. They succeeded in securing from Congress approval in June 1953 of Reorganization Plan No. 6, which made changes in OSD, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and {{the chain of}} command. Wilson welcomed the reorganization plan, which became effective on June 30, 1953, as facilitating more <b>efficient</b> <b>management</b> of the Department of Defense. He looked on the assistant secretaries as his [...] "vice presidents" [...] and tried to run the Pentagon like an industrial corporation. Wilson {{took advantage of the}} reorganization to decentralize administration, giving the service secretaries more responsibility and importance. In his first annual report, he noted that the service secretaries were his principal assistants; decentralizing operational responsibility to them would make for effective exercise of civilian authority throughout DoD. In July 1954, to complement the 1953 reorganization, Wilson issued a directive to the JCS, the most important provision of which stated that [...] "the Joint Staff work of each of the Chiefs of Staff shall take priority over all other duties", namely their tasks as chiefs of individual services. The directive also clarified the role of the JCS chairman and his authority over the Joint Staff while making clear that assignment of major tasks to the Joint Staff was the prerogative of the full JCS.|$|E
