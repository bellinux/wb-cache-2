5|$|The {{electrolysis}} {{of water}} is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another <b>inert</b> <b>metal</b> when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and {{there are very few}} rhodium-bearing minerals.

Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region.

40|$|Univocal {{conclusions}} {{around the}} wettability of graphene exposed to environmental conditions remain elusive {{despite the recent}} efforts of several research groups. The main discrepancy rests {{on the question of}} whether a graphene monolayer (GML) is transparent or not to water and more generally what the role is that the substrate plays in determining the degree of wetting of the GML. In this work, we investigate the water transparency of GML by means of a multi-length-scale approach. We complement traditional static contact angle measurements and environmental scanning electron microscopy experiments with atomic force microscopy based force spectroscopy to assess the role that intermolecular interactions play in determining the wetting of GML. To gain deeper insight into the wetting transparency issue, we perform experiments on <b>inert</b> <b>metals,</b> such as gold and platinum, covered or not covered by GML. The comparison of the results obtained for different systems (i. e. GML covered and uncovered <b>inert</b> <b>metals),</b> provides unambiguous evidence that supports the non-wetting transparency theory of GML.

30|$|However, {{apart from}} their {{magnetic}} properties, these nanocores are unstable both in air and in solution. Iron oxide typically forms aggregates in solution and undergoes oxidation in air [11, 12]. In addition, even though iron oxide nanoparticles are good magnetic materials, the cores are susceptible to corrosion {{in the presence of}} water [13, 14] and are more reactive in bulk materials because of their high surface-to-volume ratio [15]. Also, aside from their physical instability and relative biocompatibility [16, 17], iron oxide nanocores {{have been shown to be}} toxic [18]. However, these hurdles can be overcome by coating the cores with outer shells, such as inorganic oxides (silica) [19, 20], <b>inert</b> <b>metals</b> (silver, gold, or gold alloys) [11, 21 – 23], or bioactive macromolecules such as liposomes and micelles, which can encapsulate a numerous amount of nanoparticles within the structures that then impart an inert physical property to the cores in biological media [2, 24 – 26]. Subsequent surface functionalization of the nanocomposite materials with hydrophilic polymers such as poly(ethylene glycols) (PEGs) [27 – 30] and dextrans [31, 32] can further increase the physical stability of the nanoparticles particularly in solution. In addition, the coating of the magnetic nanoparticles with <b>inert</b> <b>metals,</b> such as gold, is extremely attractive because the nanocomposite system is resistant to corrosion in biological conditions and can decrease the toxicity of the cores [33 – 35].|$|R
