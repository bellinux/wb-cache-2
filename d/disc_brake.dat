5|$|The {{vehicles}} {{have three}} braking systems: a primary regenerative dynamic brake, a secondary <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> and an emergency rail brake. When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one bogie, and for one hour if disconnected from two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Honda {{introduced}} their newer NF series motorcycles, known as Honda Wave series, called the Honda Innova in some markets, which use steel tube frames, front <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> and plastic cover sets in various displacement options: 100cc, 110cc and 125cc. Though not Cubs, these bikes sold consistently well particularly in European countries, where {{the production of}} Honda Cub models had been previously discontinued. However, the production of Honda Cubs in Asia, Africa and South America still continues today, even though the newer Honda Wave Series and other designs have been introduced alongside the Cub.|$|E
25|$|The 2CV design predates the {{invention}} of <b>disc</b> <b>brake,</b> so 1948–1981 cars have drum brakes on all four wheels. In October 1981, front disc brakes were fitted. <b>Disc</b> <b>brake</b> cars use green LHM fluid – a mineral oil – which is not compatible with standard glycol brake fluid.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, Jaguar fielded {{three cars}} {{equipped}} with <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> at Le Mans, where they won, {{in large part}} due to their superior braking over drum-equipped rivals. This spelled {{the beginning of the}} crossover of drum <b>brakes</b> to <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> in passenger cars. From the 1960s to the 1980s, <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> gradually replaced drum brakes on the front wheels of cars. Now practically all cars use <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> on the front wheels, and many use <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> on all four wheels.|$|R

50|$|Enclosed {{drum brakes}} require {{infrequent}} maintenance, compared to rim <b>brakes</b> or <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{and are more}} durable than <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> which are exposed.|$|R
25|$|Under {{development}} for a year, the CB750 had a transverse, straight-four engine {{with a single}} overhead camshaft (SOHC) and a front <b>disc</b> <b>brake,</b> neither of which was previously available on a mainstream, affordable, production motorcycle. Having a four-cylinder engine and <b>disc</b> <b>brake,</b> along with the introductory price of US$ (US$ in current money), gave the CB750 a considerable sporting performance advantage over its competition, particularly its British rivals.|$|E
25|$|The first {{motorcycles}} to use {{disc brakes}} were racing vehicles. MV Agusta {{was the first}} to offer a front <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> motorcycle to the public on a small scale in 1965, on their relatively expensive 600 touring motorcycle, using a mechanical brake linkage. In 1969 Honda introduced the more affordable CB750, which had a single hydraulically-actuated front <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> (and a rear drum brake), and which sold in huge numbers. Disc brakes are now common on motorcycles, mopeds and even mountain bikes.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Budd {{designed}} and manufactured a front <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> system for Chrysler, Imperial and full-size Plymouth and Dodge automobiles, used (optionally) for the 1966–68 model years.|$|E
5000|$|All wheel <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> - earlier TGVs (including Eurostar) used <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> only on {{unpowered}} axles. Weight {{gains on}} the Duplex power units allowed {{the installation of}} <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> directly on the wheels of powered axles (so-called [...] "cheek discs"), instead of using the traditional tread brakes. This does not greatly improve braking performance, but it leaves the wheel tread smooth and considerably reduces rolling noise.|$|R
50|$|All European {{models have}} Anti-lock braking system (ABS) with <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> {{on the front}} wheels and drum <b>brakes</b> or <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> on the rear ones. Side airbags are {{standard}} on some high end models.|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{very wide}} tyres favors <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> as rim brakes require ever-longer arms {{to clear the}} wider tyre. Longer arms tend to flex more, {{degrading}} <b>braking.</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>brakes</b> are unaffected by tyre width.|$|R
25|$|Disc brakes {{are most}} common for {{mountain}} bikes (including nearly all downhill bikes), {{and are also}} seen on some hybrid bicycles and touring bicycles. A <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> is sometimes employed as a drag brake.|$|E
25|$|This {{procedure}} {{can be done}} at {{any time}} during the pad's or disc's life to attempt to alleviate some of the common issues associated with <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> systems. Ensure the discs and pads are in adequate shape before attempting a bedding procedure.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} four-wheeled petrol-driven {{automobiles}} in Britain was built in Birmingham in 1895 by Frederick William Lanchester, who also patented the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> and the first electric starter was installed on an Arnold, an adaptation of the Benz Velo, built in Kent between 1895 and 1898.|$|E
50|$|The front <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> were 260 mm {{diameter}} and ventilated. The rear <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> were 273 mm mm in diameter. Both sets were servo assisted with front/rear split dual circuits. There was a cable-operated hand brake for the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|At one time, {{passenger}} vehicles commonly employed drum brakes {{on all four}} wheels. Later, <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> {{were used for the}} front and drum brakes for the rear. However <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> have shown better heat dissipation and greater resistance to 'fading' and are therefore generally safer than drum <b>brakes.</b> So four-wheel <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> have become increasingly popular, replacing drums on all but the most basic vehicles. Many two-wheel vehicle designs, however, continue to employ a drum brake for the rear wheel.|$|R
25|$|The Majestic's four-wheel Lockheed-servo-assisted Dunlop <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> were {{regarded}} as a first for a British production car. It was the first saloon car without any claim to a sportscar nature to be equipped with <b>disc</b> <b>brakes.</b> An emergency or handbrake was provided by fitting special pads to the rear <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> which were operated by cables and rods.|$|R
25|$|Lambretta {{introduced}} the first high-volume production {{use of a}} single, floating, front <b>disc</b> <b>brake,</b> enclosed in a ventilated cast alloy hub and actuated by cable, on the 1962 TV175, followed by the range-topping GT200 in 1964. The 1969 Honda CB750 introduced hydraulic disc brakes {{on a large scale}} to the wide motorcycle public, following the lesser known 1965 MV Agusta 600, which had cable-operated mechanical actuation.|$|E
25|$|The Nimbus engines were {{produced}} in two main variants, the Mark 103/503 and the Mark 105/502. The Mark 103/503 is generally {{similar to the}} Mark 105/502 except that the former has a double-caliper <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> incorporated in the output drive shaft to provide adequate braking of the helicopter's rotor in the high winds encountered over {{the deck of a}} fast moving ship, whereas the 105/502 has a single caliper unit.|$|E
25|$|The first caliper-type {{automobile}} <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> was {{patented by}} Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902 and used successfully on Lanchester cars. However, the limited choice of metals {{in this period}} meant {{that he had to}} use copper as the braking medium acting on the disc. The poor state of the roads at this time, no more than dusty, rough tracks, meant that the copper wore quickly making the system impractical.|$|E
25|$|At Germany's Argus Motoren, Hermann Klaue (1912-2001) had {{patented}} <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> in 1940. Argus supplied wheels {{fitted with}} <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> e.g. for the Arado Ar 96. The German Tiger I heavy tank, {{was introduced in}} 1942 with a 55cm Argus-Werke disc on each drive shaft.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Haldex {{started an}} {{extensive}} project to produce <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> for heavy vehicles. During 1999 Haldex delivered their {{first generation of}} <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> called ModulX. A second generation, called ModulT, was launched in 2011 and ModulT is today the fastest growing product for Haldex.|$|R
50|$|Drum brakes {{are also}} {{occasionally}} fitted as the parking (and emergency) brake {{even when the}} rear wheels use <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> as the main <b>brakes.</b> Many rear <b>disc</b> <b>braking</b> systems use a parking brake in which the piston in the caliper is actuated by a cam or screw. This compresses the pads against the rotor. However, this type of system becomes much more complicated when the rear <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> use fixed, multi-piston calipers. In this situation, a small drum is usually fitted within {{or as part of}} the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> This type of brake is also known as a banksia brake.|$|R
25|$|Each train {{consists}} of a locomotive pushing a single passenger car up the mountain, descending the mountain by going backwards. Both locomotive and car were originally equipped with a ratchet and pawl mechanism engaged during the climb that prevents any roll-back; during descent, both locomotive and car are braked. Recent improvements in design have replaced the ratchet (gear and pawl mechanism) with sprag clutches and <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> assemblies. Most of the locomotives {{were made by the}} Manchester Locomotive Works.|$|E
25|$|After a 10-year hiatus, America built another {{production}} automobile {{equipped with}} disc brakes - the 1963 Studebaker Avanti (the Bendix system was optional {{on some of}} the other Studebaker models). Front disc brakes became standard equipment in 1965 on the Rambler Marlin (the Bendix units were optional on all American Motors' Rambler Classic and Ambassador models), {{as well as on the}} Ford Thunderbird, and the Lincoln Continental. A four-wheel <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> system was also introduced in 1965 on the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.|$|E
25|$|The Chrysler 4-wheel <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> {{system was}} {{more complex and}} {{expensive}} than Crosley's, but far more efficient and reliable. It was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Unlike the caliper disc, the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders.|$|E

25|$|A {{small number}} of PA-22s have been {{converted}} to taildragger configuration, resulting in an aircraft that {{is very similar to}} a PA-20 Pacer, but which retains the model refinements and features of the PA-22. These conversions are often referred to by owners as PA-22/20s and are often listed in classified aircraft ads as such, although officially such converted aircraft continue to be designated by the FAA as PA-22 Tri-Pacers. When this conversion is accomplished, a 2 puck <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> conversion is usually installed in place of the original drum brakes, and the Lycoming O-360 180 HP engine is the preferred upgrade.|$|E
25|$|For {{automotive}} use, <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> discs {{are commonly}} manufactured {{out of a}} material called grey iron. The SAE maintains a specification for the manufacture of grey iron for various applications. For normal car and light-truck applications, SAE specification J431 G3000 (superseded to G10) dictates the correct range of hardness, chemical composition, tensile strength, and other properties necessary for the intended use. Some racing cars and airplanes use brakes with carbon fiber discs and carbon fiber pads to reduce weight. Wear rates tend to be high, and braking may be poor or grabby until the brake is hot.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{standards}} for mounting <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> calipers. I.S. (International Standard) is different for 160mm and 203mm rotor and differs between forks with a QR and 20mm through axle. The post-mount standard also differs by disc size and axle type. Many incompatible variants were produced over the years, mostly by fork manufacturers. The mount {{used on the}} Rockshox Boxxer is the most typical of these specialty mounts, but most fork manufactures now use either the IS or post-mount standard for their current forks. As a point of reference, Hayes currently sells no fewer than 13 different adapters to fit their brakes to various mounting patterns.|$|E
