5|$|From the 1980s Scottish {{literature}} enjoyed {{another major}} revival, particularly {{associated with a}} group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize-winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late <b>It</b> <b>Was,</b> <b>How</b> Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots dialect). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw {{the emergence of a new}} generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Robert Crawford, Kathleen Jamie and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Carol Ann Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.|$|E

As churches grew rapidly with more new believers everywhere in the state, the Annual Assembly Session of Tripura Baptist Christian Union which was held in Subhash Nagar (North Tripura) on 23–26 February 1989 passed resolution that the Circles (e.g., South, Udaipur, Saisawm Sazai, and Sadar North) be given the full status of Associations. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the Sadar North Baptist Association was established as an Association in the month of February 1989.|$|E

25|$|Some writers {{that emerged}} after the Second World War {{followed}} Hugh MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch and Sydney Goodsir Smith. Others demonstrated a {{greater interest in}} English language poetry, among them Norman MacCaig, George Bruce and Maurice Lindsay. George Mackay Brown from Orkney, and Iain Crichton Smith from Lewis, wrote both poetry and prose fiction shaped by their distinctive island backgrounds. The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan became known for translations of works {{from a wide range}} of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Muriel Spark, with The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961) spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes. Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean, and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett. A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Shena Mackay, Alan Spence, Allan Massie and the work of William McIlvanney. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of Glasgow writers focused around critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum and editor Peter Kravitz. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels, often overtly political, that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray’s Poor Things (1992) and Kelman’s How Late <b>It</b> <b>Was,</b> <b>How</b> Late (1994).

500|$|What endeared the Little Russian to the kuchka was {{not simply}} that Tchaikovsky had used Ukrainian folk songs as melodic material. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>how,</b> {{especially}} in the outer movements, he allowed the unique characteristics of Russian folk song to dictate symphonic form. This was a goal toward which the kuchka strived, both collectively and individually. Tchaikovsky, with his Conservatory grounding, could sustain such development longer and more cohesively than {{his colleagues in the}} kuchka. (Though the comparison may seem unfair, Tchaikovsky authority David Brown has pointed out that, because of their similar time-frames, the finale of the Little Russian shows what Mussorgsky could have done with [...] "The Great Gate of Kiev" [...] from Pictures at an Exhibition had he possessed academic training comparable to that of Tchaikovsky.) ...|$|E

500|$|The {{winter of}} 1779–80 {{was one of}} the coldest in {{recorded}} colonial history. [...] New York Harbor froze over, and the winter camps of the Continental Army were deluged with snow, resulting in hardships exceeding those experienced at Valley Forge. [...] The war was declining in popularity, and the inflationary issuance of paper currency by Congress and the states alike harmed the economy, and the ability to provision the army. [...] The paper currency also hit the army's morale, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the troops were paid. [...] Congress fixed the rate between paper and gold dollars at 40-to-1 in March 1780, but many merchants refused to accept the Continental currency at the official exchange rate.

500|$|A {{review of}} a more {{critical}} nature came from Catherine Bennett, also writing for The Guardian, who questioned the facial reconstruction from the third episode and suggested that it was dismissive to imply that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> Jesus truly appeared. Speaking about the study, Bennett remarked: [...] "We must hope that... future BBC controllers do not dig up, say, Robin Cook's skull, drape it in Plasticine, and ask: 'Is this the real face of Tony Blair?. John Preston, writing for The Sunday Telegraph, also questioned {{the reliability of the}} reconstruction, and branded the series as dumbed down. The programme received criticism from theological scholars: following the broadcast of the first episode, Tom Wright, one of two consultants used during production of the series, felt that Jesus's mission had been misrepresented by the show. Wright claimed that the BBC had elected to portray Jesus simply as [...] "a politically correct social worker".|$|E

500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible {{that this is the way}} he remembered the occasion, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> he would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But the fact is that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E

Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books.

James Kelman’s (b. 1946) The Busconductor Hines (1984) and A Disaffection (1989) were among the first novels to fully utilise a working class Scots voice as the main narrator. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Gray's Poor Things (1992), which investigated the capitalist and imperial origins of Scotland in an inverted version of the Frankenstein myth, Irvine Welsh's (b. 1958), Trainspotting (1993), which dealt with the drug addiction in contemporary Edinburgh, Alan Warner’s (b. 1964) Morvern Callar (1995), dealing with death and authorship and Kelman’s How Late <b>It</b> <b>Was,</b> <b>How</b> Late (1994), a stream of consciousness novel dealing with a life of petty crime.

2500|$|... "Miss Clare Remembers" [...] is a {{reworked}} {{version of}} a same-titled piano instrumental that Enya originally recorded in 1983, her first project as a solo artist. It was released on Touch Travel (1984), an audio cassette of music from various artists. When the track was re-recordeded for Watermark, Enya and Nicky and toyed with adding vocals and other instruments into the arrangement, but agreed to keep it solely as a piano piece, thinking <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the track sounded best. Its title refers to the same-titled book by English novelist Miss Read, whose depictions of country and village life, {{and the people who}} lived there, appealed to Enya. Roma thought the piece [...] "recaptures the naivety and innocence of an age and a place far removed from the whirl and pressure of a sophisticated society". [...] "Evening Falls..." [...] is a track that Roma described as [...] "a song of a spirit travelling". It is based on a ghost story that Roma had heard, about a woman who had recurring dreams of a house in America, only to accidentally come across it years later in England. Upon entering the house, its inhabitants become frightened of the woman as they explain she had haunted the house each time she dreamed about it. Nicky thought a melody Enya had written suited the story, which led to Roma writing a lyric inspired by it.|$|E
