5|$|Jeremy Waldron {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The New York Review of Books, and was critical of Lewis' broad stance towards freedom of speech with respect to <b>hate</b> <b>speech.</b> Waldron later elaborated this position in his 2012 book The Harm in <b>Hate</b> <b>Speech,</b> in which he devoted an entire chapter to Lewis' book. Waldron emphasized that the problem with an expansive view of free speech is not the harm of hateful thoughts, but rather the negative impact resulting from widespread publication of the thoughts. He questioned whether children of racial groups criticized by widely published <b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> {{would be able to}} succeed in such an environment. Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens analyzed The Harm in <b>Hate</b> <b>Speech</b> and discussed Freedom for the Thought That We Hate, in a review for The New York Review of Books. Justice Stevens recounted Lewis' argument that an acceptance of <b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> is necessary, because attempts to regulate it would cause encroachment upon expression of controversial viewpoints. He pointed out that Lewis and Waldron agreed that Americans have more freedom of speech than citizens of any other country. In his review, Stevens cited the 2011 decision in Snyder v. Phelps as evidence {{that the majority of the}} U.S. Supreme Court supported the right of the people to express hateful views on matters of public importance. Stevens concluded that, although Waldron was unsuccessful in convincing him that legislators should ban all <b>hate</b> <b>speech,</b> The Harm in <b>Hate</b> <b>Speech</b> persuaded him that government leaders should refrain from using such language themselves.|$|E

Several states passed laws outlawing the <b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> directed at ethnic groups. The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 <b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped. The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.|$|E

Fallon in Harvard Magazine, Nat Hentoff, two National Book Critics Circle members, and Kirkus Reviews. Jeremy Waldron {{commented on the}} work for The New York Review of Books and criticized Lewis' stance towards freedom of speech with respect to <b>hate</b> <b>speech.</b> Waldron elaborated on this criticism in his book The Harm in <b>Hate</b> <b>Speech</b> (2012), in which he devoted a chapter to Lewis' book. This prompted a critical analysis of both works in The New York Review of Books in June 2012 by former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.|$|E

5|$|Polling {{conducted}} throughout March 2009 by Maurice de Hond {{indicated the}} Party for Freedom {{was the most}} popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted that the party would take 21% of the national vote, winning 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If the polling results were replicated in an election, Wilders would be a major power broker. Under such circumstances, there would also be some likelihood of him becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This has been partially attributed to timely prosecution attempts against him for <b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> and the travel ban imposed on him by the United Kingdom, as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch government's response to the global financial crisis of 2008–2009.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{argues that}} <b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> exists retrospectively, only after being {{declared}} such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself {{the power to}} define <b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon's argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor.|$|E
25|$|CIJA {{has been}} {{actively}} involved in the public debate surrounding the balance between protecting free speech and preventing the spread of <b>hate</b> <b>speech.</b> In 2012, in response to concerns toward Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (<b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> on the internet), CIJA proposed two options to achieve a reasonable balance. The first entailed reforming the existing act, including through measures to increase evidentiary standards, allow for early rejection of inadmissible Section 13 complaints, and discourage frivolous claims (including the assigning of costs to those who launch vexatious complaints). The second option would repeal Section 13 altogether, and assign responsibility for online <b>hate</b> <b>speech</b> exclusively to a more responsive criminal justice system.|$|E
