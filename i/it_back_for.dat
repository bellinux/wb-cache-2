5|$|The McKeesport Olympics, a {{team from}} McKeesport, Pennsylvania, was the All-Americans next opponent. This game had to be played outside of Pennsylvania because of that state's blue laws which {{disallowed}} football on Sundays. In fact, {{this was one of}} only two away games for the Olympics. Hughitt scored a rushing touchdown in the first quarter to start the game. In the second quarter, Hughitt threw a touchdown pass to offensive lineman Heinie Miller to bring the All-Americans' lead to 14–0 going into halftime. The Olympics scored their only points of the game in the third quarter. A player with the last name of Schreiner caught a receiving touchdown. The All-Americans answered when offensive lineman Lou Little blocked a field goal and ran <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown. The final score of the game came when Shelton caught a receiving touchdown in the fourth quarter from Hughitt.|$|E
5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter {{made up for}} his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for the}} opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and pull it out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{decision}} for war had been taken, Wilson promised de la Panouse that Britain would honour Asquith’s decision to send five divisions to France. Wilson {{was present at the}} War Council (a meeting of politicians and military men on 5 August) at which Sir John French proposed deploying the BEF to Antwerp (Wilson had already argued against this as impractical), and Haig proposed holding <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> two or three months until more troops could be sent. After debate about whether to deploy the BEF to Maubeuge, Amiens or Antwerp, which Wilson likened to “our discussing strategy like idiots”, it was decided to deploy five divisions to Maubeuge. The following day Kitchener scaled back this commitment to four divisions and lobbied to deploy them to Amiens.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{returned}} home to play a Sunday night match with the Dallas Cowboys. The game was close early as the Bears' Robbie Gould and the Cowboys' Nick Folk each hit field goals {{to make it a}} 3–3 tie at halftime. The Cowboys took the opening drive of the third quarter and ended it with a Tony Romo to Jason Witten touchdown pass. The Bears responded on the ensuing drive with a Cedric Benson goal line plunge. The Cowboys struck again {{before the end of the}} third quarter, Romo connecting on his second touchdown pass, this time to running back Marion Barber. Folk converted a 44-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter, and on the next play from scrimmage, Bears quarterback Rex Grossman threw an interception to Cowboys cornerback Anthony Henry, who ran <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> the score. With the lead in hand, the Cowboys proceeded to kill the clock, which they did effectively with Barber, who capped the scoring with a one-yard touchdown run. Barber ended the night with over 100 yards rushing, and Cowboys wide receiver Terrell Owens caught eight passes for 145 yards. The Cowboys improved to 3–0, while the Bears dropped to 1–2.|$|E

25|$|Rise Up (Colors of Peace) was {{a musical}} project to turn Gülen's poems and {{writings}} in Turkish language into songs. A selection {{had already been}} published as English language translations under the title Broken Plectrum. A total of 50 poems were sent to various Muslim and non-Muslim artists from various countries, who were free to pick, and then compose and vocalize the poem chosen, record it {{in their own country}} and send <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> inclusion in the planned album. Reportedly, no restrictions were put on the artists in using instrumentation, despite reservations by stricter Muslim interpretations about music and use of musical instruments. The album Rise Up (Colors of Peace) turned into an album of world music encompassing various genres like jazz, pop, flamenco, rai, Indian music among others. The artists appearing (in order of appearance on the track list) were: The Good Morning Diary, Maher Zain, Faudel, Cristelo Duo featuring Bruno Gouveia, Ryan Shaw, Natacha Atlas, Bon Bon, KK & Reet, Mazachigno featuring Ely Bruna, Bahroma, Carmen Paris, Kobi Farhi & Ruba Shamshoum.

500|$|Composer Mark Snow {{worked with}} {{producer}} Ken Horton to create Smallvilles score. Snow composed music {{as he watched}} the picture, and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings. He then sent the music to the producers, who sent <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>for</b> recomposition if needed. Individual episodes have their own soundtrack, comprising one (or more) songs. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack. Their choices were discussed by the producers, who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights. Although Snow said it initially seemed odd to combine two types of music on a [...] "typical action-adventure" [...] television show, [...] "the producers seem to like the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score".|$|E
