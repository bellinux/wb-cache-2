Consumer usage increased {{in response to}} the television campaign that was developed in conjunction with TrueCar investor Guthy-Renker, but dealer and industry criticism was significant and well documented in a series of Automotive News articles. Painter, who is commonly associated with vehicle pricing transparency, up-front pricing and the value of big data in auto retail, received pushback from auto dealers and manufacturers over the fear that TrueCar was responsible for significant retail price discounting. The industry resistance led to nearly a dozen states launching investigations into the company's practices and policies. As a result, Painter and TrueCar underwent a nine-month regulatory compliance overhaul and initiated <b>industry</b> <b>outreach</b> programs. TrueCar went through a business turnaround in 2012 that resulted in the company reporting in its S-1 filing that it had generated positive adjusted EBITDA in 2013 after having lost over $40 million in 2012.

The strength of the OSGC network of universities, community colleges, government agencies, <b>industry,</b> and <b>outreach</b> affiliates is well-established and is growing. The OSGC Consortium Management Structure was designed and remains committed to using the talents and diversity of everyone within this collaborative network, and operational policies and procedures are such that all consortium members are active contributors resulting in quality OSGC programs in research, education and service, while receiving a relatively small amount of NASA funds. The number of quality activities, both on- and off-campus, and collaborations/partnerships that OSGC has established with NASA and government agencies, state and local government, educational institutions, and private industry, has been impressive. Further desired university affiliate expansion requires additional funds. Diversity is shown in the OSGC 12 -member Executive Committee by the presence of three campus representatives from Central State University, Wilberforce University, and The Ohio State University (two underrepresented minority, one female). One additional female campus representative (Cleveland State University) is currently on sabbatical leave and a valuable alternate member attends. Other additional female and underrepresented minority members are on the larger OSGC Advisory committee. All committee members participate fully in all consortium management and policy decisions. The OSGC Executive Committee strives to achieve and communicate a culture of trust, respect, teamwork, open communication, creativity, and empowerment.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) {{has become}} a center of {{excellence}} for critical infrastructure protection, particularly {{in the field of}} cyber security. It is one of only a few national laboratories that have enhanced the nation’s cyber security posture by performing industrial control system (ICS) vendor assessments as well as user on-site assessments. Not only are vulnerabilities discovered, but described actions for enhancing security are suggested – both on a system-specific basis and from a general perspective of identifying common weaknesses and their corresponding corrective actions. These cyber security programs have performed over 40 assessments to date which have led to more robust, secure, and resilient monitoring and control systems for the US electrical grid, oil and gas, chemical, transportation, and many other sectors. In addition to cyber assessments themselves, the INL has been engaged in outreach to the ICS community through vendor forums, technical conferences, vendor user groups, and other special engagements as requested. Training programs have been created to help educate all levels of management and worker alike with an emphasis towards real everyday cyber hacking methods and techniques including typical exploits that are used. The asset owner or end user has many products available for its use created from these programs. One outstanding product is the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cyber Security Procurement Language for Control Systems document that provides insight to the user when specifying a new monitoring and control system, particularly concerning security requirements. Employing some of the top cyber researchers in the nation, the INL can leverage this talent towards many applications other than critical infrastructure. Monitoring and control systems are used throughout the world to perform simple tasks such as cooking in a microwave to complex ones such as the monitoring and control of the next generation fighter jets or nuclear material safeguards systems in complex nuclear fuel cycle facilities. It is the intent of this paper to describe the cyber security programs that are currently in place, the experiences and successes achieved in <b>industry</b> including <b>outreach</b> and training, and suggestions about how other sectors and organizations can leverage this national expertise to help their monitoring and control systems become more secure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Integrated Media Systems Center (IMSC) is the National Science Foundation's {{exclusive}} Engineering Research Center for multimed ia and Internet research. IMSC {{carries out}} a successful cross-disciplinary program of research, education, <b>outreach,</b> <b>industry</b> and international collaboration and technology transfer. IMSC's industry and international collaboration program has ranged from 20 - 30 members per year, {{who are interested}} in the multidisciplinary research results and technology integration projects. A key lesson learned for success in these collaborations has been the use of industry-like project organizations to integrate researc h results into cohesive projects. We have adapted traditional industry project management techniques for success in the university environment. Our model for group interaction emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and interaction. Each faculty parti cipant must agree that there are useful benefits and new research goals to be achieved by cooperation on projects with broader, interdisciplinary goals. They must accept and share a common vision of the goals (developed in group meetings by consensus) and long-term benefit of group involvement. One of the main challenges to the project manager in academia (APM) in achieving project goals is their limited direct influence on the project team. The APM’s main motivational influences are the challenge of the research, the expertise of those involved, the friendship associated with academic environment, and to a lesser extent, influence on budgets. The APM need not be one of the technical leads, and it is best {{if he or she is}} a credible (technically informed) and impartial (to depersonalize issues in the presence of conflicts) team member.
