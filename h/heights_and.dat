5|$|Within {{a week of}} the {{beginning}} of construction, however, severe deficiencies were beginning to be revealed in the fort's location. Due to its site close to the Long Bridge, Runyon was overlooked by the ridge of the Arlington <b>Heights,</b> <b>and</b> an enemy force could shield itself with the <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> sneak up on the fort unopposed. To prevent this from happening, Barnard was forced to issue orders calling {{for the construction of a}} fort called Fort Albany atop the ridge. Nevertheless, work on Fort Runyon continued despite its less-than-optimal location.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the ability of first-, third-, and fifth-graders to accurately self-report <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight. Self-reported and measured values for <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight were recorded for 487 students. The ability to self-report a reasonable value for <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight improved with grade level, but children in all 3 grade levels significantly underreported their <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight. Only fifth-graders accurately self-reported their weight; therefore, using self-reported <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity for elementary school-aged children is not recommended...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between <b>height</b> <b>and</b> some measures of human welfare in Spain for the period 1850 - 1978. For that purpose, we employ several filtering methods to measure the correlation between variables such as first order differences, deterministic trends, the Hodrick and Prescott filter, the band-pass filter or den Haan (2000) ’s methodology which uses {{a new set of}} statistics to characterize the co-movement between variables to capture the dynamic between variables. We always find a strong and positive correlation between <b>height</b> <b>and</b> GDP per cápita, <b>height</b> <b>and</b> the weight of health services in total consumption, <b>and</b> <b>height</b> <b>and</b> openness. By contrast, we have a negative correlation between <b>height</b> <b>and</b> the mortality rate <b>and</b> <b>height</b> <b>and</b> the ratio between the deflator of private consumption and the GDP deflator. By applying den Haan (2000) ’s method, we find that the comovement between <b>height</b> <b>and</b> GDP per cápita is always positive, increasing in the medium and long-run. This correlation is higher after the Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939). We also observe that <b>height</b> <b>and</b> mortality rate have a negative correlation in the medium-run. Other health indicators such as the weight of health services in total consumption and the ratio between the deflator of private consumption and the GDP deflator show a positive and negative co-movement in the short-run, respectively. Nevertheless, they change their sign of correlation in the long-run. Finally, we observe a positive co-movement between <b>height</b> <b>and</b> illiteracy rate in the short-run, a negative one in the long-run, and a strong and positive comovement between <b>height</b> <b>and</b> the grade of openness.

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, US9W was truncated to Albany while US9 was rerouted {{to follow a}} new stretch between Albany and Round Lake. The former routing of both routes along the Hudson River between Albany and Mechanicville, {{as well as the}} entirety of NY58 and the portion of NY30 from Schuylerville to Glens Falls was integrated into the new NY32, which followed its current routing between Harriman and the Stillwater community of Bemis <b>Heights</b> <b>and</b> from Schuylerville to Glens Falls. Between Bemis <b>Heights</b> <b>and</b> Schuylerville, NY32 followed what is now US4 along the Hudson River while the former routing of NY30 between the two locations became NY32A. At the same time, US4, which previously ended in Glens Falls, was rerouted south of Hudson Falls to end in East Greenbush. From Northumberland to Waterford, the route used what is now NY32.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTTo {{evaluate}} whether, after total knee arthroplasty, {{there is}} any correlation between patellar <b>height</b> <b>and</b> range of motion (ROM) achieved by patients {{six months after the}} operation. Methods: Forty-five patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty were assessed at least 12 months after the operation (total of 54 knees). The maximum and minimum ROM of all the knees was recorded under fluoroscopy, along with patellar height according to the Blackburne and Peel ratio. Two possible correlations were evaluated: patellar <b>height</b> <b>and</b> ROM; <b>and</b> patellar <b>height</b> <b>and</b> ROM variation from before to after the operation. Results: A correlation was found between patellar <b>height</b> <b>and</b> postoperative ROM (p = 0. 04). There was no correlation between patellar <b>height</b> <b>and</b> ROM variation (p = 0. 182). Conclusion: After total knee arthroplasty, the lower the patella is, the worse the ROM is...|$|R
5|$|The {{debate over}} the route for the {{remainder}} of the Green Line was finally resolved in December 1984. Residents and D.C. government officials asked WMATA to build stations at Congress <b>Heights</b> <b>and</b> Southern Avenue in order to promote economic development and provide service to St. Elizabeths Hospital and Greater Southeast Community Hospital. In December 1984, WMATA's Board of Directors agreed to return the Green Line to its original route, and build the Congress <b>Heights</b> <b>and</b> Southern Avenue stations. The U.S. district court approved WMATA's decision and dissolved its March 1982 injunction, which had barred construction of the $483 million southern Green Line (now estimated to cost $132 million more than the Rosecroft route).|$|E

40|$|These {{questions}} measure self-reported <b>height</b> <b>and</b> {{weight and}} perceived body weight. Data on self-reported <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight {{are used to}} calculate body mass index (BMI) and determine the corresponding BMI-for-age percentile for adolescents. BMI-for-age percentile is a proxy (1) measure of weight status, correlates with body fat, and is recommended for assessing weight (2) status in youth ages 2 – 20. Although BMI calculated from self-reported <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight underestimates the prevalence of obesity compared to BMI calculated from measured <b>height</b> <b>and</b> (3) weight, self-reported <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight are useful for tracking BMI trends over time. In addition, obesity prevalence trends from national surveys of adults using self-reported <b>height</b> <b>and</b> (4) weight have been consistent with trend data from national surveys using measured <b>height</b> <b>and</b> (5) weight. It is critical to continue monitoring <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight because the prevalence of (6) obesity among adolescents has tripled since 1980. Obesity during adolescence is associated with negative psychological and social consequences and health problems such as type 2 (7) diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. (8, 9) Further, obese adolescents {{are more likely to}} become obese adults. Nationwide in 2013, 14 % (10) of high school students were obese and 17 % were overweight.

Because of these errors in SR <b>height</b> <b>and</b> weight, accuracy of classification into the FITNESSGRAM® HFZ was compromised.
