50|$|A special mold of {{decorative}} shape {{such as a}} flower is used to make kokis. This is called a kokis achchuwa (කොකිස් අච්චුව). It is also called Rosette cookies in English. This mold is coated in a thick batter made from rice flour, coconut milk and beaten eggs. Sugar and salt may {{be added to the}} mixture as well. The batter-covered mold is dipped in boiling coconut oil, and the kokis is shaken off the mold and into the oil when it is half cooked and allowed to deep fry until ready. The cooked dish is crispy, and may be served hot or after cooling down. The oil is usually <b>drained</b> <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> before serving. It may also be prepared using wheat flour, {{as an alternative to the}} traditional rice flour.|$|R
50|$|Made with flour, {{vegetable}} oil, yeast, sugar, salt, {{and water}} (street vendors use Alum {{to make it}} crisper : baking soda, ammonium bicarbonate, alum). Sift dry ingredients together, mix in oil and water. Knead the dough, let it rest in a warm area (in a covered bowl) for 1 hour. Punch down, knead dough. Place in a dusted bowl, covered tightly with cling wrap overnight in refrigerator. The next day, take out the dough and let it rest on your countertop (or warm area) for 2 hours to come to room temperature. On floured board, roll dough to (4 inch x 1/2 inch x 24 inch). Cut the dough into 48 strips, (4 inch x 1/2 inch). Place 48 strips in 24 pairs, {{one on top of}} each other. Heat a wok with about 2 cups oil hot enough for deep frying. Lightly press a joined strip in the lengthwise center with a chopstick, making the impression only immediately before frying, then stretch to 8 inch. Gently lower into hot oil. Turn the strips and push them into the oil so they cook right through and brown evenly. Don’t fry too many at once as the temperature of the oil will drop, the dough will absorb more oil and become greasy. Fry until golden brown and puffy.

40|$|The objectIves of the {{research}} were to study the effect of flooding and <b>draining</b> <b>on</b> the population and life cycle of root-knot nematode of rice (Meloidogyne graminicola).  To study the effect of flooding and <b>draining</b> <b>on</b> the population of M. graminicola two experiments were done within two period of planting of rice IR 64. These experiments were arranged in completely randomize design with four replications. For studying the effect of flooding and <b>draining</b> <b>on</b> {{the life cycle of}} M. graminicola, the experiment was done within 30 days. The research results showed: 1) continuously flooding inhibit the penetration and population development of M. graminicola on rice IR 64, but the life cycle of M. graminicola was not affected; and 2) seventy two hours period of draining enhanced the development of M. graminicola compared to period of draining shorter than 72 hours...|$|R

30|$|Healthy leaves washed {{with running}} tape water for about 15  min. and wiped with tissue paper used of {{isolation}} of genomic DNA. In vitro leaves {{did not require}} surface sterilization. Further, 3.0 gm of each leaf sample was homogenized. The homogenized material proceeded by CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 1990) modified by Sharma et al. (2003). 3.0 gm of leaves were grounded in chilled methanol with autoclaved mortar-pestle. The homogenized material was transferred to 15  ml pre-warmed (60 °C) DNA Isolation Buffer (2 X CTAB DNA Extraction Buffer- 100  mM Tris, 20  mM EDTA, 1.4  M NaCl, 2 % CTAB and 2  μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol) in capped polypropylene tubes (PP). The clump of homogenized material was suspended using spatula. The content was incubated for 45  min at 60 °C and mixed to make solution homogenate by gentle swirling in water bath for 2 – 3 times. After removing from water bath 15  ml of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24 : 1) was added and mixed by inversion for 30  min to ensure emulsification of the phases. Content was centrifuged at 15000  rpm for 15  min at 4 °C (Remi C 24 plus). Aqueous phase was taken and transferred to another polypropylene tube. Ice cold 6.0  ml of isopropanol was added, gently swirled and kept in deep freezer at - 20 °C for 30  min to precipitate DNA. The precipitated DNA-CTAB complex was collected by centrifuging the material at 15000  rpm for 15  min at 4 °C. Supernatant was discarded and and washed with 70 % alcohol and kept for 20  min with gentle agitation. The pellet was washed by centrifuging the tube at 10, 000  rpm for 10  min and 4 °C. The liquid was discarded and above step was repeated twice to remove all impurities. The tubes were inverted and <b>drained</b> <b>on</b> a <b>paper</b> towel. The pellet was dried over-night after covering with parafilm with tiny pores. The pellet was re-dissolved in 100  μl of TE buffer by keeping over night at room temperature without agitation.|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a brief summary of {{research}} on the effect of longitudinal <b>drains</b> <b>on</b> subgrade support. The Iowa DOT began installing longitudinal subdrains at a depth of 24 " in 1978. The trend in Iowa has been to deeper longitudinal drains with the present standard being 48 " deep. A very limited amount of data would indicate that the deeper longitudinal drains are providing a greater benefit to the subgrade support value. The 24 # deep drains of the Poweshiek Interstate 80 project yielded a spring subgrade support value of 165. The 30 " deep <b>drains</b> <b>on</b> Pottawattamie Interstate 80 yielded a K value of 170 while the 48 "deep <b>drains</b> <b>on</b> Cass County Interstate 80 yielded a K value of 210.
