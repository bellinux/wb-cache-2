5|$|He led the Indian {{forces in}} Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. He {{was a member}} of the Army Sub Committee of the Forces Reconstitution Committee, which divided the British Indian Army into the Indian and Pakistani Armies after the Partition of India in 1947. After his {{retirement}} from the Indian Army in 1953, he served as the high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. As a token of <b>gratitude</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exemplary service rendered by him to the nation, the Government of India conferred the rank of field marshal on Cariappa in his 87th year, on 14 January 1986.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{announced}} his retirement from playing on March 21, 2015. Before the announcement, the Cleveland Cavaliers had said to Nash's agent that {{they were interested in}} him as a backup for Kyrie Irving if Nash asked for a buyout. Nash refused it, due to both his health concerns and wanting to retire as a Laker in <b>gratitude</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> opportunity given by the club. Nash was later on approached by another former team of his, the Dallas Mavericks, to have one last season with them instead, but he declined due to his aforementioned health concerns.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{issues were}} largely resolved {{after the city}} relented to public pressure and opted to site its memorial on a plot of land off Leeman Road, just outside the city walls, and for a reduced scheme {{in the form of}} a cross due to a shortage of funds. Coincidentally, the land was owned by the railway company and the NER board donated it to the city in a mark of <b>gratitude</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> good relations between the company and the city; the NER had by that time been amalgamated into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) as a result of the Railways Act 1921.|$|E

5|$|The second {{individual}} to be conferred the rank was Kodandera M. Cariappa, the first Indian {{to serve as}} the commander–in–chief of the Indian Army. Unlike Manekshaw, who was conferred the rank just before his retirement, Cariappa was already retired in 1953, and since a field marshal never retires, therefore retired officers cannot be given the rank. But as a token of <b>gratitude</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exemplary service rendered by him to the nation, the Government of India overruled the pre-established criteria, and conferred the rank of field marshal on him on 28 April 1986 at a special investiture ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.|$|E
5|$|The nascent Kushan fleet {{sets out}} for Hiigara, intent on {{reclaiming}} their ancient homeworld, {{but not before}} decimating the fleet responsible for Kharak genocide. Their multi-stage journey across the galaxy takes them through asteroid fields, a giant nebula, and a ship graveyard. Along the way, they encounter several independent, mercenary, and pirate enemies in addition to Taiidan outposts. They also meet the Bentusi, a race of traders, who sell them advanced technology. After discovering that the Bentusi have given aid to the exiles, the Taiidan attempt to destroy them, but are stopped by the Kushan fleet. The Bentusi then reveal that the Kushan had once ruled their own empire, before being destroyed by the Taiidan and exiled from Hiigara. In <b>gratitude</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Kushan's intervention, they promise to summon the Galactic Council to consider the Kushan's claim to Hiigara.|$|E
5|$|Toshack then removed Compton for a duck, {{caught in}} the slips by Miller, leaving England three wickets down with the score still on 125. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball, {{stopping}} Australia's fightback as England reached 174 by the close without further loss. Washbrook was unbeaten on 85 and Crapp 19. England were 316 runs in front with two days of play remaining and seven wickets in hand. Their position was aided by the Australian fielders, who dropped Washbrook twice more. The Lancastrian was on 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from the ball, much to the amusement of the crowd. After adding two more runs, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack. At {{the end of the}} day's play, Washbrook purchased a drink for Hassett in <b>gratitude</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dropped catches.|$|E

5|$|In 1761, Alexander Dalrymple, {{an officer}} of the British East India Company, {{concluded}} an agreement with the Sultan of Sulu to allow him to set up a trading post {{for the first time in}} northern Borneo, although this was to prove a failure. Following the British occupation of Manila in 1763, the British freed the Sultan Alimuddin from Spanish colonisers and allowed him to return to his throne; this was welcomed by the Sulu people and by 1765, Dalrymple managed to obtain the island, having concluded a Treaty of Alliance and Commerce with the Sultan of Sulu by the willing of Sultan Alimuddin as a sign of <b>gratitude</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British aid. A small British factory was then established in 1773 on Balambangan Island, a tiny island situated off the north coast of Borneo. The British saw the island as a suitable location to control the trade route in the East, capable of diverting trade from the Spanish port of Manila and the Dutch port of Batavia especially with its strategic location between the South China Sea and Sulu Sea. But the British abandoned the island two years later when the Sulu pirates began attacking. This forced the British to seek refuge in Brunei in 1774, and to abandon temporarily their attempts to find alternative sites for the factory. Although an attempt was made in 1803 to turn Balambangan into a military station, the British did not re-establish any further trading posts in the region until Stamford Raffles founded Singapore in 1819.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the proposed site mounted, even after the Ancient Monuments Board's approval, and the YAYAS continued to apply pressure, calling another public meeting—which it scheduled for 3 May 1923—forcing the war memorial committee to reconsider. The committee revisited a site on Leeman Road, outside the city walls, which had originally been proposed in 1921. Lutyens sent his assistant Albert J Thomas (an architect in his own right) to examine the site on 8 August 1923 and all parties agreed to it. By coincidence, the site was owned by the NER, which donated it to the city in a mark of <b>gratitude</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> good relations between {{the company and the}} city, the NER having recently been amalgamated into the London and North Eastern Railway. Lutyens submitted a revised design to account for the new location—a War Cross and a Stone of Remembrance—which would have cost almost £2,500. The scheme was scaled back to just the cross and the council undertook to conduct the work using its own staff in order to keep within the £1,100 that had been raised by public subscription.|$|E

O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his Parkinson's disease made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, which never occurred.|$|E
25|$|Gellius, however, {{showed no}} <b>gratitude</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{leniency}} {{which had been}} shown him, but deserted to the triumvirs, Augustus and Mark Antony.

In the war between Octavian and Antony, he espoused {{the side of the}} latter, and commanded the right wing of Antony's fleet at the battle of Actium. As he is not mentioned again, he probably perished in the action.|$|E
