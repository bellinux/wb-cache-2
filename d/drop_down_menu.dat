40|$|Different {{interfaces}} allow a user {{to achieve}} the same end goal through different action sequences, e. g., command lines vs. <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> <b>menus.</b> Interface efficiency can be described in terms of a cost incurred, e. g., time taken, by the user in typical tasks. Realistic users arrive at evaluations of efficiency, hence making choices about which interface to use, over time, based on trial and error experience. Their choices are also determined by prior experience, which determines how much learning time is required. These factors have substantial effect on the adoption of new interfaces. In this paper, we aim at understanding how users adapt under interface change, how much time it takes them to learn to interact optimally with an interface, and how this learning could be expedited through intermediate interfaces.

40|$|Software {{development}} and reuse, {{an issue of}} both technology and people The widespread focus and adoption of Object Orientation in the late 1980 ’ies {{was thought to be}} the necessary prerequisite for achieving reuse on a large scale in both the design and implementation of software. However, a quick survey of publications on the subject of reuse since this breakthrough tells of varying problems and challenges to achieving this goal. This essay gives an overview of some of the described issues which are grounded in technological as well as organizational issues. Finally an attempt is done to compare the programming process or experience at an individual level to findings in the research of groupware adoption. Why reuse? Given the impression that to establish firm traditions of reuse isn’t easy, why bother? Offhand a few reasons come to mind. Large software systems consists of so many parts, that many of the part-solutions must have been met before in other systems. A simple example of this is the <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> <b>menus</b> of graphical user interfaces (GUI). Comple...|$|R

At a private high school, teachers are required to use productivity tools available through the school website to do their work. However, through informal feedback, teachers expressed frustration that information was difficult to find and was not current or relevant. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} usability study was to evaluate the content and organization of a newly designed website. Teachers who reported little to no use of the website were asked to participate. Six teachers were observed and audio recorded using a talk-aloud technique while using the website to complete eight scenarios commonly asked of teachers. Data collected included field notes, screencastings, and surveys. Analysis included qualitative coding of field notes and audio transcripts and descriptive statistical analysis of the survey data. Findings indicated teachers preferred having information simplified, in one location, with fewer <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> <b>menus.</b> Additionally, there were a variety of preferences in terms of how information was presented, with some preferring video, some text and images, and some downloadable PDF files.

40|$|In this project, an {{enhanced}} version of Jedit is presented. Jedit is a Graph Editor developed at Ball State University {{by a group}} of students under the direction of Dr. Jay Bagga. The following paper describes the new version, named Jedit 4. 0. In this version two new algorithms are implemented. These are: Planarity Testing and Planarity Drawing. The first algorithm tests a graph for planarity and the second one makes a planar embedding of the graph in a grid of size (n- 2) x (n- 2), where n is the order of the graph. Planar graphs have important applications in the fields of computer engineering, architecture, and many others. Jedit 4. 0 also includes new features that were not available in earlier versions. The new features include: graph rotation operation, graph complement, drawing of well-known graphs, and credits window. Several modifications and additions to existing features and algorithms have also been carried out. Jedit 4. 0 uses swing java technology what provides a more elegant look. <b>Drop</b> <b>down</b> <b>menus</b> have also been added to provide the user an easier way to use Jedit.
