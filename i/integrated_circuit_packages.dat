50|$|The {{controller}} board inside the Anykey contains six <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>packages</b> (“chips”) {{in addition to}} various signal regulation hardware including 15 diodes, 11 capacitors, and nine resistors of unknown specific function in addition to four green LED's for signalling purposes of (left to right)“NUM LOCK”, “CAPS LOCK”, “SCROLL LOCK”, and “PROGRAM”. The chips included are an Intel P8052AH microcontroller, an Atmel AT28C16 16 kilobit EEPROM chip, and four Fairchild Semiconductor Decoder/Demultiplexer chips of various descriptions.|$|E
5000|$|The TTL [...] "totem-pole" [...] output {{structure}} {{often has}} a momentary overlap when both {{the upper and}} lower transistors are conducting, resulting in a substantial pulse of current drawn from the power supply. These pulses can couple in unexpected ways between multiple <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>packages,</b> resulting in reduced noise margin and lower performance. TTL systems usually have a decoupling capacitor for every one or two IC packages, so that a current pulse from one TTL chip does not momentarily reduce the supply voltage to another.|$|E

50|$|Since the warping of the <b>circuit</b> {{board or}} <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> may {{disappear}} when the board cools, an intermittent fault may be created. Diagnosis of head-in-pillow defects may require use of X-rays or EOTPR (Electro Optical Terahertz Pulse Reflectometry), since the solder joints are hidden between the <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>package</b> and the printed circuit board.|$|R
50|$|The defect can {{be caused}} by surface {{oxidation}} or poor wetting of the solder, or by distortion of the <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>package</b> or <b>circuit</b> board by the heat of the soldering process. This is particularly a concern when using lead-free solder, which requires higher processing temperature.|$|R
50|$|In the {{assembly}} of <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>packages</b> to printed circuit boards, a head-in-pillow defect is {{a failure of the}} soldering process. For example, {{in the case of a}} ball grid array package, the pre-desposited solder ball on the package and the solder paste applied to the circuit board may both melt, but the melted solder does not join. A cross-section through the failed joint shows a distinct boundary between the solder ball on the part and the solder paste on the circuit board, rather like a section through a head resting on a pillow.|$|E
50|$|For {{performance}} reasons, all {{the parallel}} address lines of an address bus must be valid {{at the same}} time, otherwise access to memory would be delayed and performance would be seriously reduced. <b>Integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>packages</b> may have a limit {{on the number of}} pins available to provide the memory bus. Different versions of a CPU architecture, in different-sized IC packages, can be designed, trading off reduced package size for reduced pin count and address space. A trade-off might be made between address pins and other functions, restricting the memory physically available to an architecture even if it inherently has a higher capacity. On the other hand, segmented or bank switching designs provide more memory address space than is available in an internal memory address register.|$|E

40|$|Market {{demand for}} thin, small and light {{electronic}} packaging {{is on the}} increase in recent years. This is primarily driven by space limitation in portable computing and consumer products. Fine pitch ball grid array (fpBGA™) offers competitive alternative in package miniaturization to true chip scale packaging to meet such demands. This paper outlines encapsulation technique selection, characterization and reliability for fpBGA™. Both transfer molding and liquid encapsulation techniques were evaluated. Transfer molding technique was selected due to better encapsulation thickness control and lower array warpage. Mold simulation followed by actual mold process characterization was performed. Package reliability equivalent to or surpassed existing PBGA was achieved. The reliability results are outlined in this paper.

The method obviates the need for circuit realizations of electromagnetic interactions, and can be considered complementary to the partial element equivalent circuits, for cases where surface-based modeling is preferable such as complex connectors and packages, and for Green’s function based modeling of skin effects.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in computational capability that has occurred over {{the last ten years}} has allowed fully electromagnetic simulations of large, complex, three-dimensional systems to move progressively from impractical, to expensive, and recently, to routine and widespread.
