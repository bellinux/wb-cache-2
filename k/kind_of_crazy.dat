500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} in December 2007, when she recognized it applied to more scenarios and had a [...] "bigger meaning" [...] than originally. American television network National Broadcasting Company (NBC) had asked Swift to perform at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. However, an appearance could not be scheduled because Swift was touring at the time. Instead, Swift's father suggested using [...] "Change" [...] as a theme for the event. Therefore, [...] "Change" [...] was used during NBC's daily video highlights in August 2008, prior {{to the release of}} Fearless. [...] "I wrote the song ‘Change’ as an underdog story. It’s <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> to think that the Olympics chose this as one of the songs to play during the Olympic Games", Swift commented. It was included on the AT Team USA Soundtrack (2008). The song was released as a promotional single on the iTunes Store on August 8, 2008. All proceeds were donated to the United States Olympic team.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter {{had just}} made Dark Star but {{no one wanted to}} hire him as a director, so he assumed that he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the {{intention}} of making Escape later. After the success of Halloween, Avco-Embassy signed him and producer Debra Hill to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was The Fog. Initially, the second film {{that he was going to}} make to finish the contract was The Philadelphia Experiment, but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt that something was missing and recalls, [...] "This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> humor that people from New York would expect to see." [...] He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film school days at University of Southern California who played [...] "The Shape" [...] in Halloween. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.|$|E
500|$|After publication, Juster sent {{a copy of}} {{the book}} to the Ford Foundation, with an {{explanation}} of how the projected book on cities had transformed into The Phantom Tollbooth. He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years [...] "and they'll talk to me about a whole different book, normally. But now they've got a lot more of the words right. A lot more of the fun <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> references". He learned too that readers were capable of more than he had intended, {{as in the case of}} the letter sent by the Mathemagician to King Azaz. Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set about breaking it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful. The numbers were not intended to have any meaning, and were meant to convey that the Mathemagician's letter could not have been understood by Azaz or his advisers.|$|E
5000|$|Group member Nick Littlemore gave {{details of}} the track during its premiere on American radio station KROQ, saying [...] "It was about this girl I knew when I was a kid called Alice D who was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a wild child. She did all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> things. We {{wanted to write a}} song that {{captured}} the innocence and bravery of youth, and being a teenager, and having these <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> experiences where you throw caution to the wind and you try things for the first time." ...|$|R
500|$|In January 2014, artwork {{from the}} {{canceled}} film surfaced online, showing what an adaptation could have looked like. Verbinski {{said that there}} is [...] "all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> stuff" [...] from the pre-production stage that still exists such as screen tests for characters. He noted in the 2017 Reddit piece that {{with the success of}} the 2016 film Deadpool, he believes that there is now justification for his vision of the BioShock film.|$|R
5000|$|The set {{includes}} a 3+ hour concert DVD from Tilburg (plus the [...] "Return of the Giant Hogweed" [...] encore), audio {{from the whole}} Manchester show and crazy STRANGER JAMS - (the section where Mike does all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> stuff. See Mike crowd surfing in Cologne, and singing Smoke on the Water.) Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation once again makes an appearance on this release, playing additional keyboards, guitars, percussion, and vocals throughout the show.|$|R
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or what he was going to do next ... you know what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
2500|$|After {{learning}} that Penthouse would be publishing these photos, the Miss America Organization responded by giving Williams 72 hours to resign. Williams later stated that [...] "the heightened spectacle and circus {{of it all}} was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy.</b> I had people saying 'Fight for the crown! Fight for the crown!' and people chanting 'Don't give it up! Don't secede!' [...] " [...] Williams also later noted that the situation was particularly hard on her mother Helen, who felt that she should not resign as Williams had performed her [...] "duties and excelled at everything I was asked to do plus doing 50% more of appearances that were not scheduled because I was the first African American Miss America." [...] Helen was also upset that [...] "the pageant {{did not come to}} my support, they felt I needed to resign." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics have {{described}} dril's voice as an amalgamation of ordinary Internet users, {{most of all}} those who are arrogant, ignorant, or hapless. According to The A.V. Clubs Clayton Purdom, dril is a sort of patron saint of Internet users, or [...] "your uncle's search history come to life and filtered through a scabrous comic sensibility, and ... possibly the most popular, beloved man on the entire internet (after, maybe, The Rock)." [...] Will Shaw of The Oxford Student noted the familiarity of dril's [...] "naive appeals to moderation" [...] and [...] "flame war posturing," [...] and said dril [...] "is the internet's collective id, given form. He's the internet equivalent of the Beowulf-poet; we may never know who he really is, but we recognise when he is being channelled." [...] Christine Erickson at Mashable said dril's character was like [...] "a spambot equivalent to the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> that Clint Eastwood portrays." [...] At Kotaku, Gita Jackson called dril a [...] "joke account that also inadvertently catalogues ... every way to be mad online." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 2012, at OSCON, Shuttleworth {{explained}} some of {{the historical}} reasoning behind Unity's development. The initial decision {{to develop a new}} interface in 2008 was driven by a desire to innovate and to pass Microsoft and Apple in user experience. This meant a family of unified interfaces that could be used across many device form factors, including desktop, laptop, tablet, smart phones and TV. Shuttleworth said [...] "‘The old desktop would force your tablet or your phone into all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> <b>of</b> funny postures. So we said: Screw it. We’re going to move the desktop to where it needs to be for the future. This {{turned out to be a}} deeply unpopular process." ...|$|R

5000|$|Other {{experts have}} {{suggested}} that the problem is that bloggers will cherry-pick information from the documents to solidify their own perspectives without putting the tidbits they find in an overall historical context. Former CIA terrorism specialist Michael Scheuer pointed this out {{in an interview with the}} New York Times: [...] "There's no quality control. You'll have guys out there with a smattering of Arabic drawing all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> conclusions. Rush Limbaugh will cherry-pick from the right, and Al Franken will cherry-pick from the left." ...|$|R
2500|$|As Fox greenlit {{the show}} in 2011 and ordered an initial 13 episodes, Meriwether {{approached}} Jake Kasdan, whom she admired {{for his work on}} Freaks and Geeks blending comedy and emotion, to shoot the pilot and subsequent episodes. 30 Rock Brett Baer and Dave Finkel became co-showrunners, although Meriwether is still regarded as the voice behind New Girl. According to The New Republic, Kasdan [...] "helped develop the feel of the show, which is lit more darkly and cinematically than the average sitcom", and Meriwether found the show working best [...] "when you're laughing, but you're a little sad about it". The show attempts to combine [...] "comedy and drama as the five characters explore the difficulties of the decade between 30 and 40, which is when many people take their biggest steps toward maturity" [...] in regards to relationships and careers, which, unlike Friends, is giving the show a [...] "built-in biological clock". Kasdan said that [...] "Their lives are moving forward, [...] they're still trying to hang on to some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> youth" [...] although he does not [...] "want them ever to seem pathetic." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 26, 2016, {{the band}} {{released}} the second single from the album, [...] "Moth into Flame", {{along with a}} music video. The album's third single, [...] "Atlas, Rise!", was released on October 31, 2016, with a music video composed of footage from the album's recording process. Ulrich also told The Straits Times that same day that the band would be filming music videos for all twelve tracks on the album, using YouTube as their platform. [...] "Now that YouTube is the world's biggest television station, we figured we may as well knock a video out for every song... the practicality of shooting twelve music videos is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy,</b> especially when you're trying to promote your record, and you're all over the place, {{and trying to make}} sure it doesn't leak. It's crazy but, at the same time, fun". On November 12, 2016, a local Walmart started selling the album in advance of the official release date of November 18. On November 16, the music videos for all nine remaining tracks (along with [...] "Lords of Summer") were released. The Italian city of Matera appears in the music video for [...] "Spit Out the Bone".|$|E
2500|$|With Winston {{only being}} added {{late to the}} show, the writers {{developed}} the Nick–Winston dynamic in season 1 and sought to figure out Winston's relationship with the other loftmates in season 2. The writers noticed late during the first season that Morris seemed better suited to play a smart character and act as the loft's voice of reason, although Meriwether found that when Winston [...] "finally does blow up, he's crazier than all of them" [...] and that he works better [...] "in these <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy,</b> comedic runners, small pieces of the episode" [...] that contrast the relationship dramas of the other main characters. The Winston–Schmidt friendship was developed significantly {{in the second half}} of season 2 when the story focus moved to Nick and Jess. The Nick–Jess relationship affects the three guys' friendship as Nick starts being more considerate of Jess' feelings regarding shenanigans. Damon Wayans Jr. was planned to reprise his role as Coach in at least four episodes in the third season, according to Meriwether [...] "at a time when the roommates are at odds with each other" [...] and [...] "The guys are all fighting for his friendship." [...] The three guys will get intimidated by Coach's return, as he has [...] "this alpha male aggression" [...] and is [...] "that macho, tough-talking guy that they all think is so cool".|$|E
2500|$|Lopez wrote lyrics for {{the album}} {{in a small}} red leather diary, which she {{described}} as her [...] "magic book". In it, she often scribbled down her thoughts and ideas. The album's artwork and liner notes were modeled after this book, which would [...] "further the feel of an intimate portrait of Lopez's soul". [...] "I wanted the pictures to look <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> aged, {{like it was a}} scrapbook. ... All the writing [...] is all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> and upside down and sideways just as it is in my book," [...] Lopez stated. Majority of This Is Me...

Jackson said that whenever you got overhot or excited that wound hurt you and made you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy,</b> and you went raving about pancakes. He told us to just get you worked off of the subject and soothed down, and you wouldn't be dangerous. So, me and Willella done the best by you we knew how.

2500|$|On June 15, 2008, the Seattle Mariners {{signed him}} to a minor league contract.

5000|$|Most fragging was {{perpetrated by}} enlisted men against leaders.

[...] Harassment of subordinates by a superior was another frequent motive. The stereotypical fragging incident was of [...] "an aggressive career officer being assaulted by disillusioned subordinates." [...] Several fragging incidents resulted from alleged racism between African American and white soldiers. Attempts by officers to control drug use caused others. Most known fragging incidents were carried out by soldiers in support units rather than soldiers in combat units.|$|R
6000|$|... "Boy, can {{you play}} on this?" [...] he shouted, {{holding up a}} frying-pan and a big stick to beat it with. Of course Martin could play on that instrument: he had often enough played on one like it to startle the echoes on the lake, in other days. And so, {{when he had been}} lifted on to the table, he took the frying-pan by the handle, and began vigorously beating on it with the stick. He did not mind the noise now since he was helping to make it. Meanwhile old Jacob began flinging his arms and legs about in all directions, looking like a {{scarecrow}} made to tumble about by means of springs and wires. He pounded the clay floor with his ponderous old boots until the room was filled with a cloud of dust; then in his excitement he kicked over chairs, pots, kettles, and whatever came in his way, while he kept on revolving round the table in a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>crazy</b> fandango. Martin thought it fine fun, and screamed with laughter, and beat his gong louder than ever; then to make matters worse old Jacob at intervals uttered whoops and yells, which the dogs answered with long howls from the door, until the din was something tremendous.|$|E

500|$|While recording, {{they use}} a Yamaha 02R, Pro Tools HD, a Manley Langevin Dual Vocal Combo as pre/compressor/EQ, a Neumann U87, and Event SP8 {{speakers}} with an 18‑inch Mackie. Levine explained that the acoustics and vocals are all recorded with the 87 and the Manley, the basses and electric guitars via DI, adding that [...] "the acoustic guitar that we use is a $150 cheap Fender". He runs most of the keyboards and the MPC through the 02R, and uses a Mackie Big Knob as an interface. He often uses Pro Tools. Despite MIDI being already incorporated in Pro Tools, he doesn't use it extensively.
