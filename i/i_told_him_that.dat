5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

[...] "He ate his food {{and left to}} sleep at the shop since he had a class XII {{compartment}} exam in English {{to take the next}} day. Unlike other days, next morning, he did not show up." [...] The following day Babli's uncle arrived to speak with Manoj. According to Chanderpati, [...] "He said he had come to recover some money that Manoj had borrowed, had tea and left when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Manoj was away for an exam. We only discovered late in the evening that Babli, too, was missing and the two had run away." [...] Manoj had eloped with Babli to Chandigarh and married her on 7 April at a Durga temple, their commitment to one another transcending their willingness to abide by the societal norms.|$|E

500|$|In 2013 Chinen {{stated that}} [...] "Mehldau {{is the most}} {{influential}} jazz pianist of the last 20 years". Pianist Ethan Iverson, a contemporary of Mehldau's, stated that Mehldau was the principal influence on his peers, {{beginning in the late}} 1990s. Pianist Gerald Clayton (born 1984) summarized Mehldau's importance in a 2013 interview: [...] "He brought in a new feel and sound in jazz. I don't know a single modern pianist who hasn't taken something from Brad. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I should be arrested for all the stuff I've stolen from him." [...] Redman said in 2010 that Largo had been particularly important to musicians: [...] "Brad has had a lot of influential records, [...] if you talk to musicians, especially younger musicians, so many of them will name that as a defining record." [...] Marco Benevento and Aaron Parks are among the improvisers who have been affected by the 2002 album.|$|E
500|$|She {{had just}} taken on a steady job working for Marianne Faithfull and John Dunbar as the nanny to their little boy Nicholas, and it was while taking care of Nicholas in Marianne’s third floor Chelsea flat that she first {{encountered}} Paul McCartney. He buzzed the intercom to ask if John (Dunbar) was around, and when Paul explained who he was, Maggie invited him straight up. “Paul ran {{up the stairs and}} came in. Very casually <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> John wasn’t really in and that sent us both into hysterics. We were laughing and chatting. I made a nice lunch for Marianne and a bunch of her friends but they never showed up. Paul and I sat together and ate it instead. I’ll never forget the meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard. It could have been very embarrassing, but there was an immediate rapport and we just couldn’t stop talking.” ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{she became}} {{dissatisfied}} with Cochrane, who was openly committing adultery and constantly insulting Gardnerians, even {{at one point}} calling for [...] "a Night of the Long Knives of the Gardnerians", at which point Valiente openly criticised him and then left his Clan. In her own words, she [...] "rose up and challenged him {{in the presence of}} the rest of the coven. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I was fed up with listening to all this senseless malice, and that, if a 'Night of the Long Knives' was what his sick little soul craved, he could get on with it, but he could get on with it alone, because I had better things to do". Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.|$|E

500|$|Edgardo {{returned}} to the Catechumens on 22 October, and was visited by his parents often over the next month. As with Momolo's first round of visits, two different versions emerged of what happened. According to Edgardo's parents, the boy was obviously intimidated by the clergymen around him and threw himself into his mother's arms {{when he first saw}} her. Marianna later said: [...] "He had lost weight and had turned pale; his eyes were filled with terror... <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he was born a Jew like us and like us he must always remain one, and he replied: Si, mia cara mamma, I will never forget to say the Shema every day.'" [...] One report in the Jewish press described the priests telling Edgardo's parents that God had chosen their son to be [...] "the apostle of Christianity to his family, dedicated to converting his parents and his siblings", and that they could have him back if they also became Christians. The clerics and nuns then knelt and prayed for the conversion of the Mortara household, prompting Edgardo's parents to leave in terror.|$|E
500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened the door and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} the summer of 1979 and {{continued}} periodically through November, with the production team shooting in several intervals for a few days each. A number of prominent gay activists, including Armistead Maupin, Cleve Jones and Sally Gearhart, assisted Crile and Diekhaus with the project, although Gearhart and fellow activist Del Martin began questioning their motives, coming to believe the network [...] "was out to do a hatchet job". Crile interviewed Gearhart for the piece but by the date of her interview she was so mistrustful of the producers that she took measures to try to prevent herself from being misrepresented. [...] "I would lift my voice at a certain point so what I said could not be cut. He seemed to want me to vilify Diane (sic) Feinstein in some way and set her in opposition to the gay community....During one of the breaks <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I didn't feel good about it...I felt I had been twisted and manipulated." [...] Ultimately Gearhart's interview was cut entirely, for which she was [...] "ecstatic". When Crile began his interview with then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein by asking [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} the mayor of Sodom and Gomorrah?" [...] Feinstein threw him and his crew out of her office.|$|E

2500|$|Beckett {{refrained from}} elaborating on the {{characters}} beyond {{what he had}} written in the play.

When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: 'You were worried about it yesterday {{but you do not}} have to worry so much.' Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.' In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and the navy high commands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong {{has been}} criticized for his {{disagreements}} with outspoken opponents of doping such as Paul Kimmage and Christophe Bassons. Bassons was a rider for Festina {{at the time of the}} Festina affair and was widely reported by teammates as being the only rider on the team not to be taking performance-enhancing drugs. Bassons wrote a number of articles for a French newspaper during the 1999 Tour de France which made references to doping in the peloton. Subsequently, Armstrong had an altercation with Bassons during the 1999 Tour de France where Bassons said Armstrong rode up alongside on the Alpe d'Huez stage to tell him [...] "it was a mistake to speak out the way I (Bassons) do and he (Armstrong) asked why I was doing it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> I'm thinking of the next generation of riders.
