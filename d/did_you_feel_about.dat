It is now being implemented in many healthcare systems. However, treatment often involves multiple assessments and intravitreal drug injections, usually {{over an extended period of}} time. How do patients view this process, particularly at the outset, and how does their actual experience affect their views? Methods: Fifteen patients (mean age 76 y; 6 males) were recruited and interviewed using the Biographical Narrative Interview Method (BNIM) before or just after treatment was commenced. At the end of the BNIM interview, a VFQ 25 was also completed. Nine patients were interviewed several months later after they had received at least the loading dose of three injections. A semi-structured interview technique was used and the MacTSQ (a specific treatment satisfaction questionnaire, in which patients score their most recent treatment episode) administered. Interview data was subjected to thematic analysis, and VFQ 25 and MacTSQ data scored and collated in accordance with published procedures. Results: The intersubject mean (±SD) VFQ 25 General Health and General Vision scores were 57 ± 29 and 61 ± 26 respectively; Near Activities scored 65 ± 32. In BNIM interviews almost all patients said that they had known relatively little about what treatment would entail other than that it required injections into their eye. They reported considerable apprehension pre-treatment. However, post-treatment interview data demonstrated that this apprehension was defused by actual treatment experience. None experienced serious adverse events, and few reported experiencing serious discomfort. Where this did occur, it did not discourage patients from continuing with treatment. These reports were complemented by the Mac TSQ data. The mean overall score was 65 ± 5 / 72 (a higher score indicates greater satisfaction). Item 6 specifically asks "How apprehensive <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> your most recent treatment?". The mean score was 5. 2 ± 1. 1 / 6 (where 6 ="Not apprehensive at all"). Many patients compared their treatment favourably to dental treatment. Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients are, in general, very happy with their treatment experience, returning high scores on the MacTSQ. Better information provision at the outset of their treatment journey may be of value in defusing further the apprehension that they reported in initial interviews...|$|E

Esta investiga??o se prop?s a investiga??o de como o homem amaz?nida, em espec?fico o do Amazonas, constr?i sua subjetividade a partir do contato com os cultos de matriz africana, tendo como base de an?lise a filosofia de Martin Heidegger. ? uma pesquisa de natureza qualitativa e desenvolveu a partir dos conceitos propostos pela fenomenologia que busca fazer a compreens?o do outro a partir de seu discurso. O m?todo foi o fenomenol?gico de pesquisa em Psicologia e foi utilizada a entrevista fenomenol?gica efetuada com 11 participantes de pr?ticas religiosas orientadas pela Federa??o de Umbanda e Cultos de Matriz Afro Brasileira do Estado do Amazonas - FUCABEAM, e os dados foram coletados ap?s a aprova??o do projeto de pesquisa pelo comit? de ?tica da UFAM, autoriza??o da institui??o e assinatura do termo de consentimento livre e esclarecido pelos participantes. Os dados foram coletados a partir de entrevista ?udio gravadas com uma dura??o em m?dia de 30 minutos a duas horas cada no per?odo de mar?o a agosto de 2015 a partir da quest?o norteadora: Gostaria que o Sr. (a). descrevesse para mim a sua rela??o com o candombl? (ou Umbanda) como se deu o contato e sua entrada para a religi?o?Destes discursos foram identificadas Unidades de significados que permitiram a forma??o de Categorias de An?lise que serviram para a compreens?o de como os indiv?duos constitu?am sua subjetividade a partir das pr?ticas com os cultos de matriz africana. O estudo revelou que os indiv?duos praticantes dos cultos de matriz Africana Umbanda e Candombl? constituem sua subjetividade pautados em um processo de cuidar-do-outro ou ser-com-o-outro numa proposta de que cuidando do outro este ser cuida de si pr?prio. Percebo que em sua trajet?ria hist?rica, cada um deles foi mergulhando no conhecimento acerca das religi?es de matriz africana que professam e o estado de humor propiciou a compreens?o de seu papel, de suas possibilidades, de seu poder-ser. Concomitantemente, outra existenci?lia se faz presente, a interpreta??o que Heidegger (2009, p. 204) compreende como a ?elabora??o das possibilidades projetadas na compreens?o?. Estabelece-se a indica??o do para qu?, desvelando o sentido. O sentido de sermembro de religi?o de matriz africana; o sentido de assumir as caracter?sticas de personalidade de seus mestres ou guias; o sentido para as facticidades vivenciadas cotidianamente que resultaram em ser quem s?o hoje, dirigentes de terreiros/barrac?es, responsabilizando-se por cada um daqueles que os procuram, no objetivo de propugnar conhecimento, al?vio, cuidado. The {{search for}} the sacred, always, was made present in the man's life that was {{returned}} the practice of his/her religiosity or spirituality, therefore the religious phenomenon through the mystic search and {{of the practice of}} the syncretism that involves a miscellany of practices and rituals that seek to provide the subject's wellbeing it permeates the context of the human civilization and it would not be different in the area that we inhabited, however how to understand the proximity of a religious practice which we didn't have extreme approach, as this man builds his or her subjectivity with base in practices so different from his or her culture. This investigation intended the investigation of as the man amaz?nida, in specific the one of Amazon, builds its subjectivity starting from the contact with the cults of African head office, tends as analysis base Martin Heidegger's philosophy. It?s a qualitative research nature and it developed starting from the concepts proposed by the phenomenology that looks for to do the understanding of the other starting from his/her speech. The method was the research phenomenological in Psychology and the phenomenological interview was used made with 11 participants of religious practices guided by the Federation of Umbanda and Cults of Head office Brazilian Afro of the State of Amazon - FUCABEAM, and the data were collected after the approval of the research project by the committee of ethics of UFAM, authorization of the institution and signature of the term of free and illustrious consent for the participants. The data were collected starting from interview audio recorded with a duration on average of 30 minutes at two hours each in the period of March to August of 2015 starting from the guiding question: I would like that you would describe how was your first relationship with the candombl? (or Umbanda) and how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> your entrance for the religion? About these speeches were identified Units of meanings that allowed the formation of Categories of Analysis that were for the understanding of as the individuals they constituted of his/her subjectivity starting from the practices with the cults of African head office. The study revealed that the practicing individuals of the cults of head office African Umbanda and Candombl? constitute the subjectivity ruled in a process of take care-pity-other or be-with-the-other in a proposal that taking care of the other this being takes care of itself own. I notice that in the historical path, each one of them went diving in the knowledge concerning the religions of African head office that profess and the humor state propitiated the understanding of their role, of their possibilities, of their canbeing. As the same time other way of existence is made present, the interpretation that Heidegger (2009, p. 204). The understands as the "elaboration of the possibilities projected in the understanding". The Settles down the indication of what and what for something, revealing the sense. The sense of be-member of religion of African head office; the sense of assuming the characteristics of their masters' personality or guides; the sense for the factuality lived daily that resulted in to be who they are today, their temples leaders, taking the responsibility for each one of those that seek them, in the objective of defend knowledge, relief, care...|$|E
