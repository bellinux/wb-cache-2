5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the <b>duckling</b> is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the <b>duckling</b> is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} <b>duckling</b> as fat as {{possible}} {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E
50|$|Mandarin <b>ducklings</b> {{are almost}} {{identical}} in appearance to wood <b>ducklings,</b> and {{very similar to}} mallard <b>ducklings.</b> The <b>ducklings</b> can be distinguished from mallard <b>ducklings</b> because the eye-stripe of mandarin <b>ducklings</b> (and wood <b>ducklings)</b> stops at the eye, while in mallard <b>ducklings</b> it reaches {{all the way to}} the bill.|$|R
50|$|Rouen <b>ducklings</b> can be {{distinguished}} from wild mallard <b>ducklings</b> {{by the presence of}} a second stripe which runs across their face, just under their eye, whereas mallard <b>ducklings</b> have only one stripe which runs across their eye.|$|R

5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{first began}} {{exploring}} a possible live action/animation biography film of author and poet Hans Christian Andersen sometime in late 1937 before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first feature-length hand-drawn animated film ever made. In March 1940, Walt Disney suggested a co-production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn, where Goldwyn's studio would shoot the live-action sequences of Andersen's life and Disney's studio would animate Andersen's fairy tales. The animated sequences {{would be based}} on some of Andersen's best known works, such as The Little Mermaid, The Little Match Girl, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, The Ugly <b>Duckling,</b> The Red Shoes, and The Emperor's New Clothes. However, the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow Queen, as it could not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow Queen character to modern audiences. Even {{as far back as the}} 1930s and 1940s, it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities, but the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic. After the United States entered World War II, the studio began to focus on making wartime propaganda, which caused development on the Disney–Goldwyn project to grind to a halt in 1942. Goldwyn went on to produce his own live-action film version in 1952, entitled Hans Christian Andersen, with Danny Kaye as Andersen, Charles Vidor directing, Moss Hart writing, and Frank Loesser penning the songs. All of Andersen's fairy tales were, instead, told in song and ballet in live-action, like the rest of the film. It went on to receive six Academy Award nominations the following year. Back at Disney, The Snow Queen, along with other Andersen fairy tales (including The Little Mermaid), were shelved.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{determined the}} effects of early color experience on gradients of wavelength generalization. In each experiment, one group of <b>ducklings</b> was raised in monochromatic (589 nanometers) sodium-vapor light and a second group, in white light. In Exp.

40|$|AIM: To {{analyze the}} {{difference}} of intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and (S. enteritidis) orally infected <b>ducklings.</b> METHODS: Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC) -PCR was applied to analyze the intestinal microbial community diversity and dynamic change including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and rectum from healthy <b>ducklings</b> and 7 -day-old <b>ducklings</b> after oral infection with S. enteritidis at different time points. RESULTS: The intestinal microbial community of the control healthy <b>ducklings</b> was steady and the ERIC-PCR band numbers of the control healthy <b>ducklings</b> were the least with rectum and were the most with caecum. ERIC-PCR bands of orally inoculated <b>ducklings</b> did not obviously change until 24 h after inoculation (p. i.). The numbers of the ERIC-PCR bands gradually decreased from 24 h to 72 h p. i., and then, {{with the development of}} disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 d p. i. The prominent bacteria changed because of S. enteritidis infection and the DNAstar of staple of ERIC-PCR showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected <b>ducklings</b> with SE. CONCLUSION: This study has provided significant data to clarify the intestinal microbial community diversity and dynamic change of healthy and S. enteritidis orally infected <b>ducklings,</b> and valuable insight into the pathogenesis of S. enteritidis infection in both human and animals...|$|R

50|$|Ducks are {{generally}} monogamous, although these bonds usually last {{only a single}} year. Larger species and the more sedentary species (like fast river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last numerous years. Most duck species breed once a year, choosing {{to do so in}} favourable conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons). Ducks also tend to make a nest before breeding, and, after hatching, lead their <b>ducklings</b> to water. Mother ducks are very caring and protective of their young, but may abandon some of their <b>ducklings</b> if they are physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of (such as nesting in an enclosed courtyard) or are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation, or disease. <b>Ducklings</b> can also be orphaned by inconsistent late hatching where a few eggs hatch after the mother has abandoned the nest and led her <b>ducklings</b> to water.Most domestic ducks neglect their eggs and <b>ducklings,</b> and their eggs must be hatched under a broody hen or artificially.|$|R
