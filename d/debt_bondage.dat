5|$|The {{emergence}} of mining increased {{the migration of}} native African people in search of employment to the province from elsewhere in Africa. The mining industry improved {{the standard of living}} of those living along Northern Rhodesia's railroads, and increased the influx of white people, the Europeans from South Africa who wanted to maintain their superiority over the native African population. Native Africans were poorly treated by the whites and discouraged from working in the mines; this evolved into a racial struggle. The high rate of immigration to the region increased the number of unplanned settlements. The BSAC introduced a hut tax in 1901 in North-Eastern Rhodesia and between 1904 and 1913 in North-Western Rhodesia for all migrants. The tax was high (in some cases, six months' wages), and intended to create a system of <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> and generate income for investment in other mines. Unrest caused by tax increases was suppressed {{with the help of the}} British South Africa Police. The imposition of tax was a strategy adopted to create bond labour and sustain demand during the 1920s when the demand for miners was higher. The company was able to maintain low wages on account of predominance of migrant labour from rural regions. The African miners had three major issues: low wages compared to European miners, a prohibition against working in mines reserved for Europeans despite high skills, and workplace harassment and brutality.|$|E
25|$|Indenture, {{otherwise}} known as bonded labour or <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> {{is a form of}} unfree labour under which a person pledges himself or herself against a loan. The services required to repay the debt, and their duration, may be undefined. <b>Debt</b> <b>bondage</b> can be passed on from generation to generation, with children required to pay off their progenitors' debt. It is the most widespread form of slavery today. <b>Debt</b> <b>bondage</b> is most prevalent in South Asia.|$|E
25|$|Slavery was {{abolished}} in Nepal in 1924. Nevertheless, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> even involving debtors' {{children has}} been a persistent social problem in the Terai. Rana rule was marked by tyranny, , economic exploitation and religious persecution.|$|E
25|$|The {{weighted}} average global sales {{price of a}} slave is calculated to be approximately $340, with a high of $1,895 for the average trafficked sex slave, and a low of $40 to $50 for <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> slaves in part of Asia and Africa.|$|E
25|$|Abuses {{included}} police corruption, {{registration of}} underage girls, forced registration of vulnerable women, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> and other {{ways in which}} women in brothels were exploited, as well as regulations and other practices that prevented women from leaving prostitution. In the colonies and mandated territories, the regulations were often related to military conquest and control.|$|E
25|$|Martin Albrow's {{globalization}} {{theory and}} Darren O'Byrne's theories {{on human rights}} have influenced Bales' research, as has the empirical training he received from Jack Gibbs and Larry DeBord. Some commentators believe his views on modern slavery were anticipated by contributors to the 1970s mode of production debate, and that his work on <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> in India and Pakistan was anticipated by the Marxist Tom Brass.|$|E
25|$|Tom Brass {{argues that}} unfree labour {{is not an}} archaic {{holdover}} in today's world, but an active process of deproletarianization of agricultural workers to provide rural agrarian capitalists with cheaper labour. In the constant drive to cheapen the cost of agricultural labour, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> is used to tie workers to specific employers, lower their wages, and extract further unpaid labour from them. He illustrates this process at work in Peru and India.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{indenture}} {{system was}} an ongoing system of indenture, {{a form of}} <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> by which 3.5million Indians were transported to various colonies of European powers to provide labour for the (mainly sugar) plantations. It started {{from the end of}} slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of large Indian diaspora, which spread from the Indian Ocean (i.e. Réunion and Mauritius) to Pacific Ocean (i.e. Fiji), as well as the growth of Indo-Caribbean and Indo-African population.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{economic}} and labor policy towards sustaining the self-employed livelihoods {{of millions of}} small land-owning/land-holding cash crop farmers and small family-run convenience stores against unequal competition and financial subservience to business conglomerates in the FMCG, multi-brand retail and agrochemical sector became a major focus area during the election campaign. Political parties have increasingly become sensitive to civil uprisings in rural electoral constituencies where State and Central government policies have failed to tackle widespread bureaucratic corruption, stem farmers' suicides and lower <b>debt</b> <b>bondage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Russia is a supply, transit, and {{destination}} country for men, women, and children being trafficked for various purposes. The trafficking is multidimensional and it involves both commercial sexual exploitation and labor exploitation. Russia {{is a significant}} source of women trafficked to over 50 nations. Internal trafficking is a problem in the country; women are trafficked from rural areas to urban settlements for commercial sexual exploitation. Men are trafficked internally and from Central Asia for forced labor in the construction and agricultural industries. <b>Debt</b> <b>bondage</b> is common among the trafficking victims.|$|E
25|$|The law prohibits {{trafficking}} for {{the purpose}} of commercial sexual exploitation, including <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> and prescribes up to 10 years' imprisonment. Trafficking for forced labor is criminalized and carries penalties of up to five years' imprisonment. February revisions to the Passport Act allow for restricted issuance or confiscation of passports of persons engaging in illegal activity overseas, including sex trafficking. However, some NGOs believed the laws against sex trafficking were not being enforced to their fullest potential. During the year authorities conducted 220 trafficking investigations and prosecuted in 31 cases, all for sex trafficking. There were no reported prosecutions or convictions of labor trafficking offenses.|$|E
25|$|While {{slavery was}} institutionally {{recognized}} by most societies, {{it has now}} been outlawed in all recognized countries, the last being Mauritania in 2007. Nevertheless, there are still more slaves today than at any previous point in history, with an estimated 45 million people being in slavery worldwide. The most common form of the slave trade is now commonly referred to as human trafficking. Chattel slavery is also still practiced by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In other areas, slavery (or unfree labour) continues through practices such as <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> serfdom, domestic servants kept in captivity, certain adoptions in which children are forced to work as slaves, child soldiers, and forced marriage.|$|E
25|$|The Gleeson court {{decided a}} number of {{important}} native title cases, including Yanner v Eaton (1999), Western Australia v Ward (2002) and the Yorta Yorta case (2002). In tort law, the court's significant decisions include Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999), concerning negligence actions where there is only pure economic loss as opposed to physical or mental injury, Dow Jones v Gutnick (2002), regarding defamation on the Internet, and Cattanach v Melchior (2003), a wrongful life case involving a healthy child. In criminal law, the court in R v Tang (2008) upheld slavery convictions against the owner of a brothel who had held several women in <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> after they had been trafficked to Australia.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, ILO {{helped lead}} the Worst Forms Convention 182 (C182), which {{has so far been}} signed upon and {{domestically}} ratified by 151 countries including the United States. This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> and forced labour, including forced recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work. Both the Worst Forms Convention (C182) and the Minimum Age Convention (C138) are examples of international labour standards implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.|$|E
25|$|Forced {{prostitution}} and sexual slavery are considered contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, {{and can be}} found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or <b>debt</b> <b>bondage.</b> Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This form of marriage can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in order to sell them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China. Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under lock and key until they have a child, at which time they will be less likely to leave because {{they do not want to}} abandon their child.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue to}} {{consider}} is {{the freedom of the}} migrants. Some scholars have questioned whether these workers are moving into a state of “unfreedom”. Recruitment into circular migration may involve false promises and deception, leading to forced labor and <b>debt</b> <b>bondage.</b> Migrants have varying degrees of control concerning the choice and circumstances of migration, thus making the distinction between voluntary and forced migration unclear. Once in their destination country, migrants are sometimes met with abusive treatment, inadequate nutrition, poor lodging, and insufficient food. These factors are unlikely to bring a worker back to that area, thus discouraging circular migration. This dishonest recruitment leads {{to the question of whether}} the migrants are marginalized. Circular migrants are marginal in the area of destination in the sense that their true home is back in their home area, and they do not plan on living in the host area permanently.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} her tenure as Adviser to the Minister that Giammarinaro was {{selected}} to represent the Italian Government in several high profile international and multi-lateral negotiations especially concerning transnational organized crime. In 1999-2000, Giammarinaro {{was a member of}} the Italian delegation to the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of a United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children at the UN Commission for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in Vienna. In particular, she contributed to the development of a global agreement on the definition of trafficking in human beings, especially concerning the “abuse of a position of vulnerability” as a key concept to address difficult cases of <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> extreme poverty or psychological subjugation. She was in Palermo in 2000 when the Convention and the Protocol were signed. On this occasion she participated in an informal discussion with First Lady Hillary Clinton along with a few select personalities from around the world.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{slavery is}} now outlawed in every country, {{the number of}} slaves today is {{estimated}} as between 12 million and 29.8 million. Several {{estimates of the number}} of slaves in the world have been provided. According to a broad definition of slavery used by Kevin Bales of Free the Slaves (FTS), an advocacy group linked with Anti-Slavery International, there were 27 million people in slavery in 1999, spread all over the world. In 2005, the International Labour Organization provided an estimate of 12.3 million forced labourers. Siddharth Kara has also provided an estimate of 28.4 million slaves at the end of 2006 divided into three categories: bonded labour/debt bondage (18.1 million), forced labour (7.6 million), and trafficked slaves (2.7 million). Kara provides a dynamic model to calculate the number of slaves in the world each year, with an estimated 29.2 million at the end of 2009. According to a 2003 report by Human Rights Watch, an estimated 15 million children in <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> in India work in slavery-like conditions to pay off their family's debts.|$|E
25|$|The law prohibits {{all forms}} of {{trafficking}} in persons; however, {{there were reports that}} persons were trafficked to, from, through, and within the country. Women from Russia, other countries of the former Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries were trafficked to the country for sexual exploitation and domestic servitude. They were recruited personally or answered advertisements and were flown to Korea, often with entertainer or tourist visas. In some instances, once these visa recipients arrived in the country, employers illegally held victims' passports. In addition some foreign women recruited for legal and brokered marriages with Korean men ended up in situations of sexual exploitation, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> and involuntary servitude once married. Korean women were trafficked primarily for sexual exploitation to the United States, sometimes through Canada and Mexico, as well as to other countries, such as Australia and Japan. Relatively small numbers of migrants seeking opportunities in the country were believed to have become victims of trafficking as well, although the MOL Employment Permit System reduced the number of workers trafficked into the country. There were reports that human traffickers exploited ROK passports for the purpose of human trafficking. There was no credible evidence that officials were involved in trafficking.|$|E
500|$|The phrase's literal use extends {{into the}} 21st century, with Sara Boyce of the Children's Law Centre in Northern Ireland drawing {{on it to}} {{advocate}} for the legal rights of the region's children. The 2008 book Child Labour in a Globalized World used the phrase {{to call attention to}} the role of <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> in child labor. Sara Dillon of Suffolk University Law School used the phrase [...] "What about the children" [...] in her 2009 book, International Children's Rights, to focus on child-labor program conditions. Benjamin Powell used the phrase differently in his book, Out of Poverty: Sweatshops in the Global Economy, writing that in the absence of child labor some youth faced starvation. In a 2010 book on human rights, Children's Rights and Human Development, child psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry used the phrase [...] "think of the children" [...] to urge clinicians to incorporate a process sensitive to developmental stages when counseling youth.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Debt</b> <b>bondage</b> is {{the most}} common form of slavery today. It is a {{condition}} in which a person “pledges him or herself against a loan of money, but the length and nature of the service is undefined, and the labor does not diminish the original debt.” [...] <b>Debt</b> <b>bondage</b> was included and defined as a form of slavery under the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery. However, its many modern forms continue to include pawning, peonage, and worker debt. In India, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> has been illegal since 1976; however, due to widespread poverty in the country, it continues to exist, as a man may need a loan to finance a wedding, funeral, medicine, fertilizer, or a fine. Because the interest rates on these debts as so high, debts are often inherited and children may replace their fathers or siblings. <b>Debt</b> <b>bondage</b> can also be incurred by specific industries – quarrying, carpet-making, agriculture, and fisheries – where the cost of equipment and supplies falls on the worker who needs a loan to pay for them.|$|E
2500|$|Sixteen Tons {{is a song}} by Tennessee Ernie Ford about <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> {{under the}} truck system among coal miners in Kentucky in the early 1900s. [...] The {{practice}} was since made illegal and is considered a form of labor trafficking.|$|E
2500|$|Liberal and neo-liberal market-based {{societies}} are predicated upon {{the concept of}} [...] "free labour" [...] - workers enter a labour market freely, and enter into contractual relations with employers voluntarily. [...] "Unfree labour" [...] - otherwise known as bond labour, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> debt peonage, and slavery, {{are thought to be}} archaic forms that will be eliminated with capitalist development. Anthropologists working {{in a wide variety of}} current situations have documented that the incidence of bonded labour is much greater than capitalist ideology would lead us to expect.|$|E
2500|$|Some Roman historians {{believed}} Servius Tullius {{responsible for}} Rome's earliest true, minted coinage, replacing an earlier and less convenient currency of raw bullion. This is unlikely, though {{he may have}} introduced the official stamping of raw currency. Money played a minimal role in the Roman economy, which was almost entirely agrarian at this time. Debt and <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> however, were probably rife. The form of such debts had little resemblance to those of cash-debtors, compelled to pay interest to money-lenders on an advance of capital. Rather, wealthy landowners would make an [...] "advance loan" [...] of seed, foodstuffs or other essentials to tenants, clients and smallholders, {{in return for a}} promise of labour services. The terms of such [...] "loans" [...] compelled defaulters to sell themselves, or their dependants, to their creditor; or, if smallholders, to surrender their farm. Wealthy aristocratic landholders thus acquired additional farms and service for very little outlay. Dionysius claims that Servius paid such debts [...] "from his own purse", and forbade voluntary and compulsory <b>debt</b> <b>bondage.</b> In reality, these practices persisted well into the Republican era. Livy describes the distribution of land grants to poor and landless citizens by Servius and others as the political pursuit of popular support from citizens of little merit or worth.|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 Trafficking in Persons report {{described}} the United States as, [...] "a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> and forced prostitution." [...] Sexual {{slavery in the}} United States may occur in multiple forms and in multiple venues. Sex trafficking in the United States may be present in Asian massage parlors, Mexican cantina bars, residential brothels, or street-based pimp-controlled prostitution. The anti-trafficking community in the United States is debating the extent of sexual slavery. Some groups argue that exploitation {{is inherent in the}} act of commercial sex, while other groups take a stricter approach to defining sexual slavery, considering an element of force, fraud or coercion to be necessary for sex slavery to exist.|$|E
2500|$|Trafficking {{in human}} beings (also called human trafficking) is one method of obtaining slaves. Victims are {{typically}} recruited through deceit or trickery (such as a false job offer, false migration offer, or false marriage offer), sale by family members, recruitment by former slaves, or outright abduction. Victims are forced into a [...] "debt slavery" [...] situation by coercion, deception, fraud, intimidation, isolation, threat, physical force, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> or even force-feeding with drugs of abuse to control their victims. [...] "Annually, according to U.S. government-sponsored research completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries.

2500|$|An early {{study of}} <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> was Ann Laura Stoler's Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979 (1985). Stoler {{examined}} the tobacco plantations of the Deli Maatschappij, {{one of the}} most profitable Dutch colonial corporations of the 19th century. The Deli company imported large numbers of Chinese indentured labourers to Sumatra, Indonesia, where they were treated not as employees, but as contractors. As contractors they had to buy all their supplies at inflated prices from the company, take all the risks of cultivation and processing, and finally sell their tobacco to the company at prices it set. They were kept in perpetual debt, unable to change employers, in working conditions that resulted in extraordinarily high death rates. Jan Breman extended this analysis of the [...] "Coolie regulation" [...] (which allowed for indentured labour) to the Dutch mining industry in the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia).|$|E
2500|$|PROSECUTION: The TVPA {{authorized}} the US Government to strengthen efforts to prosecute traffickers including, {{but not limited}} to: Creating a series of new crimes on trafficking, forced labor, and document servitude that supplemented existing limited crimes related to slavery and involuntary servitude; and recognizing that modern-day slavery {{takes place in the}} context of fraud and coercion, as well as force, and is based on new clear definitions for both trafficking into sexual exploitation and labor exploitation: Sex trafficking was defined as, [...] "a commercial sex act that is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age". Labor trafficking was defined as, [...] "the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> or slavery".|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the decades}} {{at the end}} of the nineteenth century and {{beginning}} of the early twentieth, the power and influence of the zamindars fell and that of the jotedars rose. The shift was caused by a rent crisis that was sparked by nineteenth century tenancy legislation, and accelerated after the Great Depression. Jotedars began to make substantial profits and gain power in their villages through their two defining roles: grain or jute traders, and more importantly, creditors who extended loans to sharecroppers, agricultural labourers and ryots. The jotedars power in the commodity and credit markets translated directly into power over their tenants. They began to leverage their economic and social clout to [...] " [...] the land and occupancy rights of the [...] through both legal and coercive means". In a few districts in the southwest, such as Midnapore and 24Parganas, they were able to employ political means. However, their principal instruments of self-enrichment were a combination of <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> through the transfer of debts and mortgages, and parcel-by-parcel land-grabbing.|$|E
2500|$|Although this {{document}} provides the concrete definition of slavery, its definition {{is limited in}} the types of slavery it includes. Instead, it is descriptive of chattel slavery, most commonly understood as the plantation slavery in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, even though chattel slavery was significantly more widespread and was not limited to one country alone. It {{is for this reason that}} the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery was signed. It gives a more comprehensive definition of slavery to include <b>debt</b> <b>bondage,</b> serfdom, or any practice where a woman is promised or given into marriage on payment of money and is without the right to refuse the marriage, the husband of a woman has the right to transfer her to another person, a woman is liable to be inherited by another upon the death of her husband, or any practice where a child under 18 years of ages is exploited for his or her labour. [...] The 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery came into force on April 30, 1957 and of 2002 there were 97 states partied to the convention.|$|E
2500|$|Bengal's {{economy was}} {{predominantly}} agrarian. For {{at least a}} decade before the crisis, between half and three quarters of those dependent on agriculture were already at near subsistence level. Underlying causes of the famine included inefficient agricultural practices, dense population, and de-peasantisation through <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> and land grabbing. Proximate causes comprise localised natural disasters (a cyclone, storm surges and flooding, and rice crop disease) and at least five consequences of war: initial, general war-time inflation of both demand-pull and monetary origin; loss of rice imports due to the Japanese occupation of Burma (modern Myanmar); near-total disruption of Bengal's market supplies and transport systems by the preemptive, defensive scorched earth tactics of the Raj (the [...] "" [...] for rice and boats); and later, massive inflation brought on by repeated policy failures, war profiteering, speculation, and perhaps hoarding. Finally, the government prioritised military and defense needs over those of the rural poor, allocating medical care and food immensely in the favour of the military, labourers in military industries, and civil servants. All of these factors were further compounded by restricted access to grain: domestic sources were constrained by emergency inter-provincial trade barriers, while access to international sources was largely denied by the War Cabinet of Great Britain. The relative impact of each of these contributing factors to the death toll and economic devastation is still a matter of controversy. Different analyses frame the famine against natural, economic, or political causes.|$|E
2500|$|Sweatshops {{are also}} {{sometimes}} implicated in human trafficking when {{workers have been}} tricked into starting work without informed consent, or when workers are kept at work through <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> or mental duress, {{all of which are}} more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor. Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries. Sometimes penal labor facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label. Sweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective. In 2014 Apple was caught [...] "failing to protect its workers" [...] in one of its Pegatron factories. Overwhelmed workers were caught falling asleep during their 12-hour shifts and an undercover reporter had to work 18 days in a row. [...] Sweatshops in question carry characteristics such as compulsory pregnancy tests for female laborers and terrorization from supervisors into submission. Workers then go into a state of forced labor, if even one day of work is not accounted for, most are immediately fired. These working conditions have been the source of suicidal unrest within factories in the past. Chinese sweatshops known to have increased numbers of suicidal employees have suicide nets covering the whole site, in place to stop over-worked and stressed employees leaping to their deaths.|$|E
50|$|<b>Debt</b> <b>bondage</b> was {{widespread}} in ancient Greece. The only city-state {{known to have}} abolished it is Athens, {{as early as the}} Archaic period under the debt reform legislation of Solon.

By the Hellenistic period, the limited evidence indicates that <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> had replaced outright enslavement for debt.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Debt</b> <b>bondage</b> was [...] "quite normal" [...] in {{classical}} antiquity.

In the Greco-Roman world, <b>debt</b> <b>bondage</b> was a distinct legal category into which a free person might fall, in theory temporarily, distinguished from the pervasive practice of slavery, which included enslavement as a result of defaulting on debt.
