While TOP 09 supports the Fiscal Compact, they have said they will only support ratification if the Czech Republic declares itself bound by all provisions of the treaty immediately, rather than once they adopt the euro. In February 2015 the Czech government introduced bills which would enact some provisions of the Fiscal Compact into Czech law. [...] A constitutional amendment was also proposed to embed the provisions in the Czech constitution. [...] The draft reform package would introduce a debt rule for the general government as a whole as well as separately for local governments, transpose into national legislation crucial elements of Council Directive 2011/85/EU on budgetary frameworks, implement a modified <b>expenditure</b> <b>rule</b> {{that is consistent with}} the Medium-Term Objective, establish an independent fiscal council and provisions to improve transparency and fiscal data reporting.

The estimation of separate fiscal policy reaction functions in good and bad times reveals that, controlling for other factors, the average stance of fiscal policy is expansionary when output is above potential, thus denoting a pro-cyclical bias in good times, while no strong evidence of a cyclical bias is found in bad times. The separate estimation of reaction functions for revenue and expenditure policy indicates that this pro-cyclical bias is an entirely expenditure-driven phenomenon. Probit regressions also reveal {{that the risk of}} pro-cyclicality in good times stems from expenditure behaviour, since expenditure-based budgetary adjustment is a highly significant determinant of the probability of pro-cyclical fiscal policy in good times.

40|$|The {{enhanced}} Stability and Growth Pact {{calls on}} euro area members and aspirants to set boundaries to fiscal deficits through high-level legislation. A {{limit on the}} deficit, such as the deficit ceiling in Bulgaria''s organic budget law, serves to protect solvency. The recent crisis clearly indicated that the key challenges are not only to contain the deficit but also to avoid a procyclical stance during upswings and to build a buffer for rainy days. Ideally, fiscal policymaking is guided by a fiscal rule that adapts through the economic cycle. This paper lays out the objectives of fiscal rules and analyzes how these objectives can be met in Bulgaria through either a growth-adjusted balance rule or an <b>expenditure</b> <b>rule</b> complemented by a deficit ceiling.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the link between}} the deficit bias in public finance and institutional settings. The Polish experience is put in a wider context and provides an extensive discussion of possible institutional reforms that may be implemented to stabilise the path of fiscal policy and reduce the deficit bias. Although substantial improvements have been made in Poland with respect to fiscal transparency standards set by the IMF and EU there is still much scope for enhancement. The recommended change in fiscal policy would involve the implementation of medium-term budgetary framework that would ensure consistency between the budgetary process and medium-term fiscal goals. This should be accompanied by the introduction of binding constraints on fiscal policy. The <b>expenditure</b> <b>rule</b> could be reintroduced to strengthen fiscal discipline, as it could force policymakers to tighten fiscal policy. It seems to be indispensable to maintain fiscal rules at the local government level. The issue of still limited fiscal transparency and unsatisfactory performance of fiscal rules requires the undertaking of various appropriate measures to strengthen the policy framework in Poland. This can be done in our view by involving external institution entitled to examine fiscal transparency and the performance of fiscal rules in the budgetary process. We think that the institution that is fully capable {{to take the lead in}} this respect is the NIK, which was granted full independence in 1994 and has since proved to be successful in overseeing public finances.
