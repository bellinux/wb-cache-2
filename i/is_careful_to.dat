5|$|Russell <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> {{indicate}} that {{his support for}} nationalisation rests {{on the assumption that}} it can be accomplished under the auspices of a robust democracy, and that it may be safeguarded against statist tyranny. If either condition fail, then nationalisation is undesirable. In delivering this warning, Russell emphasises the distinction between ownership and control. He points out that nationalisation – which would allow the citizens to collectively own an industry – would not guarantee any of them control over the industry. In the same way, shareholders own parts of companies, but the control of the company ultimately rests with the CEO (Russell 1938:235).|$|E
5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When {{the camp is}} completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E

25|$|The survey asks {{questions}} about direct attacks on journalists {{and the media}} {{as well as other}} indirect sources of pressure against the free press. RWB <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> note that the index only deals with press freedom, and does not measure the quality of journalism. Due {{to the nature of the}} survey's methodology based on individual perceptions, there are often wide contrasts in a country's ranking from year to year.|$|E
25|$|Others who end {{up under}} her care expose more of her personality. In Chamber of Secrets, Hermione {{ends up in the}} {{hospital}} wing for a month after a mishap with the Polyjuice Potion leaves her half-feline. Pomfrey <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> keep this a secret. In Order of the Phoenix, after Umbridge's henchmen stun McGonagall, Madam Pomfrey says she would resign in protest were she not afraid of what would become of the students without her presence. In Half-Blood Prince, she attempts to heal Bill of his scars from Greyback's attack without much success, and bursts into tears when she hears of Dumbledore's death. In Deathly Hallows, she and Filch oversee the evacuation of Hogwarts before the battle. She is later seen tending to the injured fighters.|$|E
25|$|From there, the Pelasgians {{dispersed}} to Crete, the Cyclades, Histaeotis, Boeotia, Phocis, Euboea, {{the coast}} along the Hellespont and the islands, especially Lesbos, {{which had been}} colonized by Macar son of Crinacus. Most went to Dodona and eventually being driven from there to Italy then called Saturnia. They landed at Spina {{at the mouth of}} the Po River. Still others crossed the Apennine Mountains to Umbria and being driven from there went to the country of the Aborigines. These consented to a treaty and settled them at Velia. They and the Aborigenes took over Umbria but were dispossessed by the Tyrrhenians. The author continues to detail the tribulations of the Pelasgians and then goes on to the Tyrrhenians, whom he <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> distinguish from the Pelasgians.|$|E

25|$|Rome's own gladiatorial {{contests}} began some 40 years later. The Samnite, {{borrowed from}} the Campanians, was the earliest of the gladiator types and the model upon which later classes were based. The Samnite gladiators were also the first {{of at least three}} gladiator classes (list of Roman gladiator types) to be based on ethnic antecedents; other examples were the Gauls and the Thracians. These gladiators fought with the signature war equipment and in the martial style of ethnic groups who had been conquered by Rome, thus appropriating their source culture for the mocking milieu of the Roman games. Gladiators who fought as any particular type did not necessarily hail from that ethnic background; the tombstone of a gladiator named Thelyphus <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> point out that he fought as a Samnite but was really a Thracian.|$|E
500|$|In {{reference}} to Fenrir's presentation in the Prose Edda, Andy Orchard theorizes that [...] "the hound (or wolf)" [...] Garmr, Sköll, and Hati Hróðvitnisson were originally simply all Fenrir, stating that [...] "Snorri, characteristically, <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> make distinctions, naming the wolves who devour {{the sun and}} moon as Sköll and Hati Hróðvitnisson respectively, and describing an encounter between Garm and Týr (who, one would have thought, might like to get his hand on Fenrir) at Ragnarök." ...|$|E
500|$|Adding {{a further}} wrinkle {{to the nature}} of quantum reality, Herbert {{presents}} the EPR paradox, and its resolution in the form of Bell's theorem. The EPR paradox, resting on the long-held assumption of locality, suggests the existence of [...] "elements of reality"—unmeasured quantum attributes which are nonetheless real—which are not predicted by quantum theory. Bell's theorem resolves this paradox by proving that locality is ruled out by observation—that any model of reality consistent with observation must allow for non-local interaction. However, Herbert <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> note, Bell's theorem does not entail any prediction of experimentally observable non-local phenomena, nor does it allow for superluminal communication.|$|E

500|$|Like Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, {{the story}} of The Flopsy Bunnies is about rabbits intruding upon the human domain and {{bringing}} the threat {{of death and destruction}} upon themselves by their own imprudence. M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh indicates in Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code that the tale's principal theme is the trickster animal, though she <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> point out that, even then, the animals are subordinate to the exquisite garden backgrounds. The reader's interest in the tale, she believes, lies in following the joke played upon McGregor rather than in the dull personalities of the rabbits. Although the trickster qualities of the rabbits are evident but muted in the earlier Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, in Flopsy Bunnies these qualities are brought to center stage. Kutzer notes that The Flopsy Bunnies belongs not to the title characters but to their parents [...] it is they who save the baby bunnies [...] and thus the story is often of less interest to children.|$|E

2500|$|A sincere {{advocate}} of popular aesthetics, Shusterman <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> distinguish his stance from one-sided apologia and would rather characterize it as ‘melorism’ which “recognizes popular art’s flaws and abuses {{but also its}} merits [...] that popular art should be improved because it can and often does achieve real aesthetic merits and serve worthy social ends”.|$|E

He keeps a picture of the floor of the old Boston Garden in his kitchen. Walton joined the Celtics broadcast crew for a West Coast road trip in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the film}} depicts the Alliance as an all-powerful, authoritarian-style regime, Whedon <b>is</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> {{point out that}} it is not so simple as that. [...] "The Alliance isn't some evil empire", he explains, but rather a largely benevolent bureaucratic force. The Alliance's main problem is that it seeks to govern everyone, {{regardless}} of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not. What the crew of Serenity represent—specifically Mal and his lifestyle—is the idea that people {{should have the right to}} make their own decisions, even if those decisions are bad.|$|E
