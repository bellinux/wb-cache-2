25|$|Currently, as of March 2012, {{the need}} for a set of unified privacy {{policies}} has been met by the European Union with proposed legislation. The Data Protection Regulation is a proposed set of consistent regulations across the European Union that will protect Internet users from clandestine tracking and unauthorized personal <b>data</b> <b>usage.</b> This regulation will further protect users' privacy rights in two key ways: clearly defining the term “personal data” and increasing punishments for those who violate users' online privacy. In Article 4(2) of the proposed legislation, the definition of personal data is expanded significantly to include any information online that could be traced to an individual. In Articles 77 and 79 of the proposed legislation, appropriate punishments are outlined for many possible violations of users' privacy rights by controllers and effective enforcement of data protection is guaranteed. The Data Protection Regulation will also hold companies accountable for violations of the regulation by implementing a unified legislation outlining specific repercussions for various types of violations based on severity.|$|E

The paper also aimed to emphasize the analysis of cost-benefit and the correlation between the journal impact factors and the <b>usage</b> <b>data.</b> In this study experiences of Ferdowsi University library on licensing and usage of electronic resources was evaluated by providing a cost-benefit analysis based on the cost and usage statistics of electronic resources. Vendor-provided data were also compared with local <b>usage</b> <b>data.</b> The <b>usage</b> <b>data</b> were collected by tracking web-based access locally, and by collecting vender-provided <b>usage</b> <b>data.</b> The data sources were one-year of vendor-supplied e-resource <b>usage</b> <b>data</b> such as Ebsco, Elsevier, Proquest, Emerald, Oxford and Springer and local <b>usage</b> <b>data</b> collected from the Ferdowsi university web server. The study found that actual usage values differ for vendor-provided <b>data</b> and local <b>usage</b> <b>data.</b> Elsevier has got the highest usage degree in searches, sessions and downloads. Statistics also showed that a small number of journals satisfy significant amount of use while the majority of journals were used less frequent and some were never used at all. The users preferred the PDF rather than HTML format. The data in subject profile suggested that the provided e-resources were best suited to certain subjects. There was no correlation between IF and electronic journal use. Monitoring the usage of e-resources gained increasing importance for acquisition policy and budget decisions.

40|$|Mobile {{handheld}} {{devices such}} as smart cellular phones are easily lost or stolen because of their small sizes and high mobility. Personal data such as addresses and messages stored in the devices may be revealed when the devices are lost. Handheld devices must include rigorous and convenient handheld data protection in case the devices are lost or stolen. This research proposes a novel approach for handheld data protection by using handheld <b>usage</b> <b>data</b> mining, which consists of five steps: (i) <b>usage</b> <b>data</b> gathering, (ii) <b>usage</b> <b>data</b> preparation, (iii) <b>usage</b> pattern discovery, (iv) usage pattern analysis and visualization, and (v) usage pattern applications. Handheld <b>usage</b> <b>data</b> is collected before applying this method. Usage patterns are discovered and saved by using finite automaton, which is then used to check device usage. When an unusual usage pattern such as an unlawful user trying to access the handheld data is detected, the device will automatically lock itself down until an action, such as entering a password, is taken. Experimental results show this method is effective and convenien...|$|R

There was much public criticism and disappointment at the instability and general slowness {{of the newly}} introduced plan. The plan was advertised with unlimited <b>data</b> <b>usage</b> and maximum speed. However, it was not clearly stated on advertisements {{that there was a}} fair use policy and traffic management that restricted users to a download limit between 4pm and 12am. If one were to continually exceed this limit, they would be placed in a [...] "download pool", or contacted with offers to switch to another plan. This triggered a lot of media attention and an investigation was launched. By 22 February 2007, Telecom decided to refund all of its Go Large customers (approximately 60,000) with amounts of at least $130 per customer. This had been caused in part by the overwhelming complaints and criticisms Telecom Xtra had received due to under-delivering on the promises of the Go Large plan. It is speculated that the refund may have cost Telecom Xtra between NZ$7.5 and 8.5 million.|$|E
