5|$|Chip Diller – Landis {{receives}} {{a letter from}} Diller, who is currently serving as a missionary in Africa. He recalls how he was prevented from going to Vietnam as {{his father was a}} prime donor to several right-wing political campaigns. When he learned of Doug Neidermeyer's fragging in Vietnam, he <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> alcoholism and despair. When he began seeing Jesus in his food, he became a born-again Christian and <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> his current profession as minister and missionary.|$|E
5|$|Despite these changes, {{and many}} other minor ones, The Scout Association <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a decline through the 1990s with falling {{membership}} levels. This spurred a major review into {{the causes of the}} decline in 1999.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century the {{practice}} <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> decline, {{when it was}} discovered that the principal active agent in tobacco smoke, nicotine, is poisonous.|$|E

50|$|The most {{influential}} of all such authors was Alfred Wainwright whose Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells series has sold {{in excess of}} 2 million copies, being in print continuously since the first volume was published in 1952. Wainwright divided the <b>fells</b> <b>into</b> seven geographical areas, each surrounded by valleys and low passes. While any such division must be arbitrary — and later writers have deviated {{to a greater or}} lesser extent from this blueprint — Wainwright's sevenfold division remains the best known partitioning of the <b>fells</b> <b>into</b> 'sub ranges', each with its own characteristics. The Far Eastern Fells are one of these divisions, covered by volume 2 of Wainwright's work.|$|R
25|$|The North-Western Fells {{occupy the}} area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, {{elongated}} on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the <b>fells</b> <b>into</b> three convenient groups. Dale Head is the highest fell in the southern sector.|$|R
5|$|In 1953 the {{spectacular}} headland, 'Da Horn o Papa' <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the sea during a storm. The nearby islet of Brei Holm also has caves {{that can be}} accessed by small boats when conditions permit.|$|E
5|$|When British troops left Malta in 1979, {{the fort}} was {{abandoned}} and <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> {{a state of}} disrepair. Parts of it were also vandalized. At some point it was also used as a desalination plant.|$|E
5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E
25|$|The North Western Fells {{occupy the}} area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, {{elongated}} on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the <b>fells</b> <b>into</b> three convenient groups. The central sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and Newlands Pass, includes Outerside.|$|R

5|$|After being decommissioned, Fort Manoel was {{abandoned}} and <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> {{a state of}} disrepair. Parts of it were also vandalized. In 1970, the Royal Malta Yacht Club acquired part of the fort as its club house, and the yacht club remained there until it acquired new premises in Ta' Xbiex in 2008.|$|E
5|$|After {{her husband}} <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> captivity, Constance {{announced}} her intention {{to administer the}} principality, but most Antiochene noblemen preferred a male ruler. BaldwinIII of Jerusalem hurried to Antioch and declared Constance's fifteen-year-old son, Bohemond III, the lawful prince, charging Patriarch Aimery with {{the administration of the}} principality. Constance did not accept Baldwin's decision and protested against it to Emperor Manuel.|$|E
25|$|The North Western Fells {{occupy the}} area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, {{elongated}} on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the <b>fells</b> <b>into</b> three convenient groups. The central sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and Newlands Pass, includes Whiteless Pike.|$|R
50|$|Unusually {{for areas}} of high fell, the North Western Fells are traversed by two roads. Both cross east to west, {{connecting}} the bordering valleys. Newlands Pass runs from Braithwaite village to Buttermere while Whinlatter Pass takes a more northerly route from Braithwaite to High Lorton. These passes divide the North Western <b>Fells</b> <b>into</b> three sectors.|$|R
50|$|The order <b>fell</b> quickly <b>into</b> {{oblivion}} {{after the}} death of its founder.|$|R
5|$|After {{her second}} husband <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> captivity around 11601161, Constance wanted to rule Antioch alone, but BaldwinIII of Jerusalem {{declared}} her fifteen-year-old son, Bohemond III, the lawful prince. Constance disregarded this declaration and {{took control of the}} administration of the principality with the assistance of Emperor Manuel. Constance was dethroned in favor of her son shortly before her death.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Gasparo's {{reputation}} <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> oblivion {{caused by}} unfavourable secular criticism. His complex artistic personality and catalog of works were only reconstructed {{from the end}} of the twentieth century, thanks to targeted critical studies that have for the first time allowed a thorough analysis and rediscovery of his works.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} in August 1299, Lamberton was Guardian of Scotland and Nicholas became his close associate. Nicholas {{can be seen}} to have benefited as a result. He became Chancellor of Scotland by 30 January 1301. Balmyle's pension for being Chancellor was to be paid by Arbroath Abbey, for which the abbey later <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> arrears.|$|E

25|$|The North Western Fells {{occupy the}} area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, {{elongated}} on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the <b>fells</b> <b>into</b> three convenient groups. Lord's Seat is {{the hub of the}} most northerly sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and the Vale of Embleton.|$|R

5|$|After the {{expulsion}} of the Jesuit order from Spanish territories in 1767, most Jesuit reductions in South America were abandoned and <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> ruins. The former Jesuit missions of Chiquitos are unique because these settlements and their associated culture have survived largely intact.|$|E
5|$|Although {{repairs to}} the chapel were {{carried out by the}} last Baron Hylton and the {{successive}} owners in the 19th century, it <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> disrepair until, like the castle, it was taken over by the state in 1950.|$|E
5|$|As {{the castle}} was disused from the mid-15th century it <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> dilapidation, and {{antiquarian}} depictions from the 18th century show Gleaston {{in a state}} of ruin. Though it is not open to the public, it {{has been the subject of}} historical and archaeological investigation in the 20th and 21st centuries.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{well you}} did it," [...] Polani said heartily. [...] "I trust {{that the man}} you <b>felled</b> <b>into</b> the water is he who {{is the author of}} this outrage. I do not think I need seek far for him. My suspicions point very {{strongly}} in one direction, and tomorrow I will lay the matter before the council and demand reparation." ...|$|R
5|$|At Thap Kaew, ML Pin also {{arranged}} {{for the construction of}} the Sound Library, a remotely accessible on-demand audio collection. King Bhumibol Adulyadej donated recordings of his speeches to the library, and later remote access via radio from Bangkok was developed, but the library was not maintained after ML Pin's presidency ended and thus <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> disuse.|$|E
5|$|Banagher {{was once}} a main centre for river {{transportation}} on the Shannon system. River transportation <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> decline {{with the advent of}} rail and road transportation improvements. Banagher is still a major centre for river cruisers, with a number of hire companies operating from an extensive and modern marina.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leading the}} final sortie by the castle garrison, Zrinski ordered a fuse be lit to the powder magazine. After cutting {{down the last}} of the {{defenders}} the besiegers poured into the fortress. The Ottoman Army entered the remains of Szigetvár and <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the booby trap; thousands perished in the blast when the castle's magazine exploded.|$|E
60|$|Billy turned {{round with}} a start, {{and in doing}} so <b>fell</b> headlong <b>into</b> the sea.|$|R
60|$|Niccolo {{reached down}} the finely-wrought coat, which <b>fell</b> {{together}} <b>into</b> {{little more than}} two handfuls.|$|R
