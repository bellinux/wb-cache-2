5|$|The {{most famous}} {{piece of music}} {{influenced}} by astrology is the orchestral suite The Planets. Written by the British composer Gustav Holst (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of The Planets <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> the astrological symbolism of the planets. Each of the seven movements of the suite <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> a different planet, though the movements {{are not in the}} order of the planets from the Sun. The composer Colin Matthews wrote an eighth movement entitled Pluto, the Renewer, first performed in 2000. In 1937, another British composer, Constant Lambert, wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called Horoscope. In 1974, the New Zealand composer Edwin Carr wrote The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment for orchestra without strings. Camille Paglia acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism Sexual Personae (1990).|$|E

The method of allocating credits to Force powers was designed with a role-playing video game style in mind, allowing the player the choice of which powers to improve. Chin said in an early interview that progress in the game <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> the abilities the player develops.|$|E

5|$|Following {{historical}} sources, Shepseskare was traditionally {{believed to}} have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted {{only a few months}} at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>upon</b> a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E
