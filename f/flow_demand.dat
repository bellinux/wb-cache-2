There should be a minimum flow of 10 L/min. The delivered FIO2 (Inhalation volumetric fraction of molecular oxygen) of this system is 60-80%, depending on the oxygen flow and breathing pattern.Another type of device is a humidified high flow nasal cannula which enables flows exceeding a patient's peak inspiratory <b>flow</b> <b>demand</b> to be delivered via nasal cannula, thus providing FIO2 of up to 100% because there is no entrainment of room air, even with the mouth open. [...] This also allows the patient to continue to talk, eat and drink while still receiving the therapy. This type of delivery method is associated with greater overall comfort, and improved oxygenation and respiratory rates than with face mask oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Pressure. In {{a typical}} pressure-compensated pump, the swash plate angle is {{adjusted}} through {{the action of}} a valve which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous pump output flow is exactly enough to maintain a designated pressure. If the load flow increases, pressure will momentarily decrease but the pressure-compensation valve will sense the decrease and then increase the swash plate angle to increase pump output flow so that the desired pressure is restored. In reality most systems use pressure as a control {{for this type of}} pump. The operating pressure reaches, say, 200 bar (20 MPa or 2900 psi) and the swash plate is driven towards zero angle (piston stroke nearly zero) and with the inherent leaks in the system allows the pump to stabilise at the delivery volume that maintains the set pressure. As demand increases the swash plate is moved to a greater angle, piston stroke increases and the volume of fluid increases; if the demand slackens the pressure will rise, and the pumped volume diminishes as the pressure rises. At maximum system pressure the output is once again almost zero. If the fluid demand increases beyond the capacity of the pump to deliver, the system pressure will drop to near zero. The swash plate angle will remain at the maximum allowed, and the pistons will operate at full stroke. This continues until system flow-demand eases and the pump's capacity is greater than demand. As the pressure rises the swash-plate angle modulates to try to not exceed the maximum pressure while meeting the <b>flow</b> <b>demand.</b>|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{superior}} long-term patency of arterial grafts, surgeons are often {{reluctant to use}} arterial grafts on coronary vessels that supply large areas of myocardium because postoperative shock may occur. We hypothesized that supramaximal flow through small arterial conduits would decrease distal intraluminal pressure, thereby reducing afterload on the smooth muscle and rendering the arterial graft vulnerable to spasm. Fourteen internal thoracic and eight gastroepiploic arteries were harvested from adult pigs (220 to 250 pounds). Arteries were mounted on a computer-controlled perfusion system with inflow pressure at 80 mm Hg and outflow resistance adjusted to simulate normal (in situ) or supramaximal (coronary artery bypass graft) <b>flow</b> <b>demands.</b> Artery pressures and flow rates were measured at baseline and after norepinephrine {{was added to the}} system. Internal thoracic arteries had no hemodynamic response to norepinephrine at normal flow. Under supramaximal <b>flow</b> <b>demands,</b> large internal thoracic arteries (2. 5 to 3. 0 mm) had no hemodynamic response to norepinephrine. However, for small internal thoracic arteries (2. 1 to 2. 9 mm), norepinephrine reduced distal internal thoracic arterial pressure (63. 2 ± 2. 2 to 27. 0 ± 1. 9 mm Hg) and flow rate (99. 4 ± 5. 0 to 45. 4 ± 2. 7 ml/min, median effective dose = 9. 12 x 10 − 9 mol/L). Under normal <b>flow</b> <b>demands,</b> the <b>flow</b> rate in gastroepiploic arteries (1. 0 to 2. 0 mm diamet decreased (14. 1 ± 0. 5 to 4. 8 ± 0. 8 ml/min, p < 0. 05) only at high concentrations of norepinephrine (median effective dose = 1. 26 × 10 − 6 mol/L). Supramaximal <b>flow</b> <b>demands</b> reduced distal gastroepiploic arterial pressure (77. 5 ± 0. 5 to 49. 5 ± 3. 8 mm Hg, p < 0. 05), which resulted in a greater decrease in flow rate (80. 0 ± 3. 7 to 6. 8 ± 1. 6 ml/min, p < 0. 05) at lower concentrations of norepinephrine, (median effective dose = 3. 24 × 10 − 8 mol/L, p < 0. 05). In four studies in internal thoracic arteries and eight in gastroepiploic arteries, arteries were cut in half, reattached, and reperfused. The proximal half of the internal thoracic artery did not respond to norepinephrine, but the distal half had a 53 % ± 7 % decrease in flow. Both gastroepiploic artery halves reacted and flow rate decreased by 88 % ± 2 % (proximal half) and 89 % ± 3 % (distal half). In conclusion, small arterial conduits develop large transconduit pressure gradients under supramaximal <b>flow</b> <b>demands.</b> Under these conditions, arteries are very sensitive to vasoconstrictors and flow may cease with higher drug concentrations. Myocardial failure after arterial bypass grafting to coronary vessels supplying large amounts of myocardium may result from an increased sensitivity to vasoconstriction leading to graft spasm and myocardial ischemia...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel observer-based {{techniques for}} {{the estimation of}} flow demands in gas networks, from sparse pressure telemetry. A completely observable model is explored, constructed by incorporating difference equations that assume the flow demands are steady.

Two techniques for constructing robust observers are employed: robust eigenstructure assignment and singular value assignment. These techniques help to reduce {{the effects of the}} system approximation. Modelling error may be further reduced by making use of known profiles for the flow demands. The theory is extended to deal successfully with the problem of measurement bias. The pressure measurements available are subject to constant biases which degrade the <b>flow</b> <b>demand</b> estimates, and such biases need to be estimated. This is achieved by constructing a further model variation that incorporates the biases into an augmented state vector, but now includes information about the <b>flow</b> <b>demand</b> profiles in a new form...|$|E
