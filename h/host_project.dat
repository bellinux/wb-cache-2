The Council obtained an initial development grant of £16,000 in April 2012, with the obligation to contribute £100,000. The second phase bid {{for the remainder of}} the funding would take place in November 2013. The renovation would take place between April and August 2014 and would include four webcams to relay views of sea front activity, plus a fifth to relay an interior view of the clock workings. There would be LED fairy lights to highlight the tower all year round as a night-time attraction. The lottery bid required the creation of a Friends of Herne Bay Clock Tower group of volunteers to [...] "educate, promote and conserve" [...] on behalf of the building. Their activities would be centred at the old Pier Trust Gallery, which would become a shop, information and exhibition centre and workshop for the volunteers and visitors.

40|$|Aircraft gas-turbine engine designs {{have been}} pushed to ever higher levels of performance, {{primarily}} due to competition {{and the need for}} improved fuel efficiency. Such improved performance is possible primarily due to higher operating pressures and temperatures. The effect, however, has been a decrease in engine durability. In hot-section components- the combustor and turbine- the more hostile environments have accelerated damage and wear of parts, with associated dramatically increased maintenance costs. In the past, minimal efforts have been made to assure required durability due to technology advances being directed primarily toward improving performance., The activities of the NASA Turbine Engine Hot Section Technology (<b>HOST)</b> <b>Project</b> are directed toward durability needs, as defined by industry, and a more balanced approach to engine design.
