5000|$|The first {{movements}} of introspection {{put in an}} unintended appearance. The first he has ever had time for. The introspection begins in his uncertainty. He does not {{view it as a}} source of pleasure, or of distraction. It is a new kind of learning process, subtly resented, yet felt as valuable in not very definable ways. It is not the normal education, and is not accompanied by normal feelings of being educated. The underlying uncertainty never goes away. Is it really worth it? Is it worth the waste of talent? It is worth it for India to educate volunteers with her own great tasks undone? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> for the government of the United States to spend so much on so little practical return. But, most fundamentally, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> for the volunteer himself when he could really be doing things, worthwhile things, at Home? Is it worth the loss of earning power, of self-esteem, of confidence in one's own powers? What is there to show for the two slow, drawn-out years but a sense of one's own failure? Why is it necessary to see what one does see? ("You face what's there, and what's there isn't what you think or what you thought is there.") And how does it all end? Not in changing but in accepting. In waiting and not cursing the waiting. It means ignoring, not dealing with the problem. The worst way of handling a problem because it doesn't lead to a solution. It leads to nothing in the real world.This is the new kind of learning that takes place, the uncomfortable learning. The volunteer appreciates it and dislikes it. It is like a stolen thing: never one's own. A hostile thing: never giving one harmony. It never provides resolution, but is merely the source of new irresolutions. It is hard to explain to others who have not come along on the trip. It appears nowhere in Peace Corps recruitment or promises. It is lonely, self-conscious, isolating, conducive to lethargy, boring, disagreeable. But it sees things not seen before....As the problems pile up, they do not resolve themselves but end in withdrawal. The education which the volunteer is receiving does little to pull him out. It does not provide him with a new start. In fact, it brings on further lethargy. He learns that the doing of a thing and the experiencing of a thing are very different from the knowledge about a thing. Doing and experiencing have dimensions which cannot be contained by abstract knowledge or pure description. Control, for the first time, is uncertain, for knowledge does not yield control. The volunteer discovers the limits to what he can do. This is unsettling to the normal American. They are not the lessons one would consciously choose to learn, or care to continue. But there is no free choice in this kind of learning. It is forced upon one. And it is not without its own satisfaction.|$|E

Chris Tilly of IGN gave Evil Dead 9/10 and called the movie a [...] "terrifying, exhilarating and relentlessly entertaining new chapter in the Evil Dead story". [...] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a positive review, calling it a [...] "remake that will win the hearts of many of the original's fans." [...] Independent horror review site HorrorTalk gave the film four stars out of five saying it is [...] "the most unrelenting and bloody horror film to come out of a major studio in a very long time". [...] Emma Simmonds of The List commented, [...] "Evil Dead has ample cheap shocks and few bloodcurdling frights but it builds to something gorily bravura and, if that's your bag, you'll come away satisfied. It's a while before anyone picks up a chainsaw, but boy <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> when they do." [...] Matt Singer called the film [...] "an assault on the senses" [...] and [...] "a success, one that out-Evil Deads the original movie with even more gore, puke, blood, and dismembered limbs. It may not be wildly inventive, but it is effective, and plenty faithful to the spirit — and tagline — of the first 'Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror.'" ...|$|E
