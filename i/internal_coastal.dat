40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} {{trends in}} accumulated winter chill across the fruit growing region of central California and its <b>internal</b> <b>coastal</b> valleys. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} global warming is in motion in California and is causing accumulated winter chill to decrease across the fruit and nut growing regions of California. The detection of potential trends in accumulated winter chill (between 0 and 7. 2 °C) was determined using two complementary climate datasets. The California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) contains hourly climate data and is suitable for computing accumulated chill hours and chill degree-hours. But, its longest data records extend back only to the 1980 s. The National Weather Service Coop climate record is longer, extending beyond the 1950 s at many sites. But its datasets only contain information on daily maximum and minimum temperatures. To assess long term trends in winter chill accumulation, we developed an algorithm that converted information from daily maximum and minimum temperature into accumulated hours of winter chill and summations of chill-degree hours. These inferred calculations of chill hour accumulation were tested with and validated by direct measurements from hourly-based data from the CIMIS network. With the combine...|$|E

40|$|<b>Internal</b> {{waves and}} <b>coastal</b> {{upwelling}} have {{important roles in}} both physical oceanography and marine ecosystems, via processes such as mixing of water masses and transfer of heat and nutrients to biologically active layers. In this paper we use quasi-weekly hydrographic profiles and moored records of temperature, salinity and water velocity to investigate the nature of <b>internal</b> tides and <b>coastal</b> upwelling behaviour in northern Marguerite Bay at the western Antarctic Peninsula. Within Ryder Bay, a near-coastal site in northern Marguerite Bay, atmospherically-forced oscillations of the water column with periods around 2 - 7 days are observed, associated with wind-induced coastal upwelling and downwelling. Sea ice cover is seen {{to play a role}} in the seasonal suppression of these oscillations. Significant internal tides are also observed at this site. A range of processes are seen to be important in controlling internal tide variability, including changes in local stratification and sea ice conditions. Both diurnal and semi-diurnal internal tidal species are observed, despite the study region being poleward of the critical latitude for diurnal internal tides. This suggests that at least the diurnal internal tides are generated close to the study location, and we investigate likely sources.

The associated average diapycnal diffusivity in stratified water was 5 – 20 (3 1026 m 2 s 21), comparable to observed open-ocean thermocline values and too low to explain the strong variability observed in local water properties. Dissipation rates and diffusivity were both highly episodic. Turbulent boundary layers grew down from the surface and up from the bottom. The dissipation rate within the bottom boundary layer had an average of 1. 2 3 1027 W kg 21 and varied in magnitude with the strength of near-bottom flow from the barotropic tide, an along-shelf flow, and low-frequency internal waves. The average dissipation rate in the peak thermocline was 5 3 1028 W kg 21; one-half of the thermocline dissipation was due to the strong shear and strain within six solibores that cumulatively lasted less than a day but contained 100 -fold elevated dissipation and diffusivity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{stratigraphy}} of {{the last}} deglaciation sequence is investigated in Lake Saint-Jean (Québec Province, Canada) based on 300 [*]km of echo-sounder two dimensional seismic profiles. The sedimentary archive of this basin is documented from the Late Pleistocene Laurentidian ice-front recession to the present-day situation. Ten seismic units have been identified that reflect spatio-temporal variations in depositional processes characterizing different periods of the Saint-Jean basin evolution. During the postglacial marine flooding, a high deposition rate of mud settling, from proglacial glacimarine and then prodeltaic plumes in the Laflamme Gulf, produced an extensive, up to 50 [*]m thick mud sheet draping the isostatically depressed marine basin floor. Subsequently, a closing of the water body due to glacio-isostatic rebound occurred at 8. 5 cal. ka BP, drastically modifying the hydrodynamics. Hyperpycnal flows appeared because fresh lake water replaced dense marine water. River sediments were transferred towards the deeper part of the lake into river-related sediment drifts and confined lobes. The closing of the water body is also marked by the onset of a wind-driven <b>internal</b> circulation associating <b>coastal</b> hydrodynamics and bottom currents with sedimentary features including shoreface deposits, sediment drifts and a prograding shelf-type body. The fingerprints of a forced regression are well expressed by mouth-bar systems and by the shoreface-shelf system, the latter unexpected in such a lacustrine setting.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{response}} on the continental shelf of a baroclinic ocean to driving by an alongshore coastal wind stress and by barotropic and baroclinic wind forced interior motions is studied {{as a function}} of latitude. The relative excitation of continental shelf waves and internal Kelvin waves is studied. The response of a rotating stratified ocean with a vertical boundary, forced at the surface by an alongshore coastal wind stress, shows vertically propagating subinertial motions. Several examples which illustrate the basic properties of the response are presented. Changes in amplitude and frequency with depth are predicted. Components that decay with depth from the surface and components that represent <b>coastal</b> <b>internal</b> Kelvin waves with negative vertical group velocity and upward phase propagation are forced. The effect of bottom Ekman layer friction and slope topography on free internal Kelvin waves is examined, using both a steep and weak slope model. The steep slope represents the low latitude case while the weak slope represents the mid-latitude case. There are substantial differences between the results from the two models. Free waves are frictionally damped and offshore and vertical phase shifts are induced by friction, as well as an onshore flow. Topography induces changes to the wave frequency and alongshore phase speed. The modal amplitude is altered and an onshore flow is induced. Sea level and current velocity data from the equator to 17 °S on the west coast of South America show that low frequency (0. 1 - 0. 2 cpd) fluctuations propagate poleward with phase speeds similar to those predicted for first mode baroclinic Kelvin waves. The sea level and currents are coherent and approximately 1800 out of phase. The waves {{do not appear to be}} the result of local atmospheric forcing.

This model will in turn be used as input to a simple linear model for the modification to the mean flow across the coastline. Aim of Research In order to predict the modification of the wind field at a coastal discontinuity a description of the CIBL is required. The CIBL height (λ) is not an easily measured parameter and, although a number of models for this have been compared with experimental data (e. g. Gryning and Batchvarova 1996, Kallstrand and Smedman 1997, Melas and Kambezidis 1992), there is no particular consensus on the most appropriate model to use. Experiments relate to different stability, roughness and terrain conditions and models require varying complexity of input. The linear approach to wind flow modelling means that the effect on the mean wind field of changes in temperature stratification, roughness and terrain at the coastline can be considered separately. Results are generated rapidly and the aim is to run the model with minimal inputs. Both) (xλ and), (zxθ, the potential temperature profile, are required. Hence if these parameters can be related, so that the description of CIBL can be obtained from land based temperature and wind speed measurements only, then this may provide a simple and robust method of providing information to the wind flow model.

40|$|The <b>internal</b> {{structure}} of <b>coastal</b> foredunes from three sites {{along the north}} Norfolk coast has been investigated using ground-penetrating radar (GPR), which provides a unique insight into the internal {{structure of}} these dunes that cannot be achieved by any other non-destructive or geophysical technique. Combining geomorphological and geophysical investigations into the structure and morphology of these coastal foredunes has enabled a more accurate determination of their development and evolution. The radar profiles show the internal structures, which include foreslope accretion, trough cut and fill, roll-over and beach deposits. Foredune ridges contain large sets of low-angle cross-stratification from dune foreslope accretion with trough-shaped structures from cut and fill on the crest and rearslope. Foreslope accretion indicates sand supply from the beach to the foreslope, while troughs on the dune crest and rearslope are attributed to reworking by offshore winds. Bounding surfaces between dunes are clearly resolved and reveal the relative chronology of dune emplacement. Radar sequence boundaries within dunes have been traced below the water-table passing into beach erosion surfaces. These are believed to result from storm activity, which erodes the upper beach and dunes. In one example, at Brancaster, a dune scarp and erosion surface may be correlated with erosion in the 1950 s, possibly the 1953 storm. Results suggest that dune ridge development is intimately linked {{to changes in the}} shoreline, with dune development associated with coastal progradation while dunes are eroded during storms and, where beaches are eroding, a stable coast provides more time for dune development, resulting in higher foredune ridges. A model for coastal dune evolution is presented, which illustrates stages of dune development in response to beach evolution and sand supply. In contrast to many other coastal dune fields where the prevailing wind is onshore, on the north Norfolk coast, the prevailing wind is directed along the coast and offshore, which reduces the landward migration of sand dunes...|$|R

Α meteorological mast was installed at a distance less than 30 m from the shoreline, instrumented with a sonic anemometer and a fast krypton hygrometer at 14. 5 m height with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz, in order to measure the turbulent transport of mass and energy of the surface MABL. At the same mast slow response sensors (1 Hz) were also installed providing vertical profiles of wind speed and direction, temperature and humidity at three levels (3, 8 and 12 m). Satellite sea surface temperature images were also obtained. The spacial and temporal scales of the Aegean Pelagos have not been studied in the past while it is expected to present differences compared with those measured over oceans or open seas. It is worth to mention that this study is a follow-up of a previous study which took place during summer 2011 at Skyros island, northern Aegean provided similar measurements but with different fetch. During Karpathos campaign, more than of 120 hours stationary surface MABL observations of near neutral wind flows were recorded. The vertical profiles of temperature reveal the presence of a <b>coastal</b> <b>internal</b> boundary layer, mostly below 8 m height. Eddy correlation analysis is used to study the turbulent fluxes of mass and energy. According to first results on the stable MABL, momentum fluxes depend on stability and give increasing values with the wind speed. The estimated values are higher, almost by a factor of two, compared to typical values measured over the ocean. These increased values could be attributed to a developed sea state since wind stress is greater over young and developing wave fields. Sensible heat flux is found to be increased with stability and rather independent from wind speed while moisture flux seems to not be dependent neither to stability or wind speed. Some part of the records present upward heat fluxes under near neutral conditions and mostly for positive sea-air temperature differences, possibly associated with sea spray or mesoscale heterogeneity of the sea surface temperature.

The {{purposes of this}} current study were to investigate the consumption and the food sources of n- 3 FA in two groups of elderly men living in different geographic location (<b>coastal</b> and <b>internal</b> regions) of Saudi Arabia; and {{to examine the relationship}} between n- 3 FA intakes and non fatal myocardial infarction and the presence of risk factors for heart disease. ^ Total n- 3 FA intakes and the intakes of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were greater in residents in the <b>coastal</b> than the <b>internal</b> region (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Walnuts, salmon, canola oil, malabar cavalla and king mackerel were the top five foods contributing to the intake n- 3 FAs in the coastal region. Seafood was a major contributor to the intake of n- 3 FAs in the coastal region as three-fourths of the residents in this region consumed 5 – 7 seafood servings/week. ^ The top five foods contributing to the n- 3 FA intakes in the internal region were walnuts, lamb, whole milk, baked beans and chicken. After walnuts, the plant foods contributing the most to the intake of n- 3 FA in the internal region were zucchini squash, potato, spinach, cherries, cantaloupe, apple and baked beans provided a total of 0. 28 g/day. ^ Rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction, high serum cholesterol, and high blood pressure were higher in the <b>internal</b> than the <b>coastal</b> region, but differences were not significant. There was a negative correlation between n- 3 FA intakes and rates of non fatal myocardial infarction in both the coastal (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) and internal (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) regions. Results also indicate a negative correlation between n- 3 FA intakes and rates of high serum cholesterol in both regions (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). There was a negative correlation between n- 3 FA intakes and rates of high blood pressure in the coastal region (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), but not in the internal region. ^ In conclusion, in this study the food consumption patterns for n- 3 FAs differ by location. N- 3 FA intakes of elderly men living in the coastal region of Saudi Arabia were higher than those of men living in internal region of the country. Seafood consumption may be one of the reasons for higher intakes of n- 3 FA in the coastal region. However the food contributing the most to the intakes of n- 3 FA in both regions was walnuts.
