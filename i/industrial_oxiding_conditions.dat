EBSD-derived maps demonstrate that the oxide scale consists primarily of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) {{with a small amount of}} hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3) which scatters near the surface, at the oxide/steel interface and at the cracking edges. The results extracted from these maps reveal that there is a significant difference between the industrial and the laboratory oxide scales in their grain boundaries, phase boundaries, and texture evolutions. There are high proportions of special coincidence site lattice boundaries Σ 3 and Σ 13 b in the magnetite of the <b>industrial</b> <b>oxide</b> scale, rather than the lower orders of Σ 5, Σ 7, and Σ 17 b, which develop in the experimental oxide scale. Within the phase boundaries, the orientation relationships between the magnetite and the hematite correspond to the matching planes and directions { 111 }Fe 3 O 4 ||{ 0001 }α-Fe 2 O 3 and { 110 }Fe 3 O 4 ||{ 110 }α-Fe 2 O 3. Magnetite in both of these oxide scales develops a relatively weak { 001 } fiber texture component including a strong { 001 }〈 100 〉 cube and a slightly strong { 100 }〈 210 〉 texture components. Unlike the { 001 }〈 110 〉 rotated cube component in the experimental oxide scale, the magnetite in the <b>industrial</b> tertiary <b>oxide</b> scale develops a strong { 112 }〈 110 〉 and a relatively strong { 113 }〈 110 〉 and { 111 }〈 110 〉 texture components.

The hspX lies between acg and Rv 2030 c. However, {{the functions of the}} dosR regulated genes in vitro and in vivo are largely unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that deletion of hspX gene produced a mutant which grew faster in macrophages and in mice. In this study, we attempted to determine the functions of acg and Rv 2030 c by gene inactivation. We demonstrate that Rv 2030 c is dispensable for virulence and growth. However, deletion of acg produced a mutant which is attenuated in both resting and activated macrophages and in acute and persistent murine infection models. Surprisingly, deletion of acg did not compromise the viability of the mutant to nitrosative and oxidative stresses in vitro and in vivo. In addition, when the WT and the acg mutants were treated with antibiotics such as the prodrugs nitrofurantoin and nitrofuran, the acg mutant became more sensitive than the WT strain to these drugs.

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{investigation}} Mills and Riaz [1] showed that <b>industrial</b> <b>oxide</b> refractory corrosion by liquid oxides could {{be changed by}} {{the application of a}} small voltage across the liquid oxide-refractory interface. They explained their result in terms of penetration of the refractory pores with liquid oxide. Their analysis of the corrosion effect was to some degree limited by the use of an industrial refractory material in the study. Further, it was not clear whether their findings were limited to solely industrial refractories or had wider ranging application to more dense ceramic type solid oxide systems. In this study, a simpler and more easily characterized solid oxide (dense MgO) has been used {{to examine the effects of}} an applied voltage on the solid oxide in a liquid oxide melt. The dissolution rate of an MgO ceramic in a CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and CaO-SiO 2 - Fe 2 O 3 -FeO-MgO liquid oxide composition at various applied voltages has been measured at 1540 °C. It was found that the MgO corrosion in the CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 system was insensitive to an applied voltage over the voltage range – 0. 5 to 0. 3 V. In the CaO-SiO 2 -Fe 2 O 3 -FeO-MgO liquid oxide system the MgO corrosion rate showed a maximum at – 0. 45 V. This effect has been explained by considering the consequences of an applied voltage on the rate of Marangoni flow at the liquid oxide-refractory-gas interface and in turn, the flow effect on the rate of the mass transfer controlled MgO dissolution reaction...|$|R
