5|$|Late on {{the third}} day, Toshack {{was part of a}} rearguard Australian action that minimised England's first innings lead. He came to the crease at 9/403 to {{accompany}} Lindwall, featuring in a 55-run stand and lasting the final 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston running for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get Toshack on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so that he faced most of the balls. On the next morning of play, Toshack did not add to his score before Lindwall was dismissed and Australia ended at 458 in the third over of the day, leaving the tourists 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Toshack did not bowl in the second innings as England made 8/365 and set Australia a target of 404 for victory on the last day. Australia achieved the runs with seven wickets in <b>hand,</b> <b>setting</b> a new world record for the highest successful run-chase in Tests.|$|E

500|$|Palpatine/Darth Sidious is {{a central}} {{character}} in Genndy Tartakovsky's [...] micro-series, which is set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The character's likeness in the series is based on that in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, and he is voiced by Nick Jameson. In the first chapter, Palpatine is informed by Obi-Wan Kenobi that the Jedi have discovered that the InterGalactic Banking Clan has established battle droid factories on the planet Muunilinst. Palpatine agrees to send a strike force that includes Anakin Skywalker, and suggests that Anakin be given [...] "special command" [...] of Obi-Wan's fighters. Yoda and Obi-Wan initially speak against the idea, but reluctantly concede. In the seventh chapter, a holographic image of Sidious appears shortly after Dooku trains Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress. Sidious orders Ventress to track down and kill Anakin. He remarks to Dooku that Ventress is certain to be defeated, but that the point of her mission is to test Anakin. In the final chapters, a hologram of Sidious again appears and orders General Grievous to begin {{an assault on the}} galactic capital. Later, the Separatist invasion of Coruscant begins and Palpatine watches from his apartment in the 500 Republica. Grievous breaks through the Chancellor's window and attempts to kidnap him, leading to a long chase while Palpatine is protected by Jedi Shaak Ti, Roron Corobb and Foul Moudama. After Grievous apprehends the Jedi, Palpatine is taken on board the Invisible <b>Hand,</b> <b>setting</b> the stage for Revenge of the Sith.|$|E

40|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>set</b> uses press {{buttons and}} allows the choice of {{different}} coordinate systems and various degrees of freedom. A 3 -D sensor system (5) evaluates the position and movement of the <b>hand</b> <b>set</b> in all {{six degrees of freedom}} and this is directly converted into corresponding movement for the robot or robot arm. The sensor comprises a signal source and a signal receiver, which evaluates the received signal (effectively, the magnetic field of the source) and transmits the information to a microcomputer connected to the robot, where it is suitably processed. The relationship between <b>hand</b> <b>set</b> movement and robot movement is adjustable. ADVANTAGE - Complete control in all six degrees of freedom...|$|R

2500|$|The pass is {{the first}} of a team's 3 allowed contacts, and is also very similar on the beach and indoors. However, the {{standards}} for <b>hand</b> <b>setting</b> (handling the ball overhand using finger action with the hands separated) are stricter on the beach. In practice, this means that players are effectively forbidden from setting the ball on serve receive; similarly, players seldom use a <b>hand</b> <b>setting</b> motion as the first (except on a hard driven attack) or last of the three allowed team contacts. [...] Digging is a similar skill to passing, but the term is not used to describe receiving the serve or a free ball, but rather refers to an attempt to prevent an opponent's attack hit from touching the court.|$|E
2500|$|When pulse {{compression}} {{is carried out}} in digital signal processing, after the incoming signals are digitised by A/D converters, {{it is important that}} level of the noise floor is correctly set. [...] The noise floor at the A/D must be high enough to ensure that the noise is adequately characterised. [...] If the noise level is too low, Nyquist [...] will not be satisfied, and any embedded chirp will not be recovered correctly. [...] On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>setting</b> the noise level unnecessarily high will reduce the dynamic range capability of the system.|$|E
2500|$|The set is {{the second}} team contact, and its purpose is to {{position}} the ball for {{an attack on the}} third hit. [...] A <b>hand</b> <b>setting</b> motion is often used, but bump setting, an underhand motion in which the ball bounces off the forearms, is also common. When using the hand motion contact for the setting the player's hands must contact the ball simultaneously. If a referee determines that a double-hit has occurred, the point will be given to the other team. [...] Excessive spin after a ball has been set is often used as an indicator of a double contact fault, but causing a ball to spin while setting is not explicitly prohibited. After completing the contact, the setter typically turns his attention to the defense and communicates to his partner whether a blocker is up and which area of the court is open. [...] The second contact {{can also be used to}} attack the ball.|$|E

You run over the articles, and perceive at a glance {{that there is no}} kind of hope or use in her trying to do anything at literature; and then you ask yourself mentally, [...] "What is to be done with her?

6000|$|And now {{the little}} {{procession}} set off. Mr. Poyser {{was in his}} Sunday suit of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyser's own <b>hand,</b> <b>setting</b> off the proportions of his leg. Mr. Poyser {{had no reason to}} be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face, which was good humour itself as he said, [...] "Come, Hetty--come, little uns!" [...] and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway gate into the yard.|$|E
60|$|But as he {{drew near}} the house his heart sank a little, for he knew what a fury his wife would be in, and how she would abuse him for his absence. And it was even worse than he expected. However, long {{experience}} had taught him to let her storm and say nothing, so he lit his pipe and waited till she was tired out. The woman was still raging, and did not seem likely to stop, when her husband, who by this time had forgotten all about her, drew out the chest from under his cloak, and opened it. Oh, what a blaze met his eyes! gold and precious stones were heaped up to the very lid, and lay dancing in he sunlight. At the sight of these wonders even the scolding tongue ceased, and the woman approached, and took the stones in her <b>hand,</b> <b>setting</b> greedily aside those that were {{the largest and most}} costly. Then her voice softened, and she begged him quite politely to tell her where he had spent his evening, and how he had come by these wonderful riches. So he told her the whole story, and she listened with amazement, till he came to the choice which had been given him between the two chests. At this her tongue broke loose again, as she abused him for his folly in taking the little one, and she never rested till her husband had described the exact way which led to the sparrow-princess's house. When she had got it into her head, she put on her best clothes and set out at once. But in her blind haste she often missed the path, and she wandered for several hours before she at length reached the little house. She walked boldly up to the door and entered the room as if the whole place belonged to her, and quite frightened the poor girl, who was startled {{at the sight of her}} old enemy. However, she concealed her feelings as well as she could, and bade the intruder welcome, placing before her food and wine, hoping that when she had eaten and drunk she might take her leave. But nothing of the sort.|$|E
