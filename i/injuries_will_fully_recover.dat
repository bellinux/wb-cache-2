40|$|Introduction: As a {{consequence}} of a road traffic crash, persistent pain and disability following whiplash injury are common and incur substantial personal and economic costs. Up to 50 % of people who experience a whiplash <b>injury</b> <b>will</b> never <b>fully</b> <b>recover</b> and up to 30 % will remain moderately to severely disabled by the condition. The reason as to why symptoms persist past the acute to sub-acute stage and become chronic is unclear, but likely results from complex interactions between structural injury, physical impairments, and psychological and psychosocial factors. Psychological responses related to the traumatic event itself are becoming an increasingly recognised factor in the whiplash condition. Despite this recognition, there is limited knowledge regarding the effectiveness of psychological interventions, either delivered alone or in combination with physiotherapy, in reducing the physical and pain-related psychological factors of chronic whiplash. Pilot study results have shown positive results {{for the use of}} trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy to treat psychological factors, pain and disability in individuals with chronic whiplash. The results have indicated that a combined approach could not only reduce psychological symptoms, but also pain and disability. Aims: The primary aim of this randomised, controlled trial is to investigate the effectiveness of combined trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy, delivered by a psychologist, and physiotherapy exercise to decrease pain and disability of individuals with chronic whiplash and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The trial also aims to investigate the effectiveness of the combined therapy in decreasing post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression. Participants and setting: A total of 108 participants with chronic whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) grade II of > 3 months and < 5 years duration and PTSD (diagnosed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) according to the DSM- 5) will be recruited for the study. Participants will be assessed via phone screening and in person at a university research laboratory. Interventions will take place in southeast Queensland, Australia and southern Denmark. Intervention: Psychological therapy will be delivered once a week over 10 weeks, with participants randomly assigned to either trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy or supportive therapy, both delivered by a clinical psychologist. Participants will then receive ten sessions of evidence-based physiotherapy exercise delivered over a 6 -week period. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is neck disability (Neck Disability Index). Secondary outcomes focus on: pain intensity; presence and severity of PTSD (CAPS V and PTSD Checklist 5); psychological distress (Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale 21); patient perceived functionality (SF- 12, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, and Patient-Specific Functional Scale); and pain-specific self-efficacy and catastrophising (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and Pain Catastrophizing Scale). After psychotherapy (10 weeks after randomisation) and physiotherapy (16 weeks after randomisation), {{as well as at the}} 6 -month and 12 -month follow-ups, a blind assessor will measure the outcomes. Analysis: All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary and secondary outcomes that are measured will be analysed using linear mixed and logistic regression models. Any effect of site (Australia or Denmark) will be evaluated by including a site-by-treatment group-by-time interaction term in the mixed models analyses. Effect modification will only be assessed for the primary outcome of the Neck Disability Index. Discussion: This study will provide a definitive evaluation of the effects of adding trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy to physiotherapy exercise for individuals with chronic WAD and PTSD. This study is likely to influence the clinical management of whiplash <b>injury</b> and <b>will</b> have immediate clinical applicability in Australia, Denmark and the wider international community.

40|$|Introduction: Whiplash {{associated}} {{disorders are}} the most common non-hospitalised injuries following a road traffic crash. Up to 50 % of individuals who experience a whiplash <b>injury</b> <b>will</b> not <b>fully</b> <b>recover</b> and report ongoing pain and disability. Most recovery, if it occurs, takes place in the first 2 - 3 months post injury, indicating that treatment provided in the early stages is critical to long-term outcome. However, early management approaches for people with acute whiplash associated disorders are modestly effective. One reason may be that the treatments have been non-specific and have not targeted the processes shown to be associated with poor recovery, such as post-traumatic stress symptoms. Targeting and modulating these early stress responses in the early management of acute whiplash associated disorders may improve health outcomes. Early aggressive psychological interventions in the form of psychological debriefing may be detrimental to recovery and are now not recommended for management of early post-traumatic stress symptoms. In contrast, Stress Inoculation Training (SIT) is a cognitive behavioural approach that teaches various general problem-solving and coping strategies to manage stress-related anxiety (ie, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring and positive self-statements) and provides important information to injured individuals about the impact of stress on their physical and psychological wellbeing. While referral to a psychologist may be necessary in some cases where acute stress disorder or other more significant psychological reactions to stress are evident, in the case of acute whiplash injuries, it is neither feasible nor necessary for a psychologist to deliver the early stress modulation intervention to all injured individuals. The feasibility of using other specially trained health professionals to deliver psychological interventions has been explored in conditions such as chronic low back pain, chronic whiplash and cancer, but few trials have studied this approach in acute musculoskeletal conditions with the aim of preventing the development of chronic pain. As physiotherapy is the most common intervention received by individuals with a whiplash injury, physiotherapists are ideally placed to provide SIT in conjunction with standard physical rehabilitation. This study (StressModEx) will target individuals in the acute stage of injury and address the stress responses associated with the accident or injury (event-related distress) with the aim of improving both physical and mental health outcomes. Research question: Is SIT integrated with standard physiotherapy exercise and delivered by physiotherapists more effective than physiotherapy exercise alone in reducing neck pain and disability in individuals with acute whiplash associated disorders? Design: Parallel randomised controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment. Participants and setting: 100 individuals with grade II or III (no fracture/dislocation or neurological loss) acute whiplash associated disorder <  4 weeks duration and at least moderate neck pain-related disability and hyper-arousal symptoms will be recruited for the study. Participants will be assessed via online surveys or in-person at a university research laboratory. Interventions will be provided at community physiotherapy practices in Brisbane, Gold Coast, Toowoomba and Mackay, Queensland, Australia. Intervention: Clinical-guideline-recommended supervised physiotherapy exercise sessions (10 sessions) integrated with six (once per week) SIT sessions. Control: Clinical-guideline-recommended supervised physiotherapy exercise sessions (10) only. Measurements: Primary (Neck Disability Index) and secondary (Acute Stress Disorder Scale; Post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; Pain Catastrophisingo Scale; Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire; Coping Strategies Questionnaire; Global impression of recovery; pain intensity; SF 36) outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after randomisation.

40|$|The Antarctic {{ozone hole}} {{develops}} {{each year and}} culminates by early spring (late September - early October). Antarctic ozone values have been monitored since 1979 using satellite observations from the TOMS instrument. The severity of the hole has been assessed from TOMS using the minimum total ozone value from the October monthly mean (depth of the hole) and by calculating the average area coverage during this September-October period. Ozone is mainly destroyed by halogen (chlorine and bromine) catalytic cycles, and these losses are modulated by temperature variations in the collar of the polar lower stratospheric vortex. In this talk, I will show the relationships of halogens and temperature to both the size and depth of the hole. Because atmospheric halogen levels are responding to international agreements that limit or phase out production, the amount of halogens in the stratosphere should decrease {{over the next few}} decades. Using projections of halogen levels combined with age-of-air estimates, we find that the ozone hole is recovering at an extremely slow rate and that large ozone holes will regularly recur over the next 2 decades. The ozone hole will begin to show first signs of recovery in about 2023, and the hole <b>will</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recover</b> to pre- 1980 levels in approximately 2070.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the effects of the}} subprime and credit crisis on the California housing market and the fall 2009 outlook for recovery. The article begins with a description of alternative measures for tracking home price changes and discusses how median price, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) index, and the Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller index differ as indicators. Statewide, the median price, dependent on the mix of sales, rose faster and then dropped more than the FHFA index, based on same-home sales with “conforming” loans. Trends among California’s regional markets also vary by index. The FHFA indices for San Francisco Bay Area west bay and east bay areas dropped significantly less than the Case-Shiller index for the combined area. Both FHFA indices among regions and price-per-square foot data within the San Francisco Bay Area show that lower priced markets, with high shares of subprime loans experienced higher foreclosure rates, as well as the most severe price drops early in the crisis. Higher priced markets have shown more vulnerability within the last year, as the impacts of recession are added to the softening caused by the subprime and credit crisis. Uncertainties in employment recovery, interest rates, and building activity make it difficult to predict how and when the market will recover. Present trends suggest that the California housing market may be stabilizing, but it is unlikely that prices <b>will</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recover</b> to the pre-crisis peak in the next five years...|$|R

40|$|With {{the global}} economy still in recession, two {{important}} questions arise for Asia: how soon will the recession end, and how vigorous will the region's recovery be? The {{purpose of this paper}} is to look at past recessions and recoveries in Asia in order to shed light on these issues. Several important stylized facts emerge from this study: (i) recessions accompanied by financial stress - notably, stress in domestic banking sectors - have been substantially longer and deeper than the norm, suggesting that the current recession could have been even costlier and more drawn out had Asia's banks not entered the downturn in such strong shape; (ii) recoveries in Asia have been weak because they were typically driven by a single engine: exports. In contrast, other emerging economies have tended to experience more vigorous recoveries because of a stronger contribution from domestic demand, notably investment; (iii) in Asia, deep recessions have resulted in substantial declines in potential output growth, meaning that their effects are not just cyclical but permanent. A clear lesson emerges from past experience: given the expected weak recovery in the eurozone and the United States, Asia should not count on exports to rebound strongly as it did in previous upturns. Rather, a fundamental rebalancing towards domestic demand is needed if Asia wants to preserve the high growth rates that have characterized its recent past. Finally, it remains to be seen whether potential output <b>will</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recover</b> from pre-crisis levels in the countries most affected by the crisis...|$|R

30|$|This article {{provides}} local {{evidence for a}} phenomenon that holds a warning for future, global discussions on the evaluation of loss and damage and the discourse on compensation that these entail (James et al. 2014; Burkett 2016). The people-centered approach that informed our results and conclusions paired qualitative research tools with in-depth quantitative survey data on livelihoods and landslide impacts. It contributes to the debates surrounding the evaluation of and the compensation for disaster losses by showing how loss and damage assessments relative to annual income tend to represent post-disaster needs more accurately than absolute loss and damage assessments. The results show that losses and damages incurred by poor households amounted to around USD 6000, which was 14 times those households’ median annual income. This gives us an idea about how hard {{it will be for}} them to recover, and, indeed, many expressed the fear that they <b>will</b> never <b>fully</b> <b>recover</b> to their predisaster level of livelihood security. Nonpoor households lost more in absolute terms (more than USD 10, 000), but much less in relative terms (three times their annual income). For this group, post-disaster recovery will also be a long process, but their prospects are clearly better.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} and forecasts the Seoul office market, {{which is going}} to face a big supply in the next few years. After reviewing several previous studies on the Dynamic model and the Seoul Office market, this thesis applies two structural econometric models to forecast trends of rent, vacancy, and new supply of office space of Seoul Office Market, {{which is going to}} face a big supply in the next a few years. The first model has rent and supply equations. The second model is a full model that consists of three simultaneous equations; rent, supply, and absorption equations Empirically, the simple model was tested against time-series data of the Seoul office market since 1975. Rent equation is explained by current office stock, current GDP and past rent and past GDP, both lagging one year. The supply equation explains new office supply by one year lagging completion, five and six years lagging rent and growth of GDP in two previous years. The second model is a full model that consists of three simultaneous equations: rent, supply, and absorption equations based on time-series data since 1991. In this model, rent is impacted by current vacancy rate, past rent and vacancy rate both lagging one year. The supply equation is explained by completion one year ago, five years lagging rent, and past vacancy rate lagging four years, and the absorption equation is expressed by GDP per employment, current GDP, one year ago rent, and occupied stocks. Using estimated models with exogenous supplies for the next six years, ten-year contingent forecasts are made based on three scenarios having different estimated GDP growths. The forecasts for both models demonstrate that untypical supply for next six years will impact office rent negatively in all of the scenarios. In short, the Seoul office market, strongly affected by big supply over demand until 2016, will tend to be become soft or tight during same period before supply goes down and rent reacts. Since late 2010 s, however, the market <b>will</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recover</b> from oversupply. by Kyungmin Kim. Thesis (S.

40|$|Pest species {{management}} is causing rapid and significant changes to burrow-nesting petrel populations on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. The Weka, Gallirallus australis, was eliminated by 1989 and the Feral Cat, Felis catus, eradicated in 2000. The most abundant burrownesting petrel species currently, White-headed Petrels, Pterodroma lessonii, Antarctic Prions, Pachyptila desolata, and Sooty Shearwaters, Puffinus griseus, {{have yet to}} increase in numbers, but are expected {{to do so in}} the absence of cats. This study found evidence that Grey Petrels, Procell aria cinerea, began breeding again on the island in 1999, after an absence of over 100 years. Blue Petrels, Halobaena caerulea, and Fairy Prions, Pachyptila turtur, were found to be re-colonising Macquarie Island from offshore stacks after a similar absence. South Georgian Diving-Petrels, Pelecanoides georgicus, were also possibly recolonising the island. Despite the presence of Black Rats, Rattus rattus, most of the bird species discussed are considered capable of population increase. If European Rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, are not eliminated or maintained in reduced numbers, some petrel populations <b>will</b> never <b>fully</b> <b>recover.</b> Climate change could have a negative impact on burrow-nesting petrels, and is likely to exacerbate the detrimental effects of the remaining pest species on vulnerable indigenous bird species, compounding the need for remedial action against rabbits in particular. Together with predictions that other petrel species will now return to breed, certain terrestrial bird species, alien to the region, may invade Macquarie Island as a consequence of the combination of pest eradication and changing climatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Malaria is {{a serious}} global health problem {{and in the absence}} of an {{effective}} vaccine, access to safe and effective treatment still remains the mainstay in the control of the disease. However, the efficacy of this control strategy is hampered by the emergence and spread of drug resistant malaria which may lead to excess of mortality. One of the greatest challenges for health authorities of malaria endemic countries is thus to decide on when and how antimalarial drug policy should be changed, so that most of the patients <b>will</b> <b>fully</b> <b>recover</b> from the disease and will be cleared from parasites. The current ‘gold standard’ for the assessment of antimalarial resistance is the estimation of in vivo drug efficacy, whereas in vitro drug sensitivity tests and the analysis of molecular resistance markers in the parasite serve as complementary tools. In the present study, we assessed the relevance of a new appraisal approach for malaria resistance: community-based cross-sectional surveys versus clinical malaria studies, and the usefulness of a new molecular technology for the identification of molecular markers in different parasite genes. The frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in given resistance marker genes, as well as genotype patterns were analyzed in clinical samples and their role in predicting in vivo treatment response was investigated. Furthermore, community drug resistance profiles were correlated with the incidence risk of clinical treatment failure in order to evaluate the relevance and usefulness of such a novel approach in the management of drug use. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), the 4 -aminoquinoline drugs amodiaquine (AQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have been first-line treatment against uncomplicated malaria until the late 1990 s. At the same time, resistance of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax to these drugs had reached unacceptably high levels and health authorities were prompted to revise antimalarial treatment policy in 1997. First efficacy trials with the combination of AQ or CQ plus SP conducted between 1998 and 1999 showed good efficacy against falciparum and vivax malaria and the PNG Department of Health chose these combination regimens to replace the monotherapy with AQ or CQ as the standard first-line treatment against uncomplicated malaria in 2000. The in vivo studies we conducted between 2003 and 2005 were the first ones to assess the therapeutic efficacy of the newly introduced combination regimen against P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria using the revised WHO standard protocol. In our studies conducted in three different areas over the period of three consecutive years, we observed PCR-corrected treatment failure rates up to 28...|$|R
