The main problems in <b>higher</b> <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> are inter symbol interference and inter channel interference. To mitigate these challenges, different equalization techniques are used. Among all multiplexing techniques Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is {{proved to be}} best for achieving <b>higher</b> <b>data</b> <b>rates.</b> This paper discusses different equalization techniques such as LS algorithm, MMSE algorithm by using OFDM for minimization of interference.
