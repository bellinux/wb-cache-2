On 25 July 1945, based on a recommendation from the local War Shipping Administration (WSA) official, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) authorized Commander Service Division (ComServDiv) 104 to accept the ship [...] "as is" [...] at Okinawa and place her in service for non-self propelled floating dry storage. ComServDiv 104 accepted her at Okinawa on 30 July and on 6 August the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) approved the name Inca and designator IX-229 for her. She was converted to a storage ship by USS Vestal (AR-4) and USS Zaniah (AG-70), and was in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, when typhoons struck on 16 September and 9 October 1945. During the September typhoon she {{was hit by a}} merchant ship and suffered topside damage that was considered repairable, and she continued to <b>issue</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> ships in the bay. During the October typhoon she broke adrift and was one of several ships that USS Nestor (ARB-6) reported nearly hit her as Nestor was inexorably being driven ashore. Inca went aground during the storm and remained aground afterward, but plans to survey her in late October were canceled and she appears to have remained in service as a storage ship into December.|$|E

Using a sample of French firms introduced on the stock exchange and belonging to SBF 250 index over a period from 1999 to 2005. We use in the paper a panel data. It provides the researcher a large number of data points, increasing the degrees of freedom and reducing the colinearity among explanatory variables, hence improving the efficiency of econometric estimates. Our result shows that the estimation of both empirical models explaining the shareholder value, we notice that the self-financing explains positively and significantly the shareholder value creation for both measure (EVA and MVA). The equity <b>issue</b> <b>supply’s</b> <b>to</b> explain negatively and significantly the shareholder value for both measure. The financial debt contributes to explain positively and significantly the EVA. But it’s negatively related to MVA. The impact of financial factors on shareholder value depends to measure taken and the financial structure added to the model. Several authors have investigated how shareholder value creation can be increased, Rappaport (1987) has defined the value drivers as financial factors. The relationship between capital structure and firm value has been the subject of considerable debate. Indeed, the Pecking Order Theory and the Static Trade-off Theory found contradictory predictions in term of the impact of the financial structure on the shareholder value creation...|$|R
