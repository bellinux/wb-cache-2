40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{obtained}} for the presence in vivo of alpha 2 D-globulin, a breakdown product of serum β 1 C-globulin, in patients with acute and persistent <b>hypocomplementemic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> The protein has been identified by immunoelectrophoretic analysis, and the amounts present have been determined by direct measurement of specific antigenic determinants present on alpha 2 D. β 1 A-Globulin, another breakdown product of β 1 C-globulin, may also be present in vivo in severely hypocomplementemic patients, but its levels are much {{lower than those of}} alpha 2 D-globulin...|$|E
40|$|In 1965, it was {{observed}} that patients with glomerulonephritis with persistently low serum concentrations of C 3 evolved to have similar glomerular morphologic characteristics, particularly recognizable in biopsy specimens stained by the Jones methenamine silver technique [1]. Subsequent observations have indicated that although long-standing hypocomplementemia is commonly observed and is unique in patients with these glomerular morphologic characteristics, reduced C 3 concentrations are not always present [2, 3] and the distinctive morphology is now the criterion for identification of the disease. Thus, the name first given, <b>hypocomplementemic</b> persistent (chronic) <b>glomerulonephritis</b> [1], is no longer appropriate and the descriptive terms membranoproliferative and mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis have subsequently been applied...|$|R
40|$|Nephritic factor (C 3 NeF) {{has been}} {{isolated}} from plasma {{of patients with}} <b>hypocomplementemic</b> chronic <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (HCG) by ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography. This material was further treated with solidified anti-Ig antiserum. The purified material failed to react with antiserum to human IgG, IgG 3, Fab, Fc, and kappa and lambda chains, but retained full C 3 NeF activity. The nonidentity of C 3 NeF with IgG was further demonstrated by Ouchterlony analysis using anti-IgG and anti-C 3 NeF. Isolated C 3 NeF {{was found to be}} a protein with a sedimentation coefficient of 7 S and a mol wt of 150, 000 daltons, which on microzone electrophoresis and gel electrophoresis at pH 8. 6 behaved as a γ-globulin. C 3 NeF is not a C 1 q precipitin and does not activate the classical complement pathway. Unlike cobra venom factor, it failed to enter into a complex with C 3 proactivator (C 3 PA) when incubated with normal human serum (NHS) and then subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The action of isolated C 3 NeF on C 3 requires C 3 PA, C 3 PA convertase (C 3 PAse), and properdin (P). Similarly, C 3 PA conversion by C 3 NeF requires P, C 3 PAse, and C 3. Total hemolytic activity was lost by incubation of 64 µg of C 3 NeF/ 1 ml NHS at 37 °C for 30 min. Both C 3 a and C 5 a anaphylatoxin could be generated by C 3 NeF in serum previously depleted of anaphylatoxin inactivator. Anti-C 3 NeF was found to detect an antigen in all NHS tested. Treatment of NHS with solidified anti-C 3 NeF caused impairment of the alternate complement pathway. It failed to sustain lysis of glutathione-treated human erythrocytes initiated by inulin. It is conceivable that the normal serum constituent which is removed by anti-C 3 NeF constitutes the inactive precursor of C 3 NeF, and a heretofore unrecognized component of the alternate pathway...|$|R
