5|$|Barnard's <b>Inn,</b> {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's <b>Inn</b> after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an <b>Inn</b> of Chancery. A large <b>Inn,</b> Barnard's had 112 students a year {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's <b>Inn,</b> who traditionally sent a Reader to the <b>Inn</b> every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The <b>Inn</b> was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E

5|$|Central to Gray's was {{the system}} shared across the Inns of Court of {{progress}} towards {{a call to}} the Bar, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A student would first study at either Oxford or Cambridge University, or at one of the Inns of Chancery, which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and be admitted to one of the Inns of Court after graduation. If he studied at one of the Inns of Chancery he would do so for one year before seeking admission to the <b>Inn</b> of Court to which his <b>Inn</b> of Chancery was tied—in the case of Gray's <b>Inn,</b> the attached Inns of Chancery were Staple <b>Inn</b> and Barnard's <b>Inn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many noted barristers, {{judges and}} {{politicians}} {{were members of}} the <b>Inn</b> during this period, including Gilbert Gerard, Master of the Rolls, Edmund Pelham, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and Francis Bacon, who served as Treasurer for eight years, supervising significant changes to the facilities of the <b>Inn</b> and the first proper construction of the gardens and walks for which the <b>Inn</b> is noted.|$|E
5|$|Serjeant's <b>Inn</b> was an <b>Inn</b> of Court {{restricted}} to Serjeants-at-Law. It operated from three locations, one in Holborn, known as Scroope's <b>Inn,</b> which was abandoned by 1498 {{for the one}} in Fleet Street, which was pulled down during the 18th century, and one on Chancery Lane, pulled down in 1877. The <b>Inn</b> was a voluntary association, and although most Serjeants joined upon being appointed they were not required to. There were rarely more than 40 Serjeants, even including members of the judiciary, and the Inns were noticeably smaller than the Inns of Court. Unlike the Inns of Court, Serjeant's <b>Inn</b> was a private establishment similar to a gentlemen's club.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Inn</b> {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's <b>Inn</b> the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's <b>Inn,</b> Clement's <b>Inn</b> and New <b>Inn.</b> In Gray's <b>Inn</b> the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's <b>Inn</b> is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the <b>Inn</b> as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortunes}} of Gray's <b>Inn</b> continued to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the <b>Inn</b> a year.

5|$|The name of {{the road}} matches its winding route, but {{actually}} derives from the emblem of the Snake <b>Inn,</b> {{one of the few}} buildings on the high stretch of road.
