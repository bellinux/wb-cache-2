50|$|Despite the {{terminology}} used {{which makes it}} appear as though a shareholder's limited liability emanates from the view that a corporation is a separate legal entity, {{the reality is that}} the <b>entity</b> <b>status</b> of corporations has almost nothing to do with shareholder limited liability. For example, English law conferred <b>entity</b> <b>status</b> on corporations long before shareholders were afforded limited liability. Similarly, the Revised Uniform Partnership Act confers <b>entity</b> <b>status</b> on partnerships, but also provides that partners are individually liable for all partnership obligations. Therefore, this shareholder limited liability emanates mainly from statute.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} prosodic correlates of the givenness of discourse entities in German radio news speech. The material {{comes from the}} Stuttgart Radio News Corpus. Both GToBI intonation labels and a Fujisaki-style parametrization of the intonation contour were examined. We find strong word-class specific accentuation defaults; the influence of <b>entity</b> <b>status</b> is rather small and varies with word class. However, there are strong influences of newness on phrasing. The results of autosegmental and superpositional approaches complement each other nicely. 1 INTRODUCTION In this study, we examine prosodic correlates of <b>entity</b> <b>status</b> in German radio news with respect to two intonation models, autosegmental [...] metrical and superpositional.

40|$|AbstractDefining, {{implementing}} {{and monitoring}} investment strategies are sensitive coordinates for solid corporate governance within <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> and may significantly influence the investors’ perception regarding the financial performances. We based our {{research on the}} assumption that efficient investment strategies has major impact upon the net asset value (NAV) reported by Financial Investment Companies, and implicitly upon the stock price. The paper is focused on identifying a certain pattern in the portfolio structures of these entities and measuring some possible correlations with the market performance. For the purpose of this paper, we examine the trading discount or premium determined as price to net asset value per unit (NAVU) ratio in order to measure investors’ perception regarding the asset management performance, defined as market performance. Nevertheless, we consider that our research find its utility also for financial audit missions conducted for <b>investment</b> <b>entities,</b> whenever significant misstatement risk is assessed as part of planning the missions. Therefore, we consider that our correlation testing may be efficiently used as analytical procedures when gathering sufficient knowledge about the entities and the asset management industry...|$|R

40|$|On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (The Act), which was {{developed}} by Congress {{in response to the}} financial crisis of 2008. In this paper we briefly discuss the history of U. S. financial regulation, the events leading up to the Dodd-Frank Act, and the intent of the new regulation. We note key events and industry types that contributed to the financial collapse of 2008. We also identify the provisions within the Act that will impact private and publically traded real estate <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> and analyze the extent of any such impact. The hypothesis of this paper is that certain real estate <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> are not systemic to the U. S. financial system and if new regulation designed to reform Wall Street and protect consumers is placing a significant burden on these firms without accomplishing the goals of the Act, then real estate <b>investment</b> <b>entities</b> should not be subject to such regulation. The analytic approach of this paper is to: 1) identify the provisions within the Act that will impact real estate equity entities (i. e., private real estate private funds and REITs), 2) conduct industry interviews to identify the likely short-term magnitude of the impacts due to new regulation and, 3) offer a conclusion as to whether the Act will have a substantial negative effect on the industry. In conclusion, with respect to these <b>investment</b> <b>entities,</b> we found that the Dodd-Frank Act has improved transparency to investors through increased disclosures. However, the allencompassing nature of the Act has forced fund managers who were previously exempt from SEC registration to comply with securities regulations regardless of the systemic nature, or lack thereof, of their business practices. While such compliance will not have a substantial negative effect on the industry, we find that the regulation of private real estate funds does not help further the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act. by Michael DiMinico and John Edward Lubitz.
