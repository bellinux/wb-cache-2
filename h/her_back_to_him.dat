500|$|Director Ardolino {{encouraged}} the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went [...] "off script". One {{example of this}} was the scene where Grey was {{to stand in front}} of Swayze with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, [...] "as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Arts of War {{consists}} of two statue groups, Valor and Sacrifice. Both are in a style of Art Deco known as [...] "Delayed Deco". Facing Arlington Memorial Bridge from the District of Columbia, Valor {{is on the left}} and Sacrifice is on the right. Valor {{consists of}} a bearded, muscular male nude symbolic of Mars, the ancient Roman god of war. To his left is a semi-nude female striding forward, a shield attached to her left, trailing forearm. Sacrifice shows the same figures, but in different poses. The nude male now holds a small child in his arms, his head bowed. The semi-nude female is to his right, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and the horse. But her head is turned backward to look at the rider, her right arm reaching up to touch his right elbow.|$|E
60|$|She turned <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{and stood}} looking at the fire again.|$|E
6000|$|The Princess, quite astonished, looked round, {{and saw a}} big pitcher full of milk, {{but before}} she could raise it to her lips the thought of how thirsty Fanfaronade must be, after eating at least fifteen pounds of honey, made <b>her</b> run <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and say: ...|$|R
6000|$|Nanda {{looked about}} {{her as if}} {{weighing}} many things; after which <b>her</b> eyes came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "Do you mind if I don't sit down?" ...|$|R
50|$|Some time later, the Girl is on {{the train}} and the door closes right before a man tries to board. She has <b>her</b> <b>back</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> so she doesn't realize it is Gyeon-woo, who realizes it is her and chases it down the {{platform}} to no avail. They fail to cross paths again.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{shut the}} door; but still Amelia stood with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> leaning upon the mantel-piece.|$|E
60|$|There was a short, uncomfortable silence. Lady Ruth rose to {{her feet}} and stood facing the {{fireplace}} with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Does {{this suit}} you, Mr. Bhaer?" [...] she asked, turning <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and feeling deeply {{grateful}} for the chance of hiding her face.|$|E
6000|$|And {{suddenly}} {{she felt his}} arms knotted behind <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> crushing <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She stilled a scream; then, very swiftly, took a resolve, and, rigid in his arms, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Still she was silent; after which, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and {{a little}} tremor in her voice while she drew forth {{successively}} her brother's studies, she made answer: [...] "For the sake of your company, Peter! Here it is, I think," [...] she added, moving a large canvas with some effort. [...] "No, no, I'll hold it for you. Is that the light?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{then told}} me how he had found her married again to Farmer Morton and implored <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She refused, and he, in a blind fury, rushed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> where he had left Marx.|$|R
60|$|Blenavon turned {{towards the}} woman as though for aid. But she stood with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> pale and with a thin scornful smile upon her lips.|$|E
60|$|PROSERPINE. (testily, {{crossing}} {{to the fire}} and standing at it with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him).</b> Oh, don't be frightened: it's not you. It's not any one particular person.|$|E
6000|$|... "Call!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Call on the devil." [...] The girl, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and {{folding the}} hussar's {{breeches}} on a chair, {{said with a}} vexed little laugh: ...|$|E
6000|$|She turned <b>her</b> eyes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and <b>her</b> {{face had}} a light. [...] "I don't {{want it to}} come by accident." [...] Then she added: [...] "If there's any good to be got from trying, from showing one's self, how can it come unless one hears the simple truth, the truth that turns one inside out? It's all for that--to know what one is, if one's a stick!" ...|$|R
60|$|Isobel never hesitated. I {{think that}} instinctively she {{accepted}} him without demur. <b>Her</b> eyes flashed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> all those nameless things which his own greeting had left unspoken. She took his hands, and looked him frankly in the face.|$|R
60|$|Margaret {{was at her}} window, {{looking for}} him, and he saw her though {{she did not see}} him. He was {{stepping}} {{into the middle of the}} road to wave his hand to her, when some sudden weakness made him look towards the fields instead. The Egyptian saw him and nodded thanks for his interest in her, but he scowled and pretended to be studying the sky. Next moment he saw <b>her</b> running <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't told me anything." [...] And {{she turned}} <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> looking {{away at the}} splendid view. [...] "I do love the scenery," [...] she added in a moment.|$|E
60|$|Then {{at the end}} of {{the five}} minutes he went {{straight}} to her room, entered, and locked the door behind him. She was lying in bed, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Maraton {{lifted her}} up. Her body was quivering. She lay, for a moment, passive in his arms. Then she sprang away. She stood with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{looking out of}} the window.|$|E
50|$|Laura's {{kind and}} patient husband, Fred (Cyril Raymond), {{suddenly}} shows {{not only that}} he has noticed her distance {{in the past few}} weeks but that he has perhaps even guessed the reason. He thanks <b>her</b> for coming <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She cries in his embrace.|$|R
50|$|<b>Back</b> in <b>her</b> country, Desi’s friend, Laura and {{her husband}} pick her {{up at the airport}} in Madrid and take her to a hotel, but she is adamant about the choices she has made and refuses further help from her friends. To try to see what it feels to be with another man, Desi has sex with Ivan, a man she has just met, but her failure to feel the same she feels with Yaman, makes <b>her</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in Turkey.|$|R
60|$|The densest {{blackness}} of the Placid Gulf seemed to fall upon his head. He could not see her now. She had vanished into a long, obscure abysmal silence, whence <b>her</b> voice came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> after a time with a faint glimmer, which was her face.|$|R
60|$|SHE. Oh, {{of course}} I'm afraid. So {{would you be}} {{if you had any}} common sense. [She goes to the hearth, turning <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and puts one tapping foot on the fender].|$|E
60|$|She seated {{herself with}} <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Dignity demanded reprisals, so he seated {{himself with his}} back to her; and the futile ocean raged towards them, and the wind grew chillier every minute.|$|E
6000|$|What was she to do? Drag {{the woman}} {{back to life}} against her will--lead <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> to be a chain about his feet until the end? Then leave him to fight the battle alone? ...|$|E
40|$|In the New England of Dickinson’s time, the Bible wasn’t just a lexicon of {{the shared}} words {{that makes a}} culture; {{it was also an}} {{anthology}} of genres. One of its genres in particular, the parable, exerted its influence on Dickinson’s friend J. G. Holland, and Dickinson merrily aped the parabolic style in <b>her</b> letters <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> But when Dickinson directed her attention elsewhere and styled herself “Your Gnome,” she slipped into quite a different genre. How, I wonder below, does she look in that...|$|R
60|$|Mildred had <b>her</b> <b>back</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She {{was sitting}} down, {{talking to the}} German whom Philip had seen there every day till a {{fortnight}} ago and since then had not seen at all. She was laughing at what he said. Philip thought she had a common laugh, and it made him shudder. He called her, but she took no notice; he called her again; then, growing angry, for he was impatient, he rapped the table loudly with his stick. She approached sulkily.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Jack and Carly {{secretly}} met in {{an abandoned}} boathouse where they fantasized about sailing away together and leaving all the drama behind. Jack and Carly finally gave into their passion and declared their love. Carly swore to divorce Brad {{so they could be}} free to be together, and Jack gave her a compass from the boathouse to remind her <b>to</b> find <b>her</b> way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> (This compass would become an important symbol of Jack and Carly's undeniable magnetic pull that brings them together time and again.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Curiosity boarded Lewisham {{and carried}} him after the briefest struggle. He looked round, and there she was, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{reaching}} after the spiky blossoming blackthorn that crested the opposite hedge. Remarkable accident! She had not seen him! ...|$|E
60|$|And he was baffled now. He {{was left}} to fasten up the bag, whilst she swiftly did up her hair for the night, {{and sat down to}} {{unfasten}} her shoes. She would not turn <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> any more.|$|E
60|$|But {{he saw her}} on the bed, lying {{very still}} and {{scarcely}} noticeable, with <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He went {{and put his hand}} on her shoulder, very gently, hesitating, in a great fear and self-offering. She did not move.|$|E
60|$|Four infants! {{how many}} hopes laid here! All the English-born {{children}} of the family had died in their cradles, and not only did compassion for the past affect Albinia, as {{she thought of her}} husband's world of hidden grief, but a shudder for the future came over her, as she remembered having read that such mortality is a test of the healthiness of a locality. What could she think of Willow Lawn? It was with a strong effort that she brought <b>her</b> attention <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Him</b> Who controlleth the sickness that destroyeth at noon-day.|$|R
60|$|While {{all this}} was happening, Prince Ratibor was hurrying away with his prize {{to a place of}} safety. With great pomp and triumph he {{restored}} the lovely princess to her father, and was then and there married to her, and took <b>her</b> <b>back</b> with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> his own castle.|$|R
60|$|Wolfenden {{had been}} shown, as he supposed, {{into an empty}} room by the servant of whom he had inquired for Mr. Sabin. But the door was {{scarcely}} closed before a familiar sound from a distant corner warned {{him that he was}} not alone. He stopped short and looked fixedly at the slight, feminine figure whose white fingers were flashing over the keyboard of a typewriter. There was something very familiar about the curve of her neck and the waving of her brown hair; <b>her</b> <b>back</b> was <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and she did not turn round.|$|R
