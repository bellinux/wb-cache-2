40|$|AbstractThe study aims {{to predict}} the {{physical}} properties of Egyptian crude oils using modified Soave–Redlich–Kowng equation of state.

Calculation sensitivity of the proposed MSRKE is determined by testing four oil samples collected from different locations in Egypt and comparing the measured PVT properties with those calculated from MSRKE.

30|$|The {{conventional}} PVT {{properties for}} the reservoir fluids black oil type are solution gas–oil ratio, Rs; oil formation <b>volume</b> <b>factor,</b> Bo; and <b>gas</b> formation <b>volume</b> <b>factor,</b> Bg. According to Fattah et al. (2009), {{the difference between}} the modified black oil (MBO) PVT properties and the conventional black oil PVT properties are in the handling of the liquid in the gas phase, the oil–gas ratio, Rv. The MBO approach supposes that the composition of stock tank liquid can exist in both of the liquid and gas phases at reservoir conditions. The liquid content of the gas phase was assumed to be defined as a function of pressure named vaporized oil–gas ratio, Rv. It is similar to the solution gas–oil ratio, Rs, which is used to describe how much gas is dissolved in the liquid phase. The MBO properties or extended black oil was introduced for the first time by Spivak and Dixon (1973).|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of gas compressibility factor {{is important in}} engineering applications such as gas metering, pipeline design, reserves estimation, gas flow rate, and material balance calculations. This factor also is important in calculating gas properties such as <b>gas</b> formation <b>volume</b> <b>factor,</b> <b>gas</b> isothermal compressibility, viscosity and density. Compressibility factor value shows how much the real gas deviates from the ideal gas at a given pressure and temperature. Most often, compressibility factor values can be determined experimentally from collected laboratory samples but frequently this measurement is not always available. In such cases, the natural gas property can be determined using empirical correlations or iteratively using equation of state (EOS). Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work is to develop ANN model to accurately predict the gas compressibility factor; as well to compare its performance with existing empirical gas compressibility factor correlations. The new model was developed using 513 PVT data points obtained from Niger-Delta region of Nigeria. The data used wasrandomly divided into three parts, of which 60 % was used for training, 20 % for validation, and 20 % for testing. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the new model to the existing empirical correlations. The ANN model performed better than the existing empirical correlations by the statistical parameters used having the lowest rank of 1. 37 and better performance plot...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} that maintaining adequate air/gas injection rate is vitally important to achieving hole cleaning both against drilling cutting and liquid accumulations. It is highly imperative to accurately predict the annulus pressure drop for determining the critical air/gas injection rate required for cleaning formation both cutting and liquid influx during underbalanced drilling. A new numerical model for determining annulus pressure drop model has been developed that is required for accurately predicting minimum air/gas injection rate for simultaneous removal of both cutting and liquid during underbalanced drilling. The new model has incorporated the influence of cutting volume which has been overlooked by most researchers. Since the required minimum flow rate needs to be determined at the surface condition, temperature and pressure dependent variables such as <b>gas</b> formation <b>volume</b> <b>factor,</b> (Bg), Oil formation factor, (Bo), and water formation factor, Bw has been considered in the model. The results generated show that the existing models have underestimated the required minimum air/gas flow rate for continuous lifting of both cutting and liquid during underbalanced drilling. Engineering charts have also been generated for predicting cutting and liquid-carrying capacity of air/gas that is injected into the borehole at various rates.

In all zero-dimensional MBEs, such as the GMBE presented in Eq.  1, reservoir fluids are characterized using black-oil fluid formulations. In these formulations, only two pseudo-components are ‘allowed’ {{to be present in}} the reservoir phases—i.e., surface gas and surface oil.

Walsh et al. (1994 a) showed that the GMBE in Eq.  1 may be collapsed to the well-known p/Z vs. cumulative gas production (G [...] p [...]) relationship applicable to volumetric dry-gas reservoirs. For gas-condensate reservoir analysis, however, Eq.  1 may not be presented in terms of p/Z vs. G [...] p [...] straight line plots because it is not pressure or p/Z explicit (Walsh et al. 1994 a). Therefore, a single-variable Newton–Raphson procedure would need to be employed to iteratively calculate average pressure for a given resource (G [...] i [...]).|$|R

40|$|This study {{basically}} {{focuses on}} numerical simulation of shale gas flow. To {{be able to}} capture the complex nature of shale gas reservoirs, different storage and flow mechanisms {{must be taken into}} consideration. Shale reservoir medium consists of organic matter (kerogen), inorganic matter, natural fractures, and hydraulic fractures. In this medium, Darcy flow is not fully capable of modeling shale gas flow since there is different flow mechanisms due to complex porosity system. In addition, Fickian diffusion and flow from matrix to fractures must be considered. For this purpose, the multiple porosity model is used. To be able to keep the resolution of the micromodel on the reservoir scale simulation, the idea of dynamic apparent permeability is followed. Storage mechanisms of shale gas is also as complex as flow mechanisms. Gas is not only stored as free fluid in pores and fractures, but also as adsorbed phase at the surface of organic matter. However, fluid properties of free gas in nano-scale pores are different than their original values. Also adsorbed phase occupies considerable amount of pore volume which causes reduction in free <b>gas</b> <b>volume.</b> As pore pressure decreases throughout the reservoir life, desorbed gas will be produced with free gas. Thus better understanding of this adsorbed gas behavior within organic matter is the key for accurate modeling of desorption and total gas production. The proposed workflow is first integrating desorption to the reservoir model by commercial simulator feature. Second, integrating diffusion using the multiple porosity model and application of dynamic apparent permeability to upscale the model. Third, different fluid properties are introduced to simulator by defining another PVT region. Finally, occupied pore space by adsorbed phase is introduced by modifying Langmuir parameters. Results are discussed by comparing different cases with cumulative gas production and average reservoir pressure. Significant difference of the models with and without integrating relevant model and properties shows the importance of the nanoscale considerations and their effect on ultimate recovery calculations. Decreasing pore size has a strong effect on <b>gas</b> formation <b>volume</b> <b>factor</b> and viscosity. It causes a decrease on cumulative gas production and average reservoir pressure. Nano-scale effects have a huge impact on both cumulative gas production and reservoir pressure. As a result, accurate modeling and reducing uncertainity require special attention on desorption, diffusion, pore size effect, and pore volume correction...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} two approaches to in vitro analysis of gas production data, being a three phase model with long ([greater-than-or-equal] 72 h) incubation times, to obtain kinetics and asymptotic values of gas production, and combination of <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> measurements with residue determinations after {{a relatively short}} incubation of 24 h. Dry matter intake (DMI) of 24 Ethiopian forages were predicted by these approaches. Combined <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> and true degradability measurements in vitro were used to calculate a partitioning factor (PF), being the ratio of mg substrate degraded to ml of gas produced. In the automated test, kinetics of gas production were described by a three phase model: y=a 1 /(1 +(b 1 /t) c 1) +[cdots, three dots, centered]+a 3 /(1 +(b 3 /t) c 3), where y is the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> at time t and a 1 -a 3 are the <b>volumes</b> of <b>gas</b> in the pools, b 1 -b 3, the time when half of the <b>gas</b> <b>volume</b> of a given pool is produced and c 1 -c 3 describe the switching characteristics of the curves by pool.

40|$|Evaluation of the {{variability}} of theoretical and effective CO 2 storage capacity estimation within depleted gas reservoirs {{is dependent on the}} integrated analysis of reservoir structure, aquifer performance and thermodynamic behaviour. Four published theoretical CO 2 storage capacity methods and one effective method have been used to estimate the capacity and variability of two Triassic depletion drive reservoirs and two Triassic water drive reservoirs located within the UK Southern North Sea and East Irish Sea Basin. Input parameters to the storage capacity equations have shown a degree of natural variability whereas others are more accurately constrained. As such, {{attempts have been made to}} more accurately constrain the most variable input parameters. The geometric, petrophysical and production characteristics of the reservoirs are analysed. Material balance methods are used to assess the reservoir drive mechanism of the reservoirs. If reservoirs are found to experience a water drive, the aquifer strength is estimated. The gas compressibility <b>factor,</b> <b>gas</b> formation <b>volume</b> <b>factor</b> and CO 2 density is estimated under initial reservoir temperature conditions using six equations of state for comparison of results. These results are then input to storage capacity equations producing a range of estimates. The most susceptible parameter to variability was the cumulative volume of water influx to a reservoir, We. Variability was also found to be the result of error in estimation of the original gas in place. As such, the water drive reservoirs made further use of aquifer modelling to achieve more precise estimates of OGIP and We. The effective capacity coefficients for the various reservoirs have been estimated to assess the proportion of pore space available for CO 2 storage. The effective CO 2 storage capacity constitutes a fraction of the theoretical CO 2 storage capacity which ranges between 0 (no storage possible) and 1 (all theoretically accessible pore volume is occupied by CO 2). Overall, it was found that depletion drive reservoirs have the potential to store greater volumes of CO 2 than water drive reservoirs whose aquifer waters occupy the newly liberated pore space. ...|$|R
