2500|$|... 30 June 1962: A Douglas DC-4 (registration ZS-BMH) was {{involved}} in a mid-air collision with a military Harvard training aircraft near Durban airport. The military aircraft crashed but the crew managed to land the airliner without <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> or crew despite losing {{a large part of the}} vertical stabiliser. The aircraft is the last DC-4 manufactured and was repaired and returned to service. It is currently owned by the South African Airways Museum Society and still flies.|$|E
50|$|Multiple-vehicle {{collisions}} {{are particularly}} deadly as {{the mass of}} crumpled vehicles makes escape for survivors difficult. Even if survivors are able to exit their vehicles, other cars may strike them. Individual vehicles in a multiple-vehicle collision are often hit multiple times at high speed, increasing the risk of <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> who may have survived the first impact {{with the benefit of}} now-discharged protective airbags. Collisions after the initial collision may occur {{from the side of the}} vehicle, where the passenger compartment is more vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|The P&I ("Protection and Indemnity") {{insurance}} {{provided by}} Skuld to its members is primarily {{to cover the}} liabilities which they incur to third parties arising out of the operation of their ships. The common types of claim which are covered are for death or <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> and crew, oil pollution, cargo loss or damage, collision, wreck removal and stowaways. Shipowners' exposure to these claims has grown in line with increasing regulation of the shipping industry through International Conventions adopted by the International Maritime Organisation {{as well as by}} domestic or regional legislation.|$|E

5000|$|Beltbags: The beltbag is an {{inflatable}} seat-belt strap that {{is able to}} reduce the risk of <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> in the rear in a head-on collision by lessening the strain placed on the ribcage. Should the crash sensors detect a severe frontal impact, the airbag control unit will trigger deployment and inflation of the beltbag. A gas generator then inflates the multi-layered belt strap with Velcro seams to nearly three times its normal width. The resulting larger surface area is able to better distribute the force acting on the seat occupant, thereby reducing the risk of injury.|$|E
5000|$|The Airline was insured by Aviation Insurance Co., a {{representative}} of Lloyd's of London. Coverage included aircraft liability, property damage, bodily <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers,</b> and damage to passenger's property. Several of the passenger's families sued the airline, but later reluctantly settled for $35,000 per passenger. The mother of Mary McNamara later stated that [...] "I feel badly about it, but we couldn't go through any more. Answering all those questions... They (attorneys for the insurance company) made us feel like she was someone who rented a room from us. I cannot tell you what she meant to me. A beautiful young girl {{walked out the door}} and was brutally murdered." ...|$|E
50|$|The popular resort’s {{register}} showed {{guests from}} {{every state in}} the union and from several foreign countries. Visitors included philanthropist William H. Vanderbilt, Viscount William Waldorf Astor, composer Walter Damrosch, and railroad financier Jay Gould.To better serve guests, the eight-mile Monte Sano Railway was created between May and August 1888. The 25 cent train ride took 20 minutes and made three trips per day. However, shortly after completion, the train’s brake sand pipes choked, the wheels jumped the rails, and the train came to a quick stop. There was no <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> or damage to the train, but the incident frightened potential riders. Thereafter, the railway was primarily used for hauling supplies until it went into bankruptcy in 1896.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 July there was a serious {{dislocation}} of train traffic caused by the overhead power wiring fouling the down and up lines at Auburn, resulting in a complete recast of the affected electric services. To provide a reasonable service on the North Shore line, trains were transposed at Central, resulting in delays to trains and causing trains {{to catch up to}} those in front.A down electric commuter train [...] "tripped" [...] past a signal showing stop at the down end of Roseville platform into the section occupied by the preceding train. After recharging the brake air supply, the driver proceeded at above a cautious speed (40mph rather than 15mph) and came into violent collision with the train ahead. At the same time an up train was passing and hit the emergency brakes but came into contact with the telescoped cars of the initial collision, tearing the sides of that train away. There were no cases of serious <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> on the three trains.The collision resulted in 3 carriages telescoping into the length of 1 carriage and remarkably only 10 passengers were taken to hospital.|$|E
50|$|For {{extraordinary}} achievement while piloting {{air mail}} plane No. 408H on April 21, 1933, during a night flight from Washington, D.C. to Detroit, Mich. At {{an altitude of}} 3200 feet and about half way to Pittsburgh, PA., with no warning whatsoever the left outboard engine of the tri-motored plane crashed from the ship. Pilot Carmichael adjusted the controls to return the plane to a level position {{and turned back to}} Washington. In breaking from the ship the left engine had pulled the outboard heater control open and effected the center engine altitude adjustment. The center engine cut out until the altitude control was discovered and readjusted. Realizing that he had about 100 miles to fly in returning to Washington, the pilot climbed to an altitude of 4500 feet in order not to overheat the remaining two engines on the plane. A survey of the damage was made from the cockpit window {{with the aid of a}} flashlight, from which it was determined that the landing gear had been damaged. The pilot, therefore, decided that a landing should be made at Bolling Field, which is larger than the Washington Airport, and would be more advantageous for the one-wheel type of landing which would have to be made with damaged landing gear. He also desired to avail himself of the trained Army personnel and their emergency equipment, including ambulances and fire trucks. The pilot made all arrangements for landing by radio communication and received the fullest cooperation from the Bolling Field authorities. A one-wheel landing was made with little additional damage to the ship and no <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> and mail.|$|E

30|$|Procedure {{dictates}} that I increase {{the speed of}} the train so that we reach the next station quickly where the suspicious item can be removed from the train. But in reality increasing {{the speed of the}} train changes all the calculations for braking, and there is a risk that the train may not come to a halt at the right spot, stop with a big jerk, and in extreme cases even get derailed. All this poses a real risk of <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|E
30|$|Large crowds on {{the network}} create more chances of <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> on the train, waiting at platforms, and while {{boarding}} or leaving the train. “During peak hours there are more passengers both on the train, and at the stations. Passengers can get injured on the train if we brake suddenly.

3000|$|All {{the train}} drivers {{in the focus}} groups were {{unanimous}} in their belief that safety of passengers using the MRS was a primary goal of the organisation. Even minor injuries to passengers due to falls from sudden braking or jerky driving were considered unacceptable from an organisational point of view. The drivers’ emphasis on absolutely safe transit of passengers could be understood as an organisational core task (OCT), as discussed by Reiman and Oedewald [29]. The drivers admitted that any <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> during operations was considered a serious mishap by the managers, and invited personal penalty and disciplinary action in the short term, and negative consequences for drivers’ career progression in the longer term.|$|E
30|$|The {{train drivers}} {{recognised}} that like safety, secure transit of passengers {{was a key}} organisational goal. “The security procedure is performed because {{the consequences of a}} bomb explosion on a train will be catastrophic. It will cause death and <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers,</b> and the result will be very similar to a major incident like a train derailment”. The focus groups emphasised that they understood the serious nature of meeting security goals because the MRS operated in an environment where there was a credible terrorist threat based on past attacks on other rail networks in the city. “The presence of guards at the stations is a constant reminder that security of passengers is of constant concern to everyone in the system”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As the {{penetration}} of software into safety-critical systems progresses, {{accidents and incidents}} involving software in such systems will inevitably become more frequent. Identifying lessons from these occurrences and applying them to existing and future systems is essential if these incidents are to be prevented in the future.

In the aviation community, most investigative agencies prioritize undesired events based on the severity of their associated losses, allocating more resources to those involving extensive aircraft damage or <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers.</b> We argue that this scheme is inappropriate because it undervalues incidents whose recurrence could have a high potential for loss while overvaluing fairly straightforward accidents involving accepted risks. We then suggest a new strategy for prioritizing incidents based on the risk arising from incident recurrence. ...|$|E
40|$|Railway track {{are used}} as way for {{carrying}} cargo or passengers {{from one place to}} another place. Nowadays, Malaysia still using the old railway line and accidents can happen at any time due to several factors, namely high density load of railroad rails, cracks due to vibration and friction wheel. Therefore, in this project the analysis is to prevent and predict the occurrence of harm or <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers,</b> and goods. The objective of this project is to determine the value of fracture toughness of railway track material using analytical solution. Finite element analysis is used to find the value of stress that has been used in analytical equation. The design of the model specimen drawn by Solidworks software and then imported into the Patran software to key in data such as load, material, element, and properties. Then, Nastran software is used as a solver and decision analysis model will be produced when the specimen is successful simulated. Comparisons are made between the simulation using finite element analysis and previous research. The result shows that the fracture toughness decreasing when the thickness is increasing.

40|$|On 31 November 2003 the 1999 Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air {{entered into}} force. Its {{purpose was to}} {{consolidate}} and modernize the Warsaw system and to reunify the provisions of several international instruments of private international air law under one legal instrument. The Montreal Convention consolidates the positive elements of the Warsaw Convention, the Hague Protocol, the Guadalajara Convention, the Guatemala City Protocol and Additional Protocol Numbers 3 and 4. It also simplifies and modernizes the requirements of documentation relating to the carriage by air of passengers, baggage and cargo. Most importantly, the Montreal Convention modernizes of the liability regime for death and <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> by adopting the passenger liability regime in the IATA Inter-carrier Agreement. It also modernizes the liability regime for damage to baggage and cargo and the delay. In spite of the foregoing, the Montreal Convention fails to advance the unification of private international air law any further than the Warsaw Convention. This thesis analyzes the provisions of liability regimes under the Warsaw System and the 1999 Montreal Convention. Chapter one studies the liability regime established under the original Warsaw Convention and the subsequent attempts by states, air carriers and other interested entities to update it. Chapter two analyzes the new regime of unlimited liability established by the 1999 Montreal Convention. Chapter three examines the liability of the air carrier for damage caused by terrorist activities. In an effort to demonstrate the innovative elements of the new Convention and to encourage states to ratify it, chapter four surveys the main benefits that have accrued to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its national air carrier upon ratification of the 1999 Montreal Convention...|$|E
