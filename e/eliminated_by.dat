5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be <b>eliminated</b> <b>by</b> choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{elimination}} is iterative. One {{looks at the}} answers, determines that several answers are unfit, eliminates these, and repeats, until one cannot eliminate any more. This iteration is most effectively applied when there is logical structure between the answers - that is to say, when <b>by</b> <b>eliminating</b> an answer one can eliminate several others. In this case one can find the answers which one cannot <b>eliminate</b> <b>by</b> <b>eliminating</b> any other answers and test them alone - the others are eliminated as a logical consequence. (This is the idea behind optimizations for computerized searches when the input is sorted - as, for instance, in binary search).|$|R
