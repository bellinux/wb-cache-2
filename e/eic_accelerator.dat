40|$|The Yale ’ 2000 Workshop {{detector}} {{model is}} presented. A short {{summary of the}} Interaction Region Group of the <b>EIC</b> <b>Accelerator</b> Workshop is given. The Yale ’ 2000 and present workshops extensively reviewed the physics programme for the Electron – Ion Collider (EIC). Also at Yale and during the <b>EIC</b> <b>Accelerator</b> Workshop (EICAW) possible options for the machine and the Interaction Region (IR) were discussed. At Yale {{a model of a}} generic detector and the IR layout were proposed and discussed [1, 2]. The design criteria were: • common detector for ep, eA, pp and pA collisions, • reconstruction of “whole ” ep and eA event, • precise luminosity monitoring and control of radiative corrections, • good detector quality in the fragmentation regions, • minimal interference with the existing IR optics, • use of the existing RHIC lattice in the spectrometer design, • possibility of a polarized electron beam...|$|E
