25|$|Sa Pa is a {{frontier}} township and capital of Sa Pa District in Lào Cai Province in north-west Vietnam. It was first inhabited by people {{we know nothing}} about. They left in the entire valley hundreds of petroglyphs, mostly composed of lines, which <b>experts</b> <b>think</b> date from the 15th century and represent local cadastres. Then came the highland minorities of the Hmong and Yao. The township {{is one of the}} main market ones in the area, where several ethnic minority groups such as Hmong, Dao (Yao), Giáy, Pho Lu, and Tày live. These are the four main minority groups still present in Sa Pa district today. The Kinh (lowland Vietnamese) never originally colonised this highest of Việt Nam’s valleys, which lies in the shadow of Phan-Xi-Pǎng (Fansipan, 3143m), the highest peak in the country.|$|E
25|$|By {{the eve of}} the Invasion of Kuwait {{which led}} to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the army was {{estimated}} to number 1,000,000 men. Just before the Persian Gulf War began, the force comprised 47 infantry divisions plus 9 armoured and mechanised divisions, grouped in 7 corps. This gave a total of about 56 army divisions, and total land force divisions reached 68 when the 12 Iraqi Republican Guard divisions were included. Although it was said at the time in Western media that Iraqi troops numbered approximately 545,000 (even 600,000) today most <b>experts</b> <b>think</b> that both the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the Iraqi army at the time were exaggerated, as they included both temporary and auxiliary support elements. Many of the Iraqi troops were also young, under-resourced and poorly trained conscripts. Saddam did not trust the army; among counterbalancing security forces was the Iraqi Popular Army.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2008, the {{prosecutor}} of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Luis Moreno Ocampo, accused al-Bashir of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Darfur. The court issued {{an arrest warrant}} for al-Bashir on [...] 2009 on counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him for genocide. However, on 12 July 2010, the Court issued a second warrant containing three separate counts. The new warrant, as with the first, were delivered to the Sudanese government, which did not recognize it nor the ICC. [...] The indictments do not allege that Bashir personally took part in such activities. Instead, they say, he is [...] "suspected of being criminally responsible, as an indirect co-perpetrator". Some international <b>experts</b> <b>think</b> {{it is unlikely that}} Ocampo has enough evidence. The court's decision is opposed by the African Union, League of Arab States, Non-Aligned Movement, and the governments of Russia and China.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey Anthony for defamation. During the investigation, Anthony told {{investigators}} that she left 2½-year-old Caylee with a babysitter named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez—also known as [...] "Zanny"—on June 16 at the stairs of a specific apartment in the Sawgrass apartment complex located in Orlando. Fernandez-Gonzalez, who was listed on apartment records as having visited apartments on that date, was questioned by police, but stated {{she did not know}} Casey or Caylee Anthony. Her defamation suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that Casey willfully damaged her reputation. Fernandez-Gonzalez has told reporters that she lost her job, was evicted from her house, and received death threats against herself and her children as a result of Anthony's lies. Fernandez-Gonzalez' lawyer, John Morgan, said he wants to interrogate Anthony about Caylee's death because it is [...] "the essence" [...] of the defamation suit. On October 8, 2011, Morgan deposed Anthony via a video conference. As expected, Anthony exercised her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and answered only a couple of factual questions. Morgan felt that was improper, but legal <b>experts</b> <b>think</b> that Anthony is well within her rights to plead the Fifth until her appeals of the convictions for lying to officers are exhausted. Fernandez-Gonzalez' attorneys sought and received permission to obtain Anthony's address (though it was kept sealed from the public) so they could subpoena her to testify, even if she only took the stand long enough to plead the Fifth. However, Fernandez-Gonzalez is willing to drop the suit if Anthony apologizes to her and compensates her for pain and suffering. In September 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Anthony, stating: [...] "There is nothing in the statement…to support (Fernandez-Gonzalez's) allegations that (Anthony) intended to portray (the nanny) as a child kidnapper and potentially a child killer." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a conceptual framework}} {{for the development of}} Knowledge Management (KM) systems to support experts in complex design activities. Designing a complex object is not a simple task, since it is concerned not only with problem solving issues, but also with the growing needs for capturing and managing the core knowledge involved in it. A complex object is typically made of a huge number of parts that are put together according to a first set of constraints (i. e. the procedural knowledge), dependable on the functional properties it must satisfy, and a second set of rules, dependable on what the <b>expert</b> <b>thinks</b> abut the problem and how he/she would represent it (i. e. the declarative knowledge). The paper illustrates a way to unify both types of knowledge, exploiting the SA-Nets formalism to capture the procedural knowledge and a mereological approach to represent declarative knowledge. ...|$|R

40|$|Much {{attention}} in knowledge acquisition {{has been directed}} at the question "What is Knowledge?". In this paper, we discuss a related question, which we consider to be of equal importance, namely "What is Thinking?". We present a definition of thinking that {{emphasizes the importance of}} arriving at new arrangements of knowledge, and discuss how having knowledge about something can be used to avoid thinking. Given this view, it is clear that stimulating an <b>expert</b> to <b>think</b> about the domain can provide more detailed knowledge about both the domain and about the expert himself. We have taken one of De Bono's thinking tools, the PMI (plus - minus - interesting) and built a knowledge elicitation tool for use in a domain where the expert's responses are likely to be based on unquestioned judgements. The tool requires the <b>expert</b> to <b>think</b> about the domain in ways that he is perhaps not used to, and the information elicited from this exercise gives an insight into the judgement polici [...] ...|$|R

When an expert 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge has been represented using these formalisms, the generation of a production plan can be achieved by a sequence of abstraction, selection and refinement. This is demonstrated in the CAPP-system PIM, which is currently developed as a prototype. The close modelling of the knowledge of the concrete expert (or the accumulated know-how of a concrete factory) facilitate the development of planning systems which are especially tailored to the concrete manufacturing environment and optimally use the expert 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge and should also lead to improved acceptance of the system...|$|R

Achim Sibeth commented that the animal is the representation of the Naga Padoha, a primordial water serpent that rules the underworld. A Batak creation myth told that {{back in the days when}} there was only sea, the serpent stirred up sand from the ocean bed to create the first islands which create the islands of Indonesia. Other <b>expert</b> <b>thinks</b> that the figure represents the singa. The word singa, borrowed from Sanskrit singa meaning [...] "lion", dates back to contact with Hindu traders in the southern Batak area. In Batak culture however, the singa itself is a complicated mythical creature related to the female serpent. An example of the representation of a singa can be found in a wooden animal head that was collected by Tassilo Adam, a German planter who is also an enthusiast in Batak Toba culture.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} create a process plan from a {{workpiece}} description, a human <b>expert</b> <b>thinks</b> in a special terminology with respect to the given workpiece. The steps of human thinking during the generation process of a process plan are following the principles of heuristic classification: First using feature recognition an abstraction process isrealized yielding a high level (qualitative) description of the current workpiece in terms of features. To these features certain (more or less) abstract (partial) process plans [...] the so-called skeletal plans [...] are associated. In the refinement step these skeletal plans are merged together to one complete process plan. In this paper we present a set of domain-oriented higher level representation formalisms for features and skeletal plans suitable for the modeling of this approach. When an expert 2 ̆ 7 s (process planner 2 ̆ 7 s) knowledge has been represented using these formalisms, the generation of a process plan can be achieved by heuristic classification.

5000|$|The {{children}} grew {{up within}} the Cherokee culture and clan of their mother. As the Cherokee had a matrilineal system {{of property and}} hereditary leadership, the children traditionally gained their status in the tribe from their mother's people.

The Vann children were likely bilingual, learning some European-American culture from their father. Wah-li later married Clement Vann (possibly related to Joseph), who acted as a stepfather to the children. (Sources disagree about the identity of Vann's biological father: Gary E. Moulton of the University of Nebraska, suggests Clement Vann. William H. Vann, Jr. in his self-published genealogy book, Vann Generations with Cherokee Origins from John Joseph Vann & James Clement Vann I of NC, SC, TN, GA ca 1750-1989, identified Joseph Vann.

40|$|In {{their very}} {{comprehensive}} review on methods for assessment of occupational exposure in case-control studies Teschke et al. state that "among the exposure estimation methods in common use today, expert assessment {{is usually the}} best approach". They do so, {{despite the fact that}} it is well known that subjective assessments by experts is of a relative nature(1) and that in order to have a more quantitative assessment the experts have to be calibrated. (2, 3) The main reason for choosing experts can be traced back to the alternative methods of self-reported exposures and generic job exposure matrices (JEM) which as they claim suffer from severe limitations. Recently, the limitations and possibilities of exposure assessment on the basis of JEM were extensively discussed. (4) From a somewhat broader perspective, expert assessment and JEM are not as different as often is being suggested. A study in which an expert judges the job history of every case and control, is actually applying a very detailed (job) exposure matrix where the input axis is made up by exposure determinants which the <b>expert</b> <b>think</b> of as being important.
